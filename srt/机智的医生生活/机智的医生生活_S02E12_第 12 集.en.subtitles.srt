1
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,522
Okay. I'm just five minutes away.
I'll head straight to the OR.

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,568
Gosh, who's on duty today?

3
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,917
-What about galbi?
-Right.

4
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,711
-Level one.
-It needs the spicy sauce.

5
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,837
Right, half and half.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,882
-Start without it and add it later.
-It has to be moist.

7
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,551
-Yes, very moist.
-Totally.

8
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,845
Then we should also…

9
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,597
Professor!

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,974
-Get in.
-Hello.

11
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,774
Doors are closing.

12
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,701
-Are you there yet?
-Yes, I'm waiting out front.

13
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,641
-Did you stay up all night?
-Yes.

14
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,309
-Thanks.
-No problem.

15
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,651
"MINUET IN E MAJOR" BY BOCCHERINI

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,118
Hey, bear. I'm on my way to get a coffee.
Do you want iced Americano?

17
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,328
Yes, sure.

18
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,248
-You're early.
-Yes, I have surgery.

19
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,667
Hey! I totally know this song.

20
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,962
Do you want to bet?

21
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,840
-How much?
-Let's do 100,000 won.

22
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,885
If I know the song, you pay me.
And vice versa.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,596
Deal?

24
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,478
-I'll pass.
-Darn it.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,690
It looks like you know.

26
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,651
Yes! I've listened to it so many times
that I'm sick of it.

27
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,528
What's the title?

28
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,869
"Hello, this is the English
listening comprehension section

29
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,080
of the 2021
College Scholastic Ability Test.

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,165
Please…

31
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,671
Please relax and listen carefully.

32
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,131
We advise all exam supervisors

33
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,259
to check the speaker
to ensure optimal volume.

34

All…

35
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,640
All examinees must write their names

36
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,101
and examinee identification numbers
on the left side

Please double-check to make sure
all the information is correct."

39
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,657
That freak.

40
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,665
He's such a freak.

41
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,712
Jeong-won.

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,089
Ahn Jeong-won.

43
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,133
Yes.

44
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,595
Appointments start in ten minutes.

45
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,555
Right.

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:01,658
KIM JUN-WAN
AHN JEONG-WON

47
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,580
Song-hwa has emergency surgery this early?

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,834
Yes. She said it won't take long though.

49
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,296
Hold on.

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,466
I was going to do something.

51
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,803
What was it?

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,721
It was something urgent.

53
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,766
Go shave first.

54
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,936
Right.

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,605
I'LL BE OUT OF SURGERY IN THE EVENING!
SEE YOU LATER

56
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,661
Seung-chae is next, right?

57
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,579
Yes.

58
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,042
I hope she succeeds today.

59
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,921
You did it!

60
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,261
She practiced a lot at home.

61
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:47,388
She started practicing winking nonstop

62
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,140
a week before the appointment.

63
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,684
I should give you a prize.

64
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,269
What would be good?

65
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,230
Stickers. Here.

66
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,149
Thank you.

67
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,988
Compared to her blood work
from last month,

68
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,865
everything has gone up a little.

69
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,700
I think she can take less potassium.

70
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,078
Sure. What about sodium?

71
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,163
If that looks good too,

72
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,582
I think we can cut down on the supplement.

73
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,418
Sure. She's taking
vitamin D as well, right?

74
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,921
Yes. I give her four drops a day.

75
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,173
And I also give her probiotics once a day.

76
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,382
That's great.

77
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,928
Why don't we change her feeding tube
since you're already here?

78
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,138
I changed it a few days ago.

79
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,934
You're more of an expert than I am now.

80
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,690
Seung-chae is gaining weight optimally
at the moment,

81
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:43,277
and she looks energetic and healthy
every time I see her.

82
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,989
I know it can get complicated
with all the meds she has to take.

83
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,950
You're doing an amazing job.

84
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:55,414
For three years, she's had no infection
caused by the central venous catheter,

85
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,999
all thanks to you.

86
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,337
And kids at Seung-chae's age
usually have a big increase in appetite,

87
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,297
but you've been keeping it under control.

88
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,301
Professor Ahn.

89
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:12,765
I actually wanted
to talk to you about that today.

90
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,393
Okay.

91
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,439
Recently, I told her not to drink water.

92
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,067
Then I caught her drinking tap water
while washing her face.

93
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,447
Also, she asks for food
more often these days.

94
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,490
And unlike before,

95
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,742
she struggles
with the injections these days.

96
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,872
She wants to go outside
and play with her friends

97
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,832
but has to stay home and get injections,

98
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,417
so I think she's very frustrated.

99
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,464
I've been coaxing her
into getting the injections,

100
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,384
and I've been making sure
she never overeats,

101
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,846
but I don't think
it'll be easy going forward.

102
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,765
And that being said,

103
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,354
when you were going over
the different treatment options,

104
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,483
you mentioned that
a small bowel transplant was one of them.

105
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,696
You said she might need it because
she only has a few central veins left now.

106
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,365
You said she's okay for now

107
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,993
but also suggested
we get her on the waitlist

108
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,497
just in case she'd need it later on,
so I registered her for it.

109
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,670
Out of fear,

110
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:29,509
I've been telling you
that I wasn't interested in that option,

111
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,558
but I now want to consider
going that route.

112
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,192
I'm aware that it's a difficult procedure
with a low success rate.

113
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,445
And that's why I was initially against it.

114
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,617
But seeing Seung-chae
asking for food all the time…

115
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,956
I want to cook her a proper meal for once.

116
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,710
I would like to give it a shot.

117
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,590
I want Seung-chae
to get a small bowel transplant.

118
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay.

119
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,561
Ma'am, can we talk about this again

120
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,604
after I give it some thought?

121
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:30,653
I want to make sure we're making
the best decision for Seung-chae.

122
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,532
Let me think about this
for just a couple of days.

123
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,659
Sure, of course.

124
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,369
All right.

125
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,553
Seok-min, do you see
the aneurysm neck here?

126
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,637
Yes.

127
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,765
I took care of the dissection.
Do you want to clip it?

128
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,142
Well…

129
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,937
Okay, I'll try.

130
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,692
RESTRICTED ACCESS

131
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,437
Nice. You weren't even nervous.
You got it in one go.

132
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,159
Seriously, you did a great job.

133
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,704
I never got it right at the beginning.
Well done.

134
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:04,997
You sure have the talent.

135
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,626
I'm flattered. Thank you
for giving me the chance to try it.

136
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,297
Since this was your first time,
you have to buy me lunch.

137
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,385
Okay. I'll treat you today.

138
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,138
Let's do one last check for bleeding.

139
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,598
Irrigation, please.

140
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,690
-Hello.
-Hello.

141
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,818
-Hello.
-Hi.

142
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,781
The patient is a kid,
but the condition is quite serious.

143
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,741
The professor of Radiology.

144
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,284
I see.

145
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,871
And is he a fellow in Pediatrics?

146
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
Yes.

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,960
Professor Kim Jun-wan is here,
so can we get started now?

148
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,169
Yes, we should.

149
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,462
All right.

150
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,381
Choi Eun-dam, age seven.

151
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,258
A male patient with Marfan syndrome.

152
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:02,596
Oh, dear. The enlarged heart
is pressing on the lungs.

153
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,265
He has severe scoliosis.

154
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,600
Four years ago,
he received MR repair at age three

155
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,311
from Professor Kim Jun-wan
at Kangwoon Medical Center.

156
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,063
At the moment, he is being treated

157
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,566
for kyphoscoliosis
in OS at Kangwoon Medical Center.

158
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,027
They recommended surgery
due to progression of AR and MR

159
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,197
shown in the tests done recently
because of his shortness of breath,

160
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,742
but his guardians wanted him
to be seen by Professor Choi Gyeong-hui.

161
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,371
I see that
the aortic sinus is enlarged too.

162
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,833
Well, I'm sure they took measurements.

163
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,336
Can we see it from a higher angle?

164
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,629
Sure.

165
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,012
It does look like he needs surgery.

166
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,892
Why did the doctors at Kangwoon
not proceed with surgery?

167
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,270
They thought the aortic regurgitation
wasn't too serious.

168
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,731
They did recommend surgery

169
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,735
but didn't want to do it right away,
so they've been using meds.

170
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,779
If they go ahead with this surgery,

171
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,741
they'll have to work on
the mitral valve, the aortic valve,

172
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,994
and even the aortic root.

173
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,039
It'll be complicated,
and his lungs aren't doing well either.

174
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,043
So they suggested surgery
but haven't been able to

175
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,086
finalize the date yet.

176
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,882
His dyspnea started to worsen notably
a few months ago,

177
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,467
so his mother kept waiting,

178
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,971
but she wants Eun-dam's surgery
to be done by the doctor

179
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,848
who performed his first heart surgery.

180
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,768
That's why she brought him to Yulje.

181
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,525
Do you think it's doable?

182
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,238
We should do it.

183
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,242
But I'm not sure if his vitals
will hold up during the anesthesia.

184
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,202
Because of his kyphoscoliosis,

185
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,871
he won't even be able to lie on his back.

186
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,290
The left ventricular contractility
and the size

187
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,876
tell me that the symptoms
won't be too severe.

188
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:01,423
So I don't want to put pressure
on the patient by expediting the surgery.

189
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,844
The regurgitation looks quite severe
on the ultrasound,

190
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,347
but it seems to be still functioning,

191
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,768
so let's see the patient and decide
when the surgery should be done.

192
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,562
He has an appointment with me,

193
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,940
so we can discuss this again
after I check the kid's condition.

194
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,082
Next is Ms. Kang Seo-ju.

195
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,750
Okay.

196
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,627
Hello.

197
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,129
Hello, Professor Yang.

198
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,463
Hello.

199
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,548
Let's sit down.

200
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,426
Well, everything looks good.

201
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,470
Don't worry about anything.

202
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,682
Just take it easy and get ready
for your due date next week.

203
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,060
The thing is, my wife is Rh-negative.

204
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:58,022
That won't be a risk factor
in the delivery process, right?

205
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,817
Well, an Rh-negative blood type

206
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,070
doesn't make the procedure riskier.

207
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,908
We have given her
an antibody injection already,

208
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,993
and the baby is doing great at the moment.

209
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,871
The only thing is,
if she loses a lot of blood

210
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,415
after the baby is born
and requires a transfusion,

211
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,459
we may have a hard time with that.

212
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:22,212
But that doesn't happen often,
so you don't need to worry.

213
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,925
You're not going away next week
or anything like that, right?

214
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,428
Me? Why do you ask?

215
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,305
Don't go anywhere.

216
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:36,060
You've been taking such good care of me
and my baby for months.

217
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,145
I want you to deliver my baby.

218
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,898
Yes. Of course, it'll be done by me.

219
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,819
But if you go into labor
at night or in the wee hours,

220
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,697
a doctor on duty
may end up taking care of--

221
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,324
No, that won't happen.

222
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,578
I'll make sure my baby

223
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,206
comes out when you're here.

224
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,752
All right.

225
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,179
Hello.

226
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,139
-Hello.
-Hello.

227
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,392
How's it going?

228
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,394
We took care of the cholecystectomy.

229
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
You've already gone past mobilization?

230
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,731
I think this is a fairly easy case.

231
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,610
No, not at all.

232
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,905
This is not an easy case.

233
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,873
You did a good job. No bleeding at all.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,168
Even the hilar dissection.
You got a lot done.

235
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,671
Look at you.

236
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,513
The adrenal gland was
almost glued to it on the CT scan,

237
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,140
but you managed to separate it.

238
00:16:56,223 --> 00:17:00,060
There wasn't a lot of fat,
so I got it done quickly.

239
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,980
-I should have you handle CUSA next time.
-Sorry?

240
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,025
No. Thank you though.

241
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,401
Forceps, please.

242
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,832
Is the food not here yet?
What did you order?

243
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,625
Food from the convenience store.

244
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,710
Sounds good.

245
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,549
-What's for lunch?
-Food from the convenience store.

246
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,592
Nice.

247
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,306
Guys, why am I always the one
doing these things?

248
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,390
Did I offer?

249
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,976
Yes, you offered to pay and pick it up.

250
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,145
Really?

251
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,950
Did Jeong-won really offer to pay?

252
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,788
No, he didn't say anything.

253
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,915
He'd do it anyway. Why bother asking him?

254
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,584
Is Ik-jun still in surgery?

255
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:10,506
Yes. He's had three transplants booked
in just a week.

256
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,467
The patients had to wait,
so he'll take on as many as possible.

257
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,010
Will he be free this weekend?

258
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,264
That I'm not sure. Why do you ask?

259
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,225
What's everyone doing this weekend?

260
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,603
How about some karaoke time?
It's been a while.

261
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,022
Do you have plans, Jeong-won?

262
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,442
No, not yet.
But I'll probably hang out with Gyeo-ul.

263
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,569
Last week, we couldn't.
So I want to see her.

264
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,576
Me too.

265
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,539
You'll see Dr. Jang too?

266
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,500
No. I've got plans for this weekend.

267
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,003
-No way.
-You're meeting someone this weekend?

268
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,841
You'll see your mom again?

269
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,302
-Do you love temple food that much?
-Enough, seriously!

270
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,975
You and Ik-jun?
I'm sure you both have no plans.

271
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,356
We're going out on a date.

272
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,405
Ik-jun and I…

273
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,450
I'm going to have dinner with him
this weekend.

274
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,744
And we'll go for a walk too.

275
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,665
-Sure.
-You guys do that all the time.

276
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,834
I guess they'll have more fun
this weekend.

277
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,504
That reminds me. His sister was here
when he was hospitalized.

278
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,340
-You mean, Ik-sun?
-Yes. Ik-sun, my dove.

279
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,134
-"Dove"?
-"Dove"?

280
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,844
There's a dove outside.

281
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,431
Anyway, the first day she was here
to look after Ik-jun,

282
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,516
she saw him hanging out with Song-hwa

283
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,934
and thought they were dating.

284
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,646
-Are you serious?
-For real?

285
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,817
But I have to say,
even I thought they looked like a couple

286
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,694
after I heard her say that.

287
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,201
I actually wondered if something was up.

288
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,660
We're actually dating.

289
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,454
-Come on.
-As if.

290
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,497
You and Ik-jun are dating?

291
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,498
Yes.

292
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,379
I'll eat my hat.

293
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,049
I'll change my surname.

294
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,177
I'll give you my house, my car,
and even all the stocks I own.

295
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,303
Me too.

296
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,804
Me too.

297
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,899
Can you say that one more time?

298
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,400
I want to record it.

299
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,286
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

300
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,454
Seung-chae?

301
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,291
The kid who ended up
with short gut after her neonatal surgery?

302
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,505
Yes. If we were to proceed
with a transplant for her,

303
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,008
I'd have to assist Professor Ahn,
so he told me to read up on it.

304
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,053
It's a very difficult procedure.

305
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,806
Intestinal transplantation?

306
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,391
Right.

307
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,979
Is it performed in Korea?
I've only read about it.

308
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,856
Well, only one or two cases a year
in the entire country,

309
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,360
including all pediatric
and adult patients.

310
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,155
It's a difficult procedure
and the success rate isn't very high.

311
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,617
Lower than that of
kidney and liver transplants?

312
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,702
Yes.

313
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,123
Compared to other organs,
the small bowel is much less likely

314
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,793
to adapt and function
when transplanted into a recipient's body.

315
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,922
Kidney and liver transplant survival rates
surpass 90 percent.

316
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,092
But small bowel transplants…
It's about 50 percent.

317
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,970
Maybe it's not even 50 percent.

318
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,346
I see.

319
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,723
That's why many parents

320
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,642
opt for maintaining the current condition
without a transplant.

321
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,978
There are effective injectable drugs,

322
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,480
so the patients can stay
pretty healthy for years.

323
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,190
I'd do the same.

324
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,443
Knowing how risky the surgery is,

325
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,611
it's a hard choice to make.

326
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,822
But I've spoken with many mothers

327
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,366
who are considering
a small bowel transplant.

328
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,119
-Really?
-Yes.

329
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,872
Kids grow up.

330
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,374
And as they grow up,

331
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,169
the mothers see them
wanting to eat through the mouth.

332
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,420
I see.

333
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,715
Every day, the kids would want to eat
until they feel full.

334
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,300
But the mothers can't let them.

335
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,970
It's heartbreaking for the mothers.

336
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,931
But with a transplant…

337
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,310
If the surgery goes well,
the kids can eat as much as they want.

338
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,563
But they still want to try it

339
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,315
even if it's dangerous.

340
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,778
But once they make up their mind to do it,

341
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,572
they start worrying
about the surgery going wrong

342
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,574
and end up deciding against it again.

343
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,662
It's hard.
It's a difficult decision to make.

344
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,623
Then what should we do?

345
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,709
Well…

346
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,878
Her mother wants her
to receive a transplant.

347
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,631
And if there are no other medical issues,

348
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,049
Professor Ahn will do it.

349
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,429
How many small bowel transplants
has he performed so far?

350
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,098
From what I know,

351
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:14,643
Professor Ahn is the only one at Yulje
with previous experience.

352
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,977
He's worked on three cases.

353
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,814
Were they all successful?

354
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,818
Only one of them was successful.

355
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,529
The other two weren't.

356
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,322
I see.

357
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,714
Where are you? Did the surgery go well?

358
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,258
Yes. Where are you?

359
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,301
I'm in the center garden.

360
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,636
I'll come now.

361
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,972
No, let's meet somewhere else.

362
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,567
You already called her
and said you'd do it.

363
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,904
Stop worrying. The surgery will go well.

364
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,534
Did I make the right decision though?

365
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,912
Is this the right answer?

366
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,501
If this was a question
with one right answer,

367
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,420
you wouldn't be this torn.

368
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,264
You already made your decision.

369
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,184
So just focus on that now.

370
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,354
Only think about the surgery,
nothing else.

371
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,233
Isn't that enough to make you feel like
your head is about to explode?

372
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,287
Did you have dinner?

373
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:01,249
I grabbed a quick bite to eat
with the others after the surgery.

374
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:07,047
Professor Ahn,
do you have plans for this weekend?

375
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,175
How about dinner?

376
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:11,843
Sounds good.

377
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,097
I have something to tell you.

378
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,353
Tell me now.

379
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,354
No.

380
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,732
Not here.

381
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,777
And not dressed like this.
I want to wear my normal clothes.

382
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,203
I'll tell you when I see you this weekend.

383
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,747
All right.

384
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:55,387
-So for that case…
-Yes.

385
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,182
Well, you know.

386
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,519
You did a good job though.
It can happen, you know.

387
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,063
-I should've been more careful.
-Right.

388
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,231
Thank you.

389
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,012
Seriously?

390
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,097
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

391
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,726
I told you guys
that I had plans for this weekend.

392
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,979
That was with Dr. Chu Min-ha?

393
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,192
My gosh, I'm so happy for you.

394
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,908
To be honest, we knew something was up
between you two,

395
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,078
but I had no idea
that you guys were already a couple.

396
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,913
You knew?

397
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,540
How could I not know?

398
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,335
Your eyes were always glued to Dr. Chu.

399
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,671
Really?

400
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,133
You're finally dating, after so long.

401
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,927
Be good to her.

402
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,389
Yes, I will.

403
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,853
Your mother doesn't know yet, does she?

404
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,943
No. But I'm planning to tell her tonight.

405
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,782
I got insurance just in case,

406
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,867
so I'm going to talk to her about it too.

407
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,369
What do you mean?

408
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,704
Nothing.

409
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,499
Anyway, I'm off.

410
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,129
Are you on duty tonight?

411
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,426
No, you're not. Ik-jun is.

412
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,097
I'm waiting for him
so we can have dinner together.

413
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,642
He has to stop by the ICU
after his surgery,

414
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,060
so I'm just waiting for him.

415
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,186
I see.

416
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,156
No way.

417
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,701
For real?

418
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,414
Yes.

419
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,684
So it is for real!

420
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,936
Yes.

421
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,108
I'm so happy for you guys.

422
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,111
This makes me…

423
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,613
really happy.

424
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:04,909
But…

425
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,204
why didn't I know? You two…

426
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,999
You really care for each other.

427
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,835
I never even thought this could happen.

428
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,715
This is such great news.

429
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,633
I'm so happy for you.

430
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,262
You made the right decision, Song-hwa.

431
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,598
Come on.

432
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,935
It still feels so awkward and funny

433
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,062
that I can't even look at his face.

434
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,816
So it really is true!

435
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,153
Yes, I told you! It is true.

436
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,350
Ik-jun, let's go eat.

437
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,949
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

438
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,829
Let's do what other couples do.

439
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:41,047
Feed me, and I'll eat like this.

440
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,759
Here, like this.

441
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,724
-Like this.
-What are you doing?

442
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
My gosh!

443
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,447
I'll do it.

444
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,534
But can you?

445
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,661
I'll try.

446
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,206
Okay. Hold on.

447
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,509
Here.

448
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,638
Open wide.

449
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,017
What are you doing?

450
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,477
Why close your eyes?

451
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,188
I'm the one who's being fed here.

452
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,357
Gosh, I can't do this.

453
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,112
-Goodness.
-Forget it.

454
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,573
Let's just feed ourselves.

455
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:51,701
My gosh.

456
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,705
Seriously…

457
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,711
So Ik-sun is coming to Seoul this weekend?

458
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,088
Yes, her friend who got married recently

459
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,798
is throwing a housewarming party.

460
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,925
She'll bring U-ju.

461
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,468
-Great.
-Yes.

462
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,806
Gosh, why can't we do it though?

463
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,808
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

464
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,769
All right, let's go.

465
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,355
Hurry. We have to go all the way
to Internal Medicine.

466
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,612
We have the lab results
for Mr. Bae's wife.

467
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,405
Everything looks good.

468
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,158
I checked the MRI scan,
and the bile duct looks good too.

469
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:34,410
How's Mr. Bae Jong-seop's bilirubin level?

470
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,121
It's gone up to 15.6.

471
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,588
You've received embolization
and radiotherapy,

472
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,632
but your liver function is deteriorating,

473
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,594
so you'll need a transplant
as soon as possible.

474
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,306
I checked the X-ray,
and your pneumonia has improved.

475
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,267
We'll wait about a week.
If it improves further,

476
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,436
we'll book your surgery.

477
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,815
Gosh, we could have done it sooner,
but this stubborn man

478
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,484
put us through all that trouble
and caused this delay.

479
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,363
He's not stubborn.

480
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,032
He just feels bad. That's all.

481
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,661
I know, but he must live.

482
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,579
He must survive this and recover.

483
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,916
Then he can treat me like a queen
for the rest of his life.

484
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,336
My kids came up
with a great nickname for him.

485
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,338
-What is it?
-Papillon.

486
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,340
Papillon!

487
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,051
Papillon…

488
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,847
Goodness. That's all in the past.

489
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,682
I won't do it again.

490
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,643
You'd better not do it this time.

491
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,271
I do see some donors run away
from time to time,

492
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,565
but you were the first and only recipient

493
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,109
who went AWOL
in my entire career as a doctor.

494
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,945
I'm sorry.

495
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,699
If we got it done last year, we'd be
vacationing with the kids this summer.

496
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,368
You can't do it this summer,

497
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,913
but you can take a family vacation
in every summer and winter going forward.

498
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,458
Will that day really come?

499
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,211
Yes, if the surgery and treatment go well.
I have no doubt about it.

500
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:14,886
Doctor, I really want to live.

501
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:19,390
I want to survive this
so I can repay my wife

502
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,642
for everything she's done for me.

503
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,478
So please save me.

504
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,439
I'm counting on you, Doctor.

505
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,747
How long has Eun-dam
been breathing like this?

506
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,791
It's been a few months.

507
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,834
He can't sleep lying down,

508
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,171
so he's been sleeping
sitting up like this for a while.

509
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,518
Eun-dam, can we measure
your height and weight one more time?

510
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,394
Okay.

511
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,939
You can go by yourself, right?

512
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,776
I'm not a baby.

513
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,529
Go for it, Eun-dam.

514
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:16,823
Okay.

515
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,033
Don't worry.

516
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,161
I'll see you in a minute.

517
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,871
Let's go, Eun-dam.

518
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,180
You must be aware of the fact
that it's high-risk surgery,

519
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,723
so I'll get right to the point.

520
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,145
He can't go on like this.

521
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,772
He should at least
be able to sleep lying down

522
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,566
and breathe comfortably.

523
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,070
I'll make time
so we can expedite Eun-dam's surgery.

524
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,408
Okay. Thank you, Professor Kim.

525
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,001
You look good.

526
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,253
You're taking your meds, right?

527
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,174
Of course. I always take
the immunosuppressants on time.

528
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,385
Warfarin too. I've been
religiously following the regimen.

529
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,263
He takes so many pills.

530
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,019
It'll probably feel like a hassle,
but please continue to follow the regimen.

531
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,524
From now on, you can come back
every three months. My gosh.

532
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,277
This must have been so hard.

533
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,447
Coming all the way to Seoul once a month.

534
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,407
Actually,

535
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,702
we live in Seoul now.

536
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,287
Really?

537
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,748
Yes. Our son got a job in Seoul,

538
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,583
so we moved here.

539
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,501
For his appointments with you

540
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,046
and with the heart specialist as well.

541
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,506
It was exhausting
to commute back and forth so often.

542
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,219
Anyway, we moved to Seoul last month.

543
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,678
We live very close to Yulje.

544
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,722
You no longer
have to arrive the day before.

545
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:09,310
That's right.
We took our sweet time today.

546
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:15,191
Who knew
I'd get to live in Seoul at this age?

547
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,320
Come on, you're still young.

548
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,699
You'll adjust in no time.

549
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,911
I'll see you in three months.

550
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,289
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

551
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,291
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

552
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,503
I'm planning to do
a valve-sparing operation.

553
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,966
Will it be doable though?
Wouldn't the Bentall procedure be better?

554
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,259
I'll try my best.

555
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,761
We'll replace the mitral valve
with an artificial one,

556
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,306
and there's a big difference
between having two artificial valves

557
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,100
and just having one,

558
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,144
so I want to fix the aortic valve
without having to replace it.

559
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,314
We'll replace the aortic root
with artificial vessels.

560
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,734
But as for the aortic valve,
we'll try our best to save it.

561
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,779
I already called him.

562
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,865
He'll come and help us out
as soon as his appointments are done.

563
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,909
Who?

564
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,747
What?

565
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,042
Whether a valve-sparing operation
will be successful or not

566
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,586
directly depends on
the surgeon's level of experience.

567
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,089
Eun-dam is a kid,

568
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,301
but the more experienced the surgeon is,

569
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,054
the more successful the surgery will be,
and the difference is huge.

570
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,392
Besides, Eun-dam's case will be difficult
even for surgeons

571
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,019
who are extremely experienced,

572
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:36,814
so it should be done by someone
who's more experienced than I am.

573
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,447
Can the next patient come in?

574
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,823
-Just a minute.
-Sure.

575
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,327
I just sent you
the patient's chart number.

576
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,246
Would you be able to take a look
at the CT scan and the echo?

577
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,624
I performed MR repair
on this kid a few years ago.

578
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,544
But MR recurred.
That in addition to the progression of AR

579
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,171
has caused aortic root dilation.

580
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,590
The mitral valve needs to be fixed,

581
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,260
and so do the aortic root
and the aortic valve.

582
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,015
You're more experienced
with valve-sparing operations than I am.

583
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,310
Could I ask you to take this on?

584
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,022
Okay, thank you.

585
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,690
-Let them in.
-Okay.

586
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,655
You've resigned as chairman,
so you're jobless now.

587
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:30,910
That's right.
I don't have a home or a job.

588
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm homeless and jobless.

589
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,377
I'll let you stay at my place.
Just pay me 500,000 won monthly.

590
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,796
Without a deposit?

591
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,091
That's right. No rent deposit.
Just 500,000 won a month.

592
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:49,637
My gosh, thanks.
This is what friends are for.

593
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,268
Was it nice to see the kids?

594
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,729
Yes.

595
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:04,193
It was nice to see my son
and my grandkids after so long.

596
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,613
I'm glad.

597
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,992
I knew I'd end up making this decision.

598
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,828
Me too.

599
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,045
-Oh, dear.
-Hey.

600
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,046
-Rosa.
-Yes.

601
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,842
Since you're giving me
a discount on the rent,

602
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,803
let me grant your lifelong wish.

603
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,600
-Really?
-Yes, let's go together.

604
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,775
We won't be able to walk for too long,
but we'll go together.

605
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,322
But just so you know,
I can't walk the entire route.

606
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,575
If I do that, I'll actually die.

607
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,912
Of course, you can't. Neither can I.

608
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,164
That'd be too ambitious.

609
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,669
We'll start with the others
and walk for a while,

610
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,797
then head straight to the finish line.
What do you say?

611
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,133
Sounds good. I'd be happy with that.

612
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,554
I'd be so happy…

613
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,932
even if we just went to the cathedral.

614
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:23,564
All right. We'll take our time
and just walk as much as we can.

615
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,234
Then we'll attend Mass at the cathedral.

616
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,574
My gosh, are you that happy?
I should have taken you there sooner.

617
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,329
Then when should we go?

618
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,872
Before we get old.

619
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,333
Hey, we're already old!

620
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,669
Come on. We'll go before we get older.

621
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,966
We should book our flights right away.
Let me call Jeong-won.

622
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,927
Rosa!

623
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,844
Hey!

624
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,147
He said his girlfriend asked him to stay.

625
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,527
Seok-hyeong has a girlfriend?

626
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,696
Yes, apparently. I was so surprised.

627
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,950
Indeed. What a surprise.

628
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,828
I can't believe it.
I had no idea that he was seeing someone.

629
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,664
Jong-su, let's have some coffee.

630
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:25,334
Okay. Seriously, what a surprise.

631
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,586
Gosh, my legs.

632
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,882
Does it mean Seok-hyeong
is not moving to the US anymore?

633
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,552
Are they getting married?

634
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,887
I'm not sure about that yet,

635
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,099
but his girlfriend persuaded him to stay
and not go to the US.

636
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,725
Nice.

637
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,979
She said, "Where do you think
you're going? Your mother isn't well."

638
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:47,189
-Really?
-Yes.

639
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,901
She told him to stay and look after me
because he's my only child.

640
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,820
How thoughtful. You should thank her.

641
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,739
I'm grateful to her for saying that.

642
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,286
Just for saying that?
Can't you be grateful for everything?

643
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:04,832
Gosh, I know. I'm just saying.

644
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,877
I swear, I'll be so good to her.

645
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,591
When he introduces her to me,
I'll take her out for an expensive dinner.

646
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:14,883
Just once?

647
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,720
Goodness. No, many times.

648
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,234
Order two dishes that you want. I'm easy.

649
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,694
Can I order tangsuyuk too?

650
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,487
Of course, that's a given.

651
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,869
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

652
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,038
-Take your time with the main dishes.
-Okay.

653
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,294
Hey, Ik-sun.

654
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,008
Don't come here. Just go home.

655
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,177
Tell her to join us. Is she nearby?

656
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,512
Where are you?

657
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,271
How did you get here so fast?

658
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,148
Was the housewarming party here?

659
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,524
No, across the street.

660
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,068
I'm lucky when it comes to food.

661
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,944
Was the party canceled?

662
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,530
Yes, my friend came down
with a stomach bug.

663
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,116
I got the text
when I arrived at the building.

664
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,701
Who's your friend? The wife?

665
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:26,121
Both of them.
They got married because I set them up.

666
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:31,960
Hey, Jun-wan.

667
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,673
Us? We're having dinner.

668
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
I'll text you the address. Okay.

669
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,138
Jun-wan will join us.

670
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,682
He hasn't eaten all day.

671
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,543
Were you guys waiting by the door
or something?

672
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,421
You can get to places fast
if there's no traffic.

673
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,048
How's the ganjjajang?

674
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,512
In Seoul,
it doesn't come with a fried egg.

675
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,514
So I never order it in Seoul.

676
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,391
Does it come with one in Changwon?

677
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:31,145
Yes. That's how we differentiate
regular jjajangmyeon from it.

678
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,480
There's a great ganjjajang place
near the base.

679
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,232
They give you two fried eggs.

680
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,235
Okay. I heard you, but I can't go. Sorry.

681
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:41,321
Even Inje was so far.
I don't have time to go to Changwon.

682
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,198
Our parents live in Changwon.

683
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,201
Let's take Mom and Dad there.
Ganjjajang is on me.

684
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,120
Why is a soldier
going on about ganjjajang?

685
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,793
But I'd say it's about time we put on…

686
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,754
a joint performance.

687
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,385
-Have you not forgotten it?
-My body remembers.

688
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,096
-What is this about?
-Jun-wan.

689
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,057
Let's go to the karaoke.

690
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,577
"LOVE LOVE" BY BIJOU

691
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:58,732
A beautiful world you've been waiting for

692
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:03,028
We're waiting for that beautiful world

693
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,739
It's nothing fancy

694
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:08,492
But there's a world I've been dreaming of

695
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,285
Just for you

696
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:17,543
Your smile is as pure as crystal

697
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:22,506
Show me that smile

698
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:27,094
So I can

699
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:32,391
Enter your heart

700
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:37,271
Your smile is as pure as snow

701
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:42,067
Show me that smile

702
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,989
So my heart

703
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:52,160
Can always beat for you

704
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:56,623
Before I met you
I never trusted anyone but myself

705
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,084
Yes, I wanted a glamorous life

706
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,128
I believed it would make me happy

707
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,298
Yes, I'll help you
Make your dreams come true

708
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,675
By teaching you how to fly on your own

709
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:11,346
True happiness always comes from within

710
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:16,351
Even when you are walking alone
In the dark

711
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,981
All exhausted

712
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,819
My heart filled with love for you

713
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:31,575
Will keep you safe

714
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:33,994
Toi, c'est très compliqué

715
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,455
Mais il est fou d'être
Trop raisonnable moi

716
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:40,208
L'amour, c'est plus fort que
J'ai besoin de toi

717
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:46,423
In the early morning
Where the sun shines down on you

718
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:50,636
-Can you think of me as another you?
-Can you think of me as another you?

719
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,018
Really? Since when?

720
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,020
Last week.

721
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,524
My mom is a good cook,
so she'll sell some side dishes too.

722
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,943
My aunt will pay her.

723
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,445
That's great.

724
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:12,407
It'd be good for her to work
and not stay home alone all the time.

725
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,202
Does your aunt own a big deli?

726
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,037
No, it's a small neighborhood shop.

727
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,623
But she has many regulars
thanks to word of mouth.

728
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,501
My mom will help her out
only during the dinnertime rush.

729
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,254
It sounds like she's doing much better.
She is, right?

730
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,510
Try this.

731
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,063
Can I decide where we should go
for our summer getaway?

732
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,189
It's coming up soon.

733
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,736
Before that,

734
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,656
can you free up just one day for me?

735
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,790
My mom wants to have dinner with you.

736
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,675
I told her…

737
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,097
that there's someone I love.

738
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,434
She wants to have dinner
with you right away.

739
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,881
Three, zero, one, two.

740
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,180
Hey, you won't stop her?

741
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,557
Why should I?
She wants to sing at a karaoke bar.

742
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,850
Is she a good singer?

743
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,602
Yes.

744
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,118
Can we please hit the stop button?

745
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,370
Hit the stop button.

746
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:34,257
The man I love is right by my side

747
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,178
Darling, your eyes are filled
With your love for me

748
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:45,018
Even if everything in the world changes

749
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:48,855
Don't ever let me go

750
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:53,610
When I open my eyes in the morning
And see the sunlight streaming in

751
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:58,782
I wake up in your arms

752
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:04,162
Even when I'm being pathetic and annoying

753
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:09,459
Always hold me in your arms, just like now

754
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:18,760
When you tell me that you love me
Say it more sweetly

755
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:23,765
And don't forget
Even after this night ends

756
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:30,772
So I won't feel like a fool
Thinking of you

757
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:50,125
So I won't feel like a fool
Thinking of you

758
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,139
I told my parents about you.

759
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,350
-What did they say?
-They're happy, of course.

760
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,811
They said you're much better
than the polar bear.

761
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,480
Especially my mom. She's over the moon.

762
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,316
I'm glad to hear that.

763
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,776
But who's "the polar bear"?

764
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,696
Oh, nothing. I'll tell you later.

765
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,574
Right, I told my mom too.

766
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,825
It made her so happy.

767
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,995
Really? When can I meet her?

768
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:31,166
Let's take it slow.
The later you meet her, the better.

769
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,250
Okay.

770
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,922
Go on in.

771
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,425
You're starting work early tomorrow.

772
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,307
Now, I get why people get married.

773
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,146
I really don't want to say goodbye here.

774
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,069
Don't you think…

775
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,698
you should wait a bit more
to get to know me better?

776
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,867
Right?

777
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,334
This may be new to you,

778
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,963
but I've waited a long time.

779
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,230
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

780
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:04,903
We've been getting
more surgery support inquiries.

781
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,405
Should we get a helper?

782
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,365
Gyeo-ul would love to help out.

783
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,747
You can just visit every month. It's okay.

784
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,459
Ik-jun didn't pull in
much revenue at all last month.

785
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,961
He has to perform surgery on weekends.

786
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,380
Ik-jun was a patient last month.

787
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,466
Was he?

788
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,511
I see that Seok-hyeong worked hard.

789
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,722
He's one diligent bear.

790
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,685
-Did you guys bad-mouth me?
-We were just about to.

791
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:43,900
Hey, I heard Chairman Ju resigned.
Was it because of a health problem?

792
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:47,946
No, he's doing great.
That's why he resigned.

793
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,364
To join a different hospital?

794
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,408
No, to walk the Camino de Santiago.

795
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,747
He and his friend
will do it together this fall.

796
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,707
You mean, Ms. Jeong Rosa?

797
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,751
Yes, he and my mom.

798
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,212
Just the two of them? With no one else?

799
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,131
Yes.

800
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:13,763
No. They really are just friends,
like you two.

801
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,733
-Hey, Seong-yeong.
-We have a 61-year-old male patient.

802
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,819
We did a CT scan.
It's a pontine hemorrhage

803
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,946
accompanied by IVH.

804
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:33,074
Current mental status is semi-coma.
He's exhibiting pinpoint pupils.

805
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,951
Motor is grade one for all limbs.

806
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,370
Breathing is unstable.
We have intubated him.

807
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,955
-Send me the CT scan now.
-Okay.

808
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:42,125
Right, he received a liver transplant here
last February,

809
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,752
then heart surgery this March.
He's on an anticoagulant.

810
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,172
He underwent a liver transplant
and heart surgery?

811
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,339
Yes.

812
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:11,613
You seemed very worried about your baby,

813
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,616
so we did a detailed ultrasound
a bit sooner for you.

814
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,076
The detailed ultrasound

815
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,371
shows no structural fetal abnormality.

816
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,835
From the brain to the heart,
everything looks good.

817
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,630
In fact, your baby is actually

818
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:32,967
measuring about one week ahead.

819
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,678
Have you felt any fetal movement yet?

820
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,724
I'm not too sure,

821
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,685
but I felt as though
a fish was swimming inside my belly.

822
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,604
Or like a stomach rumble.

823
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,940
Was that a fetal movement?

824
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,318
Yes, it is.
You felt it pretty early in the pregnancy.

825
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,402
I see.

826
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,949
Your baby is growing well,

827
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,410
so I think
you can stop worrying about your baby.

828
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:03,581
Well… I'm looking at your chart
from Hemato-Oncology right now.

829
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:08,211
Your white blood cell count isn't bad.

830
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:12,340
And no bad reactions
to the chemotherapy drugs.

831
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,634
Right. She's had three sessions so far.

832
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,804
She needs eight in total,
so she still has a long way to go,

833
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,391
but she's doing great.

834
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,768
But the blood work shows

835
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,479
that your hemoglobin level is low.

836
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,314
Chemotherapy takes a toll on the body,

837
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,733
so make sure
you eat lots of nutrient-dense foods.

838
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,695
Take your anemia medication
and eat iron-rich foods.

839
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,072
We'll give you iron injections if needed.

840
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,323
Thank you.

841
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,493
I'll see you again in a month.

842
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,787
I checked the CT scan.

843
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,789
His pontine hemorrhage is severe,

844
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,542
and his mental status isn't good.
It'll be hard.

845
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,212
With the IVH and acute hydrocephalus too,

846
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,131
we'll have to use EVDs, for both sides.

847
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,301
-Call Anesthesiology and let me know.
-Okay.

848
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,056
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

849
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,987
Well…

850
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,116
In the brain,
there's a part called "medulla."

851
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:22,994
It controls basic
yet critical bodily functions

852
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,747
such as breathing
and various reflexive activities.

853
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,750
He has a hemorrhage
in that part of the brain.

854
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,836
That's why he came into our ER
in a coma-like state.

855
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:36,132
A medullary hemorrhage

856
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,760
is very dangerous,
so we can't perform surgery.

857
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,014
But unfortunately,
the severe bleeding has caused the blood

858
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,183
to seep into the cerebral ventricles.

859
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,729
We performed an emergency procedure
to drain the blood,

860
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,857
but the initial bleeding was very severe,

861
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:55,610
and he's been on a blood thinner,

862
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,446
so we can't stop the bleeding
at the moment.

863
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,866
I think…

864
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:05,078
you should prepare yourselves.

865
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,805
No, please…

866
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,987
Jae-hak. Do you want
to go see Eun-dam with me?

867
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,614
He must be nervous about tomorrow.

868
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,408
I already checked in on him.

869
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,535
He'll go to sleep soon. You should hurry.

870
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,577
All right.

871
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,709
Hey, did your wife's appointment go well?

872
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:56,713
Yes, she's staying strong.

873
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:58,923
All right.

874
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,114
-Professor Kim.
-Hello.

875
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,661
Eun-dam's surgery is tomorrow,
so I stopped by to see him.

876
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,331
Should I wake him up?

877
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,417
No, please don't. It's okay.

878
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:39,630
I'll see you tomorrow.

879
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:16,501
Dad will probably faint
when he sees us in this state.

880
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:18,961
Should we wash up?

881
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,838
No, that will take time.

882
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:24,884
He's waiting for us,
so we should just hurry home.

883
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,804
How long has it been
since we last went home?

884
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,388
I have no idea.

885
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,937
-Hello.
-Hello.

886
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,021
Hi.

887
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:52,537
Jang Hong-do.

888
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,333
Yes, Professor.

889
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,088
Where do you live?

890
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:05,174
Pardon?

891
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,551
Where do you live?

892
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,470
-You two live together, right?
-Yes.

893
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,099
I'll drive you home.

894
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,105
Wait by the entrance.
I'll go bring the car around.

895
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,107
-No, it's okay.
-Thank you.

896
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:33,536
It's level one. Get out.
I'll see you guys in a minute.

897
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,413
-Okay.
-Okay.

898
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,137
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

899
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,306
Get some rest.

900
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,725
Hello, Doctor!

901
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,852
Hello. Are you going home
to get your things?

902
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,353
Yes. I'll be admitted tomorrow,

903
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,898
so I want to go home
and get the things I'll need.

904
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,609
You should sleep comfortably
at home tonight.

905
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,445
You've been sleeping here every night.

906
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:10,364
Yes, I haven't been home in so long.

907
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:14,452
I want to make dinner for my kids,
collect my thoughts, and sleep well.

908
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:17,496
The surgery is booked
for the coming Monday, right?

909
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,248
Yes. Monday at 7 a.m.

910
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:22,209
I'll be working this weekend,

911
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,503
so let me know if you need anything.

912
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,589
My gosh, thank you.

913
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,477
So you and Dr. Chu are seeing each other?

914
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,023
My mom told me.

915
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,817
Should I keep it to myself?

916
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,364
No. Song-hwa already knows.

917
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:55,576
And I'm going to tell Ik-jun
and Jun-wan this weekend.

918
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,167
We're practicing this Sunday, right?

919
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,336
I'll be on duty on Saturday.

920
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,423
I have a symposium in the morning too.

921
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,092
We should have lunch together.

922
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:12,426
Sure, I'd love that.

923
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,097
What's the song for this week?

924
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,765
Jeong-won picked it.

925
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:19,976
What is it?

926
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,944
Hwang Ji-woo speaking.

927
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:31,988
Sorry?

928
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,115
Okay, I'll come now.

929
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,952
Bae Jong-seop,
who's getting a transplant next week,

930
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:40,997
is experiencing hematemesis,
and his vitals are unstable.

931
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,043
Doctor.

932
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,681
-Doctor.
-Mr. Bae!

933
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,558
Let's remove this.

934
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,568
Order an emergency endoscopy now.

935
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:11,986
Okay.

936
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,364
We're ready for intubation.

937
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,580
His esophageal varices ruptured.

938
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,166
They're doing an endoscopy
but can't stop the bleeding.

939
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,209
-He'll need an SB tube.
-And his vitals?

940
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,920
BP is 80. Mental status is not good.
We've intubated him.

941
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,719
We managed
to stop the bleeding with the SB tube,

942
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,262
but he's not doing well at all.

943
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:40,181
And there's a minor bleed.

944
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,349
STAFF ONLY

945
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,727
When is his transplant surgery booked for?

946
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,437
Monday, which is in three days.

947
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,482
He may not make it through the weekend.

948
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,735
Let's try to hold him over until then.

949
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,907
He may not make it through the night.

950
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:04,622
Let's do this.

951
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,670
Will there be a paravalvular leak?

952
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,548
No, I think it'll be okay.

953
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,885
Suture for the ASD, please.

954
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,100
Can you call the professor?

955
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,143
He said he's almost here.

956
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,228
Okay.

957
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,317
Professor,
we have a new patient in the ICU.

958
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,902
A 75-year-old male patient.

959
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:38,489
The CT scan shows ICH on the right side.
It's approximately 50cc.

960
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:42,159
Mental status, stupor.
His right pupil has dilated to about 0.4.

961
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:44,161
And left-side motor is unresponsive.

962
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:47,915
Yes, I checked the CT scan you sent me.
The ICH is severe.

963
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,209
He'll need surgery,
so let his family know.

964
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,503
Call Anesthesiology
and book an OR right away.

965
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,462
Got it.

966
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,759
Professor Lee! How's my husband?

967
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,929
Will he be okay? He'll live, right?

968
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,684
You will have to make a decision now.

969
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,227
Sorry?

970
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:18,612
It doesn't look like
he can hold out until Monday.

971
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,202
I think

972
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,623
we should perform
an emergency liver transplant tonight.

973
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:34,461
As for the bleeding
from esophageal varices,

974
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:37,506
we managed to bring it under control
with an SB tube,

975
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,301
which are inflatable balloons
that are used to stop bleeding.

976
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:43,971
But his hemoglobin level isn't going up,

977
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:46,599
which means
there are minor bleeds elsewhere.

978
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,517
The best thing to do now would be

979
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,438
proceeding with the transplant
to reduce pressure and help circulation.

980
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,607
We could try other things
to stop the bleeding,

981
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,568
but this was ultimately caused
by his liver issues,

982
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:01,739
so we should get to the bottom of it
by expediting the surgery

983
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:05,075
and try to reduce the pressure
in his hepatic portal vein.

984
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,828
I think that's the best solution.

985
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,504
Okay, let's do it.

986
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,341
I'll do it.

987
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,438
The hematoma is worse
than what I saw in the CT scan.

988
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,612
I don't think
we can expect a good prognosis.

989
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:42,738
I know.

990
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,158
Did you say his wife just passed away?

991
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,285
Yes, he came from her funeral.

992
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:51,205
Oh, dear.

993
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:05,594
SURGERY PATIENT FAMILY
WAITING ROOM

994
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,557
He's not young,

995
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,977
and the hematoma is severe,

996
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:15,813
so he may not regain consciousness.

997
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:18,565
Let's monitor him carefully.

998
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,234
-Yes.
-Yes, Professor.

999
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:22,152
Suction.

1000
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:26,657
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1001
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,884
What about the mitral valve? Forceps.

1002
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:50,514
I had fixed the posterior leaflet,
but it prolapsed again.

1003
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:51,807
The leaflet had thickened,

1004
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:54,893
and the chordae were too thin and long,
so we've fixed that.

1005
01:11:55,894 --> 01:11:57,146
Metzenbaum scissors.

1006
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,398
Congenital MR can be repaired,

1007
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:01,859
but it tends to recur in many cases.

1008
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,371
Isn't the leaflet too thick?

1009
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,416
I hope we can fix it.

1010
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:20,753
We're performing
a valve-sparing operation, so let's try.

1011
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,051
Cardioplegia was administered
15 minutes ago.

1012
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:50,824
What's the flow rate?

1013
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,035
It's at 20 percent now.

1014
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:54,328
Let's bring it down.

1015
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:12,262
Suction, please.

1016
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,347
Sure.

1017
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,114
Turning the pump back on. One, two, three.

1018
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,542
We'll try that again in 20 minutes.

1019
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,710
Please drain the heart-lung machine.

1020
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,797
Be thorough with the suction.
And can we check his PEEP?

1021
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:49,967
Can you also request NO gas from the ICU?

1022
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,301
Sure.

1023
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:58,892
He had an intracerebral hemorrhage
in the right basal ganglia,

1024
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,687
so we performed surgery
to drain the blood.

1025
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,356
We successfully removed the hematoma
through the surgery.

1026
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,776
However, he's not young,
and he's lost a lot of blood.

1027
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:11,488
He was already unconscious
when he arrived at our ICU,

1028
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,951
so we'll have to see how it goes.

1029
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:20,122
Will my father live?

1030
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:24,084
I'm afraid
I can't say anything at the moment.

1031
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,129
He's still in critical condition,

1032
01:14:27,212 --> 01:14:30,632
and the hemorrhage may recur
in the next two or three days,

1033
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,009
so he may not make it.

1034
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,802
We'll have to wait two or three days

1035
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,973
for me to be able to tell you
whether or not I think he'll live.

1036
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:42,436
We'll monitor him carefully
in the ICU tonight.

1037
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,356
But even if he makes it through the night,

1038
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,775
he may never regain his consciousness.

1039
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:58,619
I think he was devastated
by the loss of his wife.

1040
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:03,916
Extremely stressful situations
such as the loss of one's spouse or child

1041
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,251
can do a lot more damage
than a fainting spell

1042
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,588
and cause a brain hemorrhage
in some rare cases.

1043
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:12,508
What do we do…

1044
01:15:15,552 --> 01:15:18,430
We will monitor him carefully.

1045
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,432
Please take good care of him.

1046
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:22,851
STAFF ONLY

1047
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,145
Dad… What do we do?

1048
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:26,939
Dad.

1049
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:29,816
Dad, what should we do?

1050
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:34,154
My mom's asking me
to go to Yangpyeong with her next week.

1051
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,197
Will you be there?

1052
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,824
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

1053
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:39,076
Thanks.

1054
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:41,578
You're leaving early today.
Do you have a date?

1055
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,873
She's on duty tonight.

1056
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:46,625
I see.

1057
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,835
And I have a symposium tomorrow morning.

1058
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:52,339
These days, I can't get up
unless I go to bed early.

1059
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:53,924
I'm off.

1060
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:55,175
All right.

1061
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,931
Ahn Jeong-won speaking.

1062
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:03,892
Professor, I think we found
the right donor for Seung-chae.

1063
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:06,937
It's a female TA patient. Age four.

1064
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,648
She's in the ICU
at Jae-an Medical Center at the moment.

1065
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,568
Her weight is 15kg,
and they have the same blood type.

1066
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,071
They said the donor is
in stable condition overall.

1067
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,489
What should we do?

1068
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,118
-What about the ultrasound?
-They said the ultrasound looked good.

1069
01:16:21,868 --> 01:16:24,705
When was she admitted to the ICU?

1070
01:16:24,788 --> 01:16:26,248
Two days ago.

1071
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:28,625
I see.

1072
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:33,338
Can I call you back in five minutes?

1073
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,881
Sure, no problem.

1074
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:17,716
Yes, Professor Ahn.

1075
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:21,219
Let's do it.

1076
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,264
Please call Seung-chae's mother
and let her know.

1077
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,807
Sure, will do.

1078
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:49,998
Scalpel.

1079
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:36,169
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1080
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,933
It looks good.
Let's take care of the bench work.

1081
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:50,851
Sure.

1082
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,448
I'm going to the recipient's OR.

1083
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,949
You know what to do, right?

1084
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:07,576
Yes, I've been given instructions.

1085
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,494
Measure the weight of the liver.

1086
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:10,579
Yes, sir.

1087
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:14,082
Is it going well?

1088
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,418
Do you see multiple varices?

1089
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:20,797
Yes. We have the liver specimen,
but there's another bleed in the stomach.

1090
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:23,175
I see distention.
We're performing a transfusion.

1091
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:26,219
Is the bowel swollen?

1092
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,929
No, the bowel is okay.

1093
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,474
Do the vitals look okay?

1094
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,517
Yes. They're holding up for now,

1095
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,936
but this will be hard.

1096
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,527
Take care
of the portal hypertension first.

1097
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:44,780
What should we do?

1098
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,119
Let's do a portacaval shunt.

1099
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,330
Okay.

1100
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:57,667
We need to fix the IVC.
Satinsky clamp, please.

1101
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:04,466
Get the suture ready.

1102
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,352
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

1103
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,730
There will be less bleeding now.

1104
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,815
Okay.

1105
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,110
Well done, Dr. Jong.
This was difficult surgery.

1106
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,112
Thank you for your kind words.

1107
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,658
We'll connect them now. Please get ready.

1108
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,244
Can I have a large Satinsky clamp?

1109
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:40,460
SATURDAY, JULY 10

1110
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:47,843
I'm on my way now.

1111
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,845
Okay. Her cervix is fully dilated now.

1112
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,639
We'll have her keep pushing
and call you when we move her.

1113
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:58,270
Okay. Kang Seo-ju is Rh-negative,
so I asked you to have the blood ready.

1114
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,729
Is it ready?

1115
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:00,897
Yes.

1116
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,399
All right.

1117
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,522
We'll perform reperfusion now.

1118
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,690
Okay.

1119
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,127
BP is dropping.

1120
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:05,462
Large bulldog clamp.

1121
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:11,301
-Oh, he's blocking it again.
-Sorry?

1122
01:22:11,384 --> 01:22:13,219
He even performed reperfusion,

1123
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,764
but he's blocking it again
because the BP is dropping.

1124
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,350
Can he not do that?

1125
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,559
No, it's not that.

1126
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,146
Just keep watching. I'll explain later.

1127
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:24,189
Okay.

1128
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:29,611
Can we have warm saline again?

1129
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:46,586
Please check. We'll try again.

1130
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,466
Is it okay now?

1131
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:57,013
-It's dropping again.
-Okay. The clamp again, please.

1132
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:25,500
Is it okay now?

1133
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,588
Yes.

1134
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,259
Thank you. We'll connect the arteries now.

1135
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,891
-The microscope can come in now.
-Okay.

1136
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:53,695
SURGERY STATUS

1137
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:56,823
PATIENT NAME: BAE JONG-SEOP

1138
01:23:56,906 --> 01:23:59,868
LEAD SURGEON: LEE IK-JUN

1139
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,787
Ms. Kang Seo-ju is okay now,

1140
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,832
but her contractions
were a bit weak earlier,

1141
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:08,585
so let the doctor know
if the bleeding gets worse.

1142
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:09,961
-Sure.
-Thanks.

1143
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,004
Take it easy.

1144
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,521
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1145
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,625
Doctor, how did it go? He's okay, right?

1146
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,336
My brother made it
through the surgery, right?

1147
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,131
Yes, the surgery went well.

1148
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,092
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank goodness.

1149
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:59,177
It took a while to stop the bleeding,

1150
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,888
and his BP gave us a hard time
while connecting the liver,

1151
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,890
but we managed.

1152
01:25:05,725 --> 01:25:09,854
After connecting the liver, we made sure
that blood was flowing into it.

1153
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,065
We'll move him to the ICU shortly.

1154
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:14,484
He needs absolute rest today,

1155
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:17,654
so we won't wake him up,
which means you can't talk to him.

1156
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:22,325
But you can see him
as soon as he's moved to the ICU.

1157
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:24,494
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Professor.

1158
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,080
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1159
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:28,414
Thank you.

1160
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:14,127
Patient Jang Jong-gil's pupils
are fully dilated.

1161
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,296
There's no voluntary respiration,

1162
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,631
and his motor has dropped to zero.
He's in a coma.

1163
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,341
His BP has dropped to 80 over 60.

1164
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,970
Give him dopamine at once.
Is his family here? Tell them to come up.

1165
01:26:24,053 --> 01:26:25,180
Okay, will do.

1166
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:31,436
I'm afraid to let you know
that he has no pupillary reflexes

1167
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,022
and is completely unresponsive
at the moment.

1168
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:37,150
There's no voluntary respiration,

1169
01:26:38,234 --> 01:26:42,197
so we are suspecting a brain death.

1170
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,242
His blood pressure keeps dropping,

1171
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:51,539
and his condition is rapidly declining,
so we're using vasopressors, but…

1172
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,295
He may not make it through the day.

1173
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:10,725
-No…
-Gosh.

1174
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:12,310
My gosh.

1175
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,274
Gosh, no…

1176
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,746
SEO YOON-HEE, RESIDENT 1

1177
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:32,789
Hi.

1178
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:36,542
Bang Mi-gyeong has surgery on Monday,
but her BP is 160 over 100 now.

1179
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,503
Her head hurts, and her vision is blurry.

1180
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:41,839
The lab results show
that her AST level has gone up to 200,

1181
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,967
and her platelet count
has dropped to 60,000.

1182
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,343
She needs surgery now.

1183
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,053
She's NPO now, right?

1184
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:50,682
Yes. Her BP has been on the rise,
so we've listed her as NPO.

1185
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:54,811
Then call Anesthesiology right away.
Book an OR and let me know.

1186
01:27:54,894 --> 01:27:56,104
I'll come now.

1187
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,272
Got it.

1188
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,337
Did the surgery go well?

1189
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,259
Yes.

1190
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:29,595
How's the patient?

1191
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,265
He's okay.

1192
01:28:36,936 --> 01:28:39,355
I bet he saw the Grim Reaper
a few times though.

1193
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,616
Ik-jun, about Mr. Jang Jong-gil…

1194
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:54,495
We may have to declare him brain-dead.

1195
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:03,713
I don't think
he'll make it through the night.

1196
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:38,873
I'm coming down now.
Seung-chae's mother is there, right?

1197
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,793
Yes, Professor. She's waiting for you.

1198
01:29:42,543 --> 01:29:43,544
All right.

1199
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:52,303
Thank you!

1200
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:53,513
No problem.

1201
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,112
Sir, could you try unfolding two fingers?

1202
01:30:38,015 --> 01:30:40,351
I heard you had to come into work
three times today.

1203
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:42,478
What? Did I?

1204
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:47,567
Well, I have nothing to give you,

1205
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,901
but I have this.

1206
01:30:50,987 --> 01:30:52,113
Here.

1207
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:55,950
Just what I needed. Thanks.

1208
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:02,665
Professor, Ms. Kang Seo-ju apologized.

1209
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,625
What?

1210
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:08,713
She tried her best to wait for you,
but her baby didn't help her.

1211
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,509
She said you can punish her
when you're doing rounds on Monday.

1212
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:17,930
Anyway, drive safely.

1213
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,560
Bye. Get going.

1214
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,187
-Right.
-What?

1215
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,904
Bye!

1216
01:31:35,406 --> 01:31:38,534
Get going. Drive safely.

1217
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:42,747
He's still in critical condition.

1218
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:45,625
But thankfully, he seems
to be regaining consciousness.

1219
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:50,504
He's okay now.

1220
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,175
If he continues to recover like this,

1221
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,718
and if nothing else happens,

1222
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:59,555
his mental status will improve gradually.

1223
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:00,640
Okay.

1224
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:04,101
We're very glad
that he's regaining consciousness.

1225
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,770
He's still sleeping,

1226
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,898
but you can make eye contact with him
when he wakes up.

1227
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:09,941
You can go in.

1228
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:12,109
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

1229
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:17,573
-My gosh.
-Dad!

1230
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:23,788
Dad, can you hear me?
We all came to see you.

1231
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:26,207
-Dad.
-Dad, can you hear me?

1232
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:29,877
Dad, can you see me?
It's me, your youngest daughter!

1233
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:31,128
Can you see me?

1234
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,798
-Dad.
-Open your eyes, Dad.

1235
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:34,799
Dad.

1236
01:32:37,301 --> 01:32:38,386
-Dad.
-Can you hear me?

1237
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,471
Dad, we're here.

1238
01:32:40,554 --> 01:32:43,015
-Dad.
-My gosh.

1239
01:32:44,642 --> 01:32:47,436
-Dad.
-How could this happen…

1240
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,604
Wake up, Dad.

1241
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:49,772
-My gosh!
-Dad.

1242
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:51,649
He woke up!

1243
01:32:52,483 --> 01:32:53,734
-Hey.
-No…

1244
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:57,780
-Don't do this to me.
-Do you recognize me, Dad?

1245
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:59,073
Dad!

1246
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,325
Do you recognize us?

1247
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,953
-Gosh…
-Dad.

1248
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:06,998
The doctor will help you,
so hang in there, okay?

1249
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,583
Dad, can you see us?

1250
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:13,045
-Dad, do you recognize us?
-You can't do this to me.

1251
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,548
You'll be okay, Dad.

1252
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,134
Hang in there, Dad.

1253
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,555
Hey, look.

1254
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:34,817
The surgery for the donor
has already begun.

1255
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,069
They're extracting the organ
at the moment.

1256
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,614
We'll start getting ready now
so we can proceed

1257
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:45,328
with Seung-chae's transplant right away
as soon as the organ arrives.

1258
01:33:46,037 --> 01:33:51,667
I expect that the entire procedure
will take about ten hours.

1259
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:56,630
But Seung-chae has undergone
intestinal surgery multiple times,

1260
01:33:57,214 --> 01:34:00,718
so it could take longer
depending on the severity of adhesions.

1261
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:08,893
This will be
most painful and difficult for Seung-chae.

1262
01:34:09,393 --> 01:34:14,148
Please pray for her
so that she can stay strong.

1263
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:15,900
Okay.

1264
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:22,323
This surgery won't be easy for me either,

1265
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,950
but I will do my very best.

1266
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,379
My gosh…

1267
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:58,317
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1268
01:35:21,215 --> 01:35:25,136
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

1269
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:49,743
Finally! Here it comes.

1270
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:51,454
Here.

1271
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:57,293
Hey, piggies! Count to ten
before you start eating, okay?

1272
01:36:00,337 --> 01:36:01,338
Ten.

1273
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:03,883
Nine.

1274
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:06,635
You're so good. Look at you training them.

1275
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:07,803
Eight.

1276
01:36:09,054 --> 01:36:09,889
Seven.

1277
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:12,308
Six.

1278
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:14,185
Hey, this is your place.

1279
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:15,728
-Why did I cook this?
-Five.

1280
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:17,855
-Four.
-You offered. That's why.

1281
01:36:17,938 --> 01:36:19,356
-Three.
-I did?

1282
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,317
Two, one. Go!

1283
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:31,202
I have something to tell you guys.

1284
01:36:31,785 --> 01:36:32,620
Say it.

1285
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,874
The piggies will be shocked,
so I'll tell you after we eat.

1286
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,251
What is it? You're making me nervous.

1287
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:41,212
Nothing too important.

1288
01:36:49,428 --> 01:36:51,388
All of a sudden? When?

1289
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,895
I'll keep working
until the end of the year

1290
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:00,439
but will leave
at the beginning of next year.

1291
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:06,612
Professor Lee Ji-yeong
will return next year,

1292
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:08,822
and the chief has already approved it.

1293
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,200
The director has approved it too.

1294
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:14,745
It's just for a year. Just one year.

1295
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:16,539
What about your mom?

1296
01:37:16,622 --> 01:37:19,250
She's okay with it too.

1297
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:24,755
She said there must be a reason
her 42-year-old son

1298
01:37:24,838 --> 01:37:28,676
suddenly wants to go to the US to study
and gave me permission right away.

1299
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:32,596
Are you going alone?

1300
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:37,351
No, with Gyeo-ul. She'll come with me.

1301
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:39,186
For a year?

1302
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:44,191
Yes, just for a year.

1303
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:49,697
I want to study
small bowel transplantation more in depth.

1304
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:53,033
You can do it here too, you know.

1305
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:57,746
The hospital there will let me
participate in their research and surgery.

1306
01:37:59,915 --> 01:38:02,042
I may never get
another opportunity like this.

1307
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,635
If I don't go,

1308
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,763
I'll regret it later on.

1309
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:22,396
Jeong-won, then…

1310
01:38:23,188 --> 01:38:24,815
Then who will play the drums?

1311
01:38:24,898 --> 01:38:28,527
I'm not leaving yet.
I'll be here until the end of the year.

1312
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,112
Then after you leave,

1313
01:38:30,195 --> 01:38:33,657
can we reach out
to our big sister for help? I mean, Rosa.

1314
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:37,077
Sure.

1315
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:41,832
My mom has a good sense of rhythm,
so she'll learn to play the drums quickly.

1316
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:45,711
We've all been busy,

1317
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:50,299
so we can't even get together like this
once a month these days,

1318
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:53,135
which means

1319
01:38:54,053 --> 01:38:56,889
we can only practice together
a few more times.

1320
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:14,990
Don't be such a downer.

1321
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:20,954
I hope it all goes well.
A year will fly by in no time.

1322
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:23,248
I told you. I'm not leaving yet.

1323
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:30,381
I shouldn't have told you guys so soon.

1324
01:39:32,424 --> 01:39:36,261
Hey, it's already 10 p.m.
Are we not going to practice?

1325
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,640
I picked the song for today.

1326
01:39:39,723 --> 01:39:40,891
I know.

1327
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:43,102
Let's do it.

1328
01:39:44,353 --> 01:39:45,437
But why do I…

1329
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,608
get the feeling

1330
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:52,820
that this will be our last jam session?

1331
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,951
Let's do it.

1332
01:39:59,034 --> 01:40:00,035
All right.

1333
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:02,746
Okay!

1334
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:28,063
The foolish world doesn't know you

1335
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:32,359
It can't see you
When you're hidden in regret

1336
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:36,780
But I know you
And I see you

1337
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:41,076
You and your splendid wings

1338
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,164
Don't be afraid
You can do it

1339
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:49,793
With a little wiggle

1340
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:53,964
Spread your wings and fly up

1341
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:59,011
Fly up to the sky

1342
01:40:59,094 --> 01:41:05,726
You shine like the sun

1343
01:41:07,853 --> 01:41:14,777
Though that world
Cruelly stands in your way

1344
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:19,323
Oh, shining one

1345
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:23,827
I love you

1346
01:41:24,661 --> 01:41:31,460
Fly away so the world can see you

1347
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:47,226
Yes, hello?

1348
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:48,644
Is this Mr. Do Jae-hak?

1349
01:41:48,727 --> 01:41:49,937
Yes, who's this?

1350
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:53,398
This is Assistant Inspector Kim Dong-ik
from Gangnam Police Station.

1351
01:41:53,482 --> 01:41:55,442
You filed charges
against Mr. Park Hwan-gyu

1352
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,152
regarding a rental scam in 2019.

1353
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:58,362
Yes. What about it?

1354
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:01,448
I'm contacting you
because I'm in charge of the case now.

1355
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:04,952
We recently arrested Mr. Park Hwan-gyu
and are investigating the case now.

1356
01:42:05,577 --> 01:42:08,997
I called to let you know that
he wishes to settle the case with you.

1357
01:42:09,081 --> 01:42:13,085
May I give him your contact info
if you're interested in settling the case?

1358
01:42:13,168 --> 01:42:14,461
Well…

1359
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:21,969
Du-na, I thought you'd stay here forever.

1360
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:27,182
I'm happy to go home.

1361
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,563
You got a phone?
Do you use a cell phone now?

1362
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:36,817
Just for texting.

1363
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:41,154
My mom bought it for me.

1364
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:44,992
Where is she?
Taking care of the discharge process?

1365
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:48,287
I don't know.

1366
01:42:49,454 --> 01:42:51,498
She's been

1367
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:54,793
in the bathroom for a while.

1368
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:09,057
MOM, I'M SORRY I TOOK IT OUT ON YOU
LOVE YOU, MOM, AND THANK YOU

1369
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:13,562
Mom, I'm sorry I took it out on you.

1370
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:16,315
Love you, Mom.

1371
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:17,566
And thank you.

1372
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:26,408
Next is…

1373
01:43:27,951 --> 01:43:30,954
It's Ms. Kim Su-jeong
according to the chart.

1374
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,539
Yes, it's her.

1375
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,419
-Hello, Professor Yang.
-Hello.

1376
01:43:37,502 --> 01:43:38,503
Hello.

1377
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:43,884
How have you been?

1378
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:45,510
Pretty good.

1379
01:43:48,722 --> 01:43:52,225
It looks like you have
some good news for me.

1380
01:44:00,233 --> 01:44:01,318
Well…

1381
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:05,072
Another baby angel came to me.

1382
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:18,961
Please keep my baby safe again.
You will, right?

1383
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,616
What is it? Did something happen?

1384
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:39,624
I met the rental scammer's family.

1385
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,881
The family of that scumbag
who scammed me two years ago.

1386
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,304
Why did you meet them?

1387
01:45:53,096 --> 01:45:54,556
That fraudster

1388
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,517
got caught while pulling another scam.

1389
01:46:01,104 --> 01:46:03,231
Now, he's scared
that he'd get a jail sentence…

1390
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:07,110
and wants to settle with me.

1391
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:13,825
With that,
he can be released on probation…

1392
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:17,079
so I settled with him.

1393
01:46:18,789 --> 01:46:21,792
What? That's not important.
Did you get your money back?

1394
01:47:00,705 --> 01:47:01,832
I…

1395
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:04,584
I did.

1396
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:06,419
I got my money back.

1397
01:47:23,728 --> 01:47:27,899
Even when you're in pain
Like a drooping flower

1398
01:47:27,983 --> 01:47:32,112
Even when you feel dejected
Like a fallen tree

1399
01:47:32,195 --> 01:47:35,949
I believe in you
And you believe in me

1400
01:47:36,032 --> 01:47:40,537
We believe in each other

1401
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:44,583
Listen to your heart

1402
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:49,129
You tried so hard

1403
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:53,508
Spread your wings and fly up

1404
01:47:53,592 --> 01:47:58,180
Fly up to the sky

1405
01:47:58,263 --> 01:48:05,270
-You're breathtakingly beautiful
-You're breathtakingly beautiful

1406
01:48:06,855 --> 01:48:09,608
-Even if the world
-Even if the world

1407
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:14,279
-Coldly turns its back on you
-Coldly turns its back on you

1408
01:48:14,362 --> 01:48:18,450
-You're dazzling
-You're dazzling

1409
01:48:18,533 --> 01:48:23,955
-I love you
-I love you

1410
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:29,836
-Fly away so the world can see you
-Fly away so the world can see you

1411
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:35,800
-You shine like the sun
-You shine like the sun

1412
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:39,846
-Though that world
-Though that world

1413
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:44,726
-Cruelly stands in your way
-Cruelly stands in your way

1414
01:48:44,809 --> 01:48:48,730
Oh, shining one

1415
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:54,236
I love you

1416
01:48:54,319 --> 01:49:01,243
-Fly away so the world can see you
-Fly away so the world can see you

1417
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:11,813
STRIVE FOR TRANSPARENCY
AND MILITARY EXCELLENCY

1418
01:50:16,484 --> 01:50:17,902
What brings you here?

1419
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,285
Don't tell me…

1420
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:29,205
you're here

1421
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:31,374
to see me.

1422
01:50:33,335 --> 01:50:34,377
No, I'm not.

1423
01:50:39,924 --> 01:50:41,176
I'm here for jjajangmyeon.

1424
01:50:44,179 --> 01:50:45,638
For ganjjajang.

1425
01:51:35,271 --> 01:51:38,274
Did U-ju go camping again
with Mo-ne and her dad?

1426
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:39,359
Yes.

1427
01:51:39,901 --> 01:51:42,112
Mr. Jang just knows how to entertain them.

1428
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:44,239
Last week, they played
a character quiz game.

1429
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:47,075
I want to tag along.

1430
01:51:48,243 --> 01:51:49,744
Let's tag along next time.

1431
01:51:49,828 --> 01:51:50,829
Sure.

1432
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,920
Hey, aren't you due for a breast exam?

1433
01:52:00,004 --> 01:52:01,131
Yes, it's next week.

1434
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:05,760
And your mom's neurology appointment?

1435
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:07,637
It's in two weeks.

1436
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,144
You're sleepy, aren't you?

1437
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:17,730
Yes, I'm about to fall asleep.

1438
01:53:33,765 --> 01:53:36,684
4 MONTHS LATER

1439
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:47,487
Professor Yang!

1440
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:03,253
Dr. Do, you can come in now.

1441
01:54:03,336 --> 01:54:04,379
Okay.

1442
01:54:16,349 --> 01:54:17,976
You're almost there.

1443
01:54:18,059 --> 01:54:21,813
Hold your breath and push once more,
then the baby will be out.

1444
01:54:21,896 --> 01:54:25,525
-Okay.
-One, two, three. Push!

1445
01:55:12,238 --> 01:55:14,324
Hi, baby.

1446
01:55:18,703 --> 01:55:21,247
The baby's crying just fine.
Everything looks good.

1447
01:55:21,873 --> 01:55:23,875
We can move her
to the newborn nursery now.

1448
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:26,628
Did you hear that?

1449
01:55:26,711 --> 01:55:31,215
She's healthy, so the pediatrician said
we can move her to the nursery now.

1450
01:55:32,759 --> 01:55:33,843
You did great.

1451
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:36,262
Your baby is healthy.

1452
01:55:36,763 --> 01:55:39,474
Yes, thank you.

1453
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:42,477
Thank you.

1454
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:46,022
I'll be a good mother.

1455
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:50,485
You did so well.

1456
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,445
You did it, honey.

1457
01:55:54,739 --> 01:55:55,823
I love you.

1458
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:05,917
I love you.

1459
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:21,099
My gosh, congratulations.
How's your wife? I see.

1460
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:22,475
Who does the baby resemble?

1461
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:24,227
Yes.

1462
01:56:24,727 --> 01:56:26,938
Thank goodness she takes after your wife.

1463
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:30,858
I won't call you today,
so just stay glued to your wife.

1464
01:56:31,943 --> 01:56:34,070
I know how stressed
and worried you've been.

1465
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,490
Jae-hak.

1466
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:43,037
I have no idea what you're saying now.
Call me again when you're done crying.

1467
01:56:45,873 --> 01:56:48,251
When is his wife's surgery, then?

1468
01:56:48,334 --> 01:56:49,961
The chemotherapy is done, right?

1469
01:56:50,044 --> 01:56:52,463
Her surgery will be
as soon as she recovers.

1470
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:54,507
And her final chemo session was last week.

1471
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:57,635
Thankfully,
the tumor responded very well to it,

1472
01:56:57,719 --> 01:56:59,262
so she can barely feel it now.

1473
01:57:00,304 --> 01:57:03,516
I heard tumors that respond well to chemo
have a good prognosis.

1474
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:05,810
That's such great news. My gosh.

1475
01:57:06,477 --> 01:57:09,939
It's the most exciting news
I've heard this year.

1476
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:13,067
Same here. When Jae-hak told me,

1477
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:15,111
I teared up.

1478
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:23,870
Well, the blood work looks good.

1479
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:25,830
So does her abdominal X-ray.

1480
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:27,540
And she's gained a lot of weight.

1481
01:57:28,249 --> 01:57:30,877
Does she ever get stomachaches
or diarrhea at home?

1482
01:57:31,502 --> 01:57:35,715
Not at all.
No stomachaches or loose stools.

1483
01:57:35,798 --> 01:57:39,343
And she's been emptying her bowels
three times a day.

1484
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:43,639
Everything looks great.

1485
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:47,935
Seung-chae, am I not getting one today?

1486
01:57:53,274 --> 01:57:54,525
Can I have one?

1487
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,656
You can eat this now thanks to me.

1488
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:02,200
No.

1489
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:03,618
It's true.

1490
01:58:03,701 --> 01:58:05,078
No, it's not.

1491
01:58:17,465 --> 01:58:20,885
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1492
01:58:32,688 --> 01:58:34,649
What is it? What are you looking at?

1493
01:58:35,858 --> 01:58:38,402
The sky. Isn't it so beautiful?

1494
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,073
It is, indeed.

1495
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,035
What are you looking at?

1496
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:48,955
The sky looks so pretty today.

1497
01:58:49,038 --> 01:58:51,165
It was like this yesterday too.
I see this often.

1498
01:58:51,249 --> 01:58:53,292
Thanks for telling us.

1499
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:57,338
When I was young,
I loved watching the sunrise.

1500
01:58:59,006 --> 01:59:02,468
But for some reason,
I now love when the sun sets.

1501
01:59:05,346 --> 01:59:06,681
Do you know why?

1502
01:59:12,103 --> 01:59:13,437
Because it's time to go home.

1503
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:21,779
You can call it a day and go home.
That's why you like it.

1504
02:01:14,934 --> 02:01:19,689
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING HOSPITAL PLAYLIST

1505
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:25,444
