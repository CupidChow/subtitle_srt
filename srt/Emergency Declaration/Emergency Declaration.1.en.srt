1
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:20,873
IF AN AIRCRAFT CANNOT FLY SAFELY
DUE TO LACK OF FUEL OR OTHER PROBLEMS

2
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:26,962
THE PILOT MAKES A DECLARATION
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

3
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:36,680
THIS PLANE THEN HAS FIRST PRIORITY TO LAND
BEFORE ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT.

4
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:46,440
IN THE WORLD OF AVIATION,
IT IS LIKE PROCLAIMING MARTIAL LAW.

5
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,692
ALL ELSE CEASES,

6
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,696
AND THE PLANE'S NEEDS
SUPPLANT ANY OTHER ORDER.

7
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:14,801
EMERGENCY DECLARATION

8
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,813
We'll probably have to circle
a couple times before landing.

9
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,774
Yes, traffic looks heavy.

10
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,866
What? Someone you know?

11
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,910
No.

12
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,762
Which plane will have a lot of people
on it?

13
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,805
Excuse me?

14
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,433
It's summer, so maybe vacation spots?

15
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,269
Do many people fly to Southeast Asia?

16
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,814
What's your destination, sir?

17
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,568
I want someplace far away,
where a lot of people go.

18
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,320
What?

19
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,197
Nothing, sir.

20
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,869
How many people are on that 1:40 flight?

21
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,582
We're not authorized to give out
that information.

22
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,085
I'm just asking how many people.

23
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,214
Why do you ask?

24
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,634
I'm just curious. Is there a problem?

25
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:43,432
No, it's just it might inconvenience
other passengers--

26
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,100
Inconvenience them? How?

27
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,729
What I mean is,

28
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:53,358
we're not allowed to reveal
passengers' personal data.

29
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,655
Hey.

30
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,615
Yes?

31
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,992
For god's sake, don't smile like that.

32
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,828
You look like a whore.

33
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,549
What loud get-together are they doing now?

34
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,386
It's not that loud.

35
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,097
It's community spirit.

36
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,976
When it finishes, go get some meat.

37
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,646
Meat? Just eat ox bone soup.

38
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,023
Ox bone soup? Where?

39
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,191
Did Mom go somewhere?

40
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,654
On vacation, of course!
She's going without you.

41
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,447
You always cancel.

42
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,115
Do you hate vacations or something?

43
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,325
Of course not.

44
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,161
Why wouldn't I want to go?

45
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:47,913
When will she be back?

46
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,208
When the soup's gone!
I'm sick of it already.

47
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,965
Gosh.

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,592
This is two weeks' worth!

49
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,056
Scratching again?
You need to stop yourself.

50
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,100
- I know.
- Wait a second.

51
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,810
I'll put on some ointment.

52
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,771
Can I go to the restroom?

53
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,982
The restroom?

54
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,780
Sure, let's go.

55
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,325
We've been waiting so long.
I'll go myself.

56
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,077
Will you?

57
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sky Korea will begin boarding shortly.

58
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,839
Bring your own mirror!

59
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,221
You will be boarding at Gate One.

60
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,879
Why don't you answer your phone?

61
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,174
I've got things to do at the airport, why?

62
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,970
Is it my fault I can't go?
Something came up at work.

63
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:29,515
That's what always happens!

64
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,101
Always? It was just this one time.

65
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,770
And the last time.

66
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,940
Whatever.
Did you put the soup in the fridge?

67
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,319
Of course, after you went to that trouble.

68
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,739
As soon as it cooled,
I divided it into portions.

69
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,783
It's 15 days' worth!

70
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,745
Don't order delivery! I'm busy, bye!

71
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,915
What a woman.

72
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:59,002
Why does she always pick blue?

73
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,469
Hello?

74
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,850
Soo-min!

75
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,270
Soo-min.

76
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,232
- Dad!
- Why are you in here?

77
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,234
I was so worried.

78
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,862
What happened?

79
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,281
Was there a line in the women's restroom?

80
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,533
Thank goodness.

81
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,205
Why so early, after working last night?

82
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,372
You should sleep.

83
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,375
A fight in my precinct,
had to cancel my vacation.

84
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,962
Who gave us the watermelon?
Everyone's eating it.

85
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,798
Two weeks of ox bone soup for me.

86
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:30,093
Why should we go? You got the call.

87
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,931
And you're closer! Oh, whatever.

88
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
What is it?

89
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,354
A bunch of school kids reported something.

90
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,731
The head office wants us to check it out.

91
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,066
What'd they report?

92
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:48,445
Some idiot uploaded a video
threatening to attack a plane.

93
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,989
The kids think it's their neighbor.

94
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,950
Attack a plane?

95
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,702
Yeah. Today, he says.

96
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,080
Today?

97
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,001
Thank you.

98
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
Why's he talking in English?

99
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,774
He didn't say which plane?

100
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:28,569
No mention of which plane.

101
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:32,322
He's just saying he'll attack a plane.

102
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:38,704
You understood that?

103
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:42,958
Such long sentences.
Is there someone we can ask?

104
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:47,421
In English they all speak long sentences.
It's advanced English.

105
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,423
I understood everything!

106
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,466
It's just a prank.

107
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,052
Who would announce it on the internet?

108
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,305
And you think it's easy to attack a plane?

109
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,141
With all the security
and checking they do.

110
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,769
It's not far from here,

111
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:03,937
- right?
- Huh?

112
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,983
Might as well stop by.

113
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,486
- I'll go myself.
- Sergeant, I'm sure it's just a prank!

114
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,325
I know, I just feel like taking a walk.

115
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,285
You're really going?

116
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,496
Hey, where did Mom say she was going?

117
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,290
I'm in class. Bye.

118
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,125
Hey! Min-jung!

119
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,045
Bear it a bit longer.

120
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:35,093
The air is so clean there,
this will clear up really fast.

121
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,513
How old are you? What a cute girl.

122
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,056
Jesus.

123
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,725
- Going on vacation?
- What?

124
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,438
I don't see her mom. Do you have a wife?

125
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,567
Where are you flying to?

126
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,031
Ah, Hawaii.

127
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,866
Let's go, Soo-min.

128
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,786
You're divorced, aren't you?

129
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,373
Do you know me?

130
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,457
No.

131
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,918
Then why stick your nose in our business?

132
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,670
I'm just asking. Why?

133
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,922
Why do you think?

134
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:16,593
Grilling me about my wife.
Why do you care?

135
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,311
What did the kid say?

136
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,313
What is your damn problem?

137
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,648
She said something about me.

138
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,484
Are you insane? Leave us alone!

139
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,319
Damned freak.

140
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,835
This video, it's advanced English,
and you can't see his face.

141
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,505
If you kids are just pulling a prank,

142
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,592
then those four dollars ice creams,

143
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,011
Haagen-Dazs.

144
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,973
I'll make you pay me back for those.

145
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:06,143
It's him! I recognized him right away.

146
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,812
If you turn up the screen's brightness,
you can see.

147
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,113
High-level English?
It's elementary school level.

148
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,871
A rich neighborhood like this,
the kids get advanced instruction.

149
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,916
Anything else strange about this guy?

150
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,335
Was there? I don't think so.

151
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,671
Last time he put his garbage
by someone else's home.

152
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,507
So there was a big fight.

153
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:41,678
A prank, right?

154
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:49,394
Sarge, let's go back.
You've had your walk.

155
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,188
These apartments may look old,

156
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,983
but given the neighborhood,
a single unit costs four million dollars.

157
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,403
If we get reported
for breaking and entering,

158
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,531
You know what rich people are like.

159
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,749
What's that smell?

160
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,211
Trash.
Our home smells like that sometimes, too.

161
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,088
- Let's go.
- You want to go in?

162
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,090
No.

163
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,019
Oh my, your door is open.

164
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:33,939
Hello?

165
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,568
When would you like the return flight
from Hawaii?

166
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,821
I'll just take the flight there. One way.

167
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,707
What's this?

168
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,350
For my asthma.

169
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,770
You can go.

170
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,882
The weather looks bad from Japan on.

171
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,220
Yes, the turbulence could be strong.

172
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,472
We'll carry some extra fuel.

173
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,225
And I'll do my best to avoid turbulence,

174
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:37,312
but if we hit a rough patch,
I'll signal twice and announce it.

175
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,064
Yes, thank you.

176
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,972
Let me check your seat.

177
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,642
Here. Take a seat.

178
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,438
Welcome on board.

179
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,108
Excuse me.

180
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,925
- What did you want?
- Where did Mom go?

181
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,468
Hawaii.

182
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,220
Wait up!

183
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,108
Let me check your ticket.

184
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,486
This way, please.

185
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,571
- Welcome.
- We almost missed the flight.

186
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,822
- Sorry!
- That's okay.

187
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,491
It's down this aisle.

188
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,180
All 121 passengers are now on board.
We'll close the door.

189
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,476
You can close the door now.
Thanks for your help.

190
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,988
- Fasten seatbelts, please.
- We'll be taking off soon.

191
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,073
Fasten your seatbelts.

192
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:52,818
Here's a tranquilizer.

193
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,488
Why didn't you send Yun-cheol in instead?

194
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,866
I told him to, but he refused.

195
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,659
I thought my heart had stopped.

196
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,244
- Sergeant!
- What?

197
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,537
Something's odd.

198
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,749
We'll need an autopsy,
but there's a skull fracture.

199
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,084
Lots of bleeding, too.

200
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,129
Is that what killed him?

201
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,715
What's strange is,

202
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,217
that doesn't seem to be
the cause of death.

203
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:22,097
Given the burst capillaries
and coughed up blood...

204
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:23,640
What's that?

205
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,685
It looks like poison.

206
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:33,066
Yun-cheol, you put him on the wanted list?

207
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,276
Yes.

208
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,611
Hey, Sergeant.

209
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,196
What?

210
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,906
I think you'd better look at this.

211
00:20:54,046 --> 00:20:56,548
I'll go get some rest.

212
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,342
Sure, rest up.

213
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,142
I want to try that.

214
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,188
Isn't this pretty? Look.

215
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,023
Wow, that's pretty.

216
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,111
Excuse me, sir.
I'm the chief flight attendant.

217
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,490
You've been drinking a lot, are you okay?

218
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,408
I'm fine, just give me more.

219
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,160
Would you like a cool beverage?

220
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,328
No, some alcohol.

221
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:30,958
Sorry, but our regulations prohibit
the amount of alcohol--

222
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,543
My dad's scared of flying.

223
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,002
Soo-min!

224
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:36,755
That's why he's drinking. He's scared.

225
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,592
Don't be ridiculous.
Adults aren't scared of flying.

226
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,313
Shall I bring what you've been having?

227
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,317
Should I stop?

228
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,029
I'll be fine.

229
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,074
Very well.

230
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,012
That's poison?

231
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:12,226
No, it looks contagious.

232
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,520
Contagious?

233
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,564
The rats that don't touch the powder
are dying, too.

234
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:19,274
Burst veins, internal bleeding...

235
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,527
Looks like a virus.

236
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:28,492
A virus can't last long in a solution.

237
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,827
So it's bred in a culture,

238
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,082
and then frozen in powder form.

239
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:37,459
You got the test kit?

240
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,761
The time keeps getting shorter.

241
00:23:48,262 --> 00:23:49,680
Getting shorter?

242
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:55,644
He's measuring
how long it takes the virus to propagate.

243
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:59,231
Trying to shorten the incubation period.

244
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,109
What for?

245
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,486
Why shorten the incubation period?

246
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,001
Sergeant!

247
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,171
He tests positive.

248
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,507
He was killed by the virus.

249
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,776
Going to the restroom?

250
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,447
Are you?

251
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,077
Are you scared of me?

252
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,830
I'm not a bad person.

253
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:01,710
Go ahead.

254
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,513
I'm sorry, it's really urgent!

255
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,226
Wow, you're a lucky kid.

256
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,703
Call me as soon as you find anything.

257
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:39,873
Got his location?

258
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,792
Did he board a plane?

259
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,462
This guy has no cell phone,
no credit cards.

260
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:46,547
We can't trace him.

261
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,174
Let's go to the immigration office.
How long will it take?

262
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:55,806
What is this?

263
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,643
What the hell?

264
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,275
- Do you have a pen?
- Hey!

265
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,151
- Can I borrow one?
- I'll bring you one, sir.

266
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,028
- Yes?
- The restroom there...

267
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,990
There was someone in business,
so I went to economy,

268
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,742
but something's falling from the ceiling!

269
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,328
How cheap can you get?

270
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:21,999
My apologies, sir.
I'll check it immediately.

271
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,793
So why'd you go to economy?

272
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:27,379
The one here was occupied.

273
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,423
Stop brushing off.

274
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,616
- Why won't she answer?
- The phone is powered off.

275
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,952
Please tell me he's not flying to Hawaii.

276
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,412
What about Hawaii?

277
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,539
The light's green. Go.

278
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:30,067
What's that?

279
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,151
What?

280
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,403
It's the airline's wi-fi.

281
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:35,906
You need a credit card,
nine dollars an hour.

282
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:39,535
Crazy expensive, and super slow.
Such a rip-off.

283
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:42,579
I mean this video. What is it?

284
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:50,128
My friend sent me this,
trying to freak me out.

285
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:53,340
This guy's threatening a terrorist attack
on a plane.

286
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:55,467
Can I take a look?

287
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,344
- What?
- Let me see.

288
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,470
Sure.

289
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,148
I'm sure it's a prank.

290
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,236
Where did Soo-min go?

291
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:20,742
Soo-min?

292
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,288
Soo-min, why are you here?

293
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,456
What's wrong?

294
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,001
What happened?

295
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,510
- It's too dark to see.
- I'm sure it's him!

296
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,472
Imagine him in a suit. It's identical!

297
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,562
He smuggled something onto the plane
in his armpit.

298
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:51,607
I don't think it's an explosive.

299
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,360
But it could be a weapon.

300
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,279
Like a small knife.

301
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:00,657
You know what he told my daughter?

302
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,076
Tell her. What did the man say?

303
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,788
It's okay, Soo-min. You can tell her.

304
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:13,545
What did that man say?

305
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:20,052
That everyone here

306
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,138
is going to die.

307
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,200
Excuse me, sir.

308
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:44,743
Yes?

309
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:49,623
I'm sorry,
but can I see your ID or business card?

310
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,291
Why all of a sudden?

311
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:57,714
A passenger claimed
you said something improper to her.

312
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:00,467
What did I say?

313
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:09,101
Ah.

314
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,155
He's a scientist.

315
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,490
A scientist?

316
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,159
He says
he's attending a conference in Hawaii,

317
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,121
and denies saying anything.

318
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,665
But your daughter
doesn't seem to be lying.

319
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:36,587
We'll keep a close eye on him.
Try not to worry.

320
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:53,145
Si-young, that steak in the oven,
can you take it out?

321
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,730
Sure.

322
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:59,610
That's for the copilot,
and seaweed soup for the pilot.

323
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,862
He doesn't eat meat.

324
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,488
Right.

325
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:17,711
- I brought your meals.
- Thanks.

326
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:21,340
Seaweed soup for you, Captain,
and steak for the copilot.

327
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:24,510
- Thank you.
- Huh? I want steak, too!

328
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,136
But you don't eat meat.

329
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,181
That's when I was taking herbal medicine.

330
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:32,392
Nearly drove me crazy.

331
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:36,897
I'm always catching colds,
and they last forever.

332
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:38,649
- I'll bring you steak, then.
- Thanks.

333
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,318
No, don't bother.
You take this, I'll have soup.

334
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,445
- Here you go.
- It's no problem to change it.

335
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,405
No need for that.

336
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,658
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

337
00:31:49,368 --> 00:31:50,369
Oh, my.

338
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:56,208
How many hours will you fly this month?

339
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:02,965
He boarded a flight. Ryu Jin-seok.

340
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,635
- Not someone with the same name?
- The ID numbers match.

341
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,095
Where...

342
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:11,849
Where's it going? Which flight?

343
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:16,687
KI501. To Honolulu.

344
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:20,941
Oh, thank god!

345
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,318
It's okay.

346
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,327
Wait, Honolulu is... in Hawaii?

347
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:36,206
- What?
- It's Hawaii, right?

348
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:42,546
- Jung Hye-yoon.
- Why are you going on about Hawaii?

349
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:43,672
What?

350
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:45,799
What is it?

351
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,009
Well...

352
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,385
What's wrong?

353
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,265
So, can you turn back the flight?

354
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,851
You're the airline.

355
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,562
You can do it, right?

356
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,230
Let go of me! What do you know?

357
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:02,858
We're police officers.

358
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:07,154
No, it'll be best just to grab him.
Grab him on the plane. Okay?

359
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,323
Listen up! Tell the security guard--

360
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,117
There's no guard, it's not a bank.

361
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,661
Why no security guard?

362
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,206
Airplanes don't have them.

363
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,958
You should've followed through
on your swing last time.

364
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:23,086
I'm telling you, I did.

365
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:27,341
Why do you keep scratching yourself?

366
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,219
What is this? Why's it so itchy?

367
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,471
And I've got the chills.

368
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,014
Did you eat something rotten?

369
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,767
What did you eat this time?

370
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,733
You've got no evidence,
if you keep on like this--

371
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:48,612
A man with a body in his home
made a terror threat!

372
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,782
If we start a scene in the plane,
passengers could get hurt--

373
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,326
This is much more serious than that!

374
00:33:54,785 --> 00:33:57,746
Seeing that video...

375
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:03,043
This is no ordinary criminal.

376
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:04,127
You know about viruses?

377
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:05,504
- Yes.
- Biological terror.

378
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:06,839
That's what this is.

379
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:09,508
If we don't move fast, it'll be too late.

380
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,636
If you're not convinced,
I'll take full responsibility.

381
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,180
So before it's too late...

382
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,935
I can't believe this.

383
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,777
Blood?

384
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,538
My eye!

385
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:41,123
Help!

386
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:42,875
Over here!

387
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,004
Doctor! Is there a doctor?

388
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,255
Doctor!

389
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:51,175
- Pil-ho!
- Are you okay?

390
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:52,551
- Hey!
- What's going on?

391
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,720
Is there a doctor?

392
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,222
Help.

393
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,224
Is there a doctor?

394
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,269
Any doctor here?

395
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:03,353
A doctor...

396
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,565
A doctor... Any doctor here?

397
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:08,025
A doctor?

398
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:15,532
- Oh my...
- Pil-ho!

399
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:16,658
Stewardess!

400
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,623
Wait, I'm a doctor.

401
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:37,179
He's dead.

402
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:39,181
- What?
- No.

403
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:43,977
Excuse me.

404
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,622
What's this? A terror attack?

405
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:05,165
Is the satellite phone working?

406
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,417
It must be down, if they sent it as text.

407
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:08,752
Check it.

408
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,258
Where are you going?

409
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,178
Here it is, Ryu Jin-seok.

410
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,639
- I'll go check.
- Okay.

411
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,266
I said where are you going?

412
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,479
- You did this, right?
- What did I do? Asshole.

413
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,189
It was you, bastard!

414
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:31,567
Let go of me!

415
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:37,656
A male passenger in section 36 Charlie
has died.

416
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,133
You did something, right?

417
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,261
You hid something in your armpit.

418
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:01,096
What are you doing?

419
00:37:02,556 --> 00:37:03,640
Look!

420
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,268
What's this?

421
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,895
What did you hide here?

422
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:13,317
You said you'd kill everyone!

423
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:15,527
You freak!

424
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,279
What's going on here?

425
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,990
You need to catch him!

426
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,293
Mr. Ryu Jin-seok, right?

427
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:40,260
Date of birth, December 1, 1985?

428
00:37:44,431 --> 00:37:46,517
Sorry, but can I see an ID?

429
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:52,189
You're Ryu Jin-seok! You speak Korean!

430
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,982
What?

431
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,863
- Shit!
- Grab him!

432
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,866
Grab him!

433
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:08,163
Soo-min, look out!

434
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,415
Soo-min, it's okay.

435
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,841
Grab his hand!

436
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,885
Help me!

437
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,686
Help!

438
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:18,692
Over here!

439
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,070
Something just came! It's from the plane?

440
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:25,908
Ryu Jin-seok has been isolated,
but one passenger has died.

441
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,205
A man in his 40s,
coughing up blood and covered in blisters.

442
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,041
Sergeant, are you okay?

443
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:38,128
Get something sweet like chocolate.

444
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:39,213
I'm okay.

445
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,050
Excuse me!

446
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,135
Via technical exchanges,

447
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,598
Korean firms can obtain
C-ITS certification...

448
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:54,853
C-IS...
Why can't I memorize anything today?

449
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,730
Did I make it too difficult?

450
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,440
No, these terms...

451
00:39:58,524 --> 00:39:59,608
Minister Kim!

452
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,739
We are currently gathering
more information.

453
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,450
Please don't be alarmed,
and wait in your seats.

454
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:09,785
We'll be fine, right?

455
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,120
Sure, it'll be okay.

456
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:13,580
Let's get some sleep.

457
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,374
He was sprinkling something.

458
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:17,626
What? It wasn't a knife?

459
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:20,921
- Was it a knife?
- Was anybody hurt?

460
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,256
They said not.

461
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:25,342
Only a few hours left, we'll be fine.

462
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:32,724
Hey!

463
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:33,934
Sorry.

464
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,604
Long time no see.

465
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,147
Right.

466
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,568
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

467
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:45,612
No.

468
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:53,287
Did that guy carry out some terror attack?

469
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,956
He threatened to.

470
00:41:01,545 --> 00:41:05,424
He's suspected of murder, too,
so we've detained him for now.

471
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:08,760
I knew
there was something weird about him.

472
00:41:08,844 --> 00:41:11,221
From the first time I saw him.

473
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,639
I saw you before.

474
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,602
At the airport.

475
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:22,107
I wasn't sure,
but I never knew you were on this plane.

476
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:25,235
Oh, really? I didn't see you.

477
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:27,487
- Why didn't--
- I hoped I was wrong.

478
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,242
Because I never wanted to see you again.

479
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:42,336
It was in here.

480
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:49,468
The man who died said
that powder was falling on his head.

481
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,762
- Powder?
- Yes.

482
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,806
Want to cover your mouth?
So you don't catch a cold.

483
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,411
They look high-ranking.

484
00:42:59,913 --> 00:43:01,331
She's arriving now.

485
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,710
We set up an operations team
at the airline.

486
00:43:04,793 --> 00:43:06,295
I'll call you back.

487
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:13,468
Thank you.

488
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:14,595
What's the situation?

489
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,805
The copilot is keeping us updated.

490
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,933
For now, apart from the one fatality,
everything is calm.

491
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:23,187
What a nightmare.
Shouldn't the plane turn back?

492
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,897
We're discussing it,

493
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,358
but it seems urgent
to get them off that plane,

494
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:31,069
so we're talking to the US
about finding a nearby airport.

495
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:33,405
Since there's never been
a bioterror attack in a plane before--

496
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:36,867
Shouldn't we call a press conference?

497
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,579
Once things become clearer.
Let's analyze the situation first.

498
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,832
I'm Park Tae-su from the President's
Crisis Management Center.

499
00:43:44,541 --> 00:43:45,626
Okay.

500
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,547
Why don't you come back?

501
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:53,800
- Something strange is going on.
- What?

502
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:56,845
The suspect spread something
in the restroom and cabin,

503
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:59,598
then an exposed passenger died,

504
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,227
and many passengers have started coughing.

505
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:07,231
I also went inside the restroom,
so I'm calling, just in case.

506
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:09,733
You feel okay?

507
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:14,446
I'm okay,
but the attendant Si-young has a fever,

508
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,657
and Captain Jang
isn't feeling well either.

509
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,577
So I think for now
it's better if you stay alone.

510
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:22,538
Okay, call me.

511
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:36,802
These photos are from the plane.

512
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:39,429
The blisters and bleeding

513
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:43,684
match what we saw on the corpse
at Ryu's house.

514
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:47,896
Ryu already dispersed the white powder
in the plane,

515
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,899
and if we have the first casualty,

516
00:44:50,983 --> 00:44:53,485
that means the virus is spreading.

517
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:56,154
So the infections will multiply rapidly.

518
00:44:56,238 --> 00:45:01,326
Not only that,
this aircraft is a 20-year-old model,

519
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,913
and the ventilation reuses air
from inside the plane.

520
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:07,374
So the virus,
which appears to be airborne,

521
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,917
will circulate.

522
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,587
It's the ideal environment for a virus.

523
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:14,047
They're saying it's a terrorist attack.

524
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,549
Everyone stay calm.

525
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:20,429
Don't let the passengers see you
looking worried, okay?

526
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:22,222
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:25,434
Are you okay?

528
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:28,145
I'm a bit dizzy.

529
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,565
If I rest for a sec, I'll be okay.

530
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:32,983
Can you get up?

531
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:40,866
Is there any existing virus
with similar traits?

532
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,994
To prepare a response--

533
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:46,538
It's an intentional act of bioterrorism,

534
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:50,334
so it'll be hard to find
anything comparable in nature.

535
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:54,171
And far more lethal.

536
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:58,008
What do we do? I'm scared.

537
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,762
Hey, don't be a wuss! It'll be fine.

538
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:05,682
It's okay. I'm scared too.

539
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,476
I SAW YOUR POST ON INSTAGRAM.

540
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:10,729
Reporters are texting like crazy.

541
00:46:12,314 --> 00:46:16,318
The video I took,
I uploaded it to Instagram.

542
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,655
But the wi-fi is so slow.

543
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:22,032
Too many people using the internet.

544
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:24,243
Try again in 2 or 3 minutes.

545
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:26,787
Ryu Jin-seok worked
for a pharmaceutical company?

546
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,249
Yes, he quit four years ago.

547
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:35,212
He was head of microbiology
at the multinational firm BRICOM.

548
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:40,634
We tried contacting them to get more info,

549
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:44,429
but their headquarters are overseas,
and they're not very cooperative.

550
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:46,849
They say he quit years ago,

551
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:50,185
and this incident has
nothing to do with them.

552
00:46:50,477 --> 00:46:53,647
They keep repeating
they have nothing to tell us.

553
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:58,068
The situation is so desperate,
and you're just going to let it go?

554
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,405
Use the power of the state if you have to.

555
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:05,742
Yes, but we have no evidence
directly linking them to this case,

556
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:08,829
and if we investigate
or force them to testify,

557
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:10,247
it could cause problems.

558
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,835
We are public servants.
It's our job to take responsibility.

559
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:17,754
I'll try another channel.

560
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,425
Ryu's mother was a microbiologist, too.

561
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:24,595
She published several papers
in overseas scientific journals.

562
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:29,558
They went to the US in 1994
and returned in 2002.

563
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:34,396
She finished her Ph.D.
just as Ryu entered school,

564
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,024
so it seems they went for Ryu's education.

565
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:38,233
Can you contact her?

566
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:40,986
She died of natural causes in February.

567
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,573
Let's negotiate with Ryu.

568
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:49,786
This is an unknown virus
with a short incubation period.

569
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,581
If he just wanted to kill people,
he could do it on land.

570
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:55,876
He chose a plane,
so he must have some other goal.

571
00:47:56,168 --> 00:47:59,296
And the internet threat suggests
he likes an audience.

572
00:47:59,796 --> 00:48:02,716
If he wants something,
we can give it to him.

573
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,928
If not, all those...

574
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:09,681
It's too dangerous for those passengers.

575
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:21,985
Can you hear me?

576
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:24,947
Yes.

577
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,083
Mr. Ryu Jin-seok?

578
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:38,502
What?

579
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,966
Can you tell us why you did all of this?

580
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:46,176
Did what?

581
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,387
Do you want something?

582
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:51,139
You must have a reason.

583
00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:53,642
So you'll give it to me?

584
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:58,438
Right now, officials from the government

585
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,357
are listening to this call.

586
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:03,318
Tell him we'll do what he wants.

587
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,115
Do you want something?

588
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:10,576
They say they'll do it.

589
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,041
Then listen up.

590
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,043
I'll tell you clearly.

591
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:27,342
The people on this plane,

592
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,721
I want them all to die.

593
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:36,185
Shall I repeat myself?

594
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:43,108
I want everyone on this plane to die!

595
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:46,570
Every single one!

596
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:51,909
Why?

597
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:54,494
It seems like fun.

598
00:49:55,954 --> 00:49:57,664
It's fun when people die?

599
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:05,797
No. It's fun seeing people trapped,
dying one by one.

600
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:06,965
Like rats.

601
00:50:07,049 --> 00:50:08,133
This is a plane!

602
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:11,220
So there's nowhere to run,
it will be chaos!

603
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:14,806
Running won't save you.

604
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:17,601
- You crazy bastard!
- Sir!

605
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:19,061
Tell him to stay calm.

606
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:23,941
Why? It's all just words.

607
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:26,443
What nonsense is this?

608
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,487
You know
how many people are on this plane?

609
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,405
You think I wanted this?

610
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:36,370
You think I wanted to do this?

611
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:41,583
Ryu Jin-seok!

612
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,353
You need to learn

613
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:05,065
just how much it hurts, you garbage.

614
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:07,442
Stop this nonsense and tell me.
Where's the treatment?

615
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:09,736
Where's the vaccine?
You must want to live!

616
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,491
Tell me!

617
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,427
You think I boarded this plane
planning to live?

618
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:39,474
I boarded it to die. With all of you.

619
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:23,096
Idle! Speed brake!

620
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,434
Pull up.

621
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:21,572
Are you okay?

622
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,779
Ryu Jin-seok is dead.

623
00:56:08,368 --> 00:56:09,828
Captain Won is dead.

624
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:15,000
And the terrorist,
Ryu Jin-seok is also dead.

625
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:17,002
What did you say?

626
00:56:29,765 --> 00:56:32,226
He said he's not hurt,
he just passes out sometimes.

627
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,270
I think he has fear of flying, too.

628
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:38,857
Fear of flying? Not him, surely.

629
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:39,816
What?

630
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,195
He used to be a famous pilot.

631
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,215
DEATH REPORTED ON FLIGHT TO HONOLULU
Minister.

632
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:04,633
SUSPECTED TERRORISM
The story broke.

633
00:57:05,968 --> 00:57:07,344
This just in.

634
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:08,762
A death has occurred...

635
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:10,681
POSSIBLE TERRORISM ON SKY KOREA 501

636
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,433
...on a Sky Korea flight
from Incheon to Honolulu.

637
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:19,022
Even more disturbing,
the presumed cause is terrorism.

638
00:57:19,731 --> 00:57:24,653
This video was taken by a passenger
on the plane

639
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:27,948
and sent
via the airline's internet service.

640
00:57:28,031 --> 00:57:30,701
The suspect Ryu being detained
in this video

641
00:57:30,784 --> 00:57:35,122
threatened an attack on a plane yesterday.

642
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:39,501
DEATH CAUSED BY SUSPECTED TERROR

643
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:43,130
This is all the info we have
at the moment,

644
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:46,049
but according to passengers' reports
from the plane,

645
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:49,011
the plane is experiencing
violent turbulence

646
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:54,308
and passengers are in a state
of extreme terror and confusion.

647
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:55,767
Despite this,

648
00:57:55,851 --> 00:58:01,231
neither the airline nor the government
have responded to calls for clarification.

649
00:58:03,984 --> 00:58:06,570
As reported in the press,

650
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:10,574
the suspect Ryu uploaded a terror threat
on the internet,

651
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:15,537
and carried out a biological terror attack
on the plane.

652
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:19,750
This virus is highly contagious

653
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:23,337
and in contrast
to naturally occurring diseases,

654
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:26,006
- appears to be extremely lethal.
- Is he that person from before?

655
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,674
He's dead?

656
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:30,469
We have learned that the terrorist himself

657
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:32,721
has died of the virus,

658
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,725
and Captain Won Dong-yeon died
after being infected.

659
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:39,186
Shouldn't we check on this?

660
00:58:39,811 --> 00:58:41,855
Hey, stewardess! Stewardess!

661
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:43,023
- The government is
- Stewardess!

662
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,317
cooperating with the US

663
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:47,903
to land the plane

664
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:52,449
and address the situation
as quickly as possible.

665
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:55,327
Dear passengers,
family members and citizens,

666
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,371
we ask for your trust...

667
00:58:57,454 --> 00:59:00,457
- It's a virus? Extremely lethal?
- ...as we work to find a solution.

668
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,585
The pilot got infected and died!

669
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:06,880
Then are we all going to get infected?

670
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:09,299
We'll all get infected?

671
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:11,426
Why won't the phone work?

672
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,097
Because everyone's calling.

673
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,140
Everyone's trying.

674
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,686
Pil-ho died of that virus.
I was next to him!

675
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:21,812
Are you serious?

676
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:23,897
- Stewardess!
- I'm sorry.

677
00:59:23,981 --> 00:59:25,399
- Just a minute.
- Wait!

678
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,608
Stop!

679
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:30,487
Tell us something!
Don't we need to get off?

680
00:59:32,531 --> 00:59:35,951
Meanwhile, police have turned
the investigation public

681
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:39,079
and released details about the suspect.

682
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,415
His name is Ryu Jin-seok.

683
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:46,753
He worked as a senior researcher
at a multinational pharmaceutical firm.

684
00:59:46,837 --> 00:59:47,796
As of now,

685
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:52,593
a Counterterrorism Task Force
has been set up at the airport,

686
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:57,848
and family members of passengers
are arriving at a nearby meeting room.

687
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:00,559
Check all CCTVs near that house,

688
01:00:00,893 --> 01:00:03,061
and see if there were any visitors.

689
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:04,855
It's chaos here!

690
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:07,316
I don't know how the location got leaked

691
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:11,862
but even if we say it's safe,
it's pandemonium here.

692
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,947
A disinfectant truck just arrived.

693
01:00:15,115 --> 01:00:17,618
Dad, is Mom on that plane?

694
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,119
A call came from her.

695
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:21,246
You can call from a plane?

696
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:23,207
Yes, on that one.

697
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,459
She just said a few words,
then it disconnected.

698
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:26,668
Where are you?

699
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:31,256
They said the families are at the airport,
so I'm going there.

700
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,258
Don't worry, she'll be fine.

701
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:36,386
She never catches a cold.

702
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:40,349
We can't get to the plane,
this is driving me crazy.

703
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,060
Where did that bastard work?

704
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:44,228
BRICOM.

705
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:47,064
If they won't cooperate,
it means they're hiding something.

706
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:49,608
Otherwise, why not talk?

707
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:55,239
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Nothing. Just dizzy.

708
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:57,950
I'm just dizzy.

709
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,161
Hey!

710
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:04,122
- Please call someone!
- Stewardess!

711
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:07,543
No, I'm okay.

712
01:01:07,876 --> 01:01:09,503
Si-young's in trouble!

713
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,259
Si-young!

714
01:01:17,803 --> 01:01:19,179
Si-young!

715
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:26,895
I'm scared.

716
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,356
I can't do it.

717
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,651
I can't do this anymore!

718
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:44,121
The passengers are in an uproar.

719
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,374
They want us to isolate the infected.

720
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:54,256
Those with blisters on their skin,
go to the tail.

721
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:56,383
Those who are still okay, to the front.

722
01:01:56,466 --> 01:01:58,969
The doctor is at the back!

723
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:01,722
If you feel even a little sick,
have a fever,

724
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:05,809
or have developed blisters,
please move to the back of the plane.

725
01:02:08,896 --> 01:02:12,274
Hold on. Is that a blister?

726
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,735
What do you mean? It's eczema.

727
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,988
- It looks like a blister.
- It's not that!

728
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:21,074
Do you have a doctor's certificate?

729
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:25,537
Why would I carry a doctor's certificate
for eczema?

730
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,372
Come on, Soo-min.

731
01:02:35,464 --> 01:02:38,967
Dad, can we just go to the back?

732
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,263
No. No way.

733
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,726
Dad, let's just go. Okay?

734
01:02:50,938 --> 01:02:54,024
No, this is just eczema.
You don't need to go there.

735
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:56,318
- Mister--
- Let go of me!

736
01:02:57,861 --> 01:03:00,864
You can't just try to save yourselves!

737
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,160
Aren't I right? Aren't I?

738
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:10,082
Dad, let's just go.

739
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,418
Please let's go!

740
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:20,592
Are you okay?
Those with blisters, in the back.

741
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:24,847
Sorry. It's because of me.

742
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,723
You've nothing to be sorry about.

743
01:03:27,266 --> 01:03:28,267
It's okay.

744
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:35,232
- Can you hand me that pillow?
- Yes.

745
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:36,650
Hand me her medicine.

746
01:03:43,949 --> 01:03:46,869
An Emergency Response Team,
with the aviation policy director,

747
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:50,914
Transport Minister Kim Sook-hee,
Health Minister Jeong Mi-ok,

748
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,667
and Kim Myeong-sik of the Korea CDC

749
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:57,254
are all departing for the US.

750
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:00,841
They will address the situation
as soon as they land.

751
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:06,221
Meanwhile, we are receiving more info
on Ryu Jin-seok.

752
01:04:06,305 --> 01:04:11,768
WAITING ROOM FOR FAMILIES
He was extremely quiet as a child.

753
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:15,272
Neighbors describe him
as somewhat peculiar,

754
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:19,860
with an incident over trash
resulting in conflict.

755
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,112
Given all this,

756
01:04:22,196 --> 01:04:26,950
some are comparing him
to the Las Vegas shooter.

757
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:30,954
First, he's an elite,
from a wealthy background.

758
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,998
His apartment is expensive.

759
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:36,710
So he's not expressing some kind of rage
towards society.

760
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:41,256
Like the Place St. Lambert incident
in Belgium

761
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,717
when a man attacked

762
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,180
this sort of attack is unexplained,
with victims chosen at random.

763
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,724
And the culprit also killed himself.

764
01:04:50,807 --> 01:04:53,018
It's known as "extended suicide."

765
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,772
Now we have disasters
of this sort as well.

766
01:04:57,272 --> 01:05:00,025
Disasters are arbitrary.

767
01:05:00,108 --> 01:05:04,530
People became victims
for being in a certain place

768
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:06,240
at a certain time.

769
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:08,492
Just a minute, Captain.

770
01:05:13,622 --> 01:05:14,706
Excuse me.

771
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:18,961
How about moving the second pilot
to the bunker?

772
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:20,671
It seems dangerous here.

773
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:24,299
But I think it's more dangerous there.

774
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:28,804
The terrorist's body
and the passengers who died are there.

775
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,940
- How many PO2s do you have?
- What?

776
01:05:40,858 --> 01:05:44,653
Oxygen cylinders for the cabin.
Not the overhead masks.

777
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:48,156
I guess about 20 of them.

778
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,829
How about using them on passengers
with trouble breathing?

779
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:03,422
Here's a fever reducer.

780
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:07,676
You need to hold on until we land.

781
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:25,777
Look at all those reporters.

782
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:29,323
Those BRICOM assholes.
There's no time for this.

783
01:06:32,367 --> 01:06:37,247
There's no warrant yet.
Not enough evidence, it seems.

784
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,792
We don't have time for this now!

785
01:06:40,876 --> 01:06:42,586
You're obstructing an investigation!

786
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:45,589
Just cooperate, okay? Step aside.

787
01:06:46,757 --> 01:06:50,302
We've nothing to do with this case!

788
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:52,262
If you want to come in, get a warrant!

789
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,556
We got the warrant, right?

790
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,807
We got it already.

791
01:06:55,891 --> 01:06:57,100
Don't lie to me.

792
01:06:57,184 --> 01:07:01,313
Follow the procedures,
show some connection to the case,

793
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:02,481
and then come back!

794
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:04,900
You asshole!

795
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:13,450
Try to pierce through!

796
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,583
Sir, this...

797
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:33,971
Hello?

798
01:08:10,215 --> 01:08:13,218
We've tried contacting senators,
the White House,

799
01:08:13,302 --> 01:08:14,469
but it's no use.

800
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,230
I'm sure you know,

801
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:28,984
the longer they stay in that plane,
the more dangerous it is.

802
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:30,819
They absolutely refuse.

803
01:08:31,737 --> 01:08:36,450
They said they can't take that risk
without knowing anything.

804
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,787
If we wait longer,
the plane may not have fuel to get back.

805
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:43,332
On their way back,

806
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:48,462
we'll try somehow to let them land
in another country.

807
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:50,172
Yes, sir.

808
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:53,467
We're turning back.

809
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:56,345
Give the order.

810
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:02,100
Sky Korea 501, we'd like you to turn back.

811
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:05,479
Did you hear me?

812
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,398
Please return to Incheon.

813
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:12,402
First Officer Choi?

814
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:15,155
I hear you.

815
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,121
KI501 is turning back.

816
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:26,291
- Check fuel levels!
- KI501 is turning back!

817
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,902
Flight KI501,

818
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:57,656
after suffering
an unprecedented terror attack,

819
01:09:57,739 --> 01:10:00,993
is reportedly turning back to Korea.

820
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:04,037
Passengers had been about to land
for treatment,

821
01:10:04,538 --> 01:10:06,957
but it's unclear what happened...

822
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,133
Just a minute.

823
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:18,844
Are we turning back?

824
01:10:19,511 --> 01:10:21,180
We saw the news.

825
01:10:22,264 --> 01:10:23,182
I'm sorry.

826
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,809
This is insane. Turn back?

827
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:28,145
How can we wait that long?

828
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:33,317
Damn, I can't do it!
I can't wait any longer!

829
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,488
Land in Hawaii now! Right now!

830
01:10:38,572 --> 01:10:40,657
The US won't let us in.

831
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,953
They refused to let us land,
so we're turning back.

832
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,668
We'll all die this way.

833
01:10:58,091 --> 01:11:02,012
KI501 TURNS BACK

834
01:11:05,807 --> 01:11:07,392
Hello? Honey!

835
01:11:08,727 --> 01:11:10,771
- Honey!
- Honey?

836
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:12,564
- You hear me?
- I hear you.

837
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:15,484
How are you? Are you okay?

838
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,611
How is Min-jung?

839
01:11:17,945 --> 01:11:21,406
She's fine. Is your health okay?

840
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,325
You're not hurt?

841
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:28,956
I'm okay. But it's total chaos here.

842
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:30,541
I'm scared.

843
01:11:30,624 --> 01:11:34,211
Just hold out a bit longer.
We're working on a solution.

844
01:11:34,294 --> 01:11:37,422
You are, right? You can fix things?

845
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:38,715
Don't worry.

846
01:11:38,799 --> 01:11:41,009
Hello? Honey?

847
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,054
Hello?

848
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:45,722
Hello?

849
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,503
The plane's turning back?
The US didn't let them land?

850
01:12:17,129 --> 01:12:18,463
That's the current situation.

851
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:20,090
What's the situation in the plane?

852
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:23,635
Luckily, there's a doctor onboard,

853
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:28,098
and the flight crew are doing their best.

854
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:54,917
What's your plan for when it lands?

855
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,296
The quarantine system will be formed
shortly.

856
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:02,966
- Just a minute!
- Please tell us something!

857
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:09,723
I'm so angry.

858
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:12,351
We've become his guinea pigs.

859
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:31,578
- Sergeant!
- Did we get the warrant?

860
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:33,372
No, but

861
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:36,625
someone who saw you on TV is on the phone.

862
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:38,335
She wants to talk to you.

863
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:40,879
She's a BRICOM employee.

864
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:44,216
Hello?

865
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,884
- I...
- Yes?

866
01:13:45,968 --> 01:13:47,511
This can't be traced, right?

867
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:50,514
Not at all! I'm speaking outside.

868
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:51,932
Or recorded?

869
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:56,103
No, this is an iPhone,
so it can't record calls.

870
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:58,647
- Don't worry.
- You've no connection to BRICOM?

871
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:03,402
No, you saw me fighting them on TV.

872
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:05,112
Yes, please go ahead.

873
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:08,198
Things are in an uproar here.
So I have to be careful.

874
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:12,494
I understand.
This is a sensitive situation, I know.

875
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:18,208
It seems like
someone here conspired with Ryu Jin-seok.

876
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:23,630
As soon as he saw the news,
he rushed home, as if fleeing.

877
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,259
Ma'am!

878
01:14:27,342 --> 01:14:30,429
This way please, it's not safe here.

879
01:14:34,016 --> 01:14:34,933
Who is it?

880
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,643
I've got a delivery.

881
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:38,187
Just a minute.

882
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:41,190
Shouldn't we pick the lock?

883
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:44,693
Sergeant, he jumped out the window!

884
01:14:44,776 --> 01:14:45,819
Damn it!

885
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:48,822
Hey, second floor!

886
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,490
Grab him, quick!

887
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,118
Stop right there!

888
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,162
That way!

889
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,664
Climb over!

890
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,750
Climb over it!

891
01:15:00,042 --> 01:15:02,127
Can't you get over this?

892
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:07,925
Shit, twisted my leg...

893
01:15:09,593 --> 01:15:11,553
My scooter!

894
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:20,354
Stop, you asshole!

895
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,856
Grab him, hurry!

896
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,941
Catch him!

897
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,693
Why are you running? Get in the car.

898
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:29,238
- You coward!
- Why call me that?

899
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,739
Chase him!

900
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,951
- Go faster!
- Up front!

901
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,202
Out of the way!

902
01:15:35,661 --> 01:15:36,620
Turn left.

903
01:15:36,703 --> 01:15:37,871
Left!

904
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:43,210
- Go faster!
- I am going fast.

905
01:15:44,127 --> 01:15:45,170
My goodness.

906
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:48,549
Right, turn right!

907
01:15:48,632 --> 01:15:49,591
Right.

908
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:52,261
Come on. A little faster.

909
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,887
- Step on it!
- I'm trying!

910
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:55,597
Hey, that's too fast!

911
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:56,849
On his tail!

912
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:57,975
Too fast!

913
01:15:58,058 --> 01:15:59,434
What am I supposed to do?

914
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:00,644
Watch out!

915
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:25,711
Oh Sung-hoon.

916
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,504
You're Oh Sung-hoon, right?

917
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:31,216
What? It's not like that.
Why are you chasing me?

918
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,551
You punk.

919
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:34,970
You're arrested as an accomplice
in the terror attack.

920
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:36,138
Come here!

921
01:16:36,763 --> 01:16:38,515
Are you okay?

922
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,184
Shit.

923
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:41,768
You jerk.

924
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:45,063
Mister, don't talk. You're bleeding a lot.

925
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:46,899
We need an ambulance here!

926
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:48,859
Somebody!

927
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:55,449
- Damn it!
- You say you're not an accomplice.

928
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:57,326
Then why'd you run?

929
01:16:58,744 --> 01:17:00,204
I was scared.

930
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,918
He tricked me too, that bastard!

931
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:11,590
He kept saying
he was unfairly fired from BRICOM.

932
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:14,676
I thought he deserved pity.

933
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,386
What are you saying?

934
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:17,846
What happened was...

935
01:17:18,555 --> 01:17:22,684
A few years ago, we received
a mutated virus from the Middle East.

936
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:27,814
Called SC-1, highly infectious,
hemorrhagic and very dangerous.

937
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:33,320
But three of our researchers got exposed
to the virus.

938
01:17:33,403 --> 01:17:35,531
The person in charge was...

939
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,284
Ryu Jin-seok.

940
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:40,661
The only person

941
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:43,872
who survived

942
01:17:43,956 --> 01:17:49,753
told the police
that Ryu intentionally exposed them.

943
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:52,089
Ryu said he was unfairly accused.

944
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:55,300
There was no evidence,
but the survivor was adamant.

945
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:58,011
The company had brought the virus
in secretly,

946
01:17:58,470 --> 01:18:01,014
so they insisted it was an accident,

947
01:18:01,098 --> 01:18:05,978
and Ryu was fired
without any charges filed with the police.

948
01:18:06,061 --> 01:18:08,730
But that bastard Ryu
with his innocent face

949
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:11,191
begged me to send him a sample,

950
01:18:11,275 --> 01:18:16,113
saying he wanted to clear his name
and get rehired...

951
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:18,365
There's a survivor?

952
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:20,909
Where's the person who survived?

953
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,746
The corpse from Ryu's house.

954
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:28,458
They said they'd incubate the virus
from the body, was it done?

955
01:18:28,542 --> 01:18:32,045
Can they determine
what kind of virus it is?

956
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:36,133
Yes, it only takes two hours,
so they must have a result.

957
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,889
Sky Korea 501!

958
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,099
Sky Korea 501!

959
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,810
Your velocity is Mach 0.85.

960
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:47,978
Is this correct?

961
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,272
Yes.

962
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:52,024
Why are you flying so fast?

963
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:53,567
Is something wrong?

964
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:58,906
Have you secured any landing spot
on the return route?

965
01:18:58,989 --> 01:19:01,366
We're negotiating. Is something wrong?

966
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:05,579
I don't feel so well.

967
01:19:13,545 --> 01:19:14,963
When did that appear?

968
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:19,218
Indeed.

969
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:22,304
Take a shot of the fever reducer.

970
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:26,391
No, there aren't enough.

971
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,352
You're the chief flight attendant.

972
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:31,855
Everyone's looking to you,
attendants and passengers.

973
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:37,861
I was planning to quit after this year.

974
01:19:38,946 --> 01:19:43,075
Get my sister married, and then quit.

975
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,285
She should get herself married.

976
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,995
Why rely on you?

977
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,332
You're right.

978
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:55,379
- I'll quit when we land.
- Yes, quit right away.

979
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,050
You were a pilot?

980
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,138
A long time ago.

981
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:06,932
Why did you quit?

982
01:20:08,892 --> 01:20:09,852
Sir!

983
01:20:09,935 --> 01:20:11,270
One of the passengers is a pilot.

984
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:14,815
Captain Park Jae-hyuk.
Alpha grade, lots of experience.

985
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:17,276
But...

986
01:20:19,361 --> 01:20:22,489
The weather was terrible that day, too.

987
01:20:25,826 --> 01:20:26,952
First Officer Choi.

988
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,539
One of the passengers is a pilot.

989
01:20:31,206 --> 01:20:32,791
Did you know that?

990
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:39,506
Not long before landing,
one of the engines caught fire.

991
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:41,550
I wanted to make an emergency landing,

992
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:44,386
but the control tower in Norway disagreed.

993
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:48,807
They said the wind was too strong,

994
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,436
to turn back and land elsewhere.

995
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:56,815
But with the engine trouble,

996
01:20:56,899 --> 01:21:00,652
I thought it safer to risk the wind.

997
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:02,154
I heard about that.

998
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:06,283
The airplane burned,
but the passengers were all saved.

999
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:09,995
Two flight attendants in the tail,

1000
01:21:10,078 --> 01:21:13,832
helping passengers disembark

1001
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,211
died when it caught fire.

1002
01:21:17,294 --> 01:21:22,090
Because passengers getting their luggage
blocked the exit...

1003
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:24,134
One of the flight attendants...

1004
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:31,391
was First Officer Choi's wife.

1005
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,776
Maybe

1006
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:45,864
I should've listened to the tower
instead of insisting.

1007
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,576
Thousands of times I've questioned myself.

1008
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:55,791
Ever since then...

1009
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,213
I just can't do it.

1010
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:05,926
When I board a plane,
I can't even breathe...

1011
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,352
Chief attendant speaking.

1012
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:19,690
Remember that there's a pilot
among the passengers?

1013
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:22,025
Park Jae-hyuk.

1014
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:23,944
Yes.

1015
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:26,738
We should get him prepared just in case.

1016
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:29,658
First Officer Choi!

1017
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:32,202
First Officer Choi!

1018
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:41,170
Ryu's mother
had been a famous microbiologist.

1019
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:46,258
I don't remember her name.
She used to pressure Ryu,

1020
01:22:46,884 --> 01:22:52,264
and when he felt stressed,
he'd get pleasure in killing animals.

1021
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:57,519
Of course we told the company
and they made him stop, but...

1022
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:03,942
I think he did it to get revenge.

1023
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:09,781
I saw it with my own eyes.

1024
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:13,285
We were dying in the lab,

1025
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:18,332
and his eyes...

1026
01:23:18,415 --> 01:23:19,958
They were laughing.

1027
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:27,382
His colleagues were writhing in agony,

1028
01:23:27,925 --> 01:23:30,177
and he was smiling.

1029
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:38,101
I brought a sample of the virus
from the corpse in Ryu's house.

1030
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:41,730
Would you be able to recognize it?

1031
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:56,537
How could I ever forget this?

1032
01:24:16,932 --> 01:24:18,892
They found an antivirus.

1033
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:22,813
Are you sure?

1034
01:24:22,896 --> 01:24:27,568
Yes, Ryu took the virus from BRICOM
and used it in the attack.

1035
01:24:28,151 --> 01:24:32,614
The virus from the dead body,
and the virus studied at BRICOM

1036
01:24:32,698 --> 01:24:33,866
are the same.

1037
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,661
How many forces can we deploy
to the BRICOM?

1038
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:43,125
Are you okay, First Officer?

1039
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:48,881
Can you do it?

1040
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:56,638
You flew a 777 before,
so it won't be much different.

1041
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,391
Technical support staff are standing by.

1042
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:01,476
So even if something happens,

1043
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,437
it won't be too hard.

1044
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,212
Are you crazy? You're going to kill us!

1045
01:25:32,049 --> 01:25:34,134
Open up. There's no time.

1046
01:25:34,218 --> 01:25:35,344
Open up!

1047
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:39,306
You bastards!

1048
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:46,021
Out of the way!

1049
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:53,111
No, it isn't!

1050
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:54,780
What's with you girls?

1051
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:59,034
Hey, what if you infect
all the people here? Huh?

1052
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:01,828
- Get out, now!
- No, it's not true!

1053
01:26:01,912 --> 01:26:03,664
Will you stop it?

1054
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:09,211
- Stop what?
- These girls could be your daughters.

1055
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:13,006
We can't all just try to save
ourselves here!

1056
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:16,218
Look at this.
Look, I saw that on you before.

1057
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:19,638
It's a blister, right?

1058
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:22,724
- You go, too! All of you!
- Stop it!

1059
01:26:22,808 --> 01:26:25,519
- Get out!
- I said stop it!

1060
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:29,106
My god, don't you have kids?

1061
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:34,987
It's okay, girls. Come with me.

1062
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:39,199
There's a doctor there, it'll be okay.

1063
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:40,868
It's okay.

1064
01:26:43,579 --> 01:26:45,080
Look at you.

1065
01:26:45,706 --> 01:26:48,792
If you go out,
you can't come back, you know?

1066
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:51,712
In this tiny plane,

1067
01:26:51,795 --> 01:26:56,133
it seems a bit much
to be kicking people out.

1068
01:26:57,634 --> 01:27:01,972
We're just trying to survive!
You'll die if you leave here.

1069
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:06,602
Look at how few are left.
You chased everyone out.

1070
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:09,104
Just survive on your own, okay?

1071
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:20,532
Let's do this, people! Be strong!

1072
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:21,992
Soo-min!

1073
01:27:22,826 --> 01:27:24,077
I came right back, right?

1074
01:27:25,913 --> 01:27:27,164
Would you like this?

1075
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,377
Is Dad flying the plane?

1076
01:27:33,837 --> 01:27:34,880
Yeah.

1077
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,841
He's scared of planes.

1078
01:27:51,522 --> 01:27:55,817
Have you flown even once since then?

1079
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:04,159
I'm sure I can do it.
I used to do it all the time.

1080
01:28:05,118 --> 01:28:08,247
- You were going on vacation?
- Not vacation.

1081
01:28:08,622 --> 01:28:10,624
My kid has eczema.

1082
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:14,461
Other kids made fun of her for it.

1083
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:17,464
She was having a hard time.

1084
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:20,801
She's gotten quiet
since my wife and I divorced.

1085
01:28:21,718 --> 01:28:23,846
They say clean air can cure eczema.

1086
01:28:23,929 --> 01:28:29,142
My friend has
a light aircraft business there.

1087
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:33,188
He said they need an instructor.

1088
01:28:33,856 --> 01:28:35,190
Teaching theory.

1089
01:28:53,584 --> 01:28:55,252
Open the door, now!

1090
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:58,839
Show us the customs clearance for SC-1!

1091
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:01,633
You have an antivirus and vaccine!

1092
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:05,053
Bring the warrant!

1093
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:07,639
Show us evidence!

1094
01:29:08,473 --> 01:29:10,058
You know this is illegal?

1095
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,526
Before we bring the warrant,

1096
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:22,237
you'd be smart to listen to him.

1097
01:29:23,488 --> 01:29:27,451
Give us the vaccine and antivirus,
and mitigate your crime!

1098
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:31,872
If this gets out,
it won't end with you going bankrupt.

1099
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,585
Do you have proof?

1100
01:29:56,730 --> 01:30:02,402
The virus released in the attack
was taken by Ryu Jin-seok from a lab

1101
01:30:02,486 --> 01:30:04,530
at his former employer BRICOM.

1102
01:30:04,613 --> 01:30:10,035
Fortunately, BRICOM possesses
an antiviral treatment and vaccine

1103
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:13,288
which they will provide to victims
free of charge.

1104
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:21,046
They found a treatment!
It was just announced!

1105
01:30:22,256 --> 01:30:23,882
They found a treatment!

1106
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:28,679
The calls are coming in.
It was on the news.

1107
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,358
They found a treatment! A treatment!

1108
01:30:41,817 --> 01:30:42,943
They found a treatment!

1109
01:30:43,026 --> 01:30:45,195
- We're going to live!
- Is it true?

1110
01:30:57,457 --> 01:30:59,835
- Is it certain?
- Yes, it is.

1111
01:30:59,918 --> 01:31:01,670
They found a treatment.

1112
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:03,547
They found a treatment.

1113
01:31:03,630 --> 01:31:04,840
Really?

1114
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:08,010
That's great.

1115
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,181
What a relief. I knew they would.

1116
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:15,100
Hello?

1117
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:16,935
Honey!

1118
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:18,812
How did you find it?

1119
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:21,732
How do you think?

1120
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:24,526
That's what detectives do.

1121
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,571
Now you just need to get home.

1122
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,949
It's for the best.
Korea's much better than Hawaii.

1123
01:31:33,076 --> 01:31:35,579
Just hold on a bit longer.

1124
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:40,751
Okay, I will.

1125
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:52,679
- It's all thanks to you.
- Minister!

1126
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:54,473
You made a great effort.

1127
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:55,807
It was nothing.

1128
01:31:56,558 --> 01:32:00,312
I'm a public servant. Just doing my job.

1129
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:05,567
Actually, my wife is on that plane.

1130
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:08,111
I heard.

1131
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,323
Please help, Minister.

1132
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:16,495
Bring her back safely.

1133
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:19,122
All the way home.

1134
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:22,709
I will.

1135
01:32:28,674 --> 01:32:31,885
Japan should accept us now, right?

1136
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:37,599
First Officer!

1137
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:48,235
We'll have to land at Narita.

1138
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:51,572
The weather was bad at takeoff,

1139
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:56,535
so we added some extra fuel,

1140
01:32:56,785 --> 01:33:00,747
but I doubt there's enough to reach Seoul.

1141
01:33:01,415 --> 01:33:03,166
And speaking honestly,

1142
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:08,839
neither one of us is in condition to fly.

1143
01:33:17,556 --> 01:33:18,724
Kubo-san!

1144
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:22,686
KI501 seems to be turning towards us.

1145
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,146
What did you say?

1146
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:26,565
It's the plane
that was hit with the bioterror attack.

1147
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:29,651
Sky Korea 501!

1148
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,904
Are you turning towards Japan?

1149
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:33,030
Yes.

1150
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:36,074
We're going to land at Narita.

1151
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,327
We need to discuss this with Japan.

1152
01:33:42,414 --> 01:33:43,582
I'm sorry.

1153
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:47,127
I can't hold out any longer.

1154
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,380
I'm issuing an emergency declaration.

1155
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,887
KI501 issued an emergency declaration.

1156
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:59,223
Isn't Park Jae-hyuk there?

1157
01:33:59,306 --> 01:34:02,142
It seems he's not in a state to fly.

1158
01:34:05,896 --> 01:34:07,272
Japan?

1159
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:10,943
Ladies and gentlemen,
to ensure your safety,

1160
01:34:11,026 --> 01:34:14,154
we will land at Narita Airport.

1161
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:15,989
Come on, let's go to the back!

1162
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:18,784
During landing, the back is the safest!

1163
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:35,008
They're going to Japan?

1164
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:38,595
The pilot's condition is bad.
It seems he was infected.

1165
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:41,306
There's a former pilot
among the passengers,

1166
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:45,018
but it seems he's not in a state to fly.

1167
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:46,478
What's their response?

1168
01:34:46,562 --> 01:34:48,021
No answer yet.

1169
01:34:48,105 --> 01:34:49,898
We told them
there's an antiviral and vaccine,

1170
01:34:49,982 --> 01:34:51,108
and the pilot is sick.

1171
01:34:51,191 --> 01:34:52,693
I'll call the Foreign Ministry.

1172
01:34:53,402 --> 01:34:54,528
But...

1173
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:59,658
It'll be okay.
We have a vaccine, after all.

1174
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:01,660
Don't worry, Sarge.

1175
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:22,890
Why not?

1176
01:35:23,432 --> 01:35:25,184
We've got a treatment.

1177
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:28,896
Tokyo refused.

1178
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:33,358
They're ordering them to leave
Japanese airspace.

1179
01:35:39,364 --> 01:35:40,866
Try telling them again.

1180
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,452
Our team will leave now
with the treatment.

1181
01:35:44,369 --> 01:35:48,248
Try again.
Tell them we absolutely need to land.

1182
01:35:53,587 --> 01:35:56,006
She said try again, asshole!

1183
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:58,425
Sarge!

1184
01:35:59,051 --> 01:36:00,552
What are you doing?

1185
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:04,264
This isn't so simple an issue.

1186
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:06,850
Our President has already tried calling.

1187
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:20,405
I can't last any longer.

1188
01:36:29,498 --> 01:36:31,124
The plane is going to Narita.

1189
01:36:31,792 --> 01:36:35,420
Five minutes to arrival.
Order other planes to turn back.

1190
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:56,316
An unidentified object is approaching!

1191
01:37:21,216 --> 01:37:22,301
Where did they go?

1192
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:29,892
It's appeared in front of them!

1193
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:55,584
Hey, Hyun-soo.

1194
01:38:08,472 --> 01:38:10,015
They're still heading to Narita!

1195
01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:28,408
They've fired warning shots.

1196
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:04,361
They're approaching closer.

1197
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,120
Permission to fire denied.

1198
01:39:36,185 --> 01:39:38,896
Ladies and gentlemen, we will land soon.

1199
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:41,064
Due to shaking of the aircraft,

1200
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:43,317
please adopt the position
for crash landing.

1201
01:39:52,367 --> 01:39:53,410
First Officer Choi!

1202
01:39:54,912 --> 01:39:56,205
The air force has appeared again!

1203
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,832
They're approaching head on!

1204
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:06,215
No, it's too dangerous!

1205
01:40:46,547 --> 01:40:48,507
First Officer Choi! Hyun-soo!

1206
01:40:49,258 --> 01:40:50,217
Hyun-soo!

1207
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:20,914
A moment ago, the Korean airliner KI501

1208
01:41:20,998 --> 01:41:22,791
trespassed into Japanese airspace,

1209
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,836
and the Air Self-Defense Force
was mobilized.

1210
01:41:26,587 --> 01:41:29,756
- Ignoring its given route,
- Hyun-soo! Please bring the doctor.

1211
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,341
Hyun-soo.

1212
01:41:31,425 --> 01:41:33,427
KI501 attempted to land at Narita Airport.

1213
01:41:34,136 --> 01:41:38,265
It has now given up trying to land
and is headed towards Korea.

1214
01:41:38,724 --> 01:41:44,730
The Korean government asked us to grant
landing permission,

1215
01:41:44,813 --> 01:41:48,025
as it has antivirals and vaccines
in its possession.

1216
01:41:48,775 --> 01:41:54,781
However, Japan's Ministry of Health
believes that this virus

1217
01:41:55,324 --> 01:42:00,454
has a much shorter incubation period
than the original virus,

1218
01:42:00,537 --> 01:42:04,374
and so it is highly likely

1219
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:08,962
that this virus is a mutation.

1220
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:15,636
A government's first duty is
to protect its citizens,

1221
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:19,264
so we had no choice but to avoid exposing
our nation to danger.

1222
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:20,349
What's he saying?

1223
01:42:20,432 --> 01:42:22,017
They said it would surely work!

1224
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:26,647
The Japanese government expresses
its deepest regret

1225
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:29,107
to the Korean people,

1226
01:42:29,191 --> 01:42:33,570
and hopes for KI501's safe passage

1227
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:35,405
to Korea.

1228
01:42:35,489 --> 01:42:37,324
I guess there's no cure.

1229
01:42:37,616 --> 01:42:41,119
They'll need
at least a few months to test it.

1230
01:42:41,203 --> 01:42:44,540
There's no cure?

1231
01:42:46,166 --> 01:42:48,919
They said they found a treatment.

1232
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:53,257
They said we could live.

1233
01:42:54,424 --> 01:42:55,551
Please don't move.

1234
01:42:55,634 --> 01:42:59,555
We were concerned too,
but what they said can't be denied.

1235
01:43:00,055 --> 01:43:04,852
A shorter incubation period means
the virus may have mutated.

1236
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:10,607
So the antiviral may be effective,
or may not.

1237
01:43:10,858 --> 01:43:13,944
It's not 100% certain.

1238
01:43:20,492 --> 01:43:21,577
Min-jung.

1239
01:43:21,910 --> 01:43:25,414
Dad, is it true what they said?

1240
01:43:25,497 --> 01:43:29,168
Is it really not a cure?

1241
01:43:29,251 --> 01:43:33,255
Public opinion is worsening
after Japan's refusal.

1242
01:43:33,338 --> 01:43:35,215
Are we still planning on Seoul Air Base?

1243
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:37,509
What do you mean?

1244
01:43:37,968 --> 01:43:40,345
We prepared negative pressure
isolation rooms for treatment.

1245
01:43:40,429 --> 01:43:43,140
Given public opinion, and the situation...

1246
01:43:43,765 --> 01:43:46,101
Forty people have died already,

1247
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:49,354
and we can assume
the survivors are all infected.

1248
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:52,608
If they land quickly,
we'll collect their permission

1249
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:54,693
and start testing on the infected at once.

1250
01:43:54,776 --> 01:43:57,237
It doesn't work?

1251
01:43:57,321 --> 01:43:59,114
If it's so deadly,

1252
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:01,909
and after it lands,

1253
01:44:01,992 --> 01:44:07,372
the treatment doesn't work
and even one more person gets infected,

1254
01:44:07,456 --> 01:44:10,250
who will take responsibility then?

1255
01:44:10,334 --> 01:44:13,712
That's why the US and Japan refused them.

1256
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:15,714
We need to accept them.

1257
01:44:15,797 --> 01:44:18,217
People on the ground are our people, too.

1258
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:22,721
We need to think of the danger
that comes as soon as the plane lands.

1259
01:44:22,804 --> 01:44:24,056
Right now,

1260
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:28,393
we need to think of minimizing the damage.

1261
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:31,396
Are you saying we should shoot it down,

1262
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:34,691
or just let it run out of fuel?

1263
01:44:34,775 --> 01:44:38,195
Has anyone here said such a thing?

1264
01:44:38,278 --> 01:44:40,155
If we don't decide now,

1265
01:44:41,865 --> 01:44:43,242
that's what will happen.

1266
01:44:43,951 --> 01:44:45,077
Dad.

1267
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:47,079
Dad!

1268
01:44:47,412 --> 01:44:49,289
The treatment doesn't work?

1269
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:53,168
Sergeant.

1270
01:44:53,502 --> 01:44:54,419
Sergeant!

1271
01:44:54,753 --> 01:44:59,591
The President is considering what to do,
so let's wait.

1272
01:45:01,468 --> 01:45:03,178
What's going on?

1273
01:45:03,887 --> 01:45:07,432
If there's a treatment,
why did Japan send the air force?

1274
01:45:07,516 --> 01:45:08,809
Things are not good.

1275
01:45:09,643 --> 01:45:11,687
We're not sure about the treatment.

1276
01:45:14,565 --> 01:45:17,192
The weather is not good.

1277
01:45:17,276 --> 01:45:21,280
If the motor overheats,
the autopilot may not operate.

1278
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:25,409
I should go to Seoul Air Base?

1279
01:45:27,578 --> 01:45:29,830
Can you hear me? Seoul?

1280
01:45:45,554 --> 01:45:46,555
Sergeant.

1281
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:49,016
Sergeant!

1282
01:45:51,643 --> 01:45:53,770
What are you doing?

1283
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:57,566
Listen closely. You see the virus there?

1284
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:01,528
I'll inject myself with it,
since I'll never get permission.

1285
01:46:01,612 --> 01:46:04,489
Once I do, call Minister Kim.

1286
01:46:04,573 --> 01:46:08,660
Tell her to give me the antivirus,
and if I live, let the plane land.

1287
01:46:08,744 --> 01:46:12,956
I know what you mean,
but Sarge, please don't do this.

1288
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,958
You know how scary that is.

1289
01:46:15,042 --> 01:46:19,630
You saw what that survivor in the hospital
looked like.

1290
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:21,256
There's no time, and no other way.

1291
01:46:21,340 --> 01:46:23,425
If we dilly-dally,
those people will all die.

1292
01:46:23,509 --> 01:46:28,180
We can't stand by.
We have to do all we can.

1293
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:32,518
I won't let my wife die this way, okay?

1294
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:38,273
Stay still!

1295
01:46:38,357 --> 01:46:40,400
Bloody hell, Sarge.

1296
01:46:41,527 --> 01:46:42,528
Minister.

1297
01:46:42,903 --> 01:46:46,156
Sergeant Koo injected himself
with the virus.

1298
01:46:52,204 --> 01:46:53,705
Yes, Mr. President.

1299
01:46:54,414 --> 01:47:00,003
As for me,
I think it's just too dangerous.

1300
01:47:01,630 --> 01:47:02,589
Yes.

1301
01:47:04,132 --> 01:47:05,342
Yes, sir.

1302
01:47:21,525 --> 01:47:22,693
What the hell?

1303
01:47:24,069 --> 01:47:25,988
You're not going to let us land, either?

1304
01:47:29,116 --> 01:47:33,662
We're the Korean Air Force.
Welcome to Korea.

1305
01:47:34,705 --> 01:47:37,499
We'll escort you home.

1306
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:49,094
I think this is wrong. We can't turn back.

1307
01:47:49,178 --> 01:47:51,305
We'll suffer a much bigger tragedy.

1308
01:47:58,145 --> 01:48:00,189
From here, you need protective clothing.

1309
01:48:01,565 --> 01:48:04,693
Is it true the plane is being escorted
to Seoul Air Base?

1310
01:48:05,527 --> 01:48:07,487
It is currently traveling safely.

1311
01:48:07,571 --> 01:48:09,281
Do you have measures in place?

1312
01:48:09,364 --> 01:48:13,076
We have a system to provide
quarantine and treatment.

1313
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,786
What will you do if the virus spreads?

1314
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:17,623
There's basically no treatment,
will Seoul have to evacuate?

1315
01:48:17,706 --> 01:48:20,918
Family members,
we will move to Seoul Air Base.

1316
01:48:21,585 --> 01:48:24,379
The airplane is going there. Let's go!

1317
01:48:26,465 --> 01:48:28,592
Meanwhile, on the Blue House's website,

1318
01:48:28,675 --> 01:48:32,554
a petition has been uploaded
arguing against the plane's landing,

1319
01:48:32,638 --> 01:48:35,390
given uncertainties
about the treatment's effectiveness,

1320
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:40,354
while simultaneously a rival petition
argues the plane should land and

1321
01:48:40,437 --> 01:48:42,898
passengers should receive treatment.

1322
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:43,899
ONLINE PETITION

1323
01:48:43,982 --> 01:48:47,110
He just rushed in, with his gun drawn...

1324
01:48:52,324 --> 01:48:53,784
More antivirus!

1325
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:55,661
More!

1326
01:49:00,499 --> 01:49:03,627
We're going to Seoul Air Base, right?

1327
01:49:05,879 --> 01:49:07,005
Do you hear me?

1328
01:49:08,173 --> 01:49:11,844
The landing site has changed.

1329
01:49:13,637 --> 01:49:17,432
What do you mean? It's not Seoul Air Base?

1330
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:26,108
Did something happen?

1331
01:49:26,483 --> 01:49:31,446
I'm told that at Seoul Air Base,
there are demonstrators.

1332
01:49:33,782 --> 01:49:35,242
Don't land!

1333
01:49:35,325 --> 01:49:37,828
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1334
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:41,832
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1335
01:49:41,915 --> 01:49:46,336
BIOCHEMICAL MISSILE KI501,
CITIZENS EXPRESS RAGE AT GOVERNMENT

1336
01:49:51,258 --> 01:49:53,010
PROTESTORS OCCUPY SEOUL AIR BASE

1337
01:49:53,093 --> 01:49:55,804
LANDING FOR WHO?

1338
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:03,103
- SHOOT IT DOWN WITH A MISSILE.
- STAY AWAY.

1339
01:50:06,899 --> 01:50:10,444
A 40% FATALITY RATE WILL KILL US ALL.
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LAND?

1340
01:50:14,656 --> 01:50:19,244
They're telling us to die?
We all need to survive.

1341
01:50:19,328 --> 01:50:21,246
Just trying to save themselves.

1342
01:50:22,122 --> 01:50:24,499
That's what you did, too.

1343
01:50:25,209 --> 01:50:27,252
When we were sick.

1344
01:50:32,841 --> 01:50:37,638
PROTESTORS UP AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS

1345
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:41,600
PROTESTORS SHOUT SLOGANS AT SEOUL AIR BASE

1346
01:50:43,227 --> 01:50:46,605
With the protests,
there are no airports where they can land.

1347
01:50:46,688 --> 01:50:50,025
They're just circling in the air now.

1348
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:54,530
Sergeant!

1349
01:50:56,698 --> 01:50:58,742
Oxygen levels are dropping.
More antiviral!

1350
01:50:58,825 --> 01:50:59,910
More antiviral!

1351
01:51:03,288 --> 01:51:05,749
Bloody hell.

1352
01:51:09,837 --> 01:51:11,505
- Captain.
- Yes?

1353
01:51:14,883 --> 01:51:16,969
No need to feel hurt.

1354
01:51:18,846 --> 01:51:20,138
For me too,

1355
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:25,394
my wife dying,

1356
01:51:26,895 --> 01:51:29,022
it wasn't your fault.

1357
01:51:30,315 --> 01:51:35,320
But I couldn't stop myself
from hating you.

1358
01:51:37,155 --> 01:51:38,949
At times like this,

1359
01:51:42,077 --> 01:51:45,372
people get weak and scared.

1360
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:52,838
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1361
01:51:52,921 --> 01:51:56,675
- No landing!
- No landing!

1362
01:51:56,758 --> 01:51:59,553
- Keep away!
- Keep away!

1363
01:52:00,762 --> 01:52:03,223
Why are you following us?

1364
01:52:03,307 --> 01:52:06,810
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1365
01:52:07,686 --> 01:52:09,146
Min-jung came too.

1366
01:52:12,482 --> 01:52:14,568
Why? Don't follow after us.

1367
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:20,199
FAMILIES ON THE MOVE DUE TO PROTESTS

1368
01:52:20,282 --> 01:52:24,745
THEY ARE OUR FAMILIES TOO!
PLEASE LET THEM LAND!

1369
01:52:24,828 --> 01:52:30,834
SOME PROTESTORS
IN FAVOR OF PLANE'S LANDING

1370
01:52:31,585 --> 01:52:34,421
There are also people saying
we should land.

1371
01:52:35,297 --> 01:52:37,132
Telling us to come back.

1372
01:52:38,759 --> 01:52:42,429
Is it really right for us to land?

1373
01:52:43,555 --> 01:52:48,060
What if we pass this on to all of them?

1374
01:52:51,104 --> 01:52:53,982
What are you talking about?

1375
01:52:54,066 --> 01:52:56,360
We still need to live!

1376
01:52:58,195 --> 01:53:00,155
I won't die this way.

1377
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:02,991
Yun-seok, look.

1378
01:53:03,075 --> 01:53:06,203
- Blisters. On your arm.
- Blisters...

1379
01:53:08,372 --> 01:53:10,082
But I wore gloves.

1380
01:53:11,959 --> 01:53:13,877
Let's not land.

1381
01:53:18,549 --> 01:53:20,467
Let's just not land.

1382
01:53:21,009 --> 01:53:23,637
What if my daughter and husband get sick?

1383
01:53:24,137 --> 01:53:25,806
Better for me to suffer.

1384
01:53:26,723 --> 01:53:28,350
Let's not land.

1385
01:53:34,773 --> 01:53:38,068
Doctor.

1386
01:53:40,362 --> 01:53:44,157
If we land, can we live?

1387
01:54:24,615 --> 01:54:26,158
- Soo-min.
- Dad!

1388
01:54:29,453 --> 01:54:32,289
Why are you crying? What's wrong?

1389
01:54:32,497 --> 01:54:37,002
Dad, can we just not land?

1390
01:54:38,629 --> 01:54:41,131
I don't want to infect my friends.

1391
01:54:41,215 --> 01:54:46,929
I always worried
my friends would catch eczema.

1392
01:54:50,015 --> 01:54:52,267
The passengers and flight crew

1393
01:54:53,477 --> 01:54:55,395
have all been infected.

1394
01:54:57,022 --> 01:55:01,777
They all say they don't want to land.

1395
01:55:02,694 --> 01:55:04,571
Because it's too dangerous.

1396
01:55:06,073 --> 01:55:07,783
They...

1397
01:55:10,661 --> 01:55:12,454
don't want to do that to others.

1398
01:55:28,387 --> 01:55:30,430
Do you have eczema, Dad?

1399
01:55:40,065 --> 01:55:43,402
Did you catch it from me?

1400
01:55:43,485 --> 01:55:44,987
I told you.

1401
01:55:46,071 --> 01:55:48,073
Eczema isn't contagious.

1402
01:55:54,121 --> 01:55:56,707
Even if we have to force
the protestors out,

1403
01:55:56,790 --> 01:55:58,709
we must land that plane.

1404
01:55:59,418 --> 01:56:02,296
There's a message being broadcast
from KI501.

1405
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:12,556
This is Sky Korea 501. Can you hear me?

1406
01:56:13,724 --> 01:56:14,933
We hear you.

1407
01:56:16,643 --> 01:56:20,564
All of us here aboard this plane

1408
01:56:21,523 --> 01:56:23,317
have decided not to land.

1409
01:56:27,779 --> 01:56:29,156
What do you mean?

1410
01:56:30,282 --> 01:56:31,950
For me as well,

1411
01:56:33,619 --> 01:56:35,495
everything happening now...

1412
01:56:38,999 --> 01:56:42,336
is shocking and frightening.

1413
01:56:45,172 --> 01:56:46,673
We know

1414
01:56:47,966 --> 01:56:51,678
what people on the ground are scared of.

1415
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:54,640
We don't resent them.

1416
01:56:56,433 --> 01:56:57,726
It's just that

1417
01:56:59,478 --> 01:57:03,482
we were caught in a disaster

1418
01:57:05,609 --> 01:57:07,486
that none of us wanted.

1419
01:57:11,865 --> 01:57:13,283
We are...

1420
01:57:15,786 --> 01:57:20,249
weak and frightened humans.

1421
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,757
But because we are human,

1422
01:57:33,637 --> 01:57:36,056
there are things that only we can do.

1423
01:57:39,059 --> 01:57:40,352
Now we intend...

1424
01:57:43,063 --> 01:57:45,566
to make a decision for everyone's sake.

1425
01:57:48,068 --> 01:57:49,570
This decision...

1426
01:57:53,824 --> 01:57:56,243
is to not give in to this disaster,

1427
01:57:57,744 --> 01:58:02,958
and make the honorable choice
with our humanity.

1428
01:58:06,211 --> 01:58:07,421
Therefore,

1429
01:58:10,257 --> 01:58:11,884
we won't land.

1430
01:58:16,763 --> 01:58:17,931
For the last time...

1431
01:58:20,976 --> 01:58:22,102
For the last time,

1432
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:24,605
we send our love

1433
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:29,860
to all our families.

1434
01:58:34,907 --> 01:58:37,075
Now we will end all communications.

1435
01:59:37,886 --> 01:59:39,346
Mom.

1436
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:46,436
Hello?

1437
01:59:47,187 --> 01:59:49,356
- Min-jung.
- Mom!

1438
01:59:49,982 --> 01:59:51,149
- Min-jung?
- Mom?

1439
01:59:51,233 --> 01:59:52,568
Mom, where are you?

1440
01:59:52,651 --> 01:59:55,612
Where are you? Mom...

1441
01:59:55,696 --> 02:00:00,492
I love you, Min-jung. I'm sorry.

1442
02:00:01,493 --> 02:00:03,745
Grandma, I'm so scared.

1443
02:00:05,414 --> 02:00:08,584
I'm sorry for saying your food tasted bad.

1444
02:00:09,710 --> 02:00:11,712
I miss your food.

1445
02:00:11,795 --> 02:00:17,801
I really looked forward
to our family trip.

1446
02:00:23,974 --> 02:00:27,978
Dad, those supplements I bought,
be sure to take them regularly.

1447
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:31,106
Jun-hyuk,
look after your mother and sister, okay?

1448
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:32,858
Look after them.

1449
02:00:32,941 --> 02:00:37,321
Behind there, I hid some money.

1450
02:00:37,863 --> 02:00:43,118
Buy the candy you like.

1451
02:00:43,202 --> 02:00:44,453
Hey!

1452
02:00:46,538 --> 02:00:47,915
I love you!

1453
02:00:49,708 --> 02:00:50,792
Min-jung?

1454
02:00:52,461 --> 02:00:53,712
Why doesn't it work?

1455
02:00:54,046 --> 02:00:55,255
Min-jung.

1456
02:00:57,382 --> 02:00:58,842
Min-jung, can you hear me?

1457
02:00:59,259 --> 02:01:00,469
Min-jung.

1458
02:01:01,929 --> 02:01:03,096
Min-jung.

1459
02:01:05,182 --> 02:01:06,475
Min-jung!

1460
02:02:12,040 --> 02:02:13,625
Sarge.

1461
02:02:16,837 --> 02:02:19,006
Tell them to come.

1462
02:02:22,759 --> 02:02:25,262
Tell them to come quickly.

1463
02:02:26,597 --> 02:02:29,391
He's improving. The antivirus is working!

1464
02:02:32,477 --> 02:02:35,564
- Is it certain?
- Tell them all to come back.

1465
02:02:36,398 --> 02:02:41,153
I'll take responsibility.
The antivirus is working.

1466
02:02:42,487 --> 02:02:44,448
Sergeant Koo is awake!

1467
02:02:49,077 --> 02:02:51,288
- Contact them quickly. Tell them to come!
- Yes, sir!

1468
02:02:51,538 --> 02:02:52,789
Sky Korea 501.

1469
02:02:52,873 --> 02:02:55,334
The treatment is effective.
Come back immediately.

1470
02:02:55,417 --> 02:02:57,628
We can't communicate!

1471
02:02:58,879 --> 02:03:02,424
We can't reach them.
Their radio's turned off!

1472
02:03:03,884 --> 02:03:05,928
The passengers' phones work, right?

1473
02:03:06,178 --> 02:03:08,138
Let the families know, quickly!

1474
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:13,060
We confirmed that the antiviral works!

1475
02:03:13,435 --> 02:03:17,731
We can't contact the plane,
so call your families and tell them.

1476
02:03:17,814 --> 02:03:19,233
Tell them to come back!

1477
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:23,987
Call your families! The treatment works!

1478
02:03:25,447 --> 02:03:27,658
- What's going on?
- Call right now.

1479
02:03:29,117 --> 02:03:31,370
Why can't I get through?

1480
02:03:40,504 --> 02:03:41,755
Text messages work!

1481
02:03:41,839 --> 02:03:44,216
We can't call, but text messages work!

1482
02:03:52,724 --> 02:03:54,101
They say to come back.

1483
02:03:55,310 --> 02:03:56,854
They say to come back!

1484
02:04:08,866 --> 02:04:10,325
This is L2, Im Tae-eun.

1485
02:04:10,409 --> 02:04:13,203
The antivirus works! They said it works!

1486
02:04:21,503 --> 02:04:23,505
This is Sky Korea 501.

1487
02:04:24,047 --> 02:04:26,341
I just heard some news
from the passengers.

1488
02:04:26,425 --> 02:04:27,551
Is it true?

1489
02:04:29,469 --> 02:04:32,764
It's been confirmed! Please come back now!

1490
02:04:34,641 --> 02:04:38,187
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me say to come back?

1491
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:40,314
Yes, I heard.

1492
02:04:42,107 --> 02:04:43,442
Thank you.

1493
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:58,248
Family members are cheering
and hugging each other.

1494
02:04:58,332 --> 02:05:01,460
Ladies and gentlemen,
the plane is now about to land.

1495
02:05:01,543 --> 02:05:04,838
Please return seats and tray-tables
to their full upright position,

1496
02:05:04,922 --> 02:05:08,050
and securely fasten your seatbelts.

1497
02:05:08,133 --> 02:05:12,554
Please remain calm,
and follow the flight crew's instructions.

1498
02:05:12,638 --> 02:05:14,848
Fasten your seatbelts please.

1499
02:05:14,932 --> 02:05:18,227
Please open the window blind
and fasten your seatbelts.

1500
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:21,647
Please leave dangerous objects
in our care.

1501
02:05:27,736 --> 02:05:31,782
Demonstrators are quickly clearing
from the air base.

1502
02:05:31,865 --> 02:05:35,452
Citizens are now welcoming
the plane's landing.

1503
02:05:39,414 --> 02:05:40,541
Do you hear me?

1504
02:05:41,041 --> 02:05:43,502
You're out of fuel,
so the engine may turn off.

1505
02:05:43,585 --> 02:05:46,380
You'll have to shut off power
and glide to the runway.

1506
02:05:49,967 --> 02:05:51,927
You should land at Suwon Air Base.

1507
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:56,348
If I'll be gliding,

1508
02:05:56,431 --> 02:06:01,270
from cruising altitude to landing,
I'll need about 20 minutes.

1509
02:06:01,895 --> 02:06:03,355
I won't make it that far.

1510
02:06:03,438 --> 02:06:05,440
You've got a tail wind,
so it should be fine.

1511
02:06:05,524 --> 02:06:08,694
I think Seongmu Airfield will be better.

1512
02:06:08,777 --> 02:06:10,946
I landed there years ago
when I did my training.

1513
02:06:11,029 --> 02:06:12,114
That's too close.

1514
02:06:12,197 --> 02:06:14,783
If you can't slow down,
you'll overshoot the runway.

1515
02:06:14,867 --> 02:06:18,328
With a tail wind, and only one runway,
it's too dangerous!

1516
02:06:20,706 --> 02:06:22,708
It's a head wind right now.

1517
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:25,460
The wind keeps changing direction
every ten minutes.

1518
02:06:25,961 --> 02:06:27,796
Is that forecast accurate?

1519
02:06:37,389 --> 02:06:40,767
To hell with it. I'm going to Seongmu.

1520
02:06:41,435 --> 02:06:45,272
Hey, First Officer Choi!
I'm going to Seongmu.

1521
02:06:54,698 --> 02:06:55,991
Honestly,

1522
02:06:56,825 --> 02:07:00,412
I'm so sorry to you about what happened,

1523
02:07:00,746 --> 02:07:03,916
but however much I think of it,

1524
02:07:04,458 --> 02:07:06,376
I made the right decision back then.

1525
02:07:06,919 --> 02:07:08,420
I think so, too.

1526
02:07:14,051 --> 02:07:16,094
I'd have done the same.

1527
02:07:27,898 --> 02:07:29,441
We're going to Seongmu.

1528
02:07:30,108 --> 02:07:31,026
It's too dangerous!

1529
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:33,862
He'll be coming in fast,
and the brakes might not work.

1530
02:07:33,946 --> 02:07:37,407
If he can't reduce his speed,
they'll crash beyond the runway.

1531
02:07:42,329 --> 02:07:44,581
He's already turned the plane.

1532
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:48,043
No choice now.

1533
02:07:48,544 --> 02:07:50,754
They're going to Seongmu, get ready!

1534
02:07:52,464 --> 02:07:55,843
This just in. Facing a fuel shortage,

1535
02:07:55,926 --> 02:08:00,514
KI501 has changed course
and will land at Seongmu Airfield.

1536
02:08:10,232 --> 02:08:13,151
They've lost power.
They must be almost out of fuel.

1537
02:08:20,409 --> 02:08:21,869
What's happening?

1538
02:08:22,244 --> 02:08:24,037
What's going on?

1539
02:08:27,541 --> 02:08:29,918
They're gone from the radar.
The engine has turned off.

1540
02:08:30,002 --> 02:08:31,420
Can you detect any radio waves?

1541
02:08:34,548 --> 02:08:37,968
They're gliding now with the engines off.

1542
02:08:42,097 --> 02:08:44,308
- They're headed for the runway!
- It's too fast.

1543
02:08:44,391 --> 02:08:46,393
At this speed
they'll shoot past the runway!

1544
02:09:00,115 --> 02:09:02,159
They've turned from the runway!

1545
02:09:12,252 --> 02:09:15,005
He's circling to reduce velocity.

1546
02:09:16,006 --> 02:09:17,716
What's my altitude reading?

1547
02:09:18,383 --> 02:09:20,761
- Eight thousand feet.
- Distance to runway?

1548
02:09:20,844 --> 02:09:22,054
Six miles.

1549
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:50,666
The wind is changing.

1550
02:09:50,916 --> 02:09:53,460
The speed is decreasing.
Now's the time to land!

1551
02:09:58,882 --> 02:10:01,510
It's turned again. It missed the landing!

1552
02:10:02,928 --> 02:10:05,389
- What the...
- I'm going around one more time.

1553
02:10:05,472 --> 02:10:07,933
The altitude is plunging.
They're going to crash!

1554
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,968
The engine just turned on.

1555
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:45,846
It seems they still had some fuel!

1556
02:12:41,211 --> 02:12:44,339
Well, based on
Ryu Jin-seok's internet search history,

1557
02:12:44,756 --> 02:12:48,677
and data received from
a forensic restoration of his hard drive,

1558
02:12:49,428 --> 02:12:52,514
it seems
that after the death of his mother,

1559
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:57,686
he became confused,
lost his sense of identity

1560
02:12:57,769 --> 02:13:00,647
and then began to plan this attack.

1561
02:13:00,731 --> 02:13:02,274
What are your thoughts?

1562
02:13:04,401 --> 02:13:08,572
Isn't that just speculation?

1563
02:13:09,489 --> 02:13:12,117
It could just all be nonsense.

1564
02:13:12,201 --> 02:13:14,828
I'm asking for your opinion.

1565
02:13:15,287 --> 02:13:17,247
You must have one.

1566
02:13:17,331 --> 02:13:19,958
If you're asking what I think,

1567
02:13:21,335 --> 02:13:26,590
I can't understand or speculate
why a normal person

1568
02:13:27,049 --> 02:13:30,802
would decide to kill 150 people.

1569
02:13:30,886 --> 02:13:33,680
But there exist some people

1570
02:13:35,015 --> 02:13:39,770
who are steeped in a vice beyond reason.

1571
02:13:40,854 --> 02:13:45,025
And they can take away those
who are precious to us.

1572
02:13:46,151 --> 02:13:47,528
Well, anyway,

1573
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:52,366
that's a question for the Minister
of the Interior and Safety.

1574
02:13:53,283 --> 02:13:58,622
I think Sergeant Koo's sacrifice
was also remarkable,

1575
02:13:58,705 --> 02:14:02,918
though the amount of virus he injected
was so large.

1576
02:14:03,377 --> 02:14:07,548
I understand
he's no longer able to function normally?

1577
02:14:07,631 --> 02:14:11,718
You ordered the landing
without full verification.

1578
02:14:11,802 --> 02:14:13,220
As a public official,

1579
02:14:13,303 --> 02:14:16,223
don't you think
it was too risky a decision?

1580
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:24,439
That's why I resigned.

1581
02:14:44,543 --> 02:14:47,880
- Hello!
- Soo-min, there you are!

1582
02:14:49,506 --> 02:14:50,674
Hello!

1583
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:53,260
- Hello.
- He's doing good, right?

1584
02:14:53,343 --> 02:14:56,388
Sure, he's in the back. Everyone's there.

1585
02:15:20,954 --> 02:15:22,039
How is he?

1586
02:15:22,789 --> 02:15:24,041
Almost all better now.

1587
02:15:24,124 --> 02:15:29,463
Doctor says he's so strong-willed,
he'll be breathing on his own soon.

1588
02:15:29,796 --> 02:15:31,882
Did you see him move his arm now?

1589
02:15:31,965 --> 02:15:33,217
- Really?
- Yes.

1590
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,344
Soon he'll be washing his face,

1591
02:15:35,427 --> 02:15:38,680
and when Min-jung gets married,
he'll probably be walking!
