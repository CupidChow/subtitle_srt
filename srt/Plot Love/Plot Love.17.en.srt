Come on!

00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,539
Let's dance!

6
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,380
Just dance!

7
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,880
Boss, why are you here?

8
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,340
Join us!

9
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,460
- Join us!
- Come on!

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Again!

11
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,700
I really appreciated your hard work in the course of working with Sia.

12
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,740
Thank you so much.

13
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,970
If you have any needs,

14
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,780
you can speak out,

15
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,320
and the company will try to meet them,

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,060
as a reward for you.

17
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,150
In addition,

18
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,890
tell me

19
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,700
your work goals for the next quarter

20
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,620
and your life plans.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
What plan?

22
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,940
What?

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,260
I'll be the first.

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm going to work really hard.

25
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,460
I'll do whatever

26
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
the boss wants me to do next quarter.

27
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,820
As for the ideal of life,

28
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,740
I want to be a winner,

29
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,180
just like Mr. Lu.

30
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,190
I want to have a wife and a child.

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,720
Good.

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,390
Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,650
A winner.

34
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,660
Mr. Lu.

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,250
I've always been a hard worker.

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,700
But look at me,

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,260
I'm still single.

38
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,260
Some of the people I met in blind dates a few years ago

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,820
now have children of several years old.

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,300
But I don't even have a boyfriend.

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,060
Well.

42
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,620
From next week,

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,780
we will adopt 996 work schedule.

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,850
What?

45
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,090
Don't take it seriously.

46
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,460
Mr. Lu was joking.

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,140
It's getting late.

48
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,780
Chris must be waiting for us at home.

49
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,310
Let's go.

50
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,980
Excuse us.

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,040
Enjoy yourselves.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,150
Let's go.

53
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,460
- Goodbye, Mr. Lu.
- Goodbye.

54
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,390
Goodbye, Mr. Lu.

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
He scared me.

56
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,720
I dare not speak out of turn again.

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,690
It's so boring to drink tea here.

58
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,660
Why don't we get back to the party?

59
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,300
Let's go.

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,700
Yeah.

61
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,620
Let's go.

62
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,750
Go, go, go.

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,960
Off you go. I want to go home and get some rest.

64
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,500
I think someone is afraid

65
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,730
that she can't drink as much as I do.

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,590
You're afraid.

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,460
Let's go. I'm not afraid of you.

68
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,740
You sissy boy.

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,140
Don't brag in front of me.

70
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,020
I'll eat my hat

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,950
if I don't teach you a lesson today.

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,780
I'm so afraid...

73
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,760
that you drink yourself to death!

74
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,650
Go.

75
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,580
Talk nicely, and let go of me.

76
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
8 sixes.

77
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,700
9 sixes.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,700
Open it.

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,740
Drink.

80
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,900
I'll teach you a lesson today.

81
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,040
Such a macho woman. I'm not afraid of you.

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,700
Another round!

83
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,580
Fine.

84
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,750
You lost, so you call first.

85
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,130
Three ones.

86
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,020
Open it!

87
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,340
I don't have any.

88
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,740
I have three!

89
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,460
Drink.

90
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,380
Fine! No big deal!

91
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Didn't you just try to teach me a lesson?

92
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,660
Drink.

93
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,320
Do you dare to play another round?

94
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,660
You must be afraid.

95
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,900
You're afraid.

96
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,340
- Twenty.
- Fifteen.

97
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,260
- Fifteen, twenty. Fifteen.
- Fifteen, twenty. Fifteen.

98
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,290
- Fifteen, twenty.
- Fifteen, twenty.

99
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,090
- Fifteen.
- Twenty.

100
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,630
Drink.

101
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,650
Do it.

102
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,340
Weren't you awesome just now?

103
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,340
Go on.

104
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,260
Go on!

105
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,980
- Fifteen, twenty.
- Fifteen, twenty.

106
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,450
- Fifteen.
- Twenty.

107
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,580
Drink.

108
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,260
Drink.

109
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,660
No!

110
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,420
I'm really not ready.

111
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,740
Wait!

112
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,860
I have one request.

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,580
Cut it out.

114
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,780
This macho woman...

115
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,480
[Eminence Group]

116
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,020
You...

117
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,380
Did you sleep together?

118
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,260
No. I was just messing with him.

119
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,420
Look how small he is!

120
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,850
Nah.

121
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,580
Then why did you pay him?

122
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,100
At least he was being my servant

123
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,660
for all night,

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,060
so there's got to be a tip.

125
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,840
Well, his services are really cheap.

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,860
249 yuan

127
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,180
for one night's service.

128
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,980
That's all I had.

129
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,580
I only had 249 yuan with me,

130
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,920
and I gave it all to him.

131
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,300
Macho woman, come with me.

132
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,780
I need to talk to your assistant.

133
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,380
Go then.

134
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,220
But be careful.

135
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,380
His small body

136
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,540
won't be able to take your "ravage".

137
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,420
What's the matter?

138
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,140
You...

139
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,060
What kind of woman are you?

140
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,100
Why did you pay me?

141
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,490
You got laid.

142
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,420
You got laid!

143
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,820
In fact,

144
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,299
they are the same.

145
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,539
It's just

146
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,100
a natural thing.

147
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,260
It's a one-night stand. It doesn't matter.

148
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,980
Fine.

149
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,500
We got laid.

150
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,700
And even if it was the tip you gave me,

151
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:56,910
then...

152
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,190
why did you give me 249 yuan?

153
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,780
I'm...

154
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,530
I'm not even worth 250 yuan, am I?
(In Chinese, the number of 250 means "fool".)

155
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,100
So it's all about money.

156
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,140
So what?

157
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,310
Do you want to get laid again

158
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,720
and I'll make up for it?

159
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,340
You...

160
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,800
What kind of woman are you?

161
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,700
- What are they doing?
- What?

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,020
Look.

163
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,420
You...

164
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,060
You...

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,660
You know what? I'll give you another yuan.

166
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,620
Check it out.

167
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,620
What?

168
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,890
After all,

169
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,900
Your skills are worth 250 yuan.

170
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,820
You...You...You...

171
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,780
You...

172
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,500
Go. Go. Go.

173
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,540
Good morning, SA Yun.

174
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,100
Good morning, SA Yun.

175
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,910
- Good morning.
- What's wrong?

176
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,580
Good morning, SA Yun.

177
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,860
SA Yun.

178
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,940
SA Yun.

179
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,060
What?

180
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,860
250 SA.

181
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,820
You...

182
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,340
You're very good, huh?

183
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,260
You not only preyed somebody close to you,

184
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,990
but got yourself a cactus lady.

185
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,790
Do you think I enjoy doing this?

186
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,790
I was trying to placate your staff.

187
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,880
Sophistry doesn't work on me.

188
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,980
Look what a mess

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,100
you've made of the company.

190
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,300
It's inappropriate.

191
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
I don't care. I'm taking a vacation.

192
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,620
Now it's time for you to cash in on

193
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,150
my two-week trip to Europe.

194
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,150
I can't stay here anymore.

195
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,180
I have to stay away from trouble.

196
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,020
You'll get the reward you want.

197
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,540
Really?

198
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,790
Thank you, Boss!

199
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,000
Stop. Let's get down to business.

200
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,700
How's Gu's Group?

201
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,870
The second child of the Gu's Family is in charge now, and there's a reshuffle of power.

202
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,700
As I expected.

203
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,180
He's the biggest beneficiary

204
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,740
of our fight.

205
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,060
He's not as simple as he seems.

206
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,220
Be careful in the future.

207
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,540
You don't have to worry about others' business.

208
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,900
Mind your own business.

209
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,250
I have been urged several times

210
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,460
by the foreign doctors I contacted before,

211
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,720
asking when you will have the operation.

212
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,290
I want to remember her

213
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,900
more than curing my eyes.

Finally, this is the day.

219
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,360
I wish I could be with you like this every day.

220
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,380
When it's over,

221
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,260
I'll be with you forever.

222
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,190
It's getting late. You better go home.

223
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,660
When will I get to work for you?

224
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,180
I learned a lot from my master.

225
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm sure I can help you in Gu's Group.

226
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,460
No.

227
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,860
I need you to find a way to stay with Su Bei first.

228
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,620
I don't want to.

229
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,180
But I would do anything for you.

230
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,980
- Sister.
- Come here.

231
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,680
- Sit here.
- I asked you here today

232
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,620
because I need your help.

233
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,140
You're one of us.

234
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
You can speak freely.

235
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,420

and the company is in liquidation.

237
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,510
I didn't mean to bother you,

238
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,380
but

239
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,780
after all these years with Master,

240
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,220
I knew nothing

241
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,710
but how to make clothes.

242
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,500
So...

243
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,100
I'd like you to find me a job.

244
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,580
That's what you've been hesitating about

245
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,900
all this time.

246
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,840
I really don't want to bother you.

247
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,180
You know what.

248
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,140
I'm working on the case of Sia.

249
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,260
And you

250
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,460
have experience with this.

251
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,720
Why don't you come to Eminence to help me?

252
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,500
Really?

253
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,140
Thank you, sister.

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,140
you have to work hard in Eminence.

Well. This is too noisy.

Look at you. You look like Santa Claus.

I've been planning to visit Chris,

349
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,900
but I've been held up

350
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,760
by a lot of work.

351
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,950
Here. Chris.

Thank you, uncle.

Thank you.

357
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,740
We should be the ones visiting you.

Thank you for saving Chris's life.

And I like Chris.

Chris doesn't like you.

363
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,940
I do like Uncle Gu.

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,060
Don't make fun of me.

367
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,180
I'd still like you

368
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,780
to drop in more often.

369
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,320
I look forward to working with you again.

She is busy.

371
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,420
Then I'll invite Chris who's not busy.

372
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,540
You know what,

373
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,380
how about next time

374
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,340
I take you to see that giant, giant model?

375
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,020
Yes!

376
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,860
Get up.

377
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,460
Are you done talking?

378
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,390
Don't disturb our family life.

379
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,390

568
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,820
just talk to Mr. Gu.

569
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,380
If you want to

570
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,740
do it,

571
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,700
don't think about putting on personas.

572
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,140
Or the loss will outweight the gain.

573
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,180
Okay.

574
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,580
Well, since we already know each other,

575
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,860
I'll leave you to it.

576
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,740
Looking forward to hearing from you.

577
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,570
Don't let Mr. Gu down.

578
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,060
Jiajia.

579
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,220
Sister.

580
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
Who was that?

581
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,220
She looked familiar.
