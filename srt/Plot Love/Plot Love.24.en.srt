00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,460
I have something very important

193
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,120
to tell you.

Keep it secret from her.

What are you hiding again?

198

Nothing.

199
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,110
It's just...

for the sake of Chris and I,

235

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,620
No.

384
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,620
I lied.

385
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,420
If they ever bully you again,

386
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,290
just tell me,

387
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,690
and I'll beat them up for you.

388
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,490
Yes.

389
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,740
This is for you.

390
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,410
We are good friends from now on.

391
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:30,980
Slowly.

392
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,420
I bought plenty more.

393
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,260
Lu Nan.

394
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,220
The cake you bought is so delicious.

395
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,860
It's the best thing I've ever eaten in the world.

396
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,460
Next time I'll bring you a burger.

397
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,620
It's better.

398
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
What's a burger?

399
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,460
It's bread with meat in it.

400
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,100
Anyway, it's delicious.

401
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,180
It's very kind of you, Lu Nan.

402
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,370
When I grow up,

403
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,230
I'll share my food with you.

404
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,060
Deal.

405
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,750
Where are your parents?

406
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,350
Why do they leave you alone?

407
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
I don't have parents.

408
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't be sad.

409
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,660
I'll ask my mom and dad

410
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,220
to be your mom and dad too.

411
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,820
Really?

412
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:05,850
Yes.

413
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,220
Let's go.

414
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Come home with me.

415
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,460
No.

416
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,420
I live in the orphan asylum.

417
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,410
If you want me to go home with you,

418
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,180
your parents have to adopt me.

419
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,820
What is "adopt"?

420
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,540
It means I'm gonna live in your house,

421
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,870
be with you all the time.

422
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,940
I promise.

423
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,740
Wait for me.

424
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,730
I'll ask my mom and dad to adopt you when I get home,

425
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,740
so no one will dare to bully you.

426
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,840
I have a lot of delicious food at home.

427
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,590
I'll be waiting for you.

428
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,510
[Basic Information Form for Children in Orphan Asylum]

429
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,660
Here.

430
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,590
Have some water.

431
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,570
Is that all?

432
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,590
There were other children,

433
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,820
but they got sick

434
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,000
and didn't qualify for adoption.

435
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,020
Impossible.

436
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,220
He said he lives here.

437
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,660
There, there. Don't cry.

438
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:05,540
Okay.

439
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,400
This is for you.

440
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,580
And this.

441
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,420
Let's go.

442
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,620
I'll take you to play.

443
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,460
The little girl is very caring.

444
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,210
We want her.

445
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,100
Mom.

446
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,860
Not her.

447
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,470
I promised little mouse

448
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,700
to ask you and dad

449
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,260
to be his mom and dad too.

450
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,420
You see,

451
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,580
we've been looking for so long,

452
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,440
but we haven't found your friend.

453
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,680
Maybe he was adopted by someone else.

454
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,380
You'll have

455
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,980
a pretty little sister keep you company.

456
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,110
You can't be that wayward as a brother.

457
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,540
Wang Ying will be under your shelter in the future.

458
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,140
You're gonna be brother and sister.

459
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,740
You'll have to take care of your little sister, Nan Nan.

460

Lu Nan.

461
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,500
Lu Nan.

462
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,780
Lu Nan. I'm here.

463
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,020
Brother.

464
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm hungry.

465
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,700
Wait.

466
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,510
There is a burger in my bag.

467
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,410
Lu Nan.

468
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,420
Lu Nan. I'm here.

469
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,580
Lu Nan, the burger is mine!

470
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,790
Thank you, brother.

471
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,860
Let's go home.

472
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,080
For the ride ahead.

473
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,500
Lu Nan.

474
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,460
Bye.

475
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,860
Bye.

476
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,570
Lu Nan.

477
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,500
Lu Nan. You can't go.

478
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,780
Lu Nan.

479
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,580
Little mouse,

480
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,420
you're still ill,

481
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,480
why did you get out?

482
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,060
Lu Nan.

483
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,460
you can't go.

484
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,980
You promised your family will adopt me.

485
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,940
Lu Nan.

486
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,340
You're not feeling well.

487
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,060
Little mouse.

488
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,300
So you were little mouse.

489
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,300
But why are you like this?

490
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,100
Why am I like this?

491
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,640
I was waiting for you at that time.

492
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
You promised me

493
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,420
to ask your parents

494
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,700
to be mine too.

495
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,800
If I had been the one adopted by your parents,

496
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,950
I wouldn't have been adopted by the Gu family.

497
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,060
The Gu family is rich and powerful.

498
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,690
Besides,

499
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,540
you are the chairman's biological son after all.

500
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,620
If you're adopted by him,

501
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,750
you'll never starve

502
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,580
or be bullied any more.

503
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,510
This toy is not for you to play with!

504
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,710
[Little Gu Chengze]

505
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,260
You don't deserve to play with toys!

506
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,140
Go clean the toilet.

507
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,780
Piss off.

508
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,860
After I was adopted by the Gu family,

509
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,960
I was treated as a servant.

510
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,420
They scolded me and punished me whenever they wanted.

511
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,430
I was hospitalized several times.

512
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,800
Once they didn't even feed me for three days.

513
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,100
Why isn't he here yet?

514
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:51,990
Brother,

515
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
are you not happy?

516
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,100
Brother,

517
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,780
I want to eat that burger.

518
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,780
It's yummy.

519
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,620
When I came to see you,

520
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,660
you were having fun with someone else

521
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
and totally forgot about me.

522
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
I'm just an illegitimate child.

523
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,470
All these years in Gu's family,

524
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,160
I was treated worse than a dog.

525
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,590
The kid only scolded and hit me.

526
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,190
But grown-ups know how to make my life a living hell.

527
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,180
Back then,

528
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,980
every time I was bullied by the bastard Gu Chengze,

529
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
I would come here,

530
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,500
a place where you used to take me to play.

531
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,480
But you know what I saw.

532
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,140
I saw Lu Fei'er next to you.

533
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,500
I saw you take Lu Fei'er to play.

534
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,660
I saw you give her my favorite burger.

535
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,500
So happy you were,

536
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,180
and so much I hate you.

537
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Because of this,

538
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,600
you came back for revenge?

539
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,680
Is that not enough?

540
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,980
If it hadn't been for your betrayal,

541
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,850
I wouldn't have suffered so many years.

542
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,180
Why can you live happily

543
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,210
and I have to live like that?

544
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,540
You think you're above me, aren't you?

545
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,800
So I'm going to trample you under my feet.

546
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm gonna take everything from you.

547
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,460
Your company,

548
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,660
your marriage,

549
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,980
and your family.

550
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,120
I came back to look for you.

551
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,900
But you were not there.

552
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,020
So we adopted Lu Fei'er.

553
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,820
I went back to the orphan asylum to look for you.

554
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,700
But the dean told me

555
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,780
you were adopted by your biological father,

556
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,100
and lived happily.

557
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,950
You think I'll believe in these bullshit?

558
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,420
So you wanna tell me

559
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,060
all these years

560
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,220
all the grudges

561
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,100
are a total misunderstanding?

562
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,060
I'm not stupid.

563
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,180
Lu Nan.

564
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,900
Lu Nan.

565
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,780
I'm not the simple little mouse I was!

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,980
Dad.

567
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,740
Chris.

568
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,700
Chris.

569
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,940
Watch out!

570
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,500
Chris.

571

759
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,580
you're a married woman.

760
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,480
♫ on the way home. ♫

761
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,330
Who allowed you to dress like that?

762
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,600
♫ Our shadows under the street lamps ♫

763
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,300
My body,

764
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,740
my rules.

765
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,160
♫ fade away. ♫

766
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,840
Let me tell you something.

767
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,820
That's not right.

768
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,460
It should follow my rules.

769
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,910
♫ Cold air is coming, ♫

770
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,820
Cover it up.

771
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,540
Cover it up.

772
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,100
No.

773
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,890
♫ and leaves are falling. ♫

774
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,700
Cover it up.

775
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,090
No.

776
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:14,780
Then you can't dress like that.

777
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,220
No.

778
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,100
You can't dress like that.

779
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,410
♫ I wish I could see you ♫

780
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,780
Cover it up.

781
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,060
♫ when I turn around. ♫

782
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,310
♫ We both consider ourselves lucky. ♫

783
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,090
♫ We think it's better to have than to lose. ♫

784
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,980
Let me teach you.

785
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,120
♫ We naively let down our guard ♫

786
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,740
Da Hai. (Ocean)

787
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,060
Da Hai. Da Hai. Da Hai.

788
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,970
♫ and gave our heart away. ♫

789
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,190
♫ If we go back where we were, ♫

790
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,620
♫ will we meet again? ♫

791
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:54,050
♫ Will we still let waiting become an addiction? ♫

792
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,540
Ms. Su.

793
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,750
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

794
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,220
Yes.

795
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,980
Dear Mr. Jealousy.

796
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,780
♫ We're reluctant to believe ♫

797
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,440
♫ that dreams can be shattered so easily. ♫

798
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,300
♫ We thought holding on to those memories ♫

799
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,490
♫ was enough. ♫

800
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,780
Not for children.

801
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,610
♫ Worries lie gently in the bottom of my heart. ♫

802
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,390
Not for children.

803
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:16,310
♫ Tears fall lightly to the ground. ♫

804
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,240
♫ Time is like heavy rain ♫

805
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,070
♫ that irrigates lies, making them addictive. ♫

806
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,970
♫ There's nothing I can do. ♫

807
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,380
♫ And I can't bear to hear from you any more. ♫

808
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:43,440
♫ I am rational, but missing has become an addiction.♫

809
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:46,080
[The End]
