00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,539
How do I feel

5
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,940
it was a trap set by Lu Nan?

6
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,300
He deliberately let me know

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,900
and then led me into the game.

8
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,259
Brother, cool down.

9
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,259
Didn't dad take care of everything?

10
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,259
What's the point?

11
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,420
He bailed me out,

12
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,060
but the board of directors kicked me out.

13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,660
I can't go to the company now.

14
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,560
You‘re happy now, are you?

15
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,380
Anyway,

16
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,340
I'm gonna go home

17
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,000
and wash off the misfortunes.

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,310
Brother.

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,389
You can't go home right now.

20
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,580
I have to take you straight to the airport.

21
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,310
Dad asked me to send you abroad.

22
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,900
What?

23
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,380
Pull over!

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,579
I asked you to pull over!

00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,100
What did he mean?

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,550
I don't know.

27
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,820
When can I come back?

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,620
He didn't say. He just asked me to send you away.

29
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,420
Lu Nan, I'm not done with you!

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,300
Brother, you'd better put up with it.

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,820
We can't fight Lu Nan now.

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,300

If you are not aggressive,

66

Why don't they ask me what I think?

00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,490
So annoying.

77

Forget it.

But don't you know I'm a kid?

97
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,860
Kids have to be in car seats.

98

If I don't take the child seat,

99
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,700

Where are we going to eat?

109
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,060
Do we eat fried chicken

110
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,740
or fried chicken?

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,300
My mom is not here,

112
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,580

Gu's Group is in disarray now.

The company's net profit has plummeted.

117

If at this point

118
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,060
Liu Qianying terminated her contract with us,

119
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,740
companies that value Liu Qianying's online traffic

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,140
would follow suit.

121
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,960
So about Liu Qianying,

122
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,790

I'll thank you in advance.

127

I can only promise to try my best.

128

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,700
Why did you order the hot wings?

133
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,020
I told you I couldn't eat spicy food.

OK. I see.

My brother got out of the detention today.

I don't know the details.

169
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,180

saying he did all those things.

192
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,780
Is Chris with you right now?

193
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,540
No.

194
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,420
He's probably out playing.

195
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,280
What happened?

196
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,180
I help you. Who do you want to call?

197
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,820
Lu Nan.

198
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,980
[Lu Nan]

199
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,630
[Gu Yan]

200
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,460
Hello.

201
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,340
Hello.

202
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,340
Where are you?

203
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
Why do you use his cellphone?

204
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,940
Lu Nan, go to the construction hovel right now.

205
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,740
Immediately!

206
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,580
Chris was kidnapped.

207
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,420
Maybe it's Gu Chengze.

208
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,170
I'll tell my father.

209
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,570
And I'll get to you later.

210
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,060
What happened?

211
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,260
Chris was kidnapped. Gu Chengze did it.

212
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,890
- Chris. Chris.
- Chris.

213
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,740
Let me go! Let me go!

214
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,100
Chris!

215
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,620
Stop!

216
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,820
Save me!

217
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,270
Don't be afraid! Mommy's here!

218
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,540
Well.

219
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,980
Your kid is here.

220
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,620
Stop!

221
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,700
Come on.

222
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,540
Let's make a deal.

223
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,740
I'll give you what you want.

224
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,680
You want money, right?

225
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,820
I'll give you whatever you want.

226
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,420
I'm short of money now.

227
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,260
But I don't want money today.

228
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,220
Lu Nan,

229
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,700
seeing your son being in my hand,

230
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,820
you're freaked out?

231
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,280
You can be scared too, huh?

232
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,580
Lu Nan,

233
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,780
I...

234
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,860
I...

235
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,300
Save people first.

236
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,760
We'll talk about it later.

237
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,700
Tell me,

238
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,350
what do you want?

239
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,340
You're straightforward.

240
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,700
But I'm afraid you can't do it.

241
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
My son.

242
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,320
I would sacrifice my life for him.

243
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,500
Manly!

244
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,620
Here. Kneel down.

245
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm talking to you.

246
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,440
I ask you to kneel down.

247
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,550
All that rhetoric was for nothing?

248
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,620
Lu Nan. Lu Nan.

249
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,820
Why weren't you so obedient before?

250
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,150
Come on.

251
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,660
Slap yourself.

252
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,980
Satisfied?

253
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,820
No.

254
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,780
What do you want?

255
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:28,890
Come on.

256
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,980
Slap

257
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,820
until I'm satisfied.

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:34,980
No!

259
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,500
The commanding president of Eminence

260
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
also has this day!

261
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,780
Arrogant!

262
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,940
Aren't you the best browbeater?

263
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,400
Being a coward now?

264
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm telling you

265
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,920
don't mess with everyone you met.

266
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,070
Restrain yourself.

267
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,460
And keep a low profile.

268
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,540
If I post this video,

269
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,020
you're gonna be the laughingstock of Nanxi.

270
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,750
Harder! Put some elbow into it.

271
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,580
OK.

272
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm satisfied.

273
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
When you want to get angry in the future,

274
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,160
think about today,

275
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,180
think about when you're ashamed.

276
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,310
Restrain yourself.

277
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I'm kind.

278
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,260
Playing,

279
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,440
is just to have fun.

280
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,090
Go. Pick up the child.

281
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,590
You dare to call the police!

282
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:39,930
Go!

283
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,420
Mommy, save me!

284
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:45,940
Go!

285
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,780
Don't hurt him, please!

286
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,460
Mommy.

287
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,620
Don't want your child?

288
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,880
Don't want your child?

289
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,180
Stand back!

290
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,660
Mommy!

291
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,940
Let the police go, or I'll kill him!

292
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,540
Calm down!

293
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,670
I tell the police

294
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,540
to let them go.

295
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,920
Don't hurt him!

296
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,540
Let the police go!

297
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,940
Mommy!

298
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,460
Gu Chengze!

299
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,980
You've challenged my bottom line over and over again.

300
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,510
Do you think I‘m afraid to do something to you?

301
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,640
How do you know it's me?

302
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:42,770
Chris!

303
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,940
Mommy.

304
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,540
Don't cry.

305
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,260
Don't cry. It's Ok now.

306
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,060
You called the police?

307
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,540
Yes.

308
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,740
I think it's only right to call the police.

309
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,860
Mommy.

310
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,100
I hope so.

311
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,020
Don't cry.

312
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,859
Don't cry.

313
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,170
Come on, time for bed.

314
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,819
Bei Bei,

315
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,099
will you stay with me?

316
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,300
OK. Mommy won't go.

317
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,660
Bei Bei.

318
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,099
I want to go back to Italy.

319
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,860
Why, babe?

320
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,980
What brings you back to Italy?

321
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,060
Bei Bei.

322
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,020
This is not my home.

323
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,170
Daddy doesn't love me either.

324
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,220
Why did you say that?

325
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,820
Why doesn't daddy love you?

326
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Bei Bei.

327
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,620
He didn't save me.

328
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,930
He doesn't love me.

329
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,780
Sorry, Chris. It's mommy's fault.

330
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,410
Mommy didn't tell daddy that

331
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,860
Chris is his child.

332
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,820
So daddy didn't save you.

333
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,180
Forgive mommy, Ok?

334
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,580
Does he really hate Chris that much?

335
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,660
Daddy likes you very much!

336
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,940
How could he hate you?

337
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,540
Daddy and mommy promise that

338
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,600
we'll be good to you in the future, Ok?

339
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,180
I only want Bei Bei.

340
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,940
Chris.

341
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,460
Get some sleep. You will be fine when you wake up tomorrow.

342
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,940
Sleep.

343
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,500
Come on.

344
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,900
Did he sleep?

345
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,260
I didn't expect

346
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,860
I was wrong.

347
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,930
I'll love him

348
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,560
and make up for him.

349
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,880
You're gonna be a good father.

350
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,260
Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:42,620
When I knew I was pregnant seven years ago,

352
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,900
I called you.

353
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
But it was Lu Fei'er who answered it.

354
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,140
She told me

355
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,700
you never wanted to

356
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,140
hear from me.

357
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,580
I didn't know

358
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,060
you were in coma

359
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,780
I was heart-broken.

360
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,180
And I almost lost the baby.

361
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,900
I haven't contacted you again.

362
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,190
You should have told me when you came back.

363
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,690
As his father,

364
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,150
I have the right to know.

365
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,300
I didn't tell you

366
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,020
because I was afraid you would take him away from me.

367
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,500
He's the only reason

368
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,820
that keeps me alive in this world.

369
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,220
I can't imagine

370
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,580
living

371
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,540
without him.

372
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,980
Don't you think

373
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,240
you're being selfish?

374
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,230
You only think of yourself.

375
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,260
Have you ever thought of me and the baby?

376
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,780
He needs a father.

377
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,020
And I

378
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,190
should do what a father needs to do.

379
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,660
I wanted to tell you,

380
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,750
but I never had the right opportunity.

381
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,660
Later on,

382
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,940
I was more and more afraid to face this problem.

383
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,110
I was afraid of affecting your condition,

384
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,020
and I was even more afraid that you would ignore me.

385
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,100
Do you really underestimate my love for you?

386
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,820
Sorry.

387
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,300
Fool.

388
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,290
I never want

389
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,140
your sorry.

390
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,700
Chris, morning.

391
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,920
Why don't you have breakfast?

392
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,540
I have no appetite at the sight of you.

393
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,000
You can't skip breakfast.

394
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,340
Come on. Daddy will have breakfast with you today.

395
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,820
This is Bei Bei's seat.

396
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,980
This is also Bei Bei's seat.

397
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
Bei Bei can't take

398
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,860
two seats.

399
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,580
You're being unreasonable.

400
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,380
You used to be unreasonable.

401
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,890
Fine, where do you want me to sit?

402
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,300
There.

403
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,500
OK.

404
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,380
If I sat over there,

405
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,580
would you be happier?

406
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,030
That depends on your performance.

407
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,200
Mommy made your favorite drumsticks today.

408
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,460
Thank you, Bei Bei. I love drumsticks!

409
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,320
Why are you sitting there?

410
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,230
I'm in a good mood today.

411
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,740
And it's the best

412
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,980
to see my son

413
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,320
from this side.

414
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,260
We two look very much alike and he's as handsome as I am.

415
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,300
Chris,

416
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,380
you can't do that to daddy.

417
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,240
It's impolite.

418
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,930
Can I sit here?

419
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,740
Come on.

420
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,140
Drumstick.

421
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,690
It's so ugly. I don't want to eat it.

422
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,420
Mommy can eat it.

423
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,950
Mommy likes drumstick.

424
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,060
Come on.

425
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,620
This drumstick is really not good enough for my son.

426
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:39,980
Come on.

427
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,380
Daddy will eat it for you.

428
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,500
Here.

429
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,110
You can eat this.

430
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,860
It's worthy of you, beautiful and cute.

431
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,700
By the way,

432
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,660
I want to go to the hospital to see Auntie Lan in the afternoon.

433
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,900
I‘d like to ask for leave.

434
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,160
I want to go there, too.

435
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,420
No.

436
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,820
The hospital is full of germs.

437
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,020
You're with me today.

438
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,140
Bei Bei.

439
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,700
I don't want to be with a stranger.

440
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,820
I'm your father.

441
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,380
I need a new dad!

442
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,620
Actually mommy thinks the old daddy is fine.

443
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,840
Come on.

444
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,660
Eat your breakfast. Sit down.

445
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,500
I want to see my great-grandson!

446
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,300
My great-grandson!

447
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,860
Great Grandma's baby!

448
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,740
Look at him.

449
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,520
At first sight,

450
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,990
his eyes and eyebrows are just like the child of Lu's family!

451
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,980
His face is so delicate,

452
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,540
exactly the same as Nan Nan

453
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,900
when he was little.

454
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
No wonder

455
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
great grandma felt so close

456
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,700
the first time I saw you.

457
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,820
Blood is really thicker than water

458
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,020

459
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,080
The baby's eating.

You can hold him later.

Fine, fine, fine. Come here.

463
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,260
Have a drumstick.

464
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,220
Eat more.

465
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,060
Eat a lot

466
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,850
and you'll grow tall.

467
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,660
Grandma, why don't you eat with Chris, too?

468
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,500
I don't know what you want to do.

469
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,620
You hid our child for six years.

470
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,380

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,280
what am I supposed to tell Nan Nan's parents?

474
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,340
Great Grandma, will you stay with me today?

475
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,660
Fine, fine, fine.

476
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,820
I

477
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,340
am not going anywhere.

478

Great Grandma, egg.

00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,730
Ok.

482
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,860
This is for you.

My precious darling, who taught you that?

485
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,940
Bei Bei taught me to peel eggs for you.

486
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
What else did your mother teach you?

487
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,940
A lot of things!

488
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,460
I'll tell you all about it later.

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,260
Fine, fine, fine.

Chris is his son.

please wake up.

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,620
to have you as his father.

571
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,050
[Eminence Joy Division]

572
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,260
Great news!

573
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,780
The boss is with his son tonight.

574
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,710
Everybody, let's have a good time!

575
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,740
Maggie.

576
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,660
Hang out tonight?

577
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,160
I have a date with my next ex-boyfriend tonight.

578
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,720
Fortunately, a lot of radishes responded to me.

579
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,580
Next?

580
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,300
I also have a next ex-girlfriend.

581
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,860
Cheers.

582
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:54,980
Cheers.

583
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,700
This is a really nice place.

584
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,340
The heaven on earth!

585
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,380
Looking around,

586
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm the prettiest guy in the place.

587
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,690
You're an old man.

588
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,780
The wrinkles could even kill a fly.

589
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,500
You still have the nerve to say you're pretty.

590
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,830
I don't know who gave you that confidence.

591
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,020
At least I look like a man.

592
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,480
Unlike you, you don't even look like a woman.

593
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,540
Who are you talking about, sissy boy?

594
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:27,300
E...

595
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,700
Everybody is looking at you. No violence.

596
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,930
I never hit a woman.

597
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,560
I think you two make a nice couple.

598
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,500
One is sadism. The other is Masochism. A good match.

599
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,460
- He?
- She?

600
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,060
Go, let's dance.

601
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,170
Dance. Dance.

602
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,900
Have a drink.

603
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,740
Let's go, the prettiest guy.

604
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,380
Coming.

605
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,500
Come on, let's have fun together.
