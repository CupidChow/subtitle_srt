If you dare to leave,

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,660
I won't let you see the sun rising tomorrow.

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,500
No, I do not dare.

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:38,780
Hello.

10
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,420
Lu Nan,

11
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,740
Gu Yan's henchman came to the hospital.

12
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,460
Be careful.

13
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,700
Okay.

14
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,700
Got it.

Then

you...

17
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,660
just do it.

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
I'm in a hurry.

00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,500
This is the hospital.

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,860
It's not convenient.

Tell me.

27

But

29
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,670
it's not completely blind.

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,940
I can still see

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,700
some blurry images.

32
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,300
Why didn't you tell me?

33
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,540
I didn't want you to worry about me.

We are a couple.

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900

You have to do the surgery as soon as possible.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,700
You'll get better soon.

43

is there any big announcement?

114
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,180
The collaboration between Eminence and Sia was successful.

115
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,300
We decided to expand the market in Europe.

116
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,540
I will do research personally

117
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,180
and look for business partners.

118
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,340

122
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,460

123
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,100
Ms. Su will be in charge.

127
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,740

134
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,659
Because of being listed,

135
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,090
we need to broaden

Whether it's too hasty

138
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,220
depends on the strategy

As long as I know what I'm doing.

143
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,320
What you should care about

144
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,180
is how to assist Ms. Su

150

At the moment, it is the crucial

151
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,180
turning point for the business to prosper.

152
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,840
I expect everyone to keep calm

153

and don't let other people take advantage of you.

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,490
If you panic,

155
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,510
you might do something that makes you regret.

156
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,900
I think

157
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,080
Ms. Su is implying something.

158
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,890
Then can I ask

159
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,020
who is this other person?

160
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:46,860
Mr. Ding,

161
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,680
you were the first one to comment.

162
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,580
It'll be misunderstanding.

163
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Nice goal!

164
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,500
Great! Great!

165
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,100
I think something's wrong.

166
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,620
There's something wrong with both of them.

167
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,680
Especially Lu Nan.

168
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,260
I asked my people to look into the hospital.

169
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,120
He's probably hiding something.

170
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
How's everything going

171
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,890
on your side?

172
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,020
I've been buying Eminence's stock long ago.

173
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,890
For the next step,

174
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,290
I need you to pull strings

175
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,620
so I can know more members

176
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,550
of Eminence's board of directors.

177
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,700
What do you want?

178
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,900
I want to buy Eminence's shares.

179
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,620
Mr. Gu,

180
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,230
in order to become a shareholder of Eminence,

181
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,220
the precondition is that

182
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,700
they are willing to sell it.

183
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,380
What if

184
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,780
Lu Nan finds out about it?

185
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,310
He won't.

186
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,180
I will be very careful.

187
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:01,990
Don't worry.

188
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,730
You

189
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,670
just need to pull some strings.

190
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,060
Whether they sell it or not,

191
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,060
it's my business.

192
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
Mr. Gu, you're not

193
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,780
simply thinking about buying odd lots.

194
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,540

You all seem to be aging

385
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,880
and experiencing memory losses.

386
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,420
At the board of director meeting last week,

387
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,750
Mr. Lu informed everyone of his schedule.

388
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,820
Enough.

389
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,070
I have his medical record from the doctor.

390
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,290
Just admit it.

391
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,080
Really?

392
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,900
Who can prove

393
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,260
that the record is true?

394
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,060
You...

395
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,420
All of you

396
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,620
are the pioneers of Eminence.

397
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,730
The achievement of Eminence today

398
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,660
is not only because of Mr. Lu's leadership

399
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,790
but also the credit of everybody here.

400
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,260
I believe you all came

401
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,540
to solve the question

402
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
that the public has about Eminence.

403
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,100
When Eminence is now

404
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,660
at the key point of being listed,

405
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,320
there are news against Mr. Lu.

406
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,340
We can't rule out the possibility that

407
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,200
it's a cut throat competition from the competitor.

408
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,340
When the nest is overturned, no egg stays unbroken.

409
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,470
It shouldn't be hard

410
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,940
to understand.

411
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,300
I hope other people won't take advantage

412
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,780
of your concern about Eminence.

413
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,460
If there's internal conflict,

414
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,740
I'm afraid it will really affect

415
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,400
the development of Eminence.

416
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,960
Rather than staying here to question Mr. Lu,

417
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,180
we should think about

418
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,300
who is

419
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,780
aiming at Eminence.

420
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,180
We don't know.

421
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,030
This way.

422
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,740
Ms. Su.

423
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,220
Ms. Su, you're good at

424
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,480
changing the subject.

425
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,620
You're avoiding answers at key points.

426
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,660
Why is that?

427
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,870
Don't be surprised.

428
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,620
I just bought some odd lots.

429
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,650
And now

430
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,920
I become one of the directors.

431
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,740
Mr. Gu,

432
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,240
when did you become interested in Eminence?

433
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,380
Look at you.

434
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,340
I bought some shares

435
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,760
to join the family.

436
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,420
Ms. Su,

437
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,260
I'll leave

438
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,380
the catching up for later.

439
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,020
Today,

440
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,900
we're here to talk about Mr. Lu.

441
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,340
You...

442
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,800
Don't change the subject.

443
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,420
So

444
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,190
you have to let Mr. Lu explain everything.

445
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,060
He's in a critical condition

446
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,380
and still travelled abroad for business.

447
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,780
Or is he using the business trip as an excuse

448
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,580
to treat his illness abroad?

449
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,940
How could you

450
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,380
cheat us?

451
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,540
Do you agree?

452
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,580
Yes.

453
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,180
That's true.

454
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,900
Since

455
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,140
Ms. Su can't offer a proper explanation,

456
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,010
I propose a resolution of voting

457
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,580
to recall the director, Mr. Lu.

458
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,180
We can't let a cheating couple

459
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,060
be in charge of Eminence.

460
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,940
Do you agree?

461
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,980
Yes.

462
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:57,860
Yes.

463
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,540
Who want to recall me?

464
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,380
Aren't

465
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,220
you dying?

466
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,620
You...

467
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,440
Mr. Guo,

468
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,190
mind your language.

469
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,220
Otherwise

470
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,550
I have to say you're fabricating a rumor.

471
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
It's impossible.

472
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,020
The news online can't be false.

473
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,500
We all saw the medical record.

474
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,430
Aren't you sick?

475
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,300
My presence

476
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,040
seems so shocking for Mr. Guo.

477
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,500
We all saw it.

478
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,740
The medical record can't be false.

479
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,660
Medical record.

480
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,580
What a coincidence!

481
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I also have a copy.

in view of the medical record,

485
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,500
Mr. Lu is very healthy.

486
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,620
No problem at all.

487
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,160
If that is the case,

488
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,100
why didn't you show up earlier?

489
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,960
Because of you,

490
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,900
the company stock is dropping.

491
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,560
You owe us an explanation.

492
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,700
Yeah.

493
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,620
Mr. Guo,

494
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,080
What position are you in to talk to me?

495
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,060
Do you own any Eminence's share?

496
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,050
This is the board of directors of Eminence.

497
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,980
For irrelevant people,

498
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,820
please leave.

499
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,900
He don't.

500
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,540
What about me?

501
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
You should know

502
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,500
I'm the largest shareholder of Eminence.

503
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,830
I have total authority.

504
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,390
Dear nephew,

505
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,820
listen to me.

506
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,980
Resign on your own

507
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,420
and leave yourself some dignity.

508
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,740
If the public knows that

509
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,470
you were recalled from office.

510
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,100
Then

511
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,620
what if

512
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,980
you'll lose face?

513
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,160
Shut up.

514
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,670
How impudent of you!

515
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,020
You'll regret later!

516
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,780
Mr. Gu, what a scheme.

517
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,300
For a scheme like this,

518
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,900
when did you start planning?

519
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,750
Not much of a scheme.

The Gu's Group is seeking for development.

521
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,500

00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,260

525
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,410
But I'm disappointed in you.

526
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,260
I won easily.

527
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,820

Compared with abroad,

533
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,380
I prefer the scenery at home.

534
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,160
When did you start suspecting me?

535
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,860
Let me ask you,

536
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,460
what role Gu Yan played

537
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
in this incident?

538
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,920

is very important.

547
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,140
it is by accident?

many people in our company

555
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,100
job hopped to Gu's Group.

556
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,090
You should have given more bonus

557
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,300
and been nicer to people.

558
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,460

567
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,820

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,140
we should pull the plug.

576
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,340
Your condition is not getting worse.

577
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,200
Be sure to do checkups regularly.

578
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,820
Okay.

579
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,110
Thank you Dr. Wu.

580
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,420
Thank you.

581
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:27,820
And

582
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,060
recently, there are somebody

583
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,930
asking about your health condition.

584
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,190
You better be careful.

585
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,140
Yun Fan told me about it.

586
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:35,740
Thank you.

587
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,920
I know uncle doesn't drink

588
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,420
so I brought tea.

589
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,540
Thank you so much Mr. Lu.

590
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,100
What brings you here?

591
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,150
It's a gathering between two of us.

592
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,500
Forget about the courtesy.

593
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,540
Call me Nan Nan.

594
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,170
Nothing much.

595
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,670
Some childhood memory came to my mind.

596
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,700
I remember uncle often visited us

597
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,540
to drink tea with my father

598
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,160
and play chess with me.

599
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,380
Time flies.

600
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,030
More than a decade passed by in a flash.

601
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:11,940
Yes.

602
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,140
Time flies.

603
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,680
Mr. Lu, do you know?

604
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,460
I am most grateful of

605
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,990
your parents in my life.

606
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,140
They didn't mind that I didn't have a degree

607
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,870
and started a business with me.

608
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,060
It was very difficult back then.

609
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,990
We couldn't have a proper meal.

610
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,580
But at that times,

611
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,940
people were simple and kind.

612
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,200
I was genuinely happy.

613
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,350
When things started to get better,

614
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,050
they passed away.

615
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,570
They didn't enjoy the fortune.

616
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,540
Since

617
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,310
you are grateful of my parents,

618
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,500
you still met Gu Yan

619
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,390
and planned to put Eminence in danger.

620
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,980
Is that appropriate?

621
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,860
Lu Nan,

622
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,020
I think there's

623
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
some misunderstanding between us.

624
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
What happened was

625
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,140
Gu Yan approached me through Mr. Guo.

626
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,410
He wanted to purchase

627
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,410
my share of Eminence at a high price.

628
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,130
Please be reassured.

629
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,300
I didn't say yes.

630
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,810
If he want it,

631
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,400
then sell it to him.

632
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,380
You set the price.

633
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,330
As he's basically giving you money,

634
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,160
there's no point in refusing.

635
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,620
What do you mean?

636
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,620
According to what I know,

637
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,220
he didn't only approach you.

638
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,190
He also bought Mr. Guo's share.

639
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,100
I know what he's up to.

640
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:30,860
You

641
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,340
can cooperate with me.

642
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,660
Uncle.

643
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,870
No matter how ruthless I am, I have gratitude.

644
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,740
After all, you are a close acquaintance

645
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,420
who worked with my parents

646
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,270
and who I've looked up to since I was young.

647
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,960
As long as I'm in Eminence,

648
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,460
you won't be mistreated.

649
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,940
Lu Nan,

650
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,510
don't worry.

651
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,820
Even if I'm of no use,

652
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:53,900
I won't

653
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,500
betray the company.

654
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,040
There's

655
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,980
one more thing to tell you.

656
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,180
Gu Yan

657
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,620
has been urging us

658
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,180
to buy a lot of Gu's odd lots.

659
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,420
We'll do as he says.

660
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,760
Uncle Ding,

661
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,940
if you don't have enough money,

662
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,670
just tell me.

663
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,420
Okay.

664
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,280
Cheers!

665
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,510
Is it safe to put off the treatment?

666
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,150
The doctor said the surgery

667
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,390
must been done as soon as possible.

668
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,150
Postponing several days is fine.

669
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,580
Eminence is still in a crisis.

670
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,900
I'm worried.

671
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,540
Tomorrow

672
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,200
Yun Fan and I will leave

673
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,700
to pretend to expand the overseas market.

674
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,540
But secretly

675
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,540
I'll hurry in the purchase of Gu's odd lots.

676
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,740
Then

677
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,550
what do you want me to do?

678
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,390
To take over my position

679
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,350
and get hold of the board of directors.

680
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,630
Other things

681
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,990
remain as usual.

682
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,540
Okay.

683
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,660
Chris and I will wait for your return.

684
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,460
I'll take care of myself.

685
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,900
I just saw Gu Yan's henchman

686
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,610
outside.

687
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:32,940
[International Departure]

688
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,820
Look forward in working with you.

689
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,750
Thank you Mr. Gu.

690
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,140
So it was you.

691
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,740
Mr. Guo.

692
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,760
Sorry about it.

693
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,030
So you've suspected me for a long time.

694
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,460
Not too early nor too late.

695
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,590
Just the right time.

696
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,140
You've got something in your sleeves.

697

An eye for an eye,

698
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,980
and a tooth for a tooth.

699
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,580
Even if you purchased Gu's shares,

700
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,260
so what?

701
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
The Gu family

702
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,870
is still the largest shareholder of Gu's Group.

703
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,220
Even if my brother is stupid,

704
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,540
he won't sell his shares to you.

705
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,290
We're brothers.

706
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,620
Despite our grudge,

707
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,820
we'll still unite against outsiders at key times.

708
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,340
Just because of your 24% shares,

709
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,260
how can you dominate Gu's Group?

710
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,900
Well,

711
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,180
I forgot to tell you.

712
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,090
Earlier

713
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,860
when you wanted to acquire Eminence,

714
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,780
you mortgaged

715
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,340
18% of your share at Shangyuan Finance.

716
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,670
That financial company

717
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
belongs to me.

718
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,460
Impossible. I did my research.

719
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,220
Nothing is impossible.

720
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,420
Everyone,

721
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,860
is everything clear?

722
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,580
Gu Yan,

723
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,750
I need to remind you.

724
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,460
How can you deal with

725
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,060
the Gu's Group shareholder?

726
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,930
Because I'm now

727
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,700
the largest shareholder in Gu's Group.

728
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,960
At the shareholder meeting in a few days,

729
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,420
I hope you can be as active as you are now.

Mr. Lu,

735
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,860
listen to me.

736
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,260
I'm innocent.

737
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,860
Gu Yan forced me to do so.

738
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,040

please leave.

00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,219

743
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,750
you're dismissed.

744
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,179

If it's mild,

767
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,110
he'll be in coma again.

768
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,510
If it's serious,

769
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,000
then...

770
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,600
We need to operate surgery right now.

771
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,900
Even if we do the surgery now,

772
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,060
there's only less than 50% of success.

773
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,060
And

774
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,580
there's a huge risk

775
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,220
in operating brain surgery.

776
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,660
From his current physical condition,

777
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,990
it's likely that he'll die in the surgery.

778
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,880
As family members,

779
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,580
you should

780
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,340
think about it carefully.

781
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,990
Are you feeling better now?

782
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,220
How's the company?

783
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,900
It's on track now.

784
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,100
Don't worry.

785
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,420
What about Gu Yan?

786
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,380
He's fired.

787
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,660
After knowing what had happened,

788
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,990
Gu Chairman became ill.

789
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,500
We can finally

790
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,980
travel overseas for the treatment.

791
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,780
This time,

792
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,700
Chris and I will be with you.

793
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,780
Don't worry.

794
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,130
If

795
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,380
you're still worry about the company,

796
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,460
I could hire

797
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,660
a professional manager to be in charge.

798
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,180
And

799
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,220
Ye Ting and Yun Fan are still in the company.

800
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,610
They can also supervise.

801
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:52,870
As soon as you recover,

802
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,950
we'll come back.

803
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:57,890
If

804
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,170
you

805
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
keep silent,

806
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,940
I'll take it as a yes

807
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,620
and call Yun Fan now.

808
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,220
Su Bei...

809
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,980
Can you not say anything?

810
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,100
I don't want to hear it.

811
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,740
Su Bei.

812
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,740
I cherish my life right now.

813
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,700
Because I cherish it so much,

814
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,100
I can't risk the uncertainty

815
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,420
to do the surgery.

816
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,160
You heard everything.

817
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
You should know

818
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,350
the consequence of not doing the surgery.

819
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,060
How could you let go of Chris and me?

820
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,210
I can't.

821
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,100
Because I can't,

822
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,280
I can't blindly

823
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,820
risk my life.

824
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,090
How can it be blindly?

825
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,560
I'll find you the best doctor.

826
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,700
Don't you worry about it.

827
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,170
Lu Nan,

828
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,940
I beg you.

829
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,540
Let's do the surgery.

830
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,850
What are you waiting for?

831
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,740
Do we have time to wait?

832
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,180
You said you care about me.

833
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,800
But have you ever thought about my feelings?

834
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,660
If you don't do the surgery,

835
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,780
I'll be living in fear

836
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,380
and count-downing the days.

837
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,740
I'm scared that

838
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,720
one day you're suddenly gone.

839
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,510
It may be relieving for you to go

840
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,710
but have you ever thought about

841
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,390
that your family are the most painful.

842
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,380
Su Bei.

843
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,860
Su Bei

844
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:43,130
[Ward]
