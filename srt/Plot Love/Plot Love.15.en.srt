as soon as we got married,

I joined in the costume designing competition

on behalf of the Eminence.

51

63
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,740
Since I

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,880
took out both the original

and want to make up the mistake seven years ago,

228
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,180
there's still an chance for you to fix it.

229
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,780

Su Bei had to give up her dream of being a designer.

Su Bei can be more desperate now

What?

562
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,780
Otherwise,

563
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,040
you'll really lose me.

564
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,740
What?

565
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,870
Afraid of it?

566
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,300
No,

567
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,070
I'm just thinking about

568
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,470
how to well cherish you.

569
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,110
Then you should really think about it.

570
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,380
Lu Nan,

571
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,980
tonight...

572
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Wait for a second!

573
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Grandma has come back home,

574
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,880
and Lu Fei'er is now in the flower shop alone.

575
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,540
Don't let grandma know

576
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,420
this issue.

577
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh,

578
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,230
what did you say about tonight?

579
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,350
I want to have dinner with you tonight.

580
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,700
But I don't know whether you have time or not.

581
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,580
I'll always have time

583
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,020
But,

584
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,380
I have something important to deal with first.

585
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,840
You'll have to wait for me.

586
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,540
I'll wait for you no matter how late it is.

587
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:33,870
Okay!

588
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,630
Let's go！

589
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,390

00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,620
How's your dad?

594
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,740
The surgery was successful!

595
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,600
Thanks for your care, Manager Gu.

596
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,940
Since your dad's good,

597
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,220
I think now we should deal with

598
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,550
the things between you and the Gu's Group.

599
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,020
Do you know how much loss your plagiarizing

600
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,900
has brought to the Gu's Group?

601
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,150
Manager Gu, I...

602
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,030
The Gu's Group is not a charity.

603
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,600
So there're only two choices for you.

604
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,340
One is

605
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
to pay for the loss of the Gu's Group.

606
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,800
The other one is

607
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,590
to find out the evidence

608
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,340
to prove your innocence.

609
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Don't forget that

610
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,530
the public will only sympathize

Seven years ago,

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,900
it was you that paid off Zhao Rui,

624
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
and framed Su Bei for plagiarizing!

625
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,060
I...

626
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,060
You know me.

627
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,900
Without evidence,

628
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,830
I wouldn't come to ask you about it.

629
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,180
Yes,

630
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,420
it was me.

631
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,150
You dare to do anything now, right?

632
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,220
I did everything for you.

633
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,020
You're mine.

634
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,220
From the moment our parents adopted me,

635
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,270
you could only belong to me.

636
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,740
You and me

637
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,380
grew up together.

638
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
You protected me,

639
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,200
and have been caring about me.

640
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,260
Without Su Bei,

641
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,430
we could have been together forever.

642

Are you crazy?

643
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,780
No, I'm not crazy.

644
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,710
I just want to force Su Bei to leave.

645
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,460
Only when she leaves,

646
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,000
can you come back to me.

647
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,110
So you forced Zhao Rui to death?

648
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,380
Don't you know

649
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,300
it's a life?

650
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,260
Have you ever thought about the result?

651
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,790
I didn't force her to death.

652
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,940
She committed suicide herself.

653
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,960
I just gave her some money.

654
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,060
And she was willing to do it.

655
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,820
I never forced her into doing anything.

I wouldn't have done so.

660
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,090
You're still looking for excuses for yourself.

661
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,820
If it were not for Su Bei's mercy on you,

662
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,750
you would already be in prison now.

663
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,820
Her mercy on me?

664
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,480
I don't need her mercy.

665
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,600
She thinks she has won?

666
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,860
She thinks she can take you

667
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,490
away from me?

668
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,860
No way!

669
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,660
I won't allow her to do so!

670
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,230
You're truly hopeless.

671
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,860

672
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,580
Leave here as soon as possible.

673
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,510
And I don't want to see you anymore.

674
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,220
I've been with you for twenty years,

675
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,350
but you still value Su Bei more than me.

676
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,380
I won't go!

677
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
I won't leave you,

678
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,340
nor will I leave home.

679
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
If you leave,

680
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,580
I can tell grandma you need to study abroad

681
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,910
considering that you have been my sister.

682
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,760
But if you don't leave,

683
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,640
I'll cut our relation as brother and sister.

684
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,660

You may be unable to imagine

687
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,460
what kind of childhood

688
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,580
a girl regarded as a bastard could have.

At that time,

690
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,380
my life was in darkness,

691
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,550
until one day Auntie Lan came into my life.

692
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,420
At that time,

693
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,380
she just got engaged.

694
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,220
But she insisted in bringing me to her home.

695
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,460
And it was because of me

696
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,740
that her marriage was ruined

697
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,670
She wasted her most precious youth

698
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,140
on looking after me.

699
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,750
And it was also because of me

700
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,990
that she even didn't get married all her life.

701
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,820
So

702
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,140
when I knew that

703
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,460
she had become a vegetable,

704
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,620
I was almost out of mind.

705
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,220
Lu Nan,

706
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,580
please forgive me for what I did.

707
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,560
I bitterly regret ever

708
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,390
making those choices and decisions.

709
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,820
Because I really didn't know

710
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,140
what I should do.

711
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,180
It was also my fault.

712
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,460
I should have protected you well.

713
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,260
But it was Auntie Lan that helped me protect you.

714
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,860
If I hadn't forgotten you,

715
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,600
I would have risked my life
