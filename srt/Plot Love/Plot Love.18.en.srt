[Episode 18]

4
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,140
Well,

5
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,459
now that

6
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,340
we've met,

7
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,670
I'll leave you to it.

8
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,580
Looking forward to hearing from you.

9
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,340
Don't let Mr. Gu down!

10
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,980
Jia Jia.

11
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,300
Sis.

12
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
Who's that? She looked familiar.

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,430
She was asking for directions.

14
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,820
Maybe I was mistaken.

15
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,180
I've been so busy lately.

16
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,780
I haven't visited Auntie Lan for a long time.

17
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,039
Let's go to see Master.

18
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,060
She'll be happy to know you visit.

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,250
You're still up. Are you waiting for me?

20
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,940
Do you still know that you have a husband

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,900
and a son?

22
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,610
How could I forget

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,860
such a perfect husband

24
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,260
and such a wonderful son?

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,220
Then why are you so late home?

26
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,060
Chris was waiting for you until he fell asleep.

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,780
How ungrateful of you!

28
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm doing this for you.

29
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,090
Don't work so hard.

30
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,020
I can't bear to see you like this.

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,780
Here's some information I've collected

32
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,240
on a few fabric factories.

33
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,310
Check it out.

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,980
I'll send someone to help you tomorrow.

35
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,820
All the fabric factories under our company

36
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,020
will also assist you.

37
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,460
I've taken care of this matter.

38
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Don't do everything

39
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,220
on your own.

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,900
You work too hard.

41
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,660
You're the wife

42
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,720
of Eminence's CEO.

43
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,980
We'll be working with many other brands in the future

44
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,580
and we'll have our own brand.

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,180
If you work too hard and fall ill,

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
who's going to manage our business?

47
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,530
What? Did I say it wrong?

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,900
You're right about everything,

49
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,940
Mr. Lu.

50
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,180
It's just that you're a bit more talkative than usual.

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,740
You're the one who made me talk too much.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,380
Tell me.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,400
How can you make it up to me?

54
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
What do you want?

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,980
Is that enough?

56
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
That's it?

57
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,220
I think

58
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,040
it's time for Su Ziyi to have a little sister.

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,380
Go!

60
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,940
Ye Ting!

61
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,620
I can't stand you anymore.

62
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm a man!

63
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,230
How can I carry bags for you?

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,100
Do it again

65
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,700
and I'll punish you!

66
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,610
Honey, I'm sorry.

67
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,860
Don't be mad.

68
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,579
If you don't want to carry my bags,

69
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,240
I'll carry them myself, okay?

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,020
And don't hit me,

71
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,460
because your hand will hurt,

72
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,990
and that'll break my heart.

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,300
Cut the crap!

74
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,630
I'm telling you.

75
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,340
You can't boss me around!

76
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,260
What do you want?

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,060
Give me a kiss.

78
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,240
What are you doing?

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,540
Shit, what's wrong with me?

80
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,470
Why would I want to kiss her?

81
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Why did you hit me?

82
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,820
What are you fantasizing about?

83
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,860
Nothing.

84
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020

85
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,500
No!

86

No!

What's wrong with you?

90
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
I'm thinking of leaving without you

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,580
because you have

92
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,630
so much luggage.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,630
I don't want you to give me a lift anyway. Mind your own business.

94
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,540
Stop!

95
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,980
That's my most expensive bag.

96
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,420
If you break it, I'll kill you.

97
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,820
Who cares about your bag?

98

Su Su, you're amazing!

102

104
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,780
Looks like you really enjoyed the trip.

105
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,100
I heard about

106
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,780
you and your man's PDA.

107
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,300
Our single colleagues are so envious.

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,340
Who told you that?

109
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,820
Your errand boy?

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,300
You did it on purpose.

111
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,820
What?

112
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,990
Not only did you put me and Yun Fan on the same holiday,

113
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:33,370
but you also put us in the same hotel.

114
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,020
No, I didn't do that.

115
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,940
It's a reward from Lu Nan

116
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,000
for your hard work.

117
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,790
What kind of reward is that?

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,830
If he really wants to reward me,

119
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,820
just give me money!

120
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,220

Are you still the Ye Ting I know?

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,180

Fine. Fine. Go to work!

129
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,300
Why did you hit me?

130
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,220
You've been sighing since you came in.

131
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,500
You look very upset.

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,460
What's wrong?

Not happy with your holiday?

134
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,120
It's your fault

135
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,420
for putting me together

136
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,500
with that violent girl.

137
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
You knew I didn't want to see her.

138
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,980
The holiday was a group purchase.

139
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,310
I got a 50% discount for the second person.

140
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,700
In addition to being a bit of a jerk,

141
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,630
you've developed some new skills:

142
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,390
arrogance and stinginess.

143
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,340
I don't know how Su Bei can stand you.

144
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,100
You have a problem with that?

145
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,260
Keep it

146
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
to yourself then.

148
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,460
Poor me!

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,820
Why can't I meet a woman

150
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,220
who's sweet and gentle?

151
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,420
I'm telling you.

152
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,820
What kind of woman is she?

153
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,500
She doesn't act like a lady at all.

154
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,900
All she knows is to threaten people with force.

155
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,100
Doesn't she know that

156
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,020
being sweet

157
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,420
works the best towards men?

158
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,210
You...

159
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,700
If you want to see her,

160
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,620
just go ahead.

161
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,080
She's not far away anyway.

162
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,700
Why would I want to see her?

163
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,830
Who wants to see her?

164
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,480
I'd rather stay with you than see her.

165
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,659
Come in.

166
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,460
Mr. Lu,

167
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,419
here are the documents needed for the factory contract.

168
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,130
Take a look.

169
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,520
If there's no problem, please sign them.

170
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,780
Give them to SA Yun first.

171
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,480
I'll check them later.

172
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,360
There are mosquitoes behind you.

173
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,680
SA Yun, please take a look.

174
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,860
I'm off.

175
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,460
See?

176
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,020
See?

177
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,390
She didn't give a damn about me!

178
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,280
What kind of woman is that?

179
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,740
You're under the thumb

180
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,770
of that girl.

181
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,510
Stop complaining.

182
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,540
What are you gonna do?

183
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,540
Go and care for my wife.

184
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,580
Very good.

185
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,370
Big deal!

186
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,860
I'm not gonna meet that violent woman.

187
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,620
No way!

188
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,390
Anything wrong?

189
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,740
I don't know,

190
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
but I feel like it's missing something,

191
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,580
and I've no idea what it is.

192
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,750
[Seven years ago]

193
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,700
Clothes, food, shelter and housing.

194
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,180
Clothes come first.

195
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,740
Clothes are more than just giving you good looks.

196
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,580
It's about the culture we've inherited

197
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,940
and the attitude we have towards life.

198
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,260
When we design, we think about what to add.

199
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,420
When it's finished,

200
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,980
we need to think about

201
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,540
what to take away.

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,030
The whole picture matters.

203
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,080
Come on.

204
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,510
Sit down.

205
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,540
If you can't think of anything,

206
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,980
give yourself a break.

207
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,900
I hate to see you like this.

208
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm not tired

209
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,580
with Mr. Lu at my service.

210
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,150
Don't work tonight.

211
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,780
I'll take you to a nice place.

212
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,580
Maybe with some rest

213
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,100
you'll be able to have some inspiration.

214
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,860
But...

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,660
Don't say no.

216
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,340
You're not allowed to say no.

217
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,080
You must take a break tonight.

218
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,500
There's nothing more important to me

219
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,860
than you.

220
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,520
Come in.

221
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,900
How are things going?

222
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,860
All good.

223
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,320
Everything's going well.

224
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,570
What do you think

225
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,340
will happen

226
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,670
if problems arise again

227
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,080
with Eminence's new collection?

228
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,300
Well, the boss knows better than I do.

229
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,620
Are there words behind my back

230
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,140
that I'm just pretending to be gentle

231
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,870
and actually having an agenda?

232
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,260
Yes.

233
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,820
But

234
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,490
most of our employees are supportive of you.

235
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,750
Because they know that

236
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,460
Gu's Group can only thrive

237
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,110
under your leadership.

238
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,180
But even so,

239
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,700
father is still wary of me.

240
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,220
Even when

241
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,780
I'm way more competent than that idiot,

242
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,660
for father,

243
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm not even as good as his dog.

244
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,460
Are we there yet?

245
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,780
Almost.

246
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,530
What are you going to show me?

247
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,060
You don't tell me what it is.

248
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,320
When did you prepare this?

249
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,340
Mrs. Lu, would you like to

250
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,520
join me for dinner?

251
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,140
I would love to.

252
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,500
Here.

253
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:23,940
Please.

254
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,240
How's the wine?

255
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,200
As long as you serve it, it's all good.

256
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,180
Mrs. Lu is so sweet.

257
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,220
I'm always sweet to you.

258
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,660
Thank you, Mr. Lu,

259
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,740
for all you've done for me today.

260
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,990
I know you're trying to comfort me,

261
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,490
but I've already made up my mind.

262
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,810
I'm going to quit the design department

263
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,800
when Sia's case is finishsed.

264
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,220
Why?

265
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,660
I used to think that passion for design was enough,

266
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,050
but now I realize it's not,

267
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,380
because you have to be competent to do it.

268
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,060
I don't think I'm competent enough

269
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,380
to design anymore.

270
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,140
After I quit,

271
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,590
I can go home and spend time with Chris.

272
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,380
So?

273
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,130
You're not happy with my decision?

274
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,700
No.

275
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,980
I don't want you to regret it.

276
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,660
You know what?

277
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,460
When you design,

278
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,060
you shine.

279
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,500
I've never seen you happier

280
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,760
doing any other thing.

281
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,360
And I've seen your design.

282
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,780
It's unique.

283
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,580
I know you're trying to make me feel better,

284
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,260
but I've run out of ideas.

285
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,680
I'm trying to get it right,

286
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,460
but it just doesn't work out.

287
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,530
You're under too much pressure and too much worry,

288
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,140
and sometimes you just need to let yourself go.

289
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,060
Think about what you really wanted to express

290
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,660
when you started designing.

291
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,070
What I really wanted to express...

292
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,780
That's the point.

293
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,340
Sia's design has always been bold and extravagant.

294
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,460
But now you're so obsessed with Chinese elements

295
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,060
that you're limited by them.

296
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,990
Maybe you should leave everything behind

297
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,730
and do what you wanted to do at the very beginning.

298
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,790
I have faith in you.

299
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,490
I think I know what goes wrong.

300
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,170
Take care of Chris.

301
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,460
Love you, super daddy!

302
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,140
Bye!

303
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,440

Finally! Done!

306
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,690
I guess you don't need

307
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,380
the coffee I just made.

308
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,860
All your hard work

309
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,180
will pay off.

310
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,300

in a long march.

312
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,580
There's more work about cutting and contacting the factory.

313
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,510
One cup of coffee may not be enough.

314
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,260
Don't push yourself too hard.

315
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,340
By the way,

316
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,620
take a look

317
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,200
and tell me what you think.

318
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,660
Very good.

319

Of course it is.

What else do you want?

333
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,140
Ms. Su,

334
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,020
would you please take time

335
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,100
to attend my proposal ceremony?

336
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,550
I'll think about it.

337
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,870
What did you say?

338
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,340
We'll definitely win this time.

339
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,100
I've never seen such a wonderful design before.

340
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,160
This is brilliant!

341
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,260
Great!

342
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,220
So good!

343
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,980
What do you think?

344
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,740
Amazing! Wonderful! Right!

345
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,780
It's remarkable, Ms. Su.

346
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,980
I'd like to have one myself.

347
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,980
Me too! Me too!

348
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,980
All the samples

349

350
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,780
You've worked very hard for this.

351
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,330
When we launch the new collection,

352
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,170
I'll get two pieces of these for each of you.

353
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,100

354
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,420
Yeah!

00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,440
That's your bonus for this month!

356
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,460
Well done, design team.

357
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,580
I'll give you double salary this month.

358
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,980
Bravo, Mr. Lu!

359
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,100

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,270
Bye, Mr. Lu.

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,320
Great. Let's go.

365
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,190
You can go home and rest now.

Just eat, all right?

370
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,980
I'll have someone take you home

373
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,220
Go.

374
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,490
Wait. We need to talk.

375
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,420
See if you like it.

376
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,350
It's a reward for your work.

377
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,270
You're so nice to me all of a sudden.

378
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,780
You must have done something bad,

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,660
don't you?

380
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,500
No way!

381
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,620
I'll never do that.

382
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,780
Really?

383
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm telling the truth.

384
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,260
I...

385
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,780
I just want to give you a bag. What's wrong with that?

386
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,240
I asked a friend to bring it back from abroad.

387
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,140
Then...

388
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,550
How much did you pay for it?

389
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,700
Not much.

390
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,860
About 20,000.

391
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,680
What are you doing?

392
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,560
No matter how touched you are,

393
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,180
behave! We're in the company.

394
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,980
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,260
You spent 20,000 on this thing?

396
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,510
I'm telling you.

397
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,710
I've never spent more than 500 on a bag.

398
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,740
If you dare to splurge like this again,

399
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,810
I'll beat you up!

400
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,260
500...

401
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,020
Don't go.

402
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,230
Help me find

403
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,720
where's the best place for me to propose.

404
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,380
It's not for a wedding ceremony.

405
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,980
Whatever place will be fine.

406
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,160
I'm asking you to come up with an idea.

407
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,380
It better be

408
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,620
romantic and moving

409
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,380
and something

410
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,230
she can't help falling in love.

411
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,800
If I knew it, I would have done it myself already.

412
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,540
You're married.

413
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,940
What's the proposal for?

414
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,980
I want to make it up to her

415
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,700
and give her a perfect proposal.

416
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,500
I've already decided to propose

417
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,540
on the day Eminence goes public.

418
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
Too much PDA.

419
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,060
I see you're not very happy with my plan.

420
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,380
You know that

421
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,780
Ye Ting is a tough woman to deal with.

422
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,110
If she knows that I'm...

423
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:51,980
Coward!

424
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,180
I'll reimburse you

425
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,060
for that bag.

426
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,270
Beggars can't be choosers.

427
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,100
Now I know what it really means.

428
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,330
My friend is tough.

429
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,420
And the girl is even tougher.

430
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,660
Poor me!

431
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,100
Qianying,

432
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,820
this dress looks great on you.

433
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,100
Thanks to your wonderful design, Ms. Su.

434
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,020
In the live session tomorrow,

435
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,220
our new collection will be a big seller.

436
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,260
Bad news, Ms. Su.

437
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,100
Gu's flagship shop has released a new collection today

438
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,810
that looks exactly the same as ours.

439
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,500
And they've got a top online celebrity for the live streaming sale.

440
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,100
What's up?

441
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,980
What's up?

442
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,380
Look.

443
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,100
Hello.

444
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,350
[Live]

445
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,560
I'm Lu Fei'er, Gu's design director.

446
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,580
The dress I'm bringing you today

447
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,180
is from our latest collection.

448
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,900
Take a look.

449
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,290
It's made from eco-friendly materials.

450
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,900
- And all the patterns on it
- What's going on here?

451
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,740
are handmade by us.

452
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,900
It looks exactly the same!

453
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,320
This...

454
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
What should we do now?

455
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,580
Its color, style and design

456
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,380
is exactly the same as ours.

457
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,180
No way!

458
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,220
It's too much of a coincidence.

459
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,740
But we're going to unveil our collection tomorrow.

460
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,140
We've already let the word out.

461
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
It's too late

462
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,270
to make any changes.

463
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,780
What should we do?

464
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,020
What to do?

465
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,100
What to do, Ms. Su?

466
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,170
Don't worry. We'll find a way.

467
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,540
Annie,

468
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,340
why is

469
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
Gu's new collection

470
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,270
so similar to our collaborations?

471
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,300
Explain!

472
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
I'm sorry, Amy,

473
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,200
but we're working on a solution here.

474
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,420
and please speak for us

475
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,340
at the head office.

476
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,350
I can't help you.

477
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,380
You're in big trouble this time.

478
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,040
I may be held accountable too.

479
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,940
Oh no. We're finished.

480
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,060
Our priority now is to fix the problem.

481
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,300
Since they copy us,

482
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,740
there must be flaws that we can use against them.

483
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,180
Evan,

484
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,740
you go and check if there's anything wrong with their design.

485
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,270
Alright.

486
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,690
Sofia,

487
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,740
you go and see if there's any difference

488
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,820
between their fabric and ours.

489
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,900
By the end of the day,

490
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,060
sum up the differences

491
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,380
between our design

492
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,300
and theirs.

493
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:22,780
Alright.

494
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,580
And the others go help them.

495
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:23,980
Be quick.

496
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,420
Yes.

497
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,660
OK.

498
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,230
Your sister-in-law is really something.

499
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,260
She's staged

500
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,590
an impressive comback.

501
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,700
I was shocked by that.

502
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,460
I can't believe that

503
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,660
she's now with Gu's Group

504
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,130
as its designer.

505
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:41,810
And

506
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,960
why is fragrance brocade at Gu's?

507
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,100
It's all a mystery.

508
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,520
So what are you going to do?

509
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,750
Talk to Gu Yan

510
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,390
to see if I can get sound him out about what's going on.

511
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,500
This is a dress

512
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,130
from our latest collection.

513
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,780
All the patterns on it

514
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,380
are handmade by us.

515
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,180
And it's made entirely

516
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,620
from eco-friendly materials.

517
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
Lu Fei'er is back.

518
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,020
It's green.

519
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,920
Let's live a green life together.

520
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,430
So you know about it.

521
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,900
What do you think?

522
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,860
Let's first set aside when she came back,

523
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,540
or why

524
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,940
she's with Gu's Group

525
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,300
as its designer.

526
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,510
The point is,

527
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,910
how did they know about our design?

528
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,520
We need to find out.

529
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,010
It must be an inside job.

530
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,480
I've asked Ye Ting to look into it.

531
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,420
But there's one more question:

532
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,660
How did they know about the fragrance brocade?

533
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
There are only four who know about it.

534
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,660
Me,

535
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:56,860
you,

536
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,820
Auntie Lan

537
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,550
and her apprentice.

538
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,420
If it's an inside job,

539
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,780
it can only be done by the four of us.

540
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,380
You are suspicious of Yu Jia?

541
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,300
No way.

542
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,220
She's Auntie Lan's apprentice.

543
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,700
Auntie Lan treated her like her own daughter.

544
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,340
I don't think she would ever do this to us.

545
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,940
And she has no reason to do so.

546
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:18,820
Okay,

547
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,700
so it's not her.

548
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,810
But

549
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,880
there's still the matter of the design to be investigated.

550
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,540
Don't let your emotion

551
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,070
influence your reasoning.

552
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,410
Alright.

553
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,660
Yes sir.

554
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,380
In short,

555
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,500
apart from you and me,

556
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,860
everyone else

557
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,140
is a suspect.

558
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,700
Jia Jia.

559
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,530
Sis.

560
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,700
Who's that? She looked familiar.

561
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,110
She was asking for directions.

562
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,540
I'm going to see Gu Yan this afternoon

563
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,450
to find out what's going on.

564
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,680
He's not trustworthy.

565
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,900
I don't want you to go.

566
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,740
If you're worried about me,

567
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,220
you can come with me,

568
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,180
Mr. Jealousy.

569
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,300
I will.

570
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,860
If you don't care that I'll beat him up when we meet,

571
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,590
then I'll go.

572
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,690
You rarely ask me out.

573
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,600
Why do you look so serious?

574
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,660
Ms. Su,

575
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,110
did I do anything wrong?

576
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,460
You shocked me with Lu Fei'er.

577
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,260
How can I not be serious?

578
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,160
Don't take it personally.

579
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,970
I didn't do it on purpose.

580
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,260
When she first applied for the job,

581
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,590
I didn't want to hire her

582
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,390
because she's Lu Nan's sister.

583
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,980
But you know the situation of Gu's Group right now.

584
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,180
I need new designers urgently.

585
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,900
And she's really talented,

586
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,300
so I had no choice.

587
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,100
She was kicked out of the family.

588
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,140
I think I told you about that.

589
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,060
I completely forgot!

590
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,620
No wonder she doesn't choose to

591
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,680
work for Eminence.

592
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,050
Since she was kicked out of the family,

593
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,710
I don't mind who she works for.

594
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,900
But Gu's new collection

595
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,620
is almost identical

596
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,700
to the collaboration design of Eminence and Sia.

597
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,820
I wonder

598
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,980
why it is, Mr. Gu.

599
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,980
Fine. Fine. Fine.

600
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,940
Let me be clear.

601
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,260
If I knew that her design

602
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,140
was similar to yours,

603
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,420
I wouldn't have the nerves

604
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
to hire her.

605
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,350
The design is not the point.

606
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,130
It's about the fabric.

607
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
It's years of hard work of my family.

608
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:02,920
Well...

609
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,940
I had no idea.

610
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,420
It's true that Lu Fei'er brought the fabric.

611
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:07,940
But at the time,

612
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,300
I just saw it as a new,

613
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,060
unique

614
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,660
and cost-effective fabric.

615
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,790
That's why I used it.

616
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,220
So,

617
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,060
you really didn't know anything about it?

618
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,060
It breaks my heart

619
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,780
to hear that.

620
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,780
I've been spending all my time

621
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,900
trying to sort out

622
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,430
the mess within Gu's Group.

623
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,980
I don't have extra energy to follow

624
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,620
what other people are doing.

625
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,940
You seem to have changed.

626
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,340
No.

627
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,830
I'm still me.

628
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm just in a different position now.

629
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,420
Maybe you're right.

630
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,220
But

631
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,350
you don't feel like the same as before.

632
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,470
Maybe I'm a bit profit-driven now.

633
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,160
I don't like it either,

634
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,600
but I can't help it.

635
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,290
I'm a manager of the company.

636
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,540
And businessmen are supposed

637
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,100
to pursue profits.

638
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,540
But I would never

639
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,940
do anything to the detriment of others,

640
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,200
especially not to you.

641
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,430
You look so anxious.

642
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,500
I feel like you're treading very carefully

643
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,700
to prove your innocence.

644
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,740
You're right!

645
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,780
I am treading carefully!

646
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,300
So Ms. Su,

647
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
can I relax a little bit now?

648
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,490
No.

649
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,300
Mr. Lu.

650
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,060
We understand what you've said.

651
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,820
But that's no reason for you

652
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,540
to shirk your responsibilities, is it?

653
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,180
I know

654
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,860
it's our fault this time.

655
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,930
But after all,

656
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,610
we're partners.

657
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,220
At this moment of crisis,

658
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,680
you should show some trust

659
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,980
and give us time to solve the problem.

660
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,740
We see your point, Mr. Lu.

661
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,220
But if the problem can't be solved,

662
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,540
how will you

663
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,460
deal with the damage

664
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,660
caused to Sia?

665
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,900
If you give us enough time

666
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,430
and we still can't solve it,

667
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,660
then Eminence will bear all the losses.

668
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,940
But if you just keep asking questions

669
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,270
without giving us time,

670
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,670
then I'm afraid that

671
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,610
we'll have to take legal action.

672
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,500
Alright.

673
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,340
We're running out of time.

674
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,090
I don't care what you do,

675
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,660
I want the collection launched in time tomorrow.

676
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,980
Lu Fei'er is responsible for giving away the fragrance brocade.

677
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,310
And I'm also wondering

678
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,960
whether she has anything to do with Auntie Lan's accident.

679
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,820
It seems to me now

680
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
that there's nothing

681
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,900
Lu Fei'er won't do.

682
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,500
If I'm right,

683
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,950
then she's the key in the Auntie Lan's accident.

684
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,150
But we don't have any evidence now,

685
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,460
and we can't do anything about her.

686
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,580
Looking back,

687
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,020
I think

688
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,220
the most suspicious thing is that

689
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,420
Zhao Long claimed responsibility for Auntie Lan's accident.

690
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,820
I'll ask Yun Fan to follow up on this matter.

691
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,340
Although our collection is

692
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,220
similar to Gu's,

693
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,700
if we can get ahead of them

694
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,300
in design,

695
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,060
we will be able to win back.

696
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,260
What do you think of

697
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,540
Gu Yan's role

698
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,620
in this case?

699
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,020
He knew very well

700
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,260
what fragrance brocade

701
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,920
meant to you

702
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,300
and Eminence.

703
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,620
And yet he approved the design

704
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,500
the day

705
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,860
before our launch.

706
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,260
Do you think it's too much of a coincidence?

707
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,940
If you look at everything together,

708
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,190
he was the one

709
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,060
who benefits the most from this.

710
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,180
If Gu Chengze is a stupid "dog",

711
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,140
then Gu Yan

712
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,460
is a fox that appears friendly on the outside

713
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,120
but is scheming on the inside.

714
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,660
So,

715
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,860
from now on,

716
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,320
he'll be the one we're going to keep an eye on.

717
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,380
When I met him today,

718
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,500
I noticed that

719
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,360
he was avoiding my questions.

720
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,060
So

721
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,380
from now on,

722
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,390
you should never see him again.

723
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,820
Yes, Mr. Jealousy.

724
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,660
Don't you run away from me!

725
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:35,990
[Lu Fei'er]

726
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,300
Brother.

727
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,340
What are you doing here?

728
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,420
Are you disappointed?

729
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,820
You didn't see the person you wanted to see?

730
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,740
How did you get the fragrance brocade?

731
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,870
Fragrance brocade.

732
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,630
My brother gave it to me.

733
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,060
We grew up together,

734
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,139
and his feelings for me

735
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,620
are beyond the understanding of an outsider like you.

736
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,020
Your brother isn't here,

737
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,260
so stop faking it.

738
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,540
I know very well

739
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,120
how he feels about you.

740
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,980
Why do you have to

741
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
deceive yourself?

742
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,510
Would he have done this to me

743
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,320
if you hadn't clung to him?

744
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,090
You're not so naive as to think

745
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,780
he's yours for life, are you?

746
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,170
I don't daydream.

747
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,929
I only look at facts.

748
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,420
You see, your brother and I were apart

749
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,370
for seven years,

750
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,830
but we come back together eventually.

751
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,699
You're eyeing your brother

752
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,949
and fall in love with a married man.

753
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,179
If there's anyone who should feel ashamed,

754
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,100
it's you.

755
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,219
You join Gu's Group

756
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,130
and help them against Eminence.

757
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:52,730
Lu Fei'er,

758
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,300
I'm impressed by the way

759
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,139
you show your crush on your brother.

760
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,140
what do you know!?

761
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm doing everything for the good of him.

762
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,550
You're not good enough for him.

763
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,180
You're only hurting him

764
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,580
by staying with him.

765
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,020
But my brother doesn't understand

766
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,540
how good I am for him

767
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,760
and he tried to send me abroad.

768
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,580
You know what.

769
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,640
Before you came along,

770
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,300
the purpose of my life was all about my brother and grandma.

771
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,340
I did

772
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,860
whatever that pleased them.

773
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,220
I thought that would make my brother

774
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,260
love me back.

775
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,820
But he loved you.

776
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,240
That's unacceptable!

777
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,390
What did you have that I didn't?

778
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,350
From that moment on,

779
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,100
I made up my mind

780
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,510
that I would do what you did.

781
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,380
You learned design, so I did too.

782
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,630
I'm going to prove to my brother

783
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,140
that I'm better than you.

784
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,980
So what?

785
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,620
No matter what you learn,

786
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,100
he won't like you.

787
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,850
No matter what you do,

788
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,140
it won't work.

789
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,210
He'll learn to appreciate my effort sooner or later.
