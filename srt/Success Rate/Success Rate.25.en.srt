00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,320
Hall Lord,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
please help me this time.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,400
Do you know why you always lose

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
to Bai Wu?

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,080
I don't know. I can't figure it out.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,880
Because he has the System.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,680
The System?

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,320
Mr. Jin wants to spend money,

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,880
so I'll reluctantly help

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
clear out inventory for everyone.

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,240
You were born like an elephant,

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,200
able to crush ants with ease.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,240
But for me,

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,920
challenging the impossible is fun.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,440
The Nine-dragon Vat was smashed?

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,680
Who did it?

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,360
A guy named Bai Wu.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,480
Bai Wu!

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,560
That guy really has incredible luck.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,240
The car's front is completely wrecked,

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,360
and yet he still didn't die.

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,400
Figure out a way.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,760
I want him to die, understand?

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,720
Make sure he dies.

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,400
Bai Wu!

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,040
No wonder, at critical moments,

28
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,080
you always turn the tables

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,280
and keep beating me back.

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,040
Turns out you're cheating!

31
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,480
If you want to turn things around,

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,220
then take his jade.

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
This is your last chance.

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,280
I'm sure you'll be dead this time.

35
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,640
Wu,

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll go with you.

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
No, I'll handle it alone.

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,160
Just wait for me.

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,180
(Tools Area)

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,040
Jin Youlong,

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
I'm here.

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Come here.

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Qingqing, Xiaoxiao.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,880
Bai Wu,

45
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
it's been a while.

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,920
Glad to see you.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Come on.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,040
Take off your jacket.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,640
Hurry up.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,400
Relax.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,080
I didn't bring anything.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
No cops either.

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,320
Good to hear.

54
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
You brought the Hetu Ancient Jade, huh?

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,080
The jade?

56
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,000
How did you know?

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
I've known about you

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,880
using the System for a long time.

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Who told you that?

60
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,520
The Hall Lord?

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,600
Cut the nonsense.

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
Throw it to me.

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,600
I said, throw it to me!

64
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,240
I finally got the System.

65
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Let them go.

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
Do you take me for a fool?

67
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
How do I use it?

68
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,680
Let them go first.

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
You're still bargaining with me?

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,760
Don't you want the System?

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Then kill me.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,600
Jin Youlong,

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,640
if you dare to hurt her...

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,520
Get lost!

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,440
It's okay.

76
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,360
It's fine.

77
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Alright now.

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,240
Bai Wu,

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
sorry.

80
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
It's fine.

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
You go first, go ahead.

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,550
Qingqing is still here.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,000
Go!

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
And she.

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
She, huh?

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,320
Smells so good.

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,400
Jin Youlong,

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
if you dare to touch her,

89
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll make you regret it.

90
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,960
Make me regret it?

91
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
Oh, I'm so scared.

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,200
Bai Wu,

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,520
you've ruined me completely.

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,560
You owe me compensation.

95
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,920
How about this?

96
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,680
Stab yourself a few times.

97
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Let me vent my anger.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
Then I'll let her go.

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,160
What do you think?

100
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,160
Jin Youlong...

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Bai Wu,

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,640
you know me well.

103
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm not very patient.

104
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
If you don't stab yourself,

105
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
I'll have to hit her.

106
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,360
Alright, I'll give you one more chance.

107
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm counting to three.

108
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,880
One,

109
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
two,

110
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
three.

111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,050
Look at him.

112
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,600
Take a good look.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,080
Coward!

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,600
Come on.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,660
Look at his pathetic state.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,360
Is he worth your affection?

117
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Be with me.

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Jin Youlong...

119
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
Bai Wu!

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,240
Tell me

121
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,640
how to activate the System.

122
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
If you dare to lie to me,

123
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,400
I'll end her now.

124
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,240
Alright.

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,520
I...

126
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,600
I accidentally...

127
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,800
dripped blood onto it,

128
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,350
and that's how the System was activated.

129
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,560
It's not responding.

130
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,530
You're lying to me.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,240
No, I'm not.

132
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
That's exactly what I did.

133
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,760
- But...
- But what?

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
It's out of energy now.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,920
It's in sleep mode.

136
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,880
Otherwise, do you think you'd have a chance?

137
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
How do I get energy?

138
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,480
Let her go.

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm no longer

140
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
a threat to you.

141
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,640
Keeping her stay her

142
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,520
won't change anything.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
Besides,

144
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,600
this is between us men.

145
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,820
If you don't let her go,

146
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
I'll take my own life.

147
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,240
You...!

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,700
Don't even think about using the System.

149
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
Stop it!

150
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,200
You win this time.

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Bai Wu...

152
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
Leave here.

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,600
We'll leave together.

154
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,000
I have the System.

155
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,680
Don't worry.

156
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,920
Just go.

157
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
Hurry up.

158
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,940
Finished saying goodbye to your lover?

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Tell me.

160
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,160
Doing good deeds.

161
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
Doing good deeds freely

162
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,640
and receiving gratitude

163
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
can build energy for the System.

164
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,760
I mean it.

165
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,920
If you let me go now,

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,520
I'd be so grateful to you.

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,880
Maybe you'll activate the System.

168
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,000
Bai Wu,

169
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,000
do you think I'm a fool?

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,160
I swear I'm not lying to you.

171
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,320
I just haven't done enough good deeds.

172
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,800
I've been pushing it too hard,

173
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,890
and now my energy's drained.

174
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,640
That's why

175
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,990
things turned out like this.

176
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
Doing good deeds?

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
I need to do more good deeds.

178
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,800
Am I not a good person?

179
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
