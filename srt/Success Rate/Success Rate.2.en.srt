Sir,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,600
=Episode 2=
my luck is truly unbelievable.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,040
18,880 in total.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,560
Give me the money.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
That's not right.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,300
It's impossible to win on scratch cards

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,620
for over 160 times in a row?

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,430
What's going on?

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
Something's wrong.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,120
I...

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,640
Tell me or I'll call the police.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
(If they find out about the system,
I'm doomed.)

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,660
(But if I just say it's good luck,)

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,820
(will he believe me?)

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,200
(If I tell him I'm a fortune teller,)

16
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,240
(what's the success rate?)

17
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,870
(I say my ancestors were fortune tellers?)

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,580
(At least the rate is over 50% for now.)

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,240
Sir,

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,440
actually, I'm a fortune teller.

21
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,240
My family has a history of over 2,000 years,

22
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,980
dating back to the Zhou Dynasty.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,120
I am a firm believer in science.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,480
I don't buy into all that superstition.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,800
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,040
Don't move.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Mr. Ma.

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,880
What?

29
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,200
Tomorrow?

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,200
After tomorrow,

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,040
the relocation compensation is 1.8 million.

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,240
(Looks like he is a relocation household.)

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,180
(He's negotiating the money
with the developer.)

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,560
(Got it!)

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Then I'll sign the contract today.

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,240
- Young man.
- Sir,

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,400
don't sign the contract.

38
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,480
Or you'll face a financial loss disaster.

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,200
What do you mean?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I mean the compensation

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,760
is not enough.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,960
How do you know that?

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,640
I'm a fortune teller.

44
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Nonsense!

45
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,680
- I'll call the police.
- Sir,

46
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,000
how about making a bet?

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,480
If I lose the bet,

48
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
the winnings are all yours.

49
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,240
Hmph.

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,200
What's the bet?

51
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
The bet is

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,040
that I can calculate for you

53
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,360
exactly how much compensation you should ask.

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,440
Alright.

55
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,920
I don't even know if two million

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,900
is enough or not.

57
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,040
Go ahead.

58
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,760
No problem, I'll help you.

59
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,770
(What is the success rate)

60
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,600
(the other party can accept for 2.5 million?)

61
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,480
(Three million?)

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
(Four million?)

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh my!

64
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,800
(Five million?)

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,960
(4.5 million?)

66
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Sir,

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
you have two options now.

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,240
If you offer four million,

69
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
they'll definitely accept.

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,480
If you offer 4.5 million,

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,240
there's a 90% chance they'll agree.

72
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Hey, can you really handle this?

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Give him a call now and try.

74
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,720
Alright.

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Mr. Ma,

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,080
Master,

77
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,870
you're absolutely brilliant!

78
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,360
4.2 million.

79
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,600
They've agreed!

80
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,110
Congrats!

81
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,760
You get an extra 2.2 million.

82
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Oh, right.

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,000
Here's 30,000 yuan for you.

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
Are you satisfied?

85
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
This doesn't seem appropriate.

86
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
You are a Master.

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
Your practice is about virtuous deeds.

89
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,540
You shouldn't accept money.

90
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,930
Yes, absolutely.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Thank you, Master.

92
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,200
I'll grab you a bottle of water.

93
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,000
Please, have a seat.

94
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,200
System Energy is being collected.

95
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
(System Energy?)

96
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,960
System Energy collection complete.

97
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,000
System Dialogue Interface Function activated.

98
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
You've received 18,880 yuan.

99
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,000
That's amazing!

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,480
I will live

101
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,840
an extraordinary life from now on.

102
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,780
(Jiang City Lucky Lottery)

103
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,280
If the System is used wisely,

104
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
I can definitely reach the peak of life.

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
10,000-yuan loan is no big deal.

106
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,490
System,

107
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,440
what's the next welfare lottery number?

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,960
Calculation is too demanding,
energy insufficient.

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Energy insufficient?

110
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,360
You are a Master.

111
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,000
Your practice is about virtuous deeds.

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,940
You can't accept money.

113
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,580
System Energy is being collected.

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,320
System,

115
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,620
I need to do good deeds and be appreciated

116
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,400
to gather energy.

117
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,280
Is that correct?

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
50%.

119
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,150
I can't expect anything in return?

120
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,240
100%.

121
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,160
This System has pretty upright principles.

122
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,000
Seems like I need to do more good.

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,240
But first, I need to handle the loan.

124
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Relying on scratch cards alone won't work.

125
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,690
It's definitely too suspicious.

126
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,800
Take a look at my Song Dynasty porcelain.

127
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
I've got a genuine Wanli-era painting.

128
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,600
(Hu City Antique Street)
My family heirloom vase.

129
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,480
Antiques?

130
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,280
I know.

131
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,000
I can use the System to spot hidden gems.

132
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
This is a Qianlong-era imperial porcelain.

133
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,600
(It seems finding hidden gems isn't easy.)

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
(With so many items here,)

135
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,200
(people would be overwhelmed just looking.)

136
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
(But)

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,800
(for me with the System,)

138
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
(it's no problem at all.)

139
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,960
System, show the authenticity probability

140
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,900
of all antiques I see.

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Incredible!

142
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,200
My System is too powerful!

143
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
Come and take a look.

144
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,800
Check out these fresh finds.

145
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680
Sir,

146
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,840
come over and have a look.

147
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
Sir, how much is this vase?

148
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,360
Who said you could touch it?

149
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
Can you afford it if you break it?

150
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,780
You want to beg for food?

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,580
There's an overpass at the next intersection.

152
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,320
Go, go, go!

153
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,400
(Does he have anything worth over 100,000?)

154
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,080
Hey, young man,

155
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,360
come check out my stall.

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
I only sell treasures here.

157
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
Wang,

158
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,380
you really don't pick your customers.

159
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
Feel free to look around.

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
Ah, a connoisseur!

161
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
You immediately picked out

162
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,400
the small leaf red sandalwood Buddha beads.

163
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,960
(It's artificially aged
with potassium permanganate.)

164
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
(The patina feels greasy too.)

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,040
(He's treating me like a rookie.)

166
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,200
Sir, how much is this?

167
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,080
Fixed price.

168
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,160
10,000.

169
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
Fatty, are you bored or what?

170
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
Look at him, all shabby like that.

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,440
Don't even mention 10,000,

172
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,200
I'd bet,

173
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,760
he couldn't pull out even a single cent.

174
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,840
You talk too much.

175
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,220
System,

176
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
does he have anything worth over 100,000?

177
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,040
100%.

178
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,440
It looks like a modern craft.

179
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,480
100%.

180
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,880
Could the valuable part be that bead?

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,480
100%.

182
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
(I see.)

183
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,600
Sir, this is a nice item.

184
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,600
It's just a bit overpriced.

185
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,400
Acting like you could really afford it.

186
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,000
Buddy,

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,640
red sandalwood or golden nanmu,

188
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,640
I only go for small-leaf rosewood.

189
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
Check out those golden specks on it.

190
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,560
That's top-notch premium quality.

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,560
10,000 yuan is a pretty good deal.

192
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,240
Alright.

193
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,080
But you gotta throw in a little extra.

194
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,440
Extra?

195
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,360
This symbolizes wealth.

196
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,280
How about this one?

197
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,640
Well,

198
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,280
this is a premium tea pet.

199
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,160
This one's a bit pricey.

200
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Then forget it.

201
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,880
Wait!

202
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,120
Alright.

203
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
Since we met, it's fate.

204
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Here.

205
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,400
Let's be friends.

206
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,400
Alright, let's make friends.

207
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,520
Make friends.

208
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Alright.

209
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
Thanks.

210
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,680
Hey, handsome!

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,640
This vase is only 5,000 yuan.

212
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,040
Not interested.

213
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,000
Take another look.

214
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,400
Take care.

215
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Oh, Li,

216
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,240
you know, in our business,

217
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,640
our appraisal skills can be average,

218
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,960
but we must read people accurately.

219
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,280
He's a perfectly good money-bringer.

220
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,240
But you can't even keep him. Tsk.

221
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,080
An aged-looking bracelet

222
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,480
and a faux antique bronze toad

223
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,160
cost less than 100 yuan,

224
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
making a profit of 100 times.

225
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,480
Time to pack up!

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,360
Go home and enjoy a nice meal.

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I bid 30,000.

230
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,800
35,000.

231
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,560
What treasure is being sold?

232
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,960
A luminous pearl.

233
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,880
That's right.

234
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,480
Young man, I bid 80,000.

235
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,800
I'll bid 100,000.

236
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,840
- What a treasure!
- Truly remarkable.

237
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
A golden toad...

238
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,600
Worth 100,000?

239
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,680
It's not the golden toad.

240
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
It's the luminous pearl in its mouth.

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
A natural luminous pearl.

242
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,360
Wait a second.

243
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,210
Isn't that just a dyed stone bead?

244
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
Professor Li from Hu City University
verified it.

245
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
It's authentic.

246
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
I'll offer 150,000.

247
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
150,000!

248
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,590
Wait, wait.

249
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,640
150,000, seriously?

250
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,800
This item was mine.

251
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,680
If I knew it was real,

252
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,660
I wouldn't have sold it.

253
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
Wait.

254
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,080
You knew this bracelet was artificially aged

255
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,200
and still sold it to me at a high price.

256
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
Playing the fool to outsmart me, huh?

257
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Everyone's got their tricks.

258
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Sorry for that.

259
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,560
Even the sharpest hunter can get outwitted.

260
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,200
