No.

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,320
=Episode 17=
No, don't do this.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,720
Don't.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,240
There are over 100 videos in total.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,970
Five women are victims.

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,510
What a disgrace.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,360
Wu,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,720
the whole room has been searched.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,800
There is only one camera.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,120
Do you have ice cubes?

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,280
Yes, wait a moment.

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm going to remove the tape from your mouth.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
But you can't shout.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Otherwise...

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
The evidence of crime is in our hands now.

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,480
If we hand it to the police,

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,680
you'll be spending your life behind bars.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,880
What do you want?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,640
I know you're working with Shadow Loan Co.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
I need you to help me

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,440
get all illegal evidence of Shadow Loan Co.

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,040
How is that possible?

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
If Mr. Meng finds out,

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
I won't survive.

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
These will cost you your life anyway.

26
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,280
Earning merit is your only way out.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,120
I...

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,240
You guys...

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,120
Can you really

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,970
help me?

31
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,680
We're after the big fish.

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,440
Small fry don't interest us.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,600
Alright, alright.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,040
I'll trust you this time.

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,440
Though Mr. Meng is very cautious,

36
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,160
I do know where

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,880
he hides the ledger and documents.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,280
Where is it?

39
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,840
Paradise Island.

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,640
The island is Shadow Loan Co.'s secret base.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,120
It holds all the cash and ledgers.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,120
On accounting day at the end of each month,

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,160
it's open only to insiders.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,840
I can use this chance to get you inside.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,560
Get ready to move.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,030
Alright, go.

47
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,930
I'll head up first.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,840
Why is she here?

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,440
She couldn't relax knowing I came with you,

50
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,820
so she insisted on tagging along.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,600
Before the ship leaves,

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,620
ask her to leave quickly.

53
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm still here.

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Kick me off the ship,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,280
then go after our Qingqing, right?

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,280
Let me tell you,

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,000
as long as I'm here, no way.

58
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
Alright then.

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't blame me if I didn't warn you.

60
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,680
Oh, I'm so scared.

61
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,640
What are you carrying? Take it out.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Bro,

63
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
I'm a chef.

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I can't get used to the ladles on this ship.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,760
Alright, you can go.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
Scout the area first.

67
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,600
We'll split up later.

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
Hey, the housekeeper over there!

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Hurry up and clean the place!

70
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
Chef, report to the kitchen.

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,600
You two, help me carry...

72
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,960
Pang Kun?

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,120
Bai Wu.

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Di Qingqing.

75
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,520
Danger warning.

76
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,920
The host's life is in danger.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,280
Why are you here?

78
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,780
Let me tell you something.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
Move, move, move!

80
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,520
Someone!

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,720
Grab both of them for me.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
And this woman too.

83
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,840
Take her as well.

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,840
(System, isn't the success rate 90%?)

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
Success rate: 90%.

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,520
Sudden danger rate: 99%.

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,760
(You totally messed me up.)

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,380
(Dodge left, dodge right, block, crouch)

89
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,420
(Punch thrown)

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,440
Leave it to me.

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,520
He doesn't like you,

92
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,320
but I do.

93
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,960
Bai Wu.

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,000
Bai Wu.

95
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Bai Wu, wake up!

96
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Bai Wu.

97
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
How are you?

98
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm fine.

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,600
Where are we?

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
It should be the bottom of the ship cabin.

101
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
We should find a way to unlock the handcuffs.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,920
I have an idea.

103
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,740
I have a hairpin in my hair.

104
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,120
Hurry up!

105
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,840
Wait a second.

106
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,660
I can't find the right spot.

107
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,280
Don't move.

108
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,440
Master Bai.

109
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,160
We meet again.

110
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,280
Pang Kun,

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I'll give you 20 million.

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Let us go.

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,040
Don't worry.

114
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
After you're gone,

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,480
I'll handle your inheritance well.

116
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Throw them both into the sea.

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,440
What are you doing?

118
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
Don't touch him!

119
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,580
Throw the guy into the sea.

120
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,120
As for the woman...

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
What are you doing?

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,600
If you dare touch her,

123
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm not letting you go.

124
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,640
Still acting tough, huh?

125
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,240
Drag him out of here.

126
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
Don't touch him!

127
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,960
I'll tell you a secret

128
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,800
the Hall Lord of Shengong Hall wants to know.

129
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,400
A secret?

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,080
What secret?

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,320
Let me go and I'll tell you.

132
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Keep talking.

133
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,160
Recently, Sanxingdui

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,720
unearthed a large number of artifacts.

135
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
One of the artifacts

136
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,880
is connected to a British Museum collection.

137
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,380
As long as they are combined together

138
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,680
and based on
the Khufu Pyramid's inscriptions,

139
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,800
a treasure can be found.

140
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,200
A treasure?

141
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,560
What treasure?

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,440
We can't let outsiders know.

143
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,200
Speak.

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,760
That treasure...

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,840
That treasure is...

146
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
One Piece.

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Bai Wu, hurry!

148
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Get lost!

149
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,960
Don't underestimate your navigator, Captain.

150
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,320
What do we do next?

151
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,320
Let's get out first.

152
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
Go!

153
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,400
Here's the satellite phone.

154
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,420
Call the police, quickly!

155
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,960
Hello? We'd like to report a crime.

156
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,600
We've been illegally detained on a ship.

157
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,640
Can you locate us?

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,720
Tell them to hurry.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,920
Yes, it's urgent!

160
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
System,

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
before the police arrive,

162
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,690
Shadow Loan Co.'s evidence of crime...

163
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,720
Chance of being destroyed:

164
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
100%.

165
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,760
Where's Yi'er?

166
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
She got separated.

167
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,240
Fatty,

168
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,400
you protect Qingqing and Mu Yi'er.

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll go to the records room.

170
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,320
Wait a sec.

171
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Let's go together instead.

172
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,640
I don't even know how to use this.

173
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,140
Look at you, scaredy-cat.

174
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
