2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,400
Bet you didn't expect this.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
What do you want from us?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,240
Obviously, pay us.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,900
Pay me back five million.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,880
No, no, hold on.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,680
Add the interest.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,520
And emotional distress fees.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,200
Pay us eight million.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,840
That is a counterfeit.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,160
Why should I compensate you?

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,120
What's wrong with it being a counterfeit?

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,340
He was willing to pay for it.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,960
Why are you meddling in this?

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,640
He's my friend.

16
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,480
Of course I'll help him.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,960
Wu...

18
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,160
Friends?

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,680
Alright.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,600
Loyalty.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,180
Just waiting for you to say that.

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,000
Aren't you going to handle this?

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Alright, you give me an answer.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,040
Name a figure.

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,360
Ten million.

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,680
Ten million?

27
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,040
How much?

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
That's not much, right?

29
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,320
What's wrong?

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,680
Are you scared?

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,040
Didn't you say you'd help your friends?

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,640
Then go ahead.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,540
Don't tell me when it comes to money,

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,120
this friendship is over.

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,240
Bros, I know,

36
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
this guy

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
doesn't have any money at all.

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
He's broke.

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Totally broke.

40
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,880
Hey,

41
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,560
you don't have money,

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,680
why are you playing hero?

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,680
Bai Wu,

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,400
you've ruined a good deal

45
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,520
and messed up our livelihood.

46
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,720
You even embarrassed me.

47
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,040
Ten million,

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,200
is it much?

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Ten million is not much.

50
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,260
Is it too much?

51
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,340
Isn't our boss's reputation

52
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,160
worth money?

53
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,170
Ten million isn't much.

54
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,760
I just didn't expect

55
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,920
Mr. Meng's reputation at Shadow Loan Co.

56
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,760
could be

57
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,840
so worthless.

58
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
What did you say?

59
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
- What did you say?
- Watch your mouth!

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
Hey, guys,

61
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,760
we're all good brothers.

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,360
- Get lost.
- Got it.

63
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,840
I have ten million here.

64
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Take it.

65
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,880
We're square now.

66
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,960
Fatty.

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
Bai Wu, no.

68
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,440
Wu, you're impressive.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,360
Regret...

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,280
Regret it now?

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,840
Thinking it's not enough?

72
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,240
Brat,

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,280
because of you two,

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
other peers look down on me.

75
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's do this.

76
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
Ten million

77
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,720
to buy your lives.

78
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
You humiliated me.

79
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,040
You.

80
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,440
And you.

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,680
I want an arm from each of you.

82
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,100
As long as you don't hurt us,

83
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,440
name your terms.

84
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,440
Alright, you've got guts.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,240
Do you dare to bet with me?

86
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,360
What are we betting on?

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Liar's Dice.

88
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Five rounds.

89
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760
Win them all, and you can leave.

90
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,400
But if you lose even one round,

91
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm taking an arm from each of you.

92
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
Fair enough, right?

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,200
You think we're fools?

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,960
We are bound to lose.

95
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,720
Fine, let's bet!

96
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,480
(System, time for work!)

97
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,880
Five threes.

98
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,800
Six threes.

99
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,080
Open.

100
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,800
Let's go again.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,920
Six ones.

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,840
Open.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,920
Five ones.

104
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,720
Again.

105
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,250
Six.

106
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,120
Seven.

107
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,000
None.

108
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
Again.

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
Four fives.

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,680
I don't have any.

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,960
Again.

112
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Four sixes.

113
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,440
- Five sixes.
- Six sixes.

114
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,640
- Seven sixes.
- Eight sixes.

115
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
- Nine sixes.
- Open.

116
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,760
I don't believe you have it.

117
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,600
Five ones.

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,520
I won.

119
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,040
This guy actually won five rounds in a row.

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,080
Wu,

121
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,080
you really are the living God of Gambling.

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,240
You flatter me.

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Don't just stand there.

124
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,560
Hurry up and leave.

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,960
Stop right there!

126
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,320
Mr. Meng,

127
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,720
don't tell me you can't handle losing.

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Can't handle losing?

129
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,280
You cheated!

130
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,200
Yeah, he cheated!

131
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
Guys, he won five rounds in a row.

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,990
There's definitely something fishy.

133
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,680
Cut off his hand!

134
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,880
Cut off his hand!

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Meng.

136
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,520
Why are you getting so worked up?

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,960
Di Qingqing.

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,880
Miss Di,

139
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,960
what brings you here?

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,840
I just heard

141
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,520
you called my friends over to hang out,

142
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
so I come take a look.

143
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
Bai Wu,

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
what are you playing?

145
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,300
This is pretty creative.

146
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
I...

147
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,280
Does this look like I'm playing?

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Is Mr. Bai really your friend?

149
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
Of course!

150
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,440
Mr. Bai is one of the Di Group's

151
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
most important partners in Jiang City.

152
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,680
Let go, let go!

153
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Buddy,

154
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
why didn't you say so earlier?

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,290
It seems

156
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,640
there's a misunderstanding between you.

157
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,680
It's a misunderstanding.

158
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
Since it's a misunderstanding,

159
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,080
how about I help clear it up?

160
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,280
No need, it's all resolved now.

161
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,040
Mr. Meng, let that ten million go like this?

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,440
What ten million?

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
Listen up, all of you.

164
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,920
From now on, if anyone crosses Mr. Bai,

165
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,480
they'll face serious consequences.

166
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,400
Got it?

167
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
Since the misunderstanding is cleared,

168
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,240
we have other matters to attend to.

169
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:21,916
We're leaving.

170
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,680
Miss Di, about the matter I mentioned...

171
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,480
No problem.

172
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,404
I'll have finance draft a contract.

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
We can discuss the details later.

174
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
See you.

175
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
Bah.

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
You...

177
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,160
Why are you here?

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,600
My contact here told me

179
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,920
you ran into some trouble,

180
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
so I've come to help out.

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960
Miss Di,

182
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,480
you really saved my life today.

183
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,760
The one who saved you is me, okay?

184
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,840
Ah, that's right.

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,000
Wu, you saved the first half of my life

186
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
and Miss Di saved the second half.

187
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
From now on, my life

188
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
belongs to both of you.

189
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,320
Fatty,

190
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
here.

191
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
Take this ten Million.

192
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,400
Ten million?

193
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,800
My life is worth that much?

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you thinking?

195
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
It's Tang Bohu's painting.

196
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,960
Mr. Che bought it for ten million.

197
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,200
What?!

198
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,200
Mine is the real one?

199
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Yeah.

200
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,640
By the way,

201
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,040
how did you cooperate with Shadow Loan Co.?

202
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,480
It's not really cooperation.

203
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
They borrowed billions from the Di Group.

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,040
The interest rate is decent.

205
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,880
They also provide me with some information

206
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,480
that's hard to get openly.

207
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
You agreed?

208
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,180
Still thinking about it.

209
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,280
What's there to think about?

210
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
They're loan sharks.

211
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,410
If you give them the money,

212
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,700
they'll just use it to do harm.

213
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,520
As if not giving them money

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,040
would stop them from doing harm.

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,240
What kind of logic is that?

216
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,360
In this world,

217
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,680
darkness has always existed.

218
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
Even if you don't accept it, it remains.

219
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,880
Existing doesn't mean it's justified.

220
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Not fighting the darkness is one thing,

221
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,800
but aiding it is another.

222
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
Your mindset is wrong, isn't it?

223
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
I am applying reasonably

224
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,920
to mitigate risks.

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,940
Do you think doing a business is easy?

226
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,330
The world

227
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,704
has never operated solely on overt rules.

228
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,160
If you ignore covert rules,

229
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,600
you're bound to mess up.

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,160
You don't agree with it, so you ignore it.

231
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
I think your mindset is wrong.

232
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,200
You are their accomplice.

233
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,360
I saved you. Am I also their accomplice?

234
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
Did I force them to lend money?

235
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
Should I thank you for that?

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
You probably should.

237
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
About the collaboration,

238
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:39,956
I can give you my reply now.

239
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,200
I refuse.

240
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,360
- Wu...
- Whatever.

241
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,720
Wu!

242
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,800
Hey, you two,

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,360
calm down, alright?

244
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
Miss Di.

245
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,520
Miss Di.

246
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,400
He's not sensible.

247
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
See you soon.

248
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,200
Miss Di.

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Can someone

250
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,320
give me a ride?

251
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Mr. Jin, the guy's on his way.

252
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,680
System, tell me.

253
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,240
Does what she said make sense?

254
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,400
Makes sense: 30%.

255
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,520
30%?

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
I think your mindset is wrong too.

257
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,680
The brakes have failed.

258
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,040
Pull the handbrake, turn left, duck down!

259
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,760
Survival rate: 71%.

260
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Quick, call 911!

261
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Calling won't help.

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,280
The crash was too severe.

263
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,960
No way anyone survived this.
