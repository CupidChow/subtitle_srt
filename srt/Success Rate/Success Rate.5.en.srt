1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,240
Let's go.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,560
Go with me to meet my parents.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,120
=Success Rate=
Isn't this too soon?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,100
=Episode 5=
Even though I go,

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,460
your parents might not accept me.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,680
At that time,

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,560
we'll kiss right in front of them.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,200
They'll have to believe us.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,520
This plot...

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Feels like a honey trap.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,880
0%.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,040
Does she really want me to meet her parents?

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,280
100%.

14
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,680
Does she really want me as her boyfriend?

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
0%.

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,600
You're using me

17
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,720
to deal with your parents' marriage pressure?

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
20%.

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,080
(20%?)

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,760
Yeah, let's just pretend.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,160
Let's go.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,600
Where are you from, Wu?

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,480
What do you do?

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,960
How long

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,160
have you known Yi'er?

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,000
Mom.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,720
You two continue.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,040
I'll go prepare some fruits.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,200
Have a good time.

30
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,800
I will knock before entering.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,160
I forgot to close the door.

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,840
(Qingqing hates unfaithful men.)

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,440
(If I prove he's a jerk,)

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,520
(Qingqing will realize)

35
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
(and stay away from this liar.)

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Miss Mu...

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,120
My mom's eavesdropping at the door.

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,200
(She's a flawless beauty)

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,440
(from every angle.)

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,720
Well,

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,160
isn't it bad to trick elders like this?

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,240
If you help me this time,

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I'll do anything you want.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,680
(Show your true colors,)

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
(jerk.)

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
(Oh my gosh!)

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,360
(Did I just save the galaxy?)

48
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,480
System,

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
if I kiss her now,

50
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,320
what's the chance she'll accept?

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
0%.

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
So,

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
she's testing me?

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
100%.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,720
I see.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640
Well, I have something to do.

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,880
I'll head out first.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,360
Wait a second!

59
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,400
(Still testing me.)

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
(Whoa, that is a real fall!)

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
I swear I didn't do it on purpose.

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,280
Do you believe me?

63
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,800
Go away!

64
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,280
Miss Mu, I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,600
I really can't help with this.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,840
Mrs. Mu, I have something to do.

67
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,760
I'll head out first.

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,640
Wu, Wu!

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
It's rare for you to visit.

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,400
Why not have a meal before you leave?

71
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,640
No, I really can't.

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,920
My uncle's niece's son

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
is sick.

74
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,400
I need to go look after him.

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,720
I'll head out now.

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Oh dear!

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,160
What kind of people are they?

78
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,480
(Keep pretending.)

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,160
(A lousy fortune teller dare covet Qingqing.)

80
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
(I'll expose you sooner or later.)

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,680
(Money matters are more important right now.)

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,000
(The auction is just days away.)

83
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,480
(I need to find a good item quickly.)

84
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,660
(Maybe I should check with Fatty Wang again.)

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,000
Fatty,

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
last time, I just got lucky.

87
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,560
How about we become friends?

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm buying something here.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
Not for sale.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
System, among these things,

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,440
what's the chance it's worth 10,000?

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
0%.

93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,280
5,000?

94
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
0%.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
3,000?

96
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
100%.

97
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,960
(Wow, that's low.)

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
30,000.

99
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,880
I'll take just one.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,200
30,000 for one item?

101
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,200
Just one.

102
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
(All my items together here)

103
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,800
(cost less than 2,800.)

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,760
(One item sells for 30,000.)

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,560
(That's ten times the cost.)

106
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
I didn't want to sell originally,

107
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
but since you're a fellow enthusiast,

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
pick one.

109
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,000
Just one.

110
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Alright.

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,320
This little burner is great for incense.

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,520
I buy it.

113
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,600
Okay.

114
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
Hey, someone's looking for you.

115
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,770
Warning: Danger.

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,040
Warning: Danger.

117
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,580
- Oh no.
- Just asking directions.

118
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
The Antiques Market is over there.

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm not close with him, really not.

120
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
Get that Fatty.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Being with him spells trouble.

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
- Don't run.
- Stop running!

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
Stop running.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
Stop right there.

125
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,080
System, which way is better to escape?

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
This way.

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Hurry. Stop there.

128
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,440
Looking for trouble?

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,280
Come on. Let's go.

130
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Get lost!

131
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,480
I must've hit a streak of bad luck with you.

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Darn it! We lost them.

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,340
You two, that way.

134
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:51,064
Go!

135
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,600
Bai Wu, have you been here before?

136
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,000
- How could I?
- Well,

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
then how do you know where to go?

138
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
I can predict these things.

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,400
Trust me.

140
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,800
You two, this way.

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,270
I'm out of energy.

142
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,280
Two fools.

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Let's see where you run off to now.

144
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,120
Hey, haven't you found the exit yet?

145
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,920
He's over here!

146
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
System, give me some tips.

147
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,700
(Dodge left, dodge right, block, crouch)

148
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,120
(Dodge right)

149
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,680
(Dodge right.)

150
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,160
(Dodge left.)

151
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
(Crouch.)

152
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
(Block.)

153
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
Fatty,

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,200
sorry for dragging you

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,720
into this today.

156
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,400
Let's focus on getting out alive first.

157
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
Once we pass that secret door,

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
we'll be in my territory.

159
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,480
The chance rate of escape is 51%.

160
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,200
Victory is in sight.

161
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Fatty,

162
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
It's okay.

164
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,100
Let's give it our all.

165
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,680
- They are outnumbered.
- True.

166
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Keep going. Don't stop.

167
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,520
I'm not done yet.

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,800
No point hiding it now.

169
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,880
Let me show my strength.

170
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,940
How much money do you want?

171
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,220
I'll have my wife bring it over.

172
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,640
Just name your price.

173
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,080
Take him down.

174
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,920
System, what's the escape chance now?

175
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,960
Escape success rate is 13%.

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,980
(There's still a chance.)

177
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,520
(Where's the chance?)

178
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,720
Fatty is the key.

179
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,360
(The chance is that Fatty.)

180
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
(Could there be a hidden trick?)

181
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,300
Fatty,

182
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,800
use your ultimate move now.

183
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,080
Escape success rate is 13%.

184
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,760
Fatty, there's something I never told you.

185
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,520
That small burner is a Xuande Incense Burner,

186
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,920
a Qing imitation made by Gao Yunqi.

187
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,860
It's worth six million.

188
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,260
I've already received the payment.

189
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,050
What did you say?

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
And I've met Mr. Che.

191
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,540
I told Mr. Che

192
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,120
that all the fakes in the Antique Market

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,680
are entirely your doing.

194
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,560
Also, I'm part of their group.

195
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,360
We're just turning against our own kind.

196
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Bai Wu,

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000

198
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,320
Worse than a beast.

199
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,320
Today, none of you will leave alive.
