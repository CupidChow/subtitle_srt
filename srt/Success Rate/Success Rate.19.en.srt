00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,680
Security!

3
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,720
Whoever dares to make a move,

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,480
I'll cripple him.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,740
Are you looking for death?

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,200
You dare wreck my place?

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,960
Mr. Jin,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,320
what an impressive show of power!

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,080
That's Mr. Sun from the Antique Association?

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,480
Why would someone like him be here?

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,320
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
Ordinary folks rarely get to see him.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
Yet he showed up today!

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,000
I wonder if Wanbao's auction

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,160
welcomes me.

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
Tell me your plan.

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,480
On auction day,

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,920
Jin Youlong will surely try to interfere.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
That's not an issue.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll get someone to hold the fort.

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,520
He wouldn't dare do anything by then.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,320
Mr. Sun,

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,280
you are too humble.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
It's an honor even to see you here.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,680
Since that's the case,

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,840
could you bend the rules

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
for these guys?

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,320
Who dares not to show you respect?

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
Does this mean

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,560
it's foolproof now?

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Pretty much.

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
But to be cautious,

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,080
I've prepared a backup plan.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,320
Fatty, on the day of the auction,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,400
you go to the Wanbao Chamber

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,480
to check their contracts and accounts

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
and see if there's any proof of them

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
funneling benefits to Shengong Hall.

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,200
That might be tricky.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
The Wanbao Chamber isn't foolish.

41
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
He won't let me investigate just like that.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,320
Don't worry.

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll give him a reason he can't refuse.

44
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,520
Officer, I want to file a report.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm a former employee of the Wanbao Chamber.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,620
I report that the Wanbao Chamber

47
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,940
is suspected of money laundering.

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,520
Stop! Stop right there!

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,880
You can't go in there.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,360
Officer?

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,680
Mr. Wang,

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,520
apologies.

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Well...

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,720
I...

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,640
Well...

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,480
I...

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,960
Officer, I...

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,160
I know there's something wrong with Wanbao.

59
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I want to report them.

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
I want to make a contribution.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Wu,

62
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
everything's smooth here.

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Got it.

64
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
This way,

65
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,700
everything will go perfectly.

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,260
A solid balance of offense and defense.

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,520
We split into three teams.

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,520
You've got some skills!

69
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
You flatter me.

70
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,960
Ladies and gentlemen, the next auction item

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
is a Royal Purple Clay Teapot

72
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,204
from Qianlong era.

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Starting bid: four million.

74
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Each increase must be at least 200,000.

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Please bid enthusiastically, everyone!

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,800
4.2 million.

77
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,160
4.4 million.

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
4.6 million.

79
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,120
5.4 million.

80
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,360
Eight million.

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Eight million.

82
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,780
- Mr. Bai,
- Eight million?

83
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,320
Eight million, first call.

84
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,280
Eight million, second call.

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,040
Eight million, final call.

86
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,960
Sold for eight million!

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
Congratulations, Mr. Bai.

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,760
You've won this rare auction item.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Please, Mr. Bai, come up for a photo.

90
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
I'll take a group photo

91
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,640
later

92
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,400
until I win other items.

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
That's wild!

94
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,940
What does he mean by "win other items"?

95
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
Is he planning to bid in succession?

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,200
This guy is so bold.

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
The next auction item

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,200
is a Yellow-glazed Yuhuchun Vase from Han.

99
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,320
Starting bid: 5.5 million.

100
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
5.7 million.

101
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Six million.

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
6.2 million.

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,800
Ten million.

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Ten million, first call.

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,340
- How can we do?
- Are you bidding?

106
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,160
I'm out.

107
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,000
Ten million, second call.

108
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
Sold for ten million.

109
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,640
Congrats on winning another treasure.

110
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,660
The Double-dragon Pattern Plate.

111
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,600
Starting bid: five million.

112
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,280
- Each increase...
- 20 million.

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,520
Looks like he doesn't care about money.

114
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Let's call it a day.

115
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,640
Mr. Bai, you really are generous!

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,740
You're very good at living off others.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Truly impressive.

118
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,560
You flatter me.

119
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,160
I could never outshine you.

120
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,050
At such a grand auction,

121
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,560
turns out all item are fakes.

122
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Fakes?

123
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,080
Impossible, right?

124
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,240
If they are fakes,

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,840
it'll ruin Wanbao's reputation.

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
It doesn't seem fake to me.

127
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,000
Bai Wu,

128
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
don't make baseless accusations.

129
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
Our auction items at Wanbao

130
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,160
are carefully selected

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,400
and vetted by experts.

132
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,720
There's absolutely no chance of fakes.

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,560
Mr. Sun, please say something fair.

134
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah,

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
let Mr. Sun make the call.

136
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
These items,

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
with my experience,

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,520
indeed seem genuine.

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,040
However,

140
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,600
there are items in the market

141
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,830
that can pass as the real deal.

142
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,780
Just by looking with the naked eye,

143
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,360
I can't guarantee these are authentic.

144
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,560
Pass as the real deal?

145
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
Are you kidding me?

146
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
If such fakes exist,

147
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,280
how can we buy the antiques?

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Exactly.

149
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,320
Everyone heard that, right?

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
Nowadays, fakes

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,040
are impossible to guard against.

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Bai Wu,

153
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,440
since you say these are fakes,

154
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,880
show us the proof.

155
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Simple.

156
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,320
He smashed it.

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,740
It's worth 20 million.

158
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,860
He just smashed it like that.

159
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
The proof you want

160
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,080
is hidden inside here.

161
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,240
I'll show you now.

162
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,600
Bai Wu,

163
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
where's the proof?

164
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
Show it to us!

165
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
What's wrong?

166
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,200
That's impossible.

167
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,000
Energy is insufficient.

168
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,780
It requires to overdraw the host's luck.

169
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Oh no!

170
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,180
How could you be so careless?

171
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,520
(That's impossible!)

172
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
(Could this porcelain vase...)

173
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Two million for an antique just to smash it?

174
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Even if the Di Family is rich,

175
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,120
you can't waste money like this.

176
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,080
Bai Wu,

177
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,740
we've investigated all the auction items.

178
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,280
None of them have any issues.

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,880
What about Fatty?

180
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,720
Fatty

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,480
was tricked by Mr. Wang.

182
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,340
(Parent Company Balance Sheet)

183
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,720
The contracts and finances seem fine.

184
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,680
Then what about the data on the USB?

185
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,680
It's just regular fund transfers.

186
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,120
Someone twisted it out of context.

187
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
It makes people think there's an issue.

188
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,640
Weren't you planning to report it?

189
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Yes.

190
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,960
I report

191
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,400
Wanbao exploits its employees

192
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,660
and deducts wages unfairly.

193
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,920
I've worked here for over ten years.

194
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,400
Not a single overtime payment so far.

195
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,280
Bai Wu,

196
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,520
are you sure about this?

197
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,440
No way, absolutely no way.

198
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
This one must be a fake.

199
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,800
It must be a fake. Absolutely.

200
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
Impossible.

201
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,360
Bai Wu,

202
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,640
you smash your own stuff. I don't care.

203
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,520
But don't frame innocent people.

204
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
Jin Zhefa.

205
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,700
It was Jin Zhefa who stole the fakes.

206
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,120
What did you say?

207
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
Say that again.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,720
Jin Zhefa, the president of Wanbao Group,

209
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,160
is part of Shengong Hall.

210
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
Arrest him.

211
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,990
Interrogate him, then we'll know the truth.

212
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,200
Arrest him, huh?

213
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,660
Alright, I'll take you to arrest him.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
Come on then.

215
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,540
(Solemn mourning)

216
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,920
Aren't you going to arrest my dad?

217
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,010
Arrest him.

218
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,500
(Solemn mourning)

219
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
What?

220
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,400
