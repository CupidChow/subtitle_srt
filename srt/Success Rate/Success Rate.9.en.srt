1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,160
I got Tang Bohu's A Lady in Spring Mountain.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,340
(Di Qingqing)
A Lady in Spring Mountain?

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,680
It's authentic?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,280
Absolutely!

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,620
=Success Rate=
=Episode 9=

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,490
Your account has received ten million.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,520
Wow.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,920
Ten million transferred without a hitch.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,800
Fatty Wang sure has bad luck.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,560
He always manages to find great treasures,

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,280
but I'm the one who ends up rich.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,680
This ten million

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,080
needs to be shared with him.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,360
You gave him ten million without hesitation.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,680
That's Tang Bohu's painting.

16
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,480
Ten million is already a bargain.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,480
He said it's true, so you believe him?

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,480
What if that's a fake?

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,120
Trust those you hire.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
Besides, Bai Wu isn't naive.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,320
He won't use a counterfeit to fool Mr. Che.

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,720
I bet

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,740
Bai Wu

24
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,480
is unable to invite Mr. Che.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,000
I bet he can.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,960
You've been brainwashed by him.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,500
(Guyun Pavilion)

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,100
(Guyun Pavilion)

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
Hello, I'm Bai Wu.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
So you're Mr. Bai.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,080
Here's 30,000 yuan.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,260
Consider it a thank-you for helping Xiaoxiao

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
take care of Oreo together.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,480
No need, really.

35
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,960
I wonder if I could meet with Mr. Che.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,680
Here, take it.

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
Sorry about that.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,360
My father is overwhelmed with work,

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
and isn't able to meet guests.

40
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
I want to seek Mr. Che's advice

41
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,640
about Guyun Pavilion storing counterfeits.

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,720
My father just finished practicing Qi.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,960
It's not convenient to talk now.

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,640
Just wait

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,400
and observe his gestures later.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Alright.

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,520
I'll go make tea.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm Bai Wu,

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,760
a friend of Xiaoxiao.

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,200
I've admired you for a long time.

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,200
Today, I came to pay my respects.

52
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Thank you, Mr. Che.

53
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,920
Please, have a seat as well.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Father,

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,080
calm down, please.

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,560
Why did you hit me?

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,520
What's going on?

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
He was scolding you because of Xiaoxiao.

59
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,120
Yet you sat down first.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,000
He was just scolding me earlier?

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
That's pretty obvious.

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
My father said,

63
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,240
you brat,

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,400
whether you're Bai Wu or Hei Wu,

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,320
stay away from my granddaughter.

66
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,920
If you bother Xiaoxiao again,

67
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,160
I'll break your legs.

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
Well,

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
just

70
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,200
one gesture.

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Che.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,520
I was disrespectful.

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
I've already found a new place.

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'll move out right away.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
You don't have to praise me.

76
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,060
It's my fault for bothering Xiaoxiao.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
Why did you throw me again?

78
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,960
Who said he praised you?

79
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,840
My father said,

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,970
you dare to talk outside

81
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,880
Guyun Pavilion holds a counterfeit;

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,920
if you can't prove it,

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,160
you'll be blacklisted in the Antique Circle.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,320
Just a thumb?

85
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,200
Yet it reveals so much?

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,200
Yeah. Can't you understand simple words?

87
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,840
Let me give you a heads-up first.

88
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,680
My grandfather's temper

89
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,280
is a little eccentric.

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
(Just a little?)

91
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,920
Alright, Mr. Bai,

92
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
no need to be nervous.

93
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,840
If you have evidence, just show it.

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
Alright.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,400
I heard Mr. Che owns

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,160
A Lady in Spring Mountain by Tang Bohu.

97
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,370
I acquired another one

98
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,720
by chance the other day.

99
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,000
Please take a look.

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,280
Its composition feels spacious.

101
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,240
The brushwork is so dynamic.

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,960
Its charm is truly unique.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,400
This is really Tang Yin's original work.

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,480
What's wrong?

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,000
Did you notice something?

106
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,680
What does he mean?

107
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,000
These two paintings are identical.

108
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Even the lead oxidation

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,560
and residual seal match perfectly.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
In this world,

111
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,920
it's impossible to have
two identical paintings.

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,640
If it happens,

113
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
one of them

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,160
must be a counterfeit.

115
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,760
Sorry, did I say something wrong again?

116
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,000
(Oh no, this old man is terrifying.)

117
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,680
(System, help me!)

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
The task is too simple.

119
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
System refuses to assist.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,320
My father is praising your intelligence.

121
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
Come on, get up, get up.

122
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,240
Have some tea.

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,440
These two paintings are identical

124
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,840
and so intricately crafted.

125
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,720
Indeed, they're hard to distinguish.

126
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,000
But, Mr. Bai,

127
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
how can you be certain

128
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,830
that the painting from Guyun Pavilion

129
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,320
must be a counterfeit?

130
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,350
My father said,

131
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,480
if you dare lie,

132
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,320
you'll suffer beating badly.

133
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm willing

134
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,720
to make a bet with Mr. Che.

135
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,720
How do you want to bet?

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,200
If I'm wrong,

137
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,760
I'll pay ten million

138
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,200
to apologize to Mr. Che.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,160
If I win,

140
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,800
I hope Mr. Che

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,040
can do me three favors.

142
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,520
Well...

143
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,920
Fine.

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,720
We'll do it your way.

145
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Thank you, Mr. Che.

146
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,130
This counterfeit is impressively detailed.

147
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,800
Judging by its surface, it's hard to tell.

148
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,320
The evidence lies in the head: 100%.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,060
But there is evidence of forgery

150
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,400
within the paper.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,680
The painting repair?

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
Mr. Che, Mr. Xiao,

153
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,720
this is the evidence of the counterfeit.

154
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,600
This...

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,340
QR code?

156
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
This painting

157
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,500
was obtained from Mr. Duan

158
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
of Yufeng Pavilion.

159
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,040
Alright.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,300
I'll immediately investigate the seller.

161
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,080
Thank you, Mr. Che.

162
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,960
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,830
(What does that mean?)

164
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,160
(System, help me!)

165
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,260
The task is too simple.

166
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:52,196
System refused to assist.

167
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
(Don't mess with me!)

168
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,520
(How is it simple?)

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
(System?)

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,240
(Does that mean...?)

171
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,160
(Right or wrong?)

172
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
I feel much better after this punch.

173
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Kid,

174
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,880
why are you lying on the ground?

175
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,040
Get up!

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
I won't.

177
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,040
You can speak now?

178
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,620
Kid,

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,960
how did you know

180
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,040
there's a QR code there?

181
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,080
You might not believe it.

182
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,800
I calculated it.

183
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Calculated it?

184
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Yeah.

185
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,200
If you dare fool me

186
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,480
using tricks again,

187
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,570
do you believe that I'll break your arm?

188
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
I really calculated it!

189
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,640
I really did.

190
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
You're so stubborn.

191
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,840
