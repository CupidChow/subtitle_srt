I thought

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,160
=Episode 14=
we're doomed.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,080
Who knew Mr. Sun would test us?

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,180
I recommended you to join the Association

5
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,536
to investigate Shengong Hall.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,560
Mr. Sun said he wants to test you.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,080
Treat this as your entrance exam.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,860
Mr. Sun,

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,240
the counterfeits are from the Ghost Market.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,120
Has the Association found any leads yet?

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
We recently identified a few stall owners.

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,200
I asked Bao Dating to keep an eye on them.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,200
But they suddenly disappeared a while ago.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,920
And the leads were cut off.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,720
Where's Bao Dating?

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,960
He's missing.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,480
No sign of him alive.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,040
No sign of him dead either.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,080
My dear brother.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Arranging your early entrance exam

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
was truly a last resort.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,960
What's the story behind Shengong Hall?

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,840
In the antique circle
during the Qianlong Era,

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,520
two incredibly skilled craftsmen emerged.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,160
The counterfeits they created

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,360
were considered masterpieces.

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,096
People called them Guifu and Shengong.

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,340
This Shengong Hall was founded

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,080
by Shengong lineage in the late Qing Dynasty.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,660
Later, Shengong Hall produced

31
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:37,456
a large number of counterfeits.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
And they made a fortune from it.

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,960
After New China was founded,

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,640
at the call of the government,

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,740
a group of antique masters

36
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:46,686
formed the Antique Association,

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,880
working together to purge counterfeits.

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,080
As for Shengong Hall,

39
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,320
it gradually faded from public view.

40
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
But in recent years,

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,840
they've resurfaced again.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
And this time,

43
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,160
their counterfeits

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,960
are good enough to pass as the real thing.

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
What do you mean by "pass as real"?

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Fake is still fake.

47
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Fooling others isn't a real skill.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,800
Mr. Che is absolutely right.

49
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,280
So, what's our next step?

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,800
No need to rush.

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,640
Today, we're just getting acquainted.

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,300
Tomorrow, we'll handle your membership.

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Sounds fantastic!

54
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll officially be part of the Association?

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
When they see me on antique street,

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,080
they'll have to call me Mr. Fatty, right?

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,680
Keep dreaming.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,920
Your membership is strictly secret.

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,040
You can't tell anyone.

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,800
So we're basically underground members?

61
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,760
Exactly, underground.

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,240
Otherwise, how to investigate secretly?

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
My dream shattered again.

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,520
Bai Wu.

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,360
Bai Wu,

66
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
I once promised you

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
to tell you clues about your parents.

68
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,570
Today, I can finally share them.

69
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,120
Please, go ahead.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,720
Your jade

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,080
is called Hetu Ancient Jade.

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Hetu Ancient Jade?

73
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,280
To be precise,

74
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,640
this jade,

75
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,000
there are actually two pieces.

76
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,960
It's said to come from meteors and comets.

77
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,680
It holds a mysterious power.

78
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,440
(Could it mean the System?)

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Back then, Guifu and Shengong each had one.

80
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Your jade

81
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,960
was originally held by one of my students.

82
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,600
Your student?

83
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
Where is he now?

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,800
20 years ago,

85
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,200
he was working at a research institute,

86
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
and secretly sent me an email.

87
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,440
This is the one.

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,280
Later,

89
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
there was an explosion at that place,

90
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,880
and everyone there lost their lives.

91
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,680
What?

92
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,600
But one thing is certain:

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,560
your mother's death is tied to Shengong Hall.

94
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,240
Shengong Hall?

95
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,360
Cheers to Bai Wu,

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,280
for rising to prominence,

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,640
becoming an industry mogul,

98
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
and reaching the peak of life.

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,600
- Great!
- Cheer!

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,520
Come on, come on.

101
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
For what you just said,

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll cover Oreo's expenses.

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
Thanks, Bai Wu!

104
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,280
What about me?

105
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
I hope you

106
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,360
won't get kicked out of the Association.

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Wait,

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,080
why does it sound so unlucky?

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,880
Grandpa said,

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,160
you have the most complaints on the street.

111
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,320
Who's here?

112
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,520
Eat!

113
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,400
Wait, it's you guys?

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,120
What, not happy to see us?

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,840
Welcome!

116
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,000
Definitely welcome!

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
Please, come in.

118
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Miss Di.

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Who's this?

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,120
Mu Yi'er.

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,440
Wow, they're gorgeous!

122
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
Stinky fortune teller,

123
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
finally caught you!

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,480
I told you he's a fraud.

125
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
You didn't believe me.

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,940
No wonder you're distancing yourself from me.

127
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,160
Turns out you've found your target.

128
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,880
Nonsense.

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
Xiaoxiao and I are just friends.

130
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,520
What about the lipstick mark?

131
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,520
Don't tell me Fatty kissed you.

132
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh no, I hope I didn't cause trouble.

133
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Looks like you did.

134
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,080
It's not that.

135
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,400
He is caught red-handed,

136
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,280
but he's still denying it.

137
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,640
We were just joking around.

138
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,120
Then why didn't she joke with others?

139
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
She only joked with you.

140
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
Bai Wu,

141
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,560
is this Qingqing you mentioned?

142
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Uh, yeah.

143
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,000
Qingqing,

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,560
you look amazing.

145
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,480
I really like you.

146
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,210
Don't get me wrong.

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,470
We were just joking around.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
Well, well, well.

149
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
A little girl just loves to do it.

150
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,090
I don't have siblings,

151
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,320
so I see Bai Wu as my real brother.

152
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,400
Let's all eat together.

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,360
Come on, dig in!

154
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Qingqing,

155
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,040
Yi'er,

156
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,280
I'll grab you some utensils.

157
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,560
Wait for me, okay?

158
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,680
Well...

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Thank you for that.

160
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
Where do you want to sit?

161
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,240
Qingqing, don't let him fool you.

162
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,960
You're impressive.

163
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,120
Bai Wu.

164
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Can I come in?

165
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,360
Wait, did I let you in?

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,600
Did I let you in?

167
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,520
Bai Wu,

168
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,560
this house belongs to you?

169
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
Can we talk, please?

170
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,720
We can talk right here.

171
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Alright.

172
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
Bai Wu,

173
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
I regret it.

174
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,680
Ever since we broke up,

175
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,200
I've been thinking about you every day.

176
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,640
Can we get back together?

177
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,280
But you already have a boyfriend.

178
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm sorry, Bai Wu.

179
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,680
Jin Youlong is a liar.

180
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,520
He lied about loving me.

181
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,920
He even hit me.

182
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,240
He forced me to help him

183
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
entertain his guests.

184
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,960
Bai Wu, I was wrong.

185
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
I really regret

186
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,000
not listening to you at that time.

187
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,360
For the sake of our seven years together,

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
can you forgive me just this once?

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,760
Bai Wu...

190
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
Spilled water cannot be gathered.

191
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,280
It's impossible now.

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
No, Bai Wu...

193
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
Are you out of your mind?

194
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,000
I know.

195
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
You still love me, don't you?

196
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,440
Can I stay tonight?

197
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
That might not be possible.

198
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,000
We're staying here tonight too.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
There aren't enough rooms.

200
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,000
Who are you two?

201
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,620
She's the woman I'm pursuing.

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,310
You like Bai Wu?

203
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,560
No way.

204
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Why would that be impossible?

205
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,560
Bai Wu has been devoted to me these years.

206
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,280
There's no way he'd like someone else.

207
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,400
Everyone has

208
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,320
their reckless teenage years.

209
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,800
Back then, Bai Wu

210
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,880
was too young to know something.

211
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
But now, he's wise enough to see clearly.

212
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
If you're just a pursuer,

213
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
then she's not even your girlfriend.

214
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,160
I know Bai Wu will come back to me.

215
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
After all, I have things

216
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,800
she could never offer.

217
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
Miss,

218
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
you're absolutely hilarious.

219
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,200
He... You...

220
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
You what?

221
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,080
He was devoted to you before,

222
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
and you repaid him with cruelty.

223
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,160
When he cared for you, you didn't cherish it.

224
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,560
Now you are dumped by another guy,

225
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,560
and suddenly remembers his kindness.

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
How dare you come back!

227
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,960
What?

228
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,880
Thinking of grazing on old grass?

229
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
Keep your mouth shut!

230
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,120
What?

231
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,600
Truth hurts, doesn't it?

232
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,840
Men like Bai Wu,

233
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,840
who love with all their heart,

234
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,760
are true treasures.

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600
Bai Wu, it isn't like that.

236
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,080
- I...
- Shh.

237
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Little girl, throw her out.

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,880
No way. What're you doing?

239
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,800
Hurry up and leave!

240
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,000
Bai Wu!

241
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,760
Bai Wu!

242
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,230
Bai Wu!

243
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,800
Thank you.

244
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Bai Wu,

245
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
your taste before

246
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
was honestly terrible.

247
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,720
He was blind.

248
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,680
I just couldn't stand it.

249
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,320
It wasn't to help him.

250
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
Hello? Siting.

251
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
Don't act impulsively.

252
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,480
Wait for me.

253
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,880
