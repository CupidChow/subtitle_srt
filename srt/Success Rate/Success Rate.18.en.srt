2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,440
Hey, don't rush, okay?

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,680
Let's build some chemistry,

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,800
alright?

5
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,240
You know,

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,160
the way you drink

7
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,280
is so cool

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,240
and so attractive.

9
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,040
I really like it.

10
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,220
Honestly,

11
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,160
you're really

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,680
so strong.

13
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,290
You enjoy this vibe, huh?

14
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,720
Alright, here I go!

15
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
You didn't catch me.

16
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,360
Try again!

17
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,220
Wow,

18
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,840
you're so quick.

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,320
Honestly, you're

20
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,170
the strongest man I've met.

21
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,960
Dear,

22
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,020
you really are

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,330
incredible.

24
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,390
I

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,050
can do even better.

26
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,980
That was close.

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,910
Next time, I'll increase the dose.

28
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,840
What's wrong?

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
Why aren't you running?

30
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,080
Danger's approaching.

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,200
Don't move.

32
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,520
Who are you two?

33
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,840
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,320
We're just staff.

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,280
Yeah, we were looking for the restroom,

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,760
but got lost.

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,680
Nonsense.

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,480
There are plenty upstairs.

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,280
I think you two

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
are sneaking around, aren't you?

41
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,360
Bro,

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,280
how do you know everything?

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,560
Stop laughing.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,760
If Mr. Pang finds out,

45
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,720
you are definitely thrown into the sea,

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,040
to feed the sharks.

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,440
Bro,

48
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,280
please don't tell Mr. Pang.

49
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,000
Or

50
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,280
how about we play together?

51
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,010
Play...

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,720
This

53
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
might not be appropriate.

54
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,440
It's fine.

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,360
Nothing inappropriate.

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
This should be the place.

57
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Are these all their criminal evidence?

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Wu,

59
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,120
how do we get all this out?

60
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,240
This is just the lower deck of the ship.

61
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,560
We're not leaving.

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,200
Until rescue arrives,

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
we'll stay here.

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
First, to protect ourselves,

65
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,800
and second,

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,840
to safeguard the data.

67
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Alright.

68
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
Fatty,

69
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,080
keep watch at the door.

70
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,580
I'll check the file cabinets.

71
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,920
Besides the evidence on Shadow Loan Co.,

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,800
there are clues on Shengong Hall.

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,960
Bai Wu,

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,200
take a look at this.

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,200
(Wanbao Chamber of Commerce
Transaction details)

76
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,320
Wanbao Chamber of Commerce?

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,400
As expected,

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,760
Wanbao is one of
Shengong Hall's fund sources.

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,880
Your earlier suspicions were spot on.

80
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,440
Bai Wu,

81
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,600
good job.

82
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,880
You actually found this place.

83
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,360
Wu,

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,080
who is he?

85
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,680
If my guess is correct,

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,120
he's the Hall Lord of Shengong Hall.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,480
Exactly.

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
We have all the evidence now.

89
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
You can't escape.

90
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,480
Why are you laughing?

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
You're just an entry-level ability user,

92
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
yet so confident.

93
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,520
(He knows about the System).

94
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,960
Ability user?

95
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
Where did you get

96
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,360
your Hetu Ancient Jade?

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
It was left by my biological parents.

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,640
Also,

99
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,960
what do you mean by entry-level ability user?

100
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
It seems

101
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
you're just a lucky fool,

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,200
who accidentally gained power.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
Such a disappointment.

104
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,480
Go reunite with your parents in heaven.

105
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Farewell, Bai Wu.

106
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,560
Alert! Alert!

107
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
Major life-threatening danger detected.

108
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,640
Wu! What do we do now, Wu?

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,080
Stay calm.

110
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,240
(System, the password!)

111
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,400
Password not found.

112
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,960
Escape rate: 0%.

113
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,160
Records room self-destruction activated.

114
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,720
Countdown initiated.

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,240
Ten,

116
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,240
- Wu!
- nine,

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
- Are we doomed?
- eight,

118
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
- System, use the protection function?
- seven,

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,640
- Bai Wu!
- Protection function can cover three people,

120
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,760
but energy is insufficient.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,360
It needs to overdraw the host's luck.

122
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you choose to overdraw?

123
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,240
- I do.
- two,

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,640
one.

125
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,420
(Weak)

126
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,440
Goodbye.

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
(System?)

128
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,160
(System?)

129
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
(Are you still there?)

130
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,580
Evidence was completely destroyed.

131
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,990
Mr. Meng has gone and is on the run.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,180
The witness you provided,

133
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,020
Luo Jiajun was found dead in a hotel.

134
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,540
We will continue investigating it.

135
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,790
Thanks all for your cooperation.

136
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,420
Of course, no problem.

137
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,020
Appreciate your hard work.

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,180
Protection function can cover three people.

139
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,340
Energy is insufficient.

140
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,980
It needs to overdraw the host's luck.

141
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,020
Do you choose to overdraw?

142
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,940
Yes, I do.

143
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,580
Luck's finally turning around.

144
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
That's a good sign.

145
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,140
Oh, sorry about that.

146
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,060
Quick, wipe it off.

147
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,060
With aim like that,

148
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
why aren't you on the National Football Team?

149
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,740
Bai Wu,

150
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,340
come see me tomorrow.

151
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,660
You guys really dodged a bullet this time.

152
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,220
Did you find any leads?

153
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,700
Yes.

154
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,060
On the Paradise Island,

155
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,880
we uncovered evidence linking Shadow Loan Co.

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,240
and the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.

157
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,220
From this, we deduce

158
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,500
that the Chamber

159
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,700
is likely a funding source for Shengong Hall.

160
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,260
Wanbao?

161
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,560
Based on the records,

162
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,260
Shengong Hall seems to be preparing

163
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,380
for GRA International Auction

164
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,380
which will be held in New York next month.

165
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,460
From what I know,

166
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,420
the auction list includes

167
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,660
many cultural relics lost from our country.

168
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,620
Right.

169
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,480
Shengong Hall aims

170
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:14,504
to acquire national treasures from the event,

171
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,980
but they'll need substantial funds.

172
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,900
Because of this,

173
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,180
they'll likely sell counterfeits extensively

174
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,500
at the Wanbao auctions.

175
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,500
How could you be so careless?

176
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,620
Wu,

177
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,540
you've been very unlucky lately.

178
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,580
Why not check your fortune, and see

179
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,700
if you offend the Grand Duke of Jupiter.

180
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,620
I already did it.

181
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,780
My bad luck will last for a while.

182
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,500
But the urgent task right now

183
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,420
is to seize this opportunity

184
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,020
and take down Shengong Hall in one move.

185
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,900
So, what's your plan?

186
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,620
(Yueyun Pavilion)

187
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,660
(Guyun Pavilion)

188
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,220
It's simple.

189
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,820
At the auction,

190
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,860
we'll catch them red-handed.

191
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,420
As long as we find counterfeits on the spot,

192
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,700
Wanbao

193
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,980
won't be able to escape blame.

194
