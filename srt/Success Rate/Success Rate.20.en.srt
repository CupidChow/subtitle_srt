2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,320
Go arrest my dad.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,120
Go arrest my dad!

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,760
What's going on?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,140
Why didn't I know about this?

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,920
Mr. Jin accidentally fell

7
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:19,096
from the stairs days ago.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,060
Before passing, he made one request,

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
that don't let his issue affect the Auction.

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,180
Mr. Jin respected his father's final wish.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,060
That's why the funeral was kept private.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,630
Mr. Jin...

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,360
Dad...

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,640
Why did you leave so soon?

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,320
Look at these people.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,800
They turned on us the moment you left.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,840
Dad...

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
Mr. Jin, we're counting on you.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,640
That's impossible.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,320
Bai Wu,

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,840
you're a disgrace.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,920
My dad gave his life for the Auction.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,720
But you come to disrupt it.

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,200
You even insult him!

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,360
Apologize to my dad!

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,880
Apologize!

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,320
Jin Youlong, let him go!

28
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,840
Apologize! Apologize!

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,480
Apologize!

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,160
Bai Wu has found out

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,800
Shadow Loan Co. funds the forgery group.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,240
What's your next move?

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,360
The deal with the Di Family

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,760
was sabotaged by him.

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,000
He also meddled

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,720
in the Nine-dragon Vat issue.

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,160
Why keep him around so long?

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
How will you report this to the organization?

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
It's...

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,080
It's all because of this useless son.

41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,120
I'll hand him over to the organization

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
for them to deal with.

43
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,000
This fool slipped up,

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,760
allowing Bai Wu to live until now.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,920
You were the one who gave up on me first.

47
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Hall Lord,

48
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,000
this is my answer to you.

49
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,200
Bai Wu,

50
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,080
I've been watching your every move closely.

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
How could you possibly fight me?

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,560
What?

53
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
(Could it be)

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,880
(because my luck is completely drained?)

55
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,600
(No,)

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,920
(it's not a luck issue.)

57
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
(There's a mole.)

58
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
Bai Wu,

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,600
I've been watching your every move closely.

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
How could you possibly fight me?

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,760
But right now, the priority is

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
to seize this opportunity

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
to take down Shengong Hall in one strike.

64
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,120
Tell me about your plan.

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
I really appreciate your help.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,280
My name is Che Xiaoxiao.

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,000
I am obsessed with money.

68
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm quite famous on antique street.

69
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,140
I choose wealth.

70
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,080
That makes sense, right?

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
Does this mean

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
it is foolproof now?

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,850
I still have a hidden trump card.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Why are you working with Shadow Loan Co.?

75
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
They borrowed billions from the Di Group.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
The interest rate was reasonable.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
There's a mole.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,120
System,

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,020
tell me

80
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,600
if there is a mole.

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,680
Who is the mole?

82
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,200
You've been offline for days.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
Can you resume work or not?

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,570
Do you think without you,

85
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm completely useless?

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,160
Honestly, I'm nothing but a failure.

87
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,600
System.

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,120
System.

89
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,440
Right here.

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,320
Bai Wu, we...

91
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,720
Wu!

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Wu, you...

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Don't do anything rash, Wu.

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
Fatty...

95
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,800
Don't overthink it.

96
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
Bai Wu, are you crazy?

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,760
Commit suicide just because of a setback?

98
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,000
Exactly.

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,500
You fatty,

100
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,440
I'm being crushed here!

101
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Stop this!

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,320
I... I didn't.

103
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,160
I...

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,880
I cut my hand while cutting fruit.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,320
We understand you're under pressure.

106
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,740
Originally, we planned to deal

107
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:34,376
with Shengong Hall at the Auction.

108
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,040
But they completely fooled us.

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,590
It was truly a tough loss.

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
Lost money and reputation.

111
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
But that's no reason to give up on life.

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
- Right?
- Exactly.

113
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
You all...

114
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,260
really know how to comfort someone.

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
You really haven't thought about a suicide?

116
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
Now I do.

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Wu,

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
have a good rest first.

119
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,740
Once you're back to full strength,

120
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,760
let's fight again.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Exactly, we're with you.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Bai Wu,

123
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,080
I've been watching your every move closely.

124
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,840
How could you possibly fight me?

125
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,120
Forget it.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm giving up.

127
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
What?

128
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
I won't investigate Shengong Hall anymore.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,880
Also,

130
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,800
the partnership with the Di Group

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
will end here.

132
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,720
Miss Di, find someone more capable.

133
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
I'm just an unlucky mortal now.

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,720
I won't trouble you anymore.

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,400
Bai Wu, don't be like this.

136
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,120
Wu,

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,000
luck changes and it'll turn around soon.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,520
Bai Wu, pull yourself together.

139
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,520
What's wrong with me?

140
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,560
I'll help you investigate Wanbao

141
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,760
help Mr. Che smash the Nine-dragon Vat,

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,400
rescue Fatty from Shadow Loan Co.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,470
and catch those fraudsters.

144
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,990
I was almost killed on Paradise Island.

145
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,040
What more can I do

146
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,120
to make it work?

147
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm exhausted.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,960
Can't I just give up?

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,520
Wu,

150
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,200
is there some misunderstanding?

151
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, Bai Wu.

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,000
You should leave now.

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
Mr. Che.

155
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
Have a seat.

156
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Bai Wu,

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,840
are you really giving up?

158
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,160
I don't know.

159
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
Just...

160
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm worried...

161
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,040
I understand.

162
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,640
You

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,880
are scared.

164
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,920
You dare not trust the person closest to you.

165
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,840
How do you know that?

166
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,240
Bai Wu,

167
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
your situation right now

168
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,800
is exactly like mine 14 years ago.

169
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,800
Could it be

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
that you went through this too?

171
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,680
Back then,

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,620
I had just started

173
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:46,956
researching Hetu Ancient Jade

174
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,200
and tracing clues about Shengong Hall.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,240
Someone warned me at the time

176
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
that the jade was cursed.

177
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,160
But I didn't take it seriously.

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Shortly after,

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,280
misfortunes flooded in one after another.

180
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
First, my daughter

181
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,160
fell down the stairs

182
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:05,816
and had a premature birth.

183
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,560
Her child didn't survive.

184
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,040
And she ended up in a vegetative state.

185
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,720
Xiao Ze was left

186
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
all alone.

187
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,440
My research work also

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,400
came to a complete halt.

189
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
When I was at my wit's end,

190
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
someone found traces

191
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,920
of the Hetu Ancient Jade team

192
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,336
