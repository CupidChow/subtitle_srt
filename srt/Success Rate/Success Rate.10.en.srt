00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,120
Mr. Che,

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,000
in this room,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,720
there're 26 authentic antiques in total.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
That's correct, right?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,120
That just shows you can count.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,240
Don't rush.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,160
Let me explain slowly.

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,320
This piece,

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,200
a red sandalwood table from Qianlong era,

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,680
is valued at 20 million on the market.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,920
You acquired it eight years ago.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,520
That's correct.

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,440
And this piece.

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,200
The inkstone of
Grand Secretary Zhang Juzheng.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,400
It is worth 5 million.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,160
You won it in an auction last October.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,440
How did you know that?

19
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,480
A few of us old-timers spent over two years

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,920
to trace the origins of this inkstone.

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,560
This imperial brush rack of Emperor Jiaqing.

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
You acquired it last April,

23
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,680
but unfortunately, these brushes

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,840
are from the Republic era.

25
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
The blue and white porcelain from Hutian Kiln

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,760
and the handwritten Dream of the Red Chamber

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,880
were both purchased by you

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,240
this February.

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,300
Lastly,

30
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,780
this Huanghuali round-back armchair
from the late Song Dynasty

31
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,400
was bought seven years ago.

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,280
However, its market value

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,840
is far below other similar chairs out there,

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,040
simply because it's a damaged piece.

35
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
The four legs

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,880
were newly replaced by you.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
How is that even possible?

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,360
Mr. Che, do you believe I calculated it now?

39
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
Why?

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,000
Tell me.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,880
Did Shengong Hall send you to approach me?

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,780
Shengong Hall?

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,200
- What Shengong Hall?
- Still denying it?

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
It hurts, it hurts!

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,920
I really have no idea what Shengong Hall is.

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,720
Father, you...

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,640
What are you doing?

48
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,360
He's Xiaoxiao's friend after all.

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
It's fine, it's fine.

50
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,840
I was just playing with him for fun.

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,960
Who knew young people these days

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,440
are so fragile?

53
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,320
Playing with me?

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
My arm feels like it's breaking.

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
Have you asked Duan?

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,480
Mr. Duan got the painting

57
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,200
from the Ghost Fair.

58
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,640
Ghost Fair?

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
Got it.

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,920
(Looks like they've seen the QR code before.)

61
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,660
(It must be related to the Shengong Hall)

62
00:02:20,684 --> 00:02:21,636
(Mr. Che mentioned.)

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
Connection rate: 100%.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,400
Mr. Che,

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,920
what is the Shengong Hall you talked about?

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,400
Shengong Hall is an antique forgery group

67
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,200
that specializes in forgery of antiques.

68
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,560
That QR code

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,520
is their signature mark.

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,040
So that's the story.

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,960
I just never expected

72
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
their craftsmanship

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
even fooled my father's expert eye.

74
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,040
Kid,

75
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
name your price.

76
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,760
I'll buy

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
this painting.

78
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
No need, Mr. Che, no need.

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,080
This painting was meant as my gift to you.

80
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
Transfer ten million to him.

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,600
- Yes.
- No.

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,760
Mr. Che, this...

83
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,960
No need to say more.

84
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Ten million.

85
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,440
I've already taken advantage of you.

86
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
(Wow!)

87
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,480
(Two million in one day!)

88
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,840
(Fatty Wang,)

89
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
(you're truly my lucky charm!)

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,040
Mr. Che,

91
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,920
now that the counterfeit is confirmed,

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,640
I won our bet earlier,

93
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
didn't I?

94
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,720
You won.

95
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,600
You promised to do me favors...

96
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,320
Kid, what's the rush?

97
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,640
I have one more favor to ask you.

98
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,800
Please go ahead.

99
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Follow me.

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Let's go.

101
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Mr. Che.

102
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,960
You just said you can calculate by deduction,

103
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,880
is that right?

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,360
Yes, I know a bit.

105
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,920
If so,

106
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,240
I have a rare treasure

107
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,400
to acquire.

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,500
Can you calculate for me?

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Sure, no problem.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
The treasure I want to acquire

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,460
is this Blue-and-white Nine-dragon Cloud Vat

112
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,860
from the Ming Dynasty.

113
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,080
It cost

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
1.3 billion.

115
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,600
1.3 billion?

116
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,400
That's correct.

117
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,530
Mr. Bai, please take a look.

118
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,000
This vat,

119
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
whether it's the glaze,

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
the patterns,

121
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,920
or the craftsmanship and quality,

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,480
it's practically flawless.

123
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,360
A true treasure without equal.

124
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,880
Yet for some reason,

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

126
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,000
Something doesn't feel right.

127
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,640
That's why I haven't sealed the deal.

128
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,960
Since you manage to appraise

129
00:05:18,984 --> 00:05:21,176
the painting is a replica,

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,920
you should also be able

131
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,116
to appraise the quality of this vat.

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
Are you saying

133
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,480
this 1.3 billion deal hinges on me?

134
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Exactly.

135
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,320
If you conclude the vat is genuine,

136
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,120
I'll purchase it right away.

137
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,560
Alright.

138
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,480
I'll do my best.

139
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,730
(Where is the System?)

140
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,500
(Doesn't it usually jump in with answers?)

141
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,120
(Why is it silent today?)

142
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
(The System only conducts an analysis)

143
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,040
(to your questions)

144
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
(and is not your personal errand boy.)

145
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,360
(Alright, alright.)

146
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,680
(You win.)

147
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
(So, is this nine-dragon vat)

148
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,400
(real or fake?)

149
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,880
(Fake: 100%)
Counterfeit rate: 100%.

150
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,320
(How do we prove it?)

151
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
(Where's the proof?)

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
(The base, the body?)

153
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,920
(Vat wall: 100%)
The proof inside the wall: 100%.

154
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
(It's inside the wall?)

155
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,640
(How do I get the proof out?)

156
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,240
(Do I have to break it?)

157
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Break the vat and get the proof: 100%.

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,160
Break the vat and destroy the proof:

159
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,840
4.24%.

160
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,360
(4.24%?)

161
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,840
(This is worth 1.3 billion.)

162
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,660
(Even though I know it's a counterfeit,)

163
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,880
(but if I hit that 4% chance of being wrong,)

164
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
(I'd be devastated.)

165
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,600
(Breaking it comes with risks.)

166
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,160
(If I don't break it,)

167
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,320
(Mr. Che won't fully trust me.)

168
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
(The origin of this jade)

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,600
(is my only clue about my parents.)

170
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,240
Kid,

171
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,640
what's the result?

172
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,300
Congratulations, Mr. Che.

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,280
You've determined

174
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,520
it is genuine?

175
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
No,

176
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm congratulating you

177
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,480
for saving 1.3 billion.

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,080
Based on my analysis,

179
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
this vat

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
is fake.

181
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,160
- Fake?
- A counterfeit.

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,480
You...

183
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,800
How can you be sure?

184
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,240
Do you have any proof?

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,640
The proof

186
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,600
is hidden within the wall.

187
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
Well...

188
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
The wall?

189
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Well,

190
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,120
do we have to break the vat to find it?

191
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Exactly.

192
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,440
Break it?

193
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,240
Are you kidding me?

194
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,040
This Nine-dragon Vat is worth billions!

195
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,560
You can't just break it without solid proof.

196
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,520
Father, he...

197
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
This vat hasn't been fully paid for yet.

198
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,280
Technically, it doesn't belong to me.

199
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,000
Breaking it is a serious matter.

200
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,840
We have to get the owner's approval first.

201
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
Then,

202
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
please contact the owner.

203
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm willing to confront him face-to-face.

204
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,560
Mr. Zhang.

205
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,880
Mr. Che,

206
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
are you confirmed

207
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,200
and ready to finalize the deal?

208
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,240
As long as this vat is authentic,

209
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,160
today,

210
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll buy it without hesitation.

211
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Isn't that right, Bai Wu?

212
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,320
Yes.

213
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,760
Mr. Che,

214
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,760
this man is...?

215
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,320
Mr. Zhang, nice to meet you.

216
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm Bai Wu,

217
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,440
here to help Mr. Che authenticate the vat.

218
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,080
Authenticate the vat?

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Kid,

220
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,200
do you know how much this vat is worth?

221
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,800
It's valued at 1.3 billion.

222
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,880
Your ancestors combined

223
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
aren't worth as much as this vat.

224
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
You're teaching fish to swim.

225
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,440
You know about vats, huh?

226
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
I think

227
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,320
you better

228
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
go home

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,280
and be a mama's boy.

230
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
How much

231
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
can a counterfeit be worth?

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Mr. Che,

233
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,580
you know this better than anyone.

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
This vat

235
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
has been professionally evaluated

236
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,200
by several experts in the field.

237
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,880
I don't blame you for not buying.

238
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,360
But if

239
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,280
some clueless young guy

240
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,760
starts spreading baseless rumors,

241
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,800
Dianjin Hall won't stand for it.

242
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,400
Whether it's real or fake,

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,060
we have to break it to know.

244
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,300
(Though there's some risk involved,)

245
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,600
(I can't lose my momentum.)

246
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,000
I'd like to see

247
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,180
how it feels to break a vat

248
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,840
worth 1.3 billion.

249
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,520
Mr. Bai,

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,280
don't act impulsively.

251
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,440
Kid,

252
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,600
who do you think you are?

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,560
Why would you smash my vat worth 1.3 billion?

254
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,640
Mr. Che,

255
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,480
are you just letting him act recklessly?

256
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm not selling this vat anymore.

257
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,700
(This guy's feeling guilty now.)

258
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,200
Because it's a fake.

259
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
You must not know

260
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,640
who I am in the circle.

261
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,280
How dare you act up in front of me?

262
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,080
I don't care who you are.

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,840
