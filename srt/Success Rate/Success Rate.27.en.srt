2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,280
Bai Wu,

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,960
what a coincidence.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
I was waiting for this shabby stone

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
to be fully charged and regain power,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,560
then I'd deal with you.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,160
But I didn't expect

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,800
you'd come knocking on my door.

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,440
Why do you have the Hetu Ancient Jade?

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,280
Take a guess.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,120
I've been waiting to deal with you.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,760
Do you know how many plans you've ruined?

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,960
You think you can?

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
What?

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,520
System,

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,720
activate.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Activate.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,680
You little punk,

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,800
how dare you mess with me!

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,120
Today,

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
I'll crush your bones

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,000
piece by piece.

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Wait a second.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Spare me.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
I'll tell you a secret.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,480
What kind of secret?

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,560
Recently, Sanxingdui

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
unearthed some artifacts.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,360
One of those artifacts

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,640
is linked to a British Museum piece.

31
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,840
Combine the two,

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,600
and add Khufu Pyramid texts,

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
you'll uncover a treasure.

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,720
What treasure?

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,640
That treasure is...

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,240
ONE PIECE.

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,760
How dare you mess with me again?

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Why do you have

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,000
a replica?

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,440
That's my ancient jade,

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,880
Hetu Ancient Jade.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,320
This is the real Hetu Ancient Jade.

43
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,920
It's not a replica.

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
What else would it be?

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
Consider yourself lucky.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,080
It's out of energy now.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,200
Otherwise, I'd beat you badly.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Out of energy, huh?

49
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,920
I'll just recharge it.

50
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,280
Tell me

51
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,400
how to activate it.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Speak.

53
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
Same way.

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
Recharge and activate.

55
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,400
Brat,

56
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,600
you didn't lie to me, huh?

57
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
Look at me now.

58
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,690
How could I lie to you?

59
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,320
You wouldn't dare.

60
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,320
Never thought

61
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,720
there's an unexpected gain.

62
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
I've heard before,

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,900
the power of Hetu Ancient Jade

64
00:03:04,924 --> 00:03:06,016
is extraordinary.

65
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
With it in hand,

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,680
it's like becoming divine.

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,080
You're not tricking me, right?

68
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,200
Go ahead.

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,360
Maybe I am tricking you.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,640
Come on.

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,160
Do you believe it will blow you up?

72
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,840
You're trying to scare me.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,840
As expected,

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,480
it really charges energy.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,400
With this Hetu Ancient Jade,

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
I can finally

77
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,640
stand equal to the Hall Lord.

78
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,480
No!

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,360
I will replace him

80
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,440
to become the new Hall Lord

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,720
of Shengong Hall.

82
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,920
I want to become

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,440
the ruler of this world.

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,080
Wu,

85
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,200
look.

86
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
This is the jade charging device.

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,240
It's a pity

88
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,640
that it only works on the replica.

89
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,360
If it was the Hetu Ancient Jade,

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,320
it might explode.

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,320
Dad,

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
thanks a lot.

93
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,920
Come on.

94
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,160
Come on.

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,400
Bai Wu,

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
you've worked hard lately.

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
Thankfully,

98
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,356
Shengong Hall was severely weakened.

99
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,040
Mr. Sun, you're too kind.

100
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,280
I've decided

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
to pause the investigation

102
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,480
into Shengong Hall.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,600
You should get some proper rest.

104
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,280
When I return from the overseas auction,

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
we'll discuss the next steps for work.

106
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Mr. Sun,

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
about the overseas auction,

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
do I need to go with you?

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
No, you don't.

110
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,320
The antique circle has been chaotic lately,

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,640
and people are feeling unsettled.

112
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,700
Antique enthusiasts willing
to invest in retrieving

113
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,740
national treasures has sharply decreased.

114
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,560
There's simply no money for it.

115
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,200
Mr. Sun,

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
I have a solution

117
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,180
for the funding group issue.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,120
Leave it to me.

119
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,360
You're quite impressive, aren't you?

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,280
Not too bad.

121
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,640
When I'm out and about,

122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,280
I still rely on my buddies.

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,440
Who wants to be your buddy anyway?

124
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Are you thinking of being my...

125
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,700
There's only one room left now?

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm really sorry.

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,600
But you were led only for the president Sun.

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
That's fine.

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
I can pay for an extra room.

130
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,800
There is no any available room

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,040
in the hotel at the moment.

132
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,240
It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Let's share the room.

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,880
What's wrong?

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,760
Not willing to share?

136
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm willing.

137
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
I'm fine with it.

138
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
The place looks really nice.

139
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,480
The bed looks super comfy.

140
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,280
What are you thinking?

141
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,220
You sleep on the sofa.

142
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Alright.

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,960
It's really hot here.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I need a shower first.

145
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Well,

146
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
right now?

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,360
It's not appropriate.

148
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,200
What are you thinking?

149
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
Don't get any weird ideas.

150
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,560
