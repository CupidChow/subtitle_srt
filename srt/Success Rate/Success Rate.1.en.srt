00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,220
People choose to escape

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,700
because they fear failure.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,330
But if

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,490
you're able to see the success rate,

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,350
can you seize the chance

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,020
and turn your life around?

00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,020
(Wanbao Chamber of Commerce)

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,440
(Intern Evaluation Form)
Only one of you can become

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,480
a regular worker this time.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,680
It's Wu, right?

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,760
Wu is the most talented.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,840
Mr. Wang,

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,110
as a newcomer,

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,390
I should work harder.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright, Wang,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
stop teasing these two fools.

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,320
Just announce the results.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,080
The one who becomes a regular worker

21
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,800
is naturally Mr. Jin,

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,120
the young master of the Chamber.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Young master?

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Originally,

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,820
I worked at the auction house

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,660
to go through the motions.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,640
But you caused me to be scolded a lot.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Do you know why I've tolerated you until now?

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,560
I just want to make you understand

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,120
that all your efforts,

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,360
in front of me,

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,880
are completely worthless.

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,290
Bai Wu,

34
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,030
took out a training collateral loan

35
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,500
(Loan Agreement)
that if he's dismissed,

36
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,660
he must repay the full loan immediately.

37
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,450
You're fired.

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,180
Jin Youlong!

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,460
- Wu!
- Security! Security!

40
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Wu! Wu!

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,580
Calm down.

42
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,980
You're rubbish!

43
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,320
Come on, face me one-on-one!

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,040
One-on-one, huh?

45
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,780
You think I'm stupid?

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,500
A,

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,420
slap him.

48
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
Mr. Jin, I...

49
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,620
Slap him!

50
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,980
Want to get fired, huh?

51
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,700
Wu, my mom is sick.

52
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,060
I still need money for her treatment.

53
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,940
A...

54
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,500
Wu...

55
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,060
Wu, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,500
Yeah, hit harder, harder, harder!

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,340
If I give him a little favor,

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,360
he'll be like that mad dog

59
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,900
when he sees meat.

60
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,060
You should learn from A

61
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,980
how to please someone like me

62
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,380
and to grab scraps from my table.

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,580
If you don't kill me,

64
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,260
you'll regret it sooner or later.

65
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,020
Looking for death?

66
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,940
Bai Wu.

67
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,330
Linlin!

68
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,260
Why are you here?

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,600
Jin Youlong,

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,100
don't you dare touch her!

71
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,570
Bai Wu,

72
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,900
let's break up.

73
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,860
I don't want to struggle with you anymore.

74
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,100
I don't want to take out loans

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,580
and spend my life as a mortgage slave.

76
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,660
Did you see my new bag?

77
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,020
28,000 yuan.

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,540
Mr. Jin can give me

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,020
the things I desire.

80
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,780
But you can never provide them.

81
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,230
We've been together for seven years.

82
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,620
Linlin, you look amazing.

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,540
Bai Wu, I wonder

84
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,860
why Linlin is still a virgin

85
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,830
after being with you for seven years.

86
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,780
Stop talking.

87
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,250
Jin Youlong!

88
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,380
(The next day)

89
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,800
You've been terminated from your internship.

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,680
Please repay your 100,000 yuan loan

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
within ten days.

92
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,810
Congrats on our customer
winning the first prize.

93
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,420
The prize is 5.98 million yuan.

94
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,890
(Since life's hit rock bottom already,)

95
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,120
(why not buy a lottery ticket)

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,780
(and take a chance?)

97
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,170
Sir, give me a five-yuan scratch card.

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,380
The prize is 5.98 million yuan.

99
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,650
Which one do you want?

100
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,570
It doesn't matter.

101
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,020
(Good Luck Scratch Card)

102
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,220
(Wait, what's happening?)

103
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,340
(Could this be a concussion?)

104
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,420
Take it, young man.

105
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,990
(Am I the only one who can see this?)

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,380
(Give it a try.)

107
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,700
(10 yuan)

108
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,100
I really won!

109
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,460
(Could the numbers show winning probability?)

110
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,560
(Let me try again.)

111
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,700
Sir,

112
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
I'll take two more cards.

113
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,780
Sure, take them.

114
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,780
(100 yuan)
I won!

115
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,740
(50 yuan)

116
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,230
I won all the cards!

117
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,930
(I'm going to strike it rich!)

118
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,500
You've got quite the lucky hand, young man.

119
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,820
(100% means a win.)

120
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,490
(Let me try this one with 0%.)

121
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,030
(As expected,)

122
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,150
(I can really see the success rate.)

123
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,330
(Is it because of this piece of jade?)

124
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,500
(Inside it lies the system?)

125
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,060
Young man,

126
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,340
small bets add fun,

127
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,820
while big bets hurt the body.

128
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,420
You should know when to stop.

129
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,300
Sir,

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,820
give me five tickets worth 20 each

131
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,840
and five tickets worth 10 each.

132
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,740
I won.

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,660
No way!

134
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,020
I won.

135
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,140
Well...

136
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,980
I won!

137
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,620
50.

138
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,260
I still won!

139
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,300
- This guy...
- 100!

140
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,420
You've received

141
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,420
3,860 yuan.

142
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,760
(First of all,)

143
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,420
(the numbers show winning probability.)

144
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,250
(But the prize amount is unknown.)

145
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,540
(It'd be great to know the prize amount,)

146
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,360
(like probabilities winning 100 yuan)

147
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,470
(or other amounts.)

148
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,570
Whoa!

149
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
What's going on?

150
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,100
(10 yuan)

151
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,420
(20 yuan)

152
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
(50 yuan)

153
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,940
Six consecutive wins.

154
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,250
No way! How could it be possible?

155
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,460
(Oh, I see.)

156
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,060
(The success rate depends on the answers.)

157
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
(I can't help but strike it rich now!)

158
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,020
Sir,

159
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
I told you my luck was great today!

160
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,020
No normal person has such good luck.

161
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
Sir, be careful of this guy

162
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,620
using sleight of hand.

163
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,940
(This guy really is suspicious.)

164
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,900
(If I really give him money,)

165
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,360
(what if the headquarters won't cash it?)

166
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,180
Sir,

167
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,540
my luck is so good.

168
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,820
Give me 20 more cards.

169
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,740
Young man,

170
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
luck is luck, true enough.

171
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,980
But don't get addicted to it.

172
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,940
It's nothing, really.

173
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,580
My luck is incredible.

174
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,660
What if I win all of them?

175
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,420
(Thanks).

176
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,580
I don't believe it.

177
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,380
Luck, you know,

178
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
is fickle and unreliable.

179
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,580
Maybe you just used up

180
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,650
all your luck for the year.

181
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,980
(Thanks)
Young man,

182
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,850
remember, don't be greedy.

183
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,260
Exactly.

184
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,900
(I'm just joking with you).

185
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,540
(I don't pretend anymore).

186
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,300
(I admit it, I'm cheating).

187
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,870
Hocus, Pocus!

188
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,980
Please let me win 10,000.

189
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,850
Do you know

190
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,090
