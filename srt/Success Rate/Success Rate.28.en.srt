00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello? Mr. Bai Wu.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,560
This is Jack from the GRA Service Center.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,120
I'm calling to inform you,

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,400
due to certain reasons,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,200
the auction item inspection schedule

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,280
has been adjusted.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,480
When's the new time?

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,800
10 PM tonight.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,880
Warehouse No. 5,

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,760
24th Block.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,320
Please inspect the auction items.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,520
I'll wait outside.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,480
You're not staying on-site?

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,720
Once you finish,

16
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,120
just let me know.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,680
That's strange.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,600
No third party during inspection is fine,

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,000
but even the host isn't present.

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,280
Don't overthink it.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,220
Our target is the national treasures.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,390
Let's check the goods first.

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,320
(System, have you woken up?)

24
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,520
(Time for work!)

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,240
These treasures have wandering

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,840
for nearly a century overseas.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,640
They're finally going home.

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,840
They're all fakes.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
What?

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
What's going on?

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,840
We've been framed.

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,520
Framed us

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,600
for stealing antiques?

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,640
Who would do that?

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,160
Who else?

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Shengong Hall.

37
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,680
They set a trap here.

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
And we

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,560
fell into their trap.

40
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,480
Mr. Bai Wu, Miss Di,

41
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,440
I need a reasonable explanation.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,520
What's there to explain?

43
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,920
They're clearly here to steal.

44
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Mr. Mash,

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,500
please check this out.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,080
What's going on?

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
I... I don't know.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Someone offered me ten grand.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Luckily, I was prepared.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,160
Or we'd be in big trouble.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Take him down.

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,760
I understand them all.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,800
This is misunderstanding.

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,430
You and Miss Di are victims.

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,320
What does he say?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
He said it's all a misunderstanding.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,640
About these Chinese antiques,

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
please provide a reasonable explanation.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,000
What to explain?

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,960
Why?

61
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,120
Why are the antiques prepared for auction

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,320
are all fakes from Shengong Hall?

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,760
What?

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,000
How can it be?

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,640
GRA's national treasures are fakes?

66
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,720
Look. I found this QR code

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
inside one of the fakes.

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,200
Something feels off.

69
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,280
Bai Wu,

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,920
enlarge it for me to see.

71
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
Wait a second.

72
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,240
This isn't Shengong Hall's QR code.

73
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
What?

74
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,400
It's really different.

75
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
Shengong?

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Guifu?

77
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,400
Guifu?

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,080
Is it the one which was honored

79
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
as a master in antique replication

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,080
alongside Shengong 200 years ago?

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
Didn't expect

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
I'd still see this symbol today.

83
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,040
I've never thought

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,480
Guifu went into exile abroad

85
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,520
and even made fakes now.

86
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,760
No wonder.

87
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,080
Our previous investigation

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,320
kept hitting a dead end.

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,580
It seems the direction is wrong.

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,040
I'll notify the GRA immediately.

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,200
We'll start fresh

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,440
from the Guifu lead.

93
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,280
We must recover the national treasures soon.

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,160
Thanks for that.

95
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Stay safe out there.

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,990
(Antique Fakes Investigation; Guifu)

97
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,680
You also found Guifu?

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
You know Guifu?

99
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,740
To tell the truth,

100
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,970
these years, there had been mysterious guys

101
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,480
have competing with me.

102
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,120
So I have started investigation privately.

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
Finally, I found

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
these people are from the same force,

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Guifu.

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,480
Do you mean

107
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,800
Guifu have always been your rival?

108
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,660
Yes.

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,240
Later, as I found as long as

110
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
the Chinese antiques are presenting

111
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,084
in the market,

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,280
the people will arrange to sell.

113
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,400
So,

114
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,600
as to take out some treasures as a bait,

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,640
the Guifu will get hooked.

116
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,840
As you said,

117
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,050
I publicly announced an auction

118
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,000
as bait.

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
Over 20 VIP slots

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,600
have already been applied.

121
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
What do you think?

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,680
They get hooked.

123
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
Hello? Mr. Wood,

124
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,480
this is...

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,560
Mr. Bai Wu.

126
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,480
Apologies.

127
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,980
I didn't realize you were a woman.

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,500
The teacher asked me to relay

129
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,960
he has no interest in your antiques.

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
If you'd like to meet the teacher,

131
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
come to the location I shared.

132
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,920
The teacher you're referring to is...?

133
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,160
You're Mr. Wood, right?

134
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,080
You must be Mr. Bai Wu.

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,160
Wood is just the teacher's nickname.

136
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,040
My name is Mary.

137
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Nice to meet you.

138
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,680
The teacher is waiting inside.

139
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,520
Please.

140
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,120
Sorry.

141
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Only Mr. Bai can go in.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,840
How can that be?

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,180
What if there's danger inside?

144
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Exactly.

145
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,400
We, the Half-Life Squad,

146
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
always stick together.

147
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,480
Step aside.

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
- Fatty!
- I said it.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,680
Only Mr. Bai can go in.

150
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Tai Chi?

151
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,390
This is...

152
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,720
That's right.

153
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,800
The two Hetu Ancient Jade pieces

154
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
were originally one.

155
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
But Guifu...

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,160
That's me.

157
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,080
I've come as agreed.

158
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,530
Yet you refuse to show yourself,

159
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,840
and use these tricks instead.

160
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
What does this mean?

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,960
This isn't my trick.

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,600
This is a heart-questioning trial

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,640
the Hetu Ancient Jade prepared for you.

164
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
System,

165
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,560
you're awake.

166
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,760
Congratulations, host.

167
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,320
You've obtained the Hetu Ancient Jade.

168
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,560
The Hetu Ancient Jade can

169
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
grant the host a wish

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,360
that's impossible in the real world.

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,840
Please state your wish.

172
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,480
A wish, huh?

173
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,880
Give me a billion dollars.

174
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
This wish can be achieved in reality.

175
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,190
Please think twice.

176
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,450
I want my parents

177
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
to come back to life.

178
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,000
Wu...

179
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,160
Wu...

180
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,720
We miss you very much.

181
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,080
Dad, Mom.

182
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,560
To revive the host's parents,

183
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,000
the life of Di Qingqing or Fatty Wang

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,480
must be offered.

185
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
What?!

186
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
Host, please make your choice.

187
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,400
Di Qingqing or Fatty Wang.

188
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,880
Enough! Guifu,

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,000
stop playing these ridiculous games.

190
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,600
Didn't I already tell you?

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,160
This is

192
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,280
a heart-questioning trial of the jade.

193
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,400
It has nothing to do with me.

194
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
What the hell is this?

195
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
Question what?

196
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,240
Heart-questioning trial...

197
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,280
Of course, it questions your true desires.

198
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,760
The Hetu Ancient Jade

199
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,640
truly can make your wish

200
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,160
come true.

201
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
What?!

202
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Same rules apply.

203
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,800
The friend you sacrificed

204
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,040
will truly die.

205
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,240
Let me warn you,

206
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,320
if anything happens to Wu,

207
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
I won't let you off.

208
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
You're his friends?

209
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
Yes, we're sworn friends.

210
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Yes, sworn friends.

211
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,560
Good.

212
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,400
One of you

213
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,630
must die for him

214
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
today.

215
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,120
What do you mean?

216
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Exactly as it sounds.

217
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,680
Don't act rashly.

218
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
Take it out on me.

219
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,680
Fatty, don't do this.

220
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,640
No, Miss Di,

221
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,760
you saved me first

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,080
and Wu saved me later.

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
Come at me instead.

224
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
Don't mess around.

225
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,600
Stop arguing.

226
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,920
Who will die today depends

227
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,600
on who Bai Wu chooses to sacrifice

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
in the heart-questioning trail.

229
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Reminder to the host:

230
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,800
you only have one chance.

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
Wu...

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,160
Wu...

233
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,800
We miss you very much.

234
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Dad, Mom...

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Think it over.

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
If you want to bring them back,

237
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,760
this really is your only chance.

238
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Why?

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,330
Why are you forcing me?

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,400
Fate has always been about

241
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,840
forcing people to make choices.

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,000
I choose to sacrifice myself

243
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,900
to bring my parents back to life

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
and ensure Fatty and Qingqing's safety.

245
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,430
Reminder to the host:

246
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,040
this is not an option provided by the System.

247
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,620
Isn't this the heart-questioning trial?

248
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,320
In my heart,

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
this is the only choice.

250
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,600
As you wish.
