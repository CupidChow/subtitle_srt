1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,400
Wu, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Dad and Mom have no choice but to leave.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,160
We love you deeply, Wu.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,320
Keep this Hetu Ancient Jade.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,600
It will surely protect you.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,540
Wu,

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,020
don't forget us.

8
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,260
=Success Rate=
=Episode 13=

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,350
What happened to this car?

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,760
It's completely crushed.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,160
The front is completely wrecked.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,360
No way someone survived this.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,800
This person's still alive!

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,680
He's still breathing!

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,480
He made it through.

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,460
Such luck!

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,240
The crash was so severe.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
But he's still alive.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,080
The car's completely totaled.

20
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,360
Yet this person's still alive.

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
He actually didn't die.

22
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,560
Emergency Protection Function activated.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,680
I'm still alive.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,000
Host survival rate: 100%.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,040
External injury: 2%.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
Internal injury: 0%.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
Aftereffects: 0%.

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
(You have a protection function.)

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,760
It only activates in emergencies.

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,160
(So, it's a passive ability.)

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,800
Keep this Hetu Ancient Jade.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,280
It will surely protect you.

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,800
(Hetu Ancient Jade.)

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
(The brakes suddenly failed.)

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,880
(This can't just be an accident.)

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,080
Man-made accident: 100%.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,560
(Man-made?)

38
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,800
(Is it linked to Shadow Loan Co.)

39
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,360
(or tied to the Nine-dragon Vat?)

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,560
Nine-dragon Vat connection: 100%.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,160
(Looks like I've cut off their profits.)

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,800
(Now they've got their eyes on me.)

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
(I can't escape this, no matter what I do.)

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
Mr. Che, it's Bai Wu.

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,080
I've thought over about the matter
you asked me

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
to investigate the source of the fakes.

47
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
That guy's got unbelievable luck.

48
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
The car front has been destroyed.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Yet he still survived.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,040
Find a way.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,400
I want him gone. Understand?

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
Let him die.

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,580
(Three days later, in the dead of night)

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,880
Sir,

55
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,040
this is ancestral. Authenticity guaranteed.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Take a look at this one.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
It's from the Western Zhou.

58
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,680
Sir,

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,760
take a look at this.

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,440
- This is truly good.
- Wu,

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,680
did Mr. Che really agree that once it's done,

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,560
he'll help us join the Antique Association?

63
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,360
Why would I lie to you?

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,160
That's amazing!

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,740
As long as we join the association,

66
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,280
I'll be on my way to the top.

67
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
It's just joining an association.

68
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,840
Is it that big of a deal?

69
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Of course it is.

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,880
Joining gets you credibility and backing.

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,520
Then I can open my own antique shop.

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
Alright.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,460
I've even thought of a name for your shop.

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,880
Call it Yueban Hall.

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,520
Great name!

76
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Wu, I'll give you and Miss Di

77
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
each a ten percent share.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,920
What do you think?

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,080
Alright, we'll talk about it later.

80
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Let's find Bao Dating first.

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,520
Bao Dating, right?

82
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
I know him too well.

83
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
I contacted him this afternoon.

84
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,280
Let me give him a call first.

85
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,370
Didn't you see us?

86
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,400
Didn't you watch the road?

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Fatty, look.

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,400
What's this?

89
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
It's a Luban Box.

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,560
What does it mean?

91
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Try opening it.

92
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,280
Maybe it's a clue from Bao Dating.

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm familiar with this.

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,080
Let me handle it.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,800
(Want the clue? First, open this box.)

96
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,360
Didn't I just open it?

97
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,440
What does that mean?

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,680
This.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,880
The exterior of this Luban Box features

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,360
a Chinese mortise and tenon structure.

101
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
The mechanism inside

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,640
uses Japanese fine woodworking techniques.

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,480
Two elements are combined into one.

104
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,760
That's why it's so chaotic.

105
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,320
And it hides a second-dimension space.

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,840
A second-dimension space?

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
Wu,

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
you've really opened my eyes.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,760
Let me take a look.

110
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,800
How is there a QR code here?

111
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,000
There's a line of text.

112
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,760
The west forest, west of Ghost Market.

113
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Let's go.

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
Move!

115
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,160
Wu,

116
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,840
this is the west forest.

117
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Where's Bao Dating?

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,560
You opened the Luban Box so fast!

119
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,320
Impressive!

120
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Wu, this person isn't Bao Dating.

121
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,240
Where's Bao Dating?

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,400
Relax.

123
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,240
You came here to investigate the source

124
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,120
of Jiang City's fakes, didn't you?

125
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,440
It's the same if you look for me.

126
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,560
But first, I need to test you.

127
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,280
A test? Really?

128
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
Go ahead.

129
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I just bought these from the Ghost Market.

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,360
Can you tell their origin and value?

131
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,880
No problem.

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,640
Wu, are you too nervous?

133
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,040
Is your mind cramping?

134
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,760
Relax, it's a small matter.

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Let me handle it.

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,640
I'll take care of this.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
This ancient candlestick is stunning.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,680
In any museum, this would be

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,240
a true centerpiece on display.

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,440
Bai Wu,

141
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
what do you think?

142
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,040
It's a counterfeit.

143
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Judging by the technique,

144
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:52,856
it's from a decade ago.

145
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,320
The craftsmanship is impressive.

146
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,920
But the rust colors reveal its age and flaws.

147
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,200
A counterfeit? That can't be true.

148
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
There's no mistake.

149
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
It's worth 5,000 at most.

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
(Such low EQ.)

151
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
(Why be so blunt?)

152
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,160
(What if he gets upset and hides the source?)

153
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,120
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

154
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,080
Who hasn't been fooled at the Ghost Market?

155
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,940
Let's take a look at this one.

156
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,600
Mi Fu's cursive script.

157
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,520
Another counterfeit.

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,260
The paper is from Northern Song Period.

159
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,920
But the calligraphy was written this year.

160
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,240
Its cost is around 300,000.

161
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,160
What a pity.

162
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,320
It wasted good paper.

163
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,160
But it is worthless.

164
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Wu,

165
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,200
both of these are counterfeits?

166
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,600
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,160
That Enamels Yuhuchun Vase is also a fake.

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
Wu,

169
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,160
I see no flaws in that piece.

170
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Having no flaws is the biggest flaw.

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,040
Mr. Bai,

172
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,160
please explain further.

173
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,280
Look at the inscription above.

174
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,950
Green branches cradle the blossoms;

175
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,040
red buds emerge from twigs.

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,680
Emperor Qianlong personally designed it.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,550
It was selected from a dozen

178
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,320
of flawless creations produced in Jingdezhen.

179
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,760
The rest were all destroyed.

180
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,220
It's a one-of-a-kind piece.

181
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,160
If so, it must be even more valuable.

182
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
What's the problem?

183
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,160
The state has taken the authentic piece,

184
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,700
and it's now on a nationwide tour.

185
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,160
So, what do you think?

186
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Wu, you mean all three of these...

187
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
They are all counterfeits.

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,490
And I can say with certainty,

189
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
a Shengong Hall QR code is hidden inside.

190
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,760
Do you know what the QR code is for?

191
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,680
No idea.

192
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
I scanned it with my phone earlier,

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,080
but found nothing useful.

194
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,400
Try the method you used
to open the Luban Box.

195
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,060
(Shengong)

196
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,960
Shengong?

197
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,160
How would you know that?

198
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
It's simple.

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,240
Because I am the Hall Lord of Shengong Hall.

200
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,240
Wu, watch out!

201
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Fatty Wang!

202
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Don't move.

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
System, can we escape?

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,200
Escape success rate: 26%.

205
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,480
(That's so low.)

206
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,600
I originally didn't plan to leave you alive.

207
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,200
But I truly admire talent.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,240
So I'm offering you a chance.

209
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,000
What do you mean?

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,600
Join my Shengong Hall.

211
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,240
Help me dominate the antique business.

212
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,920
Relax.

213
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,880
Shengong Hall will treat you well.

214
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,960
The antique trade is highly profitable.

215
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
Selling counterfeits is even more lucrative

216
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
than selling genuine antiques.

217
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,400
Either we make money together,

218
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
or you die.

219
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,080
Fatty,

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,280
what's your decision?

221
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,840
I live for wealth.

222
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,760
I'm well-known in the antique street for it.

223
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
At such a critical moment,

224
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,080
I chose to chase wealth,

225
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,160
which seems reasonable, right?

226
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,440
But as the old saying goes,

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,920
true nature reveals itself in despair.

228
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,190
Even I didn't expect

229
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
that I would go against money.

230
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
That means choosing death?

231
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,320
I give up on life.

232
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,640
Living this way feels too humiliating.

233
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,560
Well said!

234
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,840
Wu.

235
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,000
Bai Wu,

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,680
you're new to the antique industry.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,880
Is it worth risking your life

238
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,390
for this?

239
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,080
It's not because of this industry.

240
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
A gentleman knows what to do

241
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,760
and what not to do.

242
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
Tell me

243
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,040
what makes a gentleman?

244
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,960
It's quite simple.

245
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,760
Beneath the outer shell,

246
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
there're passion, integrity, and conscience.

247
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,120
You're absolutely right.

248
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,800
Life's about living happily.

249
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,200
But when passion fades,

250
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
integrity scatters,

251
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,840
I can no longer stand up straight,

252
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
and I can no longer be happy.

253
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,920
Well said.

254
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,880
Then I'll help you achieve that.
