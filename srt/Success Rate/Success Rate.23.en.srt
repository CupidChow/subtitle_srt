00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,280
Glassy type imperial green?

=Success Rate=
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,460
This one's more stunning.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,010
Glassy type mauve jadeite!

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,510
These two premium jades

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,400
worth at least a billion.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,740
Absolutely top-grade quality.

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,040
What do you think?

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,450
My strategy's solid, right?

10
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,990
Are you sure your strategy is flawless?

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,570
Congrats to Wu's Alliance No. 1, 2,

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,710
- Since the alliance is formed,
- 3, and 4.

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,000
Why does the Mu Family

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,420
still separately bid

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,080
(Jade stone No 5; Jade stone No. 6)
on No.5 and 6?

16
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,230
With my current streak of bad luck,

17
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,480
even the Jade King avoids me,

18
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,100
whenever I make an offer.

19
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,160
So, the two you bid for alone

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,980
are definitely Jade King pieces.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,070
Mr. Tian,

22
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,010
Mr. Wei,

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,150
thanks for that.

24
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,420
Jade King?!

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,660
Two Jade Kings?!

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,700
Everyone,

27
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,860
my apologies.

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,060
I...

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Wu,

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,460
no need to say sorry.

31
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,780
Without you,

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,070
I'd be empty-handed today.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
These eight jade stones are excellent,

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,060
especially No. 8.

35
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,990
It would've been the Jade King in the past.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,100
With these two Jade Kings,

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,700
in the next five years,

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,020
the Mu Family will secure

39
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,060
the top jade business in Jiang City.

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,100
Bai Wu, you truly

41
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,420
are impressive.

42
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,940
Miss Mu,

43
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,940
you're too kind.

44
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,660
(In this case,)

45
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,100
(the Mu Family might receive)

46
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,690
(an invitation from Minglou.)

47
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,900
97%.

48
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,660
(System,)

49
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,660
(you're awake.)

50
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,660
System?

51
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,640
(Was that just an illusion?)

52
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,020
Mr. Tian,

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,780
do you have anything to say?

54
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,740
Don't worry,

55
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,020
I'll step out.

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,580
Seems you have some integrity after all.

57
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,620
Given the circumstances,

58
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,860
I have no choice

59
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,220
but to step out.

60
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,420
I'm not sure

61
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,580
what you think

62
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,820
of jade stone business,

63
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,860
but in my opinion,

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,780
all businesses in the world

65
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,060
can achieve win-win cooperation.

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,740
A cake

67
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,180
can always grow bigger.

68
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,140
Well said!

69
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,710
♪The river washes away towering waves♪

70
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,780
Exactly, well said.

71
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,000
♪The youth is strong, and China is strong♪

72
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,690
You know,

73
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,180
Bai Wu

74
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,820
was absolutely incredible this time.

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,560
When we unveiled the two Jade Kings,

76
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,500
everyone was completely stunned.

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,100
Look at you.

78
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,340
You used to dislike him,

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,020
but now he's unveiled the two Jade Kings,

80
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,440
you've turned into his little fan.

81
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,420
Oh, by the way, yesterday,

82
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,100
(Minglou)
I received the invitation from Minglou.

83
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,620
Great!

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,820
During this time, does everyone know

85
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,280
I've been in the Intensive Care Unit?

86
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Alright.

87
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,700
I bet once I'm discharged,

88
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,540
the mole will be watching me again.

89
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,020
We need to use this period

90
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,940
to force them out into the open.

91
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,220
Are you saying...

92
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,660
(I'll be discharged in three days)

93
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:32,084
(and plan to attend the Minglou Auction.)

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,130
(Bai Wu: Be discharged in three days
Plan to attend the Minglou Auction.)

95
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,100
How far have you progressed

96
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
with Bai Wu?

97
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,050
What nonsense are you saying?

98
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,790
If you're not interested,

99
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,020
then I might make a move myself.

100
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,820
I see.

101
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,560
No wonder they say to guard against friends

102
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:56,496
stealing your crush.

103
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,380
- I was wrong.
- Realize it?

104
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,220
Just kidding.

105
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,540
How dare you!

106
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,500
Yi'er has just received

107
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,740
a notification from Minglou.

108
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,100
The auction

109
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
starts tomorrow night.

110
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,940
As expected,

111
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
they couldn't wait.

112
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,330
We'll meet at the hospital tomorrow night,

113
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,420
and head out together.

114
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,300
By the way, Qingqing,

115
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,460
I need a favor from you.

116
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,820
Don't move.

117
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,260
So this is Minglou.

118
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,660
Your teapot is truly impressive.

119
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,540
I just spent 800,000 on it.

120
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,300
This enamel painted vase is only 1.2 million.

121
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,540
What a steal.

122
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,690
Look at this galloping horse.

123
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,340
Only Minglou could offer

124
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,740
such a treasure of this quality.

125
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,700
Bai Wu.

126
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,300
Look over there.

127
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,740
He must be the master of Minglou.

128
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,140
See the eight auction items on stage?

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,220
The Mu Family's Jade King has already

130
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,860
been tagged with a tracker by me.

131
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,280
As long as we can prove

132
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,760
the other items are fakes,

133
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,740
then send the tracker signal immediately.

134
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,180
Next step,

135
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,680
we will wait for the police to arrive

136
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,860
and catch these fraudsters.

137
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,260
The plan sounds simple.

138
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,220
But who knows

139
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,740
if something might go wrong?

140
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,060
Chance of an incident: 100%.

141
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,260
(100% chance of an incident?)

142
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,420
(How many antiques here today)

143
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,700
(are actually authentic?)

144
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,580
Authenticity rate: 0%.

145
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,460
(As expected, they're all fakes.)

146
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,240
(What could the incident be?)

147
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,380
(System? System?)

148
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
What's wrong?

149
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,300
The system just told me,

150
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,040
there's a 100% chance of an incident today.

151
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,340
How is that possible?

152
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,260
Wait a second.

153
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,060
Your System's back online?

154
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Yeah, but it's still unstable.

155
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,620
These things can't be rushed.

156
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,780
It'll settle over time.

157
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,220
I'll try to find some energy,

158
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,220
and get it fully operational soon.

159
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,940
Hold on.

160
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,220
You two...

161
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,100
It's not what you think!

162
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,920
Thank you all for waiting.

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,020
The Minglou Underground Auction

164
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:21,980
starts now.

165
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,580
Now, we move on

166
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,700
to the first segment,

167
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,420
unveiling eight treasures.

168
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,140
These antiques...

169
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,540
They are national treasures lost overseas.

170
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,100
Wu,

171
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,300
these are all fake?

172
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,620
They're all fakes.

173
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,500
The genuine ones should be in Shengong Hall.

174
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,620
Now, let's start

175
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,780
the auction segment.

176
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,180
The first auction item is

177
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,660
the Emperor Qin's Bronze Sword.

178
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,780
This sword belonged to Emperor Ying Zheng,

179
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,980
worn during his unification
of the six states.

180
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,820
Forged from alloy,

181
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,780
it's perfectly preserved,

182
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,500
and still incredibly sharp.

183
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,100
Starting bid: 500 million.

184
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,620
Each bid increase,

185
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,780
no less than ten million.

186
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,060
Let's start now.

187
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
One billion.

188
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,020
(Shengong Hall,)

189
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,460
(just wait and see.)

190
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,100
(I'm going to turn the Minglou auction)

191
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,940
(completely upside down.)

192
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,580
1,05 million.

193
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,900
1.5 billion.

194
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
1.55 billion.

195
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,100
1.58 billion.

196
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,460
1.8 billion.

197
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,380
2 billion.

198
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,060
2.1 billion.

199
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,380
2.5 billion.

200
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,500
2.5 billion, first call.

201
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,260
2.5 billion, second call.

202
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,260
2.5 billion.

203
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,340
Sold!

204
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,020
Congratulations to...

205
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,860
Mr. Ximen.

206
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,700
- Look into his background.
- Mr. Ximen.

207
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,420
Yes.

208
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,980
Next is the second auction item.

209
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,180
Hold on a moment.

210
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,780
Mr. Ximen, do you have something to say?

211
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,540
Since I've already won this sword,

212
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,900
shouldn't I be invited to try it out?

213
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,490
The auction follows specific procedures.

214
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,100
If you want to try it,

215
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,060
you can do so backstage.

216
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,180
Are you suggesting

217
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,580
I go backstage to swing the sword?

218
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,340
You're quite amusing, sir.

219
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,620
Who said I was joking?

220
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,740
I spent 2.5 billion without hesitation,

221
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,540
just to get on stage and swing the sword.

222
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Is that too much?

223
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,580
Master,

224
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,540
this guy came with the Mu Family.

225
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,390
The Mu Family didn't reveal
his real identity.

226
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,600
He's probably a playboy

227
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,350
from a prestigious family in the jade circle.

228
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,880
This doesn't follow the rules.

229
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,760
Rules?

230
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,220
What are the rules?

231
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,780
I'll add one billion more.

232
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
2.6 billion.

233
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,380
2.7 billion.

234
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,220
3 billion.

235
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,060
Is that enough?

236
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,780
3 billion, huh?

237
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,430
Spending another 500 million

238
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,740
just to swing the sword on stage.

239
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,420
Even Emperor Qin himself

240
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,540
wouldn't go this far, right?

241
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,370
Let him try!

242
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,340
Let him try!

243
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,480
Let him try!

244
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,580
Let him try!

245
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,700
Let him try!

246
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,080
Let him try!

247
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,540
Let him take the stage.

248
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,780
Let him go on stage.

249
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,580
Please welcome Mr. Ximen to the stage

250
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,620
to swing... no, verify the treasure.

251
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,340
It's heavy enough.

252
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
This sword

253
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,820
is forged from copper, iron,

254
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,900
lead, and zinc.

255
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,660
It weighs 1,575 grams.

256
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,420
It's remarkably well-preserved,

257
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,220
and still incredibly sharp today.

258
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,260
Still incredibly sharp today?

259
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,820
Isn't it very easy

260
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,300
to kill people with it?

261
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
Sir,

262
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,180
you can't joke like that.

263
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,940
Do you think I'm a fool?

264
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,380
Of course, I was joking with you.

265
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,100
Why would I use a three-billion sword

266
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,300
to kill someone?

267
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
You're truly humorous.

268
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,460
If this sword is to be used,

269
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,260
it should naturally be used

270
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,300
on fake antiques.
