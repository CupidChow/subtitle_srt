Miss,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,800
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
is this your dog?

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,080
Thanks for helping me catch Oreo.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,840
It just chewed through the leash.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,560
No worries.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,640
Come down first. It hurts.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,840
Did it bite you?

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,480
Wait, don't touch me.

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
No, come down first.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,480
Come down first.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,640
I'm Che Xiaoxiao.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,720
Thank you so much!

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,880
Otherwise, Oreo would've been lost.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm Bai Wu.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
Don't mention it.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,700
Bai Wu,

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,760
how should I thank you?

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,680
No need to thank me.

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,120
Just keep an eye on your dog.

21
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,390
Hmm.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,480
Sensing energy.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,720
Energy is being collected.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
Collection complete.

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
The System can be upgraded.

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Upgrade now?

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Of course.

28
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
Upgrading...

29
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,600
(A blessing in disguise.)

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,080
Come on, take a look.

31
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,920
Take a look.

32
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,520
This is a great thing.

33
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,560
Take a look, take a look.

34
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,760
Good things!

35
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
How about

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,560
going to the stall of Fatty first?

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,920
Chance Fatty agrees to trade: 7%.

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,300
(It seems he still holds a grudge)

39
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,870
(about the last time I found a bargain.)

40
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,720
Hold on.

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
System,

42
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,120
you've become smarter.

43
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
Current version

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,920
can offer analysis to assist with problems.

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,760
Nice!

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,000
Today I will definitely harvest a lot.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,240
What treasures do you have?

48
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,880
Qianlong-era items.

49
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,440
They are fake, huh?

50
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,880
Fatty,

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,720
how's the business?

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
Why are you here again?

53
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,120
I obviously support your business.

54
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,720
Pfft.

55
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,960
No need.

56
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,920
I feel unlucky.

57
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,900
(As expected,)

58
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,400
(he really doesn't want my business.)

59
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,480
Hey, young man,

60
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,320
come over here.

61
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,800
Last time, weren't you worried

62
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,400
I might dirty your antiques?

63
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
My apologies.

64
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
Last time, it was my mistake.

65
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
You're kind enough to let it go.

66
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Come, come.

67
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,600
Li,

68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,720
you're actually trading with a jinx?

69
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,200
Not afraid of jinxing yourself?

70
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,040
Quiet down!

71
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
Here, take a look, young man.

72
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,140
What's the authenticity rate
for these stalls?

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,720
2%.

74
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,440
26%.

75
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
What a shame.

76
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,680
Fatty's stall has a much higher rate.

77
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,240
Ming-era teapot,

78
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
valued at 25,000-30,000 yuan.

79
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,120
How much is this?

80
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
5,000.

81
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,190
Today's chance of finding a bargain: 0%.

82
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,080
(What does that mean?)

83
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,120
(Not a single steal today?)

84
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,520
3,000.

85
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,660
Deal.

86
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,600
(Isn't this a steal?)

87
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
5,000. I'll take it.

88
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,600
5,000.

89
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,480
Surprised?

90
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Caught off guard?

91
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,640
Jin Youlong.

92
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
Pang Kun?

93
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
You've offended me

94
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,920
and my friend too.

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,590
If you don't want to stay in Jiang City,

96
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,990
then you can leave.

97
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,200
Unexpected, right?

98
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm very close with Mr. Jin.

99
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,720
If I knew you were his friend,

100
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
I wouldn't have let you off that day.

101
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,520
People might think you're rich.

102
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
What do you want?

103
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
You cut off my road for gaining money.

104
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,360
Of course, I'll cut off your road too.

105
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
(So they're the distractions.)

106
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,760
Sir, 8,000.

107
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,680
8...

108
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,960
10,000.

109
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,320
Young man, 10,000?

110
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,280
You're determined to compete with me today?

111
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,320
Stop wasting time. Yes or no?

112
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,920
(This teapot is worth at most 30,000.)

113
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
30,000.

114
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,720
- Mr. Jin.
- Raise the bid.

115
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Got it.

116
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,160
50,000.

117
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
50,000?

118
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,280
How much?

119
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,420
You're ruthless.

120
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,640
Hey.

121
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,040
Giving up already?

122
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,160
Sir, here you go.

123
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,840
Oh no.

124
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,720
Got it wrong, didn't you?

125
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Who's the jinx?

126
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,560
This is a walking fortune!

127
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,660
20,000.

128
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,680
40,000.

129
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
30,000.

130
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,520
60,000.

131
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
60,000.

132
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,800
100,000.

133
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,640
You're really going all in against me?

134
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Highest bidder wins.

135
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,720
It's fair.

136
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,150
Everyone, everyone!

137
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Come and take a look.

138
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,520
This guy is good for nothing.

139
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
Just a penniless nobody.

140
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,200
Isn't that Young Master Jin

141
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,540
of the Wanbao Chamber of Commerce?

142
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,440
How'd this guy

143
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,090
get tangled with someone like that?

144
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
Well said.

145
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
I can't compare to you,

146
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
rich but stupid.

147
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,760
What do you mean by that?

148
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,160
That teapot is worth at most 30,000.

149
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
The jade, artifact and the vase

150
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,520
are worth no more than 60,000.

151
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,720
You're already lost over 160,000.

152
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,320
Trying to outplay me?

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,240
My finances aren't running dry.

154
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
You'll bleed money before you know it.

155
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,320
Dare to trick me?

156
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,600
That's a lot of money.

157
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Not cheap, huh?

158
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
160,000.

159
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
For someone like you, it's astronomical.

160
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
But for me,

161
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,770
it's just pocket change.

162
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,520
Everyone, everyone,

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,920
(What's going on here?)

164
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Come on, remember this face.

165
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,960
Bai Wu.

166
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,640
Bai Wu.

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,920
The watchdog of my family's branch store.

168
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,320
He got lucky and found a bargain.

169
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,920
Really think you can turn your life around?

170
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I'll walk you to the end of the road today.

171
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
You just love collecting junk, right?

172
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Fine, I'll sell it to you.

173
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,000
1,000.

174
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,920
Sorry.

175
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,040
I forgot.

176
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,920
You don't even have 1,000 yuan.

177
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,120
He did guard my family's gate for years.

178
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,280
He's loyal

179
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,800
and obedient.

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
Let me give him a discount.

181
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,520
250.

182
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Pay me 250.

183
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,890
This guy really doesn't know his place.

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,560
How dare he offend Mr. Jin!

185
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,520
Yeah, that's right.

186
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,720
Offending Mr. Jin

187
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,950
means he'll be done in the antique industry.

188
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,600
Probably he can't even stay in Jiang City.

189
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,520
Bai Wu!

190
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,520
Bai Wu,

191
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,720
what are you doing here?

192
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,520
Alright, Bai Wu, I won't disturb you.

193
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Take your time.

194
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,840
Pack all of these up.

195
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
Pack these up.

196
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,240
Pack these up.

197
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Mr. Jin,

198
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,760
he's going...

199
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,000
Stay close.

200
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,500
Thanks for your hard work.

201
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,360
Thanks.

202
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
Pack these up.

203
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,920
I want all of them.

204
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,220
Got it.

205
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
He's focused on quantity

206
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
and hides what he truly wants.

207
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
Hey, wait a minute.

208
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Wrap it all up.

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
I'll take it.

210
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,720
Double the price.

211
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
Jin Youlong,

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,670
are you raising the prices of antiques here?

213
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
Oh dear.

214
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,840
You wouldn't understand

215
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,520
the pains of the wealthy.

216
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Fine.

217
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
You're so extravagant.

218
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Buy it.

219
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Go ahead, buy it.

220
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Get the goods.

221
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,920
Mr. Jin, shouldn't we check the price first?

222
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Get the goods.

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
Alright.

224
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,040
I'll definitely cut off

225
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,640
your financial path.

226
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,720
Come on.

227
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Bai, it's a 50-50 split.

228
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Thanks for the hard work.

229
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,600
Let's work more later.

230
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
- Mr. Jin.
- Thanks a lot!

231
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Let's exchange WeChat.

232
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,680
- Thanks.
- Bai Wu.

233
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm in trouble right now.

234
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Could you lend me a hand?

235
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,860
You go over there

236
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
and tell the stall owners...

237
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,640
You want to spend money.

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
I have to step in

239
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,240
and help clear out the stock for everyone.

240
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Thanks a lot, Mr. Jin.

241
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
It's just more than 2 million.

242
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,110
Pocket change.

243
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,900
Oh, I remember something.

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
Feel free

245
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,440
to smash these things.

246
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,920
None of them are worth much.

247
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,220
Don't feel bad about it.

248
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,740
Everyone,

249
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,800
add me on WeChat, add me!

250
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
- Thanks!
- Thank you.

251
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
Add me on WeChat so we can connect.

252
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,720
Mr. Jin, are we really letting him go?

253
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,840
Why are you still holding it?

254
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
Get a few blank handprints ready.

255
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,200
A 100,000 loan

256
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,440
will make your life unbearable.

257
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
Let's do something for him.

258
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,720
(Loan Agreement)
(I've already swapped his loan)

259
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,300
(High-interest loan, daily rate 5.5%)
(for a high-interest loan.)

260
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,980
(Now that 100,000 he owes me)

261
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,020
(Lender: Shadow Loan Co.; Borrower: Bai Wu)

262
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,720
(has already snowballed)

263
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,720
(into millions with interest.)

264
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,210
(Better to give away ten years of life)

265
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,900
(than owe Shadow Loan even a cent.)

266
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,830
(He's doomed.)

267
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
I can kiss anyone,

268
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,040
except you.

269
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
You can kiss anyone?

270
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,560
I'm telling you, Mu Yi'er,

271
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,120
your parents agreed to our marriage.

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,320
Sooner or later, you'll be my wife.

273
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,160
I'm warning you,

274
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,400
you can't kiss anyone.

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Mu Yi'er, what are you doing here?

276
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Are you trying to provoke me?

277
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,720
Mu Yi'er, don't...

278
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,140
This isn't right.

279
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't...

280
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,280
You...

281
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,440
You!

282
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,760
Just you wait.

283
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
He has left.

284
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
What are you doing?

285
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,840
(Qingqing's been brainwashed)

286
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,910
(by this fortune teller.)

287
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,300
(She believes everything he says.)

288
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,880
(There isn't a good man.)

289
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
(Today, I'll help Qingqing)

290
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,640
(expose this con artist.)

291
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,480
Miss Mu...

292
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,240
Miss,

293
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,440
you've seen it yourself.

294
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,760
Our relationship is unique.

295
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,120
So what if you kissed?

296
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Exactly.

297
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
We have kissed.

298
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,520
So, he's coming with me.

299
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,320
Wait, when did I kiss you?

300
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,400
Now, we're on equal footing.

301
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
Bai Wu,

302
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,120
you promised to have dinner with me.

303
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,800
He's coming with me.

304
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,890
Come with me.

305
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,240
- Come with me.
- Come with me.

306
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,640
- Come with me.
- Come with me.

307
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,070
- Come with me.
- My arms are broken!

308
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,960
- It's broken!
- Come with me.

309
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
My arms are about to break.

310
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,530
Hey,

311
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,800
your dog ran off.

312
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Oreo!

313
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
Bai Wu, wait here for me.

314
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,400
Don't go with her.

315
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,880
Xiaoxiao! Xiaoxiao!

316
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800
Oreo!

317
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,420
Miss Mu, you...

318
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,720
Master Bai,

319
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,320
today,

320
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,280
can you help me one more time?

321
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,280
What do you need?

322
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,680
Be

323
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,280
