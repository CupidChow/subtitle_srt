what's your plan?

A sting operation.

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,040
Step one,

Step two,

00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,080
you play the role

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,240
of a naive and sweet college girl.

15

No, this won't work.

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,040
can I have your WeChat?

I'll give whatever you want.

highlight a lack of social experience.

That's it.

There's a cinema upstairs too.

During the interview,

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,490
they'll deliberately undermine you

and brainwash you.

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,480
if you want to get this job,

81
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,320
you'll need to pay the high training fees.

82
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,360
Act a little nervous.

83
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,080

I've reviewed your résumé.

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,240
You don't have any work experience.

93
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,250
That's because I haven't graduated yet.

94
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,920
But I believe in my potential, I...

95
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Believing in yourself doesn't mean much.

96
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,460
What can you offer to make me believe in you?

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,760
As expected, the brainwashing begins.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,920
Don't be nervous.

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
As a workplace rookie,

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,520
how do you view challenges and obstacles

Challenges and obstacles?

103
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,480
I'll pinpoint the key issues,

104
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
take the initiative to seek help,

105
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,560
and ask colleagues and leaders for advice.

106
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,640
Relying on coworkers for everything?

107
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,640
Then what does the company need you for?

108
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,200
That's just wasting time.

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,790
Even people like her come for interviews?

110
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,640
Who scheduled this?

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,880
I did. Is there a problem?

112
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,160
Well, the drama begins.

113
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
One plays the good cop.

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,560
The other plays the bad cop.

115
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Mr. Luo,

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,600
we need someone reliable

117
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
and stable who can get the job done.

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,680
Because of her lacking individual capability

119
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,960
and work experience,

120
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,880
you just dismiss her.

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,320
You're shutting out
a lot of potential talent.

122
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
Sounds nice in theory.

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,360
You just want to groom your own people.

124
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Not everyone thinks like you.

125
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,680
What's wrong with you?

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,740
How dare you say like that?

127
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,140
Try to look more flustered.

128
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,360
Don't let them see through you.

129
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
They're definitely going

130
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,320
to advice you to join the training.

131
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,520
Just pretend to agree when the time comes.

132
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,640
That's it for today's interview.

133
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,680
I'll wait for your notice?

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,040
No need.

135
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,080
This backstabbing environment

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,680
isn't suitable for you.

137
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,200
How could this happen?

138
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
I don't think I did anything wrong.

139
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,320
Bai Wu, what's going on?

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,160
This doesn't make sense.

141
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,000
Forget it, come back first.

142
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,040
Ding Yifei.

143
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Sorry about earlier.

144
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
The interview turned out like that.

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,560
I should be the one apologizing.

146
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
You even argued with your colleague.

147
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,560
She's not my colleague anymore.

148
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,920
I just resigned.

149
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Resigned?

150
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Keep up with him.

151
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,000
It's not because of me, is it?

152
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,320
Don't feel guilty.

153
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,440
It's not your fault.

154
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
I've been disappointed with it for a while.

155
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,290
Hopefully, it's not just because of me.

156
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,280
If it is because of me,

157
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,600
then I truly apologize.

158
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,280
Some key team members will leave with me.

159
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,600
Next step,

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,890
I'll start my own business.

161
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,520
I believe,

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
in less than two years,

163
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,280
I'll surpass them.

164
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,200
You're really impressive!

165
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's exchange WeChat.

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Maybe we can collaborate someday.

167
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Sounds great!

168
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,770
Where are you heading next?

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,980
I'm going back to school.

170
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Business School, right?

171
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,600
It's on my way. I'll drop you off.

172
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, that's too much trouble for you.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
It's no trouble at all.

174
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,480
I see.

175
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,140
Afraid your boyfriend might see us?

176
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
No, no!

177
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,760
I don't have a boyfriend.

178
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,280
Then it's settled. Let's go.

179
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
This girl

180
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,440
is quite the actor.

(Day 1 of the sting operation)

182
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,400
Got time for a movie tomorrow?

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,640
But I have class tomorrow.

184
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,960
Alright.

185
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,360
Okay then.

186
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,480
Just think of it

187
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,000
as keeping a recently unemployed friend.

188
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
Fine, I'll go.

189
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,560
See you tomorrow.

190
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,600
Bye.

191
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
Why is the interview taking so long?

192
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,500
(Day 2 of the sting operation)

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,240
Sorry about that.

194
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
No worries.

195
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
Getting ready for work.

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,160
Arrived at the company.

197
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Ordered afternoon tea for the staff.

198
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,240
I started from the bottom too

199
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,280
and totally understand their hard work.

200
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,520
You're such a wonderful boss.

201
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,280
You're the most unique girl I've ever met.

202
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,560
Do you say this to every girl you meet?

203
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
Of course not.

204
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,880
You seem a little different today.

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,280
Different in a cute way.

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Here, take this.

207
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
- Are you sure?
- Take it.

208
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
You're so thoughtful.

209
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
They're just small gifts.

210
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,900
If you want more, we can go shopping later.

211
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,060
(Day 7 of the sting operation)
This is for you.

212
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
It's so beautiful!

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,640
I'm not sleeping.

214
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Wu, it's been eight days already.

215
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
When will this end?

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,560
Today's the day.

217
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,840
That guy is definitely make a move on you.

218
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,920
A 500-yuan dress can win over a girl?

219
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,320
What kind of game are they playing here?

220
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,760
Emotional scams.

221
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,630
- Start with a romantic encounter.
- Here.

222
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,760
Establish a perfect persona

223
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
of being handsome,

224
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,320
wealthy, gentle, and talented.

225
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,910
Make the target believe she's a lucky girl.

226
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,680
- Finally, secure the target.
- So beautiful!

227
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
What does "secure the target" mean?

228
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
Well, of course it means...

229
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,240
Wait a second, I...

230
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm not ready just yet.

231
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,400
It's okay.

232
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,680
Just relax.

233
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
We can just chat.

234
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,960
If the girl refuses,

235
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,000
the scammer might use drugs,

236
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
creating an irreversible situation.

237
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,680
And of course,

238
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,480
hidden recording devices are essential.

239
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,240
Most girls

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,600
will lower their guard

241
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,560
against men they've been with.

242
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,600
And this

243
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,520
is the perfect moment for scammers to act.

244
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Next,

245
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
he'll say like this.

246
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
I suddenly ran out of cash flow,

247
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,810
and I owe a huge amount of money.

248
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,040
They won't let me off the hook!

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,120
Don't do that!

250
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,840
How much do you owe?

251
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,960
Two...

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,960
two... two million.

253
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Two million?

254
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,200
Fei, please help me, won't you?

255
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
I...

256
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
How can I possibly help you?

257
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,290
(Credit Loan Agreement)
Can you take out a loan for me?

258
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,040
Once my cash flow recovers,

259
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,190
I'll pay it back immediately.

260
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,440
Fei, please help me.

261
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,960
If you don't, they might kill me.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
At this point,

263
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,360
a girl's only fate is to be played with.

264
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,480
Oh no.

265
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,760
This is terrifying.

266
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,280
What should I do now?

267
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,000
Counter with strategy.

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,480
(Day 9 of the sting operation)
Cheers.

269
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
Fei.

270
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,760
Open it and see.

271
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,200
What's this?

272
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,320
It's for you.

273
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
Wow, it's beautiful.

274
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,520
Fei,

275
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,920
I really like you.

276
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Will you be my girlfriend?

277
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,880
(Bai Wu: Keep an eye on the time.)

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,480
It's getting late.

279
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,880
If I go back any later,

280
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,200
the dormitory is about to close.

281
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,680
Tomorrow is the weekend.

282
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,720
Don't go back to school tonight.

283
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,680
Come to my place.

284
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,000
Wait, I...

285
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm not ready yet.

286
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
It's okay.

287
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,320
Just relax.

288
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
We can just chat.

289
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,280
What are you doing tomorrow?

290
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,240
Going to the bookstore.

291
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,720
I'll go with you.

292
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,860
No, don't.

293
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,960
No.

294
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,880
Please don't do this.

295
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,200
Don't.
