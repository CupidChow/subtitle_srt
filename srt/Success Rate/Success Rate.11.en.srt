00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,280
You... You...!

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,120
Seriously?

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,480
Look at what you've done!

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,640
The Nine-dragon Vat worth 1.3 billion...

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,160
You actually smashed it!

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,840
Mr. Che, you just let him act recklessly?

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Mr. Zhang,

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,720
calm down please.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,360
Take it easy.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
If this kid

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,280
can't prove the vat is fake,

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,520
I will personally give you an explanation.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,360
But if he smashed it

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,640
and can prove the vat is truly fake,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,920
Mr. Zhang,

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,840
then I will

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,960
have a serious conversation with you.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,840
(Mr. Che really knows how to play the game.)

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,800
(Looks like I have to win today.)

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,000
(A 95% chance of winning sounds solid.)

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,920
(It is worth 1.3 billion.)

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,800
(What if luck turns against me?)

24
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,720
Kid,

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,600
you've already smashed this vat.

26
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,640
1.3 billion for one hit, fun, huh?

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,960
Got anything to say?

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,200
Right.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,360
Proof, show me the proof.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,280
Of course, there's proof.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,480
Don't rush.

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
(System, where's the flaw?)

33
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,760
Chance of finding a flaw in the wall: 98%.

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
(If I smash with this hammer,)

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,800
(I won't destroy the flaw, will I?)

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,160
Chance of destroying the flaw: 58%.

37
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,640
(Phew!)

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,840
(I almost lose my life with one hit!)

39
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,120
- What about now?
- Chance of destruction: 8%.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,320
(Alright then.)

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,280
(Break it safely.)

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,920
(My life and safety come first.)

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,280
(Hurry up and get out!)

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,020
(If it drags on,)

45
00:02:15,144 --> 00:02:16,744
(Mr. Che will trust me even less.)

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,560
Mr. Che,

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,320
the vat is ruined.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,520
Out of respect for you,

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,120
I give him a chance to find the proof.

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
Look at him,

51
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,060
dragging things out endlessly.

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,360
After all this, where's the proof?

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,360
Why are you in such a rush?

54
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
This vat is so huge.

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,000
I have to take some time to search.

56
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,990
(Hurry up! If you don't come out soon,)

57
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,240
(I'll really lose 1.3 billion.)

58
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
(That's risking my own life.)

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,920
(It's over.)

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,440
(I got too anxious and lost control.)

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,880
(Could I have destroyed it?)

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,520
Kid, how's it going?

63
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Mr. Bai,

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,000
this is a treasure worth 1.3-billion.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,120
You acted impulsively.

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Brat,

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,600
if you can't show me the proof,

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,320
I'll make you pay for this.

69
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
(Where is it?)

70
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,440
(Where is it?)

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
(If it doesn't come out,)

72
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,580
(Mr. Che will be in trouble.)

73
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,320
(Come out!)

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,240
(Hurry up!)

75
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,880
Found it!

76
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,320
Everyone, take a look.

77
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
What's this?

78
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,960
A QR code?

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
Mr. Zhang,

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,280
explain it.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,720
(That was nerve-wracking!)

82
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,640
It's...

83
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,440
Mr. Zhang, you're not suggesting

84
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,880
this QR code was put in by the Ming's kiln?

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
What now?

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,160
Scan it to follow a public account?

87
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Mr. Zhang,

88
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,520
you need to give me an explanation.

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's go.

90
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,320
Kid,

91
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,160
how did you know the secret was there?

92
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
Mr. Che,

93
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,280
I already explained it to you.

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I calculated it.

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Calculated it?

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
You're still claiming you calculated it?

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Take care.

98
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,040
What favors do you need me to do?

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,320
The first one,

100
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,600
is for you to take back the 30,000 yuan.

101
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,320
Xiaoxiao and I are really just friends.

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,200
And I've already found a place to live.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,840
What about the second thing?

104
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,280
Have you or Mr. Xiao

105
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
heard of the Di Group?

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
I've heard a little.

107
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,060
It seems like

108
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,900
an overseas antique trading association.

109
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,080
They're planning to expand back home.

110
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,160
Yes.

111
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,720
They want to hire you
as their chief consultant.

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,240
Alright.

113
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
About this matter,

114
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,680
I agree.

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,640
Thank you, Mr. Che.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,720
What's the last thing?

117
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,760
The last thing.

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,360
I wanted to ask you

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
if you've seen

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,000
this jade before.

121
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,160
Where did you get this jade?

122
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,720
I'm an orphan.

123
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
This is the only thing my parents left me.

124
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,400
I heard from Xiaoxiao

125
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,080
that you have an identical one.

126
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,950
So,

127
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,460
I wanted to ask if you know anything

128
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,484
about my parents.

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,840
About the origin of this jade,

130
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,040
I do know some details.

131
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,640
Please, enlighten me.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Do you really want to know?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then do something for me first.

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,760
Alright.

135
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Hello?

136
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,400
What?

137
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,400
The Nine-dragon Vat was smashed.

138
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,680
Who did it?

139
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,080
A guy named Bai Wu.

140
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,440
Bai Wu?

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,560
He even found the proof it's a counterfeit.

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,520
That troublemaker always ruins my plans.

143
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,360
He will lead to disasters someday.

144
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,240
If he makes any trouble again

145
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,200
and the Hall Lord blames us,

146
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,160
we won't be able to handle it.

147
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Dad,

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
are you saying...

149
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,240
What a big house!

150
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,520
Feels so comfortable to live in.

151
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,800
System, we're about to live a good life!

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,800
Hello?

153
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
Long time no see.

154
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,400
Who are you?

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,720
Ignore them.

156
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,520
This has nothing to do with you.

157
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
I take full responsibility for my actions.

158
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Fatty Wang,

159
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,040
what did they do to you?

160
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm Mr. Meng from Shadow Loan Co.

161
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,400
Your friend is with me.

162
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,440
Come over so we can talk.

163
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Shadow Loan Co.?

164
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,880
Shadow Loan Co...

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,840
How did Fatty Wang get involved with them?

166
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
System, is this related to me?

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,280
Connection rate: 88%.

168
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,440
It's related to me?

169
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Is this trip safe?

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,760
Safety rate: 61%.

171
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,280
There's some risk. Proceed cautiously.

172
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,680
Only 61%?

173
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,400
Sounds a bit dangerous.

174
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,480
Dangerous or not,

175
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm definitely saving Fatty.

176
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,640
I'm Bai Wu.

177
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,100
I'm here to find my friend.

178
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Bai Wu, why do you come here?

179
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down.

180
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,640
Stay put.

181
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Bai Wu, you arrived so quickly.

182
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,560
What a pity.

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,200
I was just getting ready

184
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
to cut off this fat guy's two fingers.

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,160
Did you borrow money from them?

186
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Yes.

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,440
I did borrow.

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,880
But... but I paid it back.

189
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,320
I paid back the principal

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,840
and the interest too.

191
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,880
So you're

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,560
Mr. Meng from Shadow Loan Co.

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,960
Bai Wu,

194
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,640
we've crossed paths before.

195
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,080
Don't you remember?

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Of course I remember.

197
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
Wu, you also...

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
We have been operating for years.

199
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,160
Only you walked away without paying.

200
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,760
I gave you enough respect, didn't I?

201
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,480
But you ruined my business,

202
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,960
and that's crossing the line.

203
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
Ruined your business?

204
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,680
What do you mean?

205
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,160
Come out now.

206
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,800
Who are you?

207
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,140
What does it have to do with you?

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,360
It's you.

209
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,920
