00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,720
Senior Guifu,

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,720
nice to meet you.

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,850
Congratulations on you

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,040
passing the heart-questioning trial.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,680
What about my friends?

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,600
Don't worry,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,160
they're fine.

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,160
Mary

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
simply played along

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
in the trial's illusion.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,520
Your parents didn't come back to life.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,640
Are you disappointed?

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,600
Come, have a seat.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,280
Senior,

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,360
what's the story behind the trial

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,760
and the GRA fakes?

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
It's a long story.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,840
28 years ago,

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,420
my master entrusted me with this jade.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,240
I've been frail and sickly since childhood.

22
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,520
Doctors in town always said

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
I wouldn't live past 20.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,240
During my heart-questioning trial,

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,080
I made a wish

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,120
to live forever.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,400
Not long after,

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,240
my sister fell critically ill.

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,960
The ancient jade forced me to choose

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,240
between immortality

31
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
and my sister.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,880
In the end,

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,280
I painfully chose

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,840
to save my sister.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,960
The ancient jade accepted me as its master.

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,720
I gave it energy,

37
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,040
and in return, it extended my life.

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,640
From then on,

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,800
my health improved day by day.

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,580
After the founding of the nation,

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,080
I was taken to Taiwan, China

42
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,080
along with a batch of national treasures,

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,920
and then made my way to Europe and America.

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,360
During this time, my jade was lost.

45
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,720
To this day,

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,160
there is only one thing

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,480
keeping me going:

48
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,440
bringing back our treasures

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,990
that were scattered abroad

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,080
home.

51
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,240
You're already

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,850
over 100 years old now, aren't you?

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Well,

54
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,960
those fakes in GRA...

55
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,640
They were all crafted by me.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,340
It was to prevent Shengong Hall

57
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:33,656
from interfering.

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,120
So, senior,

59
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,560
the heart-questioning trial

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
set by the Hetu Ancient Jade...

61
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
It's naturally because it met its old master.

62
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,000
The old master nodded.

63
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,880
Only then can it recognize a new master.

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,840
So the abilities

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,120
I used before are...

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,920
It's just the ancient jade making a deal

67
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,840
with you to gain energy.

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Its true capabilities

69
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,120
are far more powerful.

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,280
Come on.

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,720
Let me take a closer look at it.

72
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
My old friend,

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
it's been over a century.

74
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
How are you doing?

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,920
Go ahead.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
Take good care of it.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Energy source detected.

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,360
System rebooting.

79
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Host authentication.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,640
System functions fully unlocked.

81
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
System upgrading now.

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,960
Upgrade progress: 1%.

83
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,120
System.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,230
You are fully revived.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,000
Upgrade progress: 1%.

86
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,640
Senior,

87
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,600
the System's upgrade is stuck at 1%.

88
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,440
How much longer will it take?

89
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,440
Just give it more time.

90
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,920
Its support for me

91
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,800
is almost

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,120
at its limit.

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
Are you saying

94
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
since I become the master,

95
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,800
your lifespan will be...?

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Senior,

97
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,080
I don't want the jade anymore.

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
You silly boy.

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,920
That's not how it works.

100
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,640
Do you know

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,120
why the jade has made me

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,640
to live so long?

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
Because

104
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,560
it was the wish you made during the trail?

105
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
Right,

106
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,750
but also not entirely right.

107
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,720
A wish is still part of one's heart,

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,840
and the human heart

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,160
is not easily changed.

110
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,810
Back then,

111
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,200
after passing the trial,

112
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
I lived comfortably into my thirties,

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
then my forties,

114
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,120
and even my fifties.

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,600
But I never thought about

116
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,240
living so long

117
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,840
might have stolen

118
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,680
someone else's years.

119
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,080
Senior,

120
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
are you saying,

121
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,960
deep down, you didn't want to die,

122
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
so the jade...

123
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,520
Looking back now,

124
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,720
I really shouldn't have been so greedy

125
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,760
that I caused others to lose their lives.

126
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,480
You can't say that.

127
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,020
It's just human nature, after all.

128
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,400
Life has its own way of unfolding.

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,440
But greed always comes with a price.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,960
Kid,

131
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,240
remember this.

132
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,720
You made the right choice

133
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,360
in the trail,

134
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,960
but it doesn't mean you'll always be right.

135
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't let selfish desires

136
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,560
hurt those closest to you.

137
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,320
Alright,

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880
I'll remember that.

139
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,480
About Shengong Hall,

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
from what I know,

141
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Shengong is the owner

142
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,000
of another piece of jade.

143
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,400
But you know,

144
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,680
he passed away in the late Qing Dynasty.

145
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
His Hetu Ancient Jade

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,840
was passed down through generations,

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,440
yet none of his descendants

148
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,280
could pass the heart-questioning trial.

149
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
After the founding of the nation,

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,120
one of his descendants

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,080
found my piece of jade,

152
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,080
determined to bypass the trial,

153
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,520
and uncover the jade's secrets.

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,040
Thus, he established

155
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,320
the Hetu Research Institute.

156
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Later on,

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,880
they developed the replica jade.

158
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,240
To ensure the research results

159
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,640
stayed under control,

160
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,840
the descendant of Shengong

161
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,520
created an accident

162
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,560
to destroy the institute.

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Turns out

164
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,160
my biological parents

165
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,080
were killed by people from Shengong Hall.

166
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
Although Shengong Hall

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,600
was not recognized by the ancient jade,

168
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,760
they has spent years researching it,

169
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,200
and must have gained access

170
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
to the ancient jade's power.

171
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,660
You...

172
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,960
You must be careful.

173
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,720
Got it.

174
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440
Senior, you should rest for a while.

175
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,280
It's been 100 years.

176
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,760
I am tired.

177
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,410
I think

178
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,120
I should

179
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,520
take a good rest now.

180
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Senior!

181
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,040
Senior Guifu!

182
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
Senior Guifu!

183
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Guifu,

184
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
you finally died.

185
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,820
About today's events,

186
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,220
the teacher predicted it long ago,

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,200
and he was well-prepared.

188
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
The teacher said

189
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,680
he's done everything he could.

190
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,040
He hands over the national treasures to you

191
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,500
and so is the responsibility.

192
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,150
♪He's at the pinnacle of the pyramid♪

193
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,070
♪Being frivolous, arrogant, like a disguise♪

194
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,990
♪Destiny requires me to boldly venture♪

Upgrade progress: 53%.

210
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,600
Come on, today is our first time

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
to hold a shareholder meeting.

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
Let's have a toast first.

213
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,160
Fatty, I'm telling you,

214
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,440
you're too stingy.

215
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,360
Who holds a meeting by the street?

216
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,200
Exactly.

217
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,000
And look at the name.

218
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
Half-life Hall.

219
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,400
Sounds awful.

220
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,240
How can you say it sounds awful?

221
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
We are originally

222
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,440
Half-Life Squad.

223
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,790
And we're all shareholders.

224
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,200
What else would we call it?

225
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,320
I'm worried you'll scare off the customers.

226
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,560
They might think shopping here

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,900
could cost them half their life.

228
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,160
Miss Di,

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,720
don't say things like that.

230
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,920
Come on, Fatty,

231
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
let me toast to you.

232
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,160
Wait a moment.

233
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,800
Wu,

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,520
you and I

235
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
got off on the wrong foot.

236
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,720
Back then,

237
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,440
you wanted to snag a bargain,

238
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,420
and I tried to trick you.

239
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,400
We were practically

240
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
destined to clash,

241
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
starting off as enemies.

242
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,400
But you have a generous heart.

243
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,000
You never hold grudges,

244
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,200
and often help me through tough times.

245
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,460
You even introduced me to the association.

246
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,720
I

247
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,820
am just a small vendor

248
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,920
on the antique street.

249
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,640
My dream is to open

250
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,320
my own antique shop.

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Now, that dream has come true.

252
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,330
Wu, your support made it possible.

253
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,320
This toast

254
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,840
is for you.

255
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Buddy,

256
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,800
it's all in the wine.

257
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,280
It's all in the wine.

258
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,120
Miss Di,

259
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
this toast is for you.

260
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,280
Actually, the fate of the three of us

261
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,480
was already determined

262
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,640
in a play.

263
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
What do you mean?

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,120
The luminous pearl you bought

265
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,360
from Wu was actually a bargain

266
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,640
that Wu snagged from me.

267
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,440
I offer 300,000.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,840
Let's make a deal.

269
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,520
My 300,000!

270
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,640
- Is it?
- That's right.

271
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Miss Di,

272
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,960
you're an entrepreneur.

273
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,640
I know

274
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
you wouldn't care

275
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,640
about the shares.

276
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
But I believe the shares...

277
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
I care about it.

278
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,800
Because this is not just about shares,

279
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,000
but also the bond between us.

280
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,520
Miss Di,

281
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,160
Wu,

282
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
it's all in the wine.

283
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
It's all in the wine.

284
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,360
Cheers!

285
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,840
- Let's eat.
- Eat!

286
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
Come on.

287
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,600
Alert!

288
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,120
National treasures being stolen: 100%.

289
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,440
What's going on?

290
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,960
The System just informed me

291
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
the national treasures might be stolen.

292
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,760
System,

293
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,680
is Shengong Hall behind the theft?

294
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,560
Upgrade progress: 90%.

295
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,320
Excuse me. Please pack it up.

296
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,280
Stop! Don't move it!

297
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,120
You dare to steal the national treasures.

298
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
You will get penalty, you know?

299
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Put it down now!

300
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Don't say nonsense.

301
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,360
We were tasked to relocate the treasures.

302
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,960
Who gave you this mission?

303
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,320
It was me!

304
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Mr. Sun?

305
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,160
What's going on here?

306
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Two hours ago,

307
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,120
I received an anonymous call,

308
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,040
saying the Shengong Hall

309
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,420
would steal the national treasures.

310
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,840
Anonymous call?

311
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
What's more, they accurately described

312
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
the security staff,

313
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
their patrol routes,

314
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,400
and even knew the passwords.

315
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,120
After much thought,

316
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,960
I decided to move the treasures

317
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,520
to a safer location first.

318
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,560
Alright, everyone, great job.

319
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,500
You can head back now.

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,440
Alright.

321
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,880
You all can leave now.

322
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,480
I'll handle the rest from here.

323
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,600
Got it, Mr. Sun.

324
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,040
I'll head back now, Mr. Sun.

325
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,440
System,

326
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
are the national treasures safe now?

327
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,240
National treasures having been stolen: 100%.

328
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,320
Hurry, call the police!

329
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,560
Catch that truck!

330
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
Why?

331
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,160
That's Shengong Hall's truck.

332
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
It's Shengong Hall.

333
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Bai Wu!

334
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,640
What Shengong Hall?

335
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
Where is it?

336
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,840
Mr. Sun,

337
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,360
you are

338
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,720
