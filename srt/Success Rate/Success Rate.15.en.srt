2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,040
Doctor.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,160
Hurry up.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,520
Quickly!

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,000
It's all my fault.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,240
I noticed

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,000
her mood has been off lately.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,320
But I didn't talk to her properly.

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,240
Alright.

10
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,380
She's been stabilized now.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,200
Besides, this isn't entirely on you.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,240
Exactly.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,160
Siting!

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,480
You're awake.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Why did you do something so reckless?

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,040
There's nothing that can't be solved.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,680
You still have me, don't you?

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,120
Xiaoxiao,

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
you've already helped me so much.

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,760
I feel ashamed to ask for more.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,400
What exactly happened to you?

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,760
I...

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
I took out a campus loan.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,720
But I only borrowed 4,800 yuan.

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,680
In just five months,

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,850
with compound interest,

27
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,136
they ask me to pay 200,000.

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,880
I can't possibly pay it back.

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,120
200,000 yuan?

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,080
After graduating high school,

31
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,120
I've always felt insecure about my education.

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,760
That day, I met someone.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,960
Miss, learn about self-study programs.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,440
We focus on top-tier universities here.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,640
Our instructors

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,960
are lecturers from prestigious schools.

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,500
(Magic Institution; Adult Education;
Enrollment Brochure)

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,360
Please help me fill out a survey.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,320
Just two minutes. Please.

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,960
I thought she was a salesperson like me,

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
so I filled out the survey

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,520
(Training Needs Survey)
to help boost her performance a little.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,120
But in the end, her pitch convinced me.

44
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,160
I was tempted,

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,270
so I signed up.

46
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,100
The tuition fee is 6,000?

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,200
I don't have that much money.

48
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,040
(Loan Agreement)
We collaborate with a loan company.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
If you take out a loan,

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,400
we can offer a 20% discount on tuition.

51
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,280
20% discount?

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,240
Can there really be such a good deal?

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,600
I might as well be honest with you.

54
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,360
There're university graduates everywhere now.

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,060
For those of us running self-study training,

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,000
the pressure is immense.

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,240
To attract students,

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,000
we've had to keep cutting our profits.

59
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,800
Eventually,

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
her persuasive words won me over.

61
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,200
I ended up signing the contract.

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Didn't you just sell a house to Bai Wu?

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
My brother's getting married.

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Our family can't afford a wedding house.

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
My mom's been crying to me about it,

66
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
so I gave her the money.

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,560
You...!

68
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Then... what happened next?

69
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,880
Hello? Hi, hello.

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,520
Is this Need Money Customer Service?

71
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,960
I'd like to ask something.

72
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,760
I borrowed 4,800 yuan.

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
Why did I only get 2,880?

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,320
We offer loans

75
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,360
with a handling fee and consultation fee.

76
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Usually about 40% of the loan amount.

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
That's so high!

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
Then I don't want the loan.

79
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,920
Your loan has already been issued.

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,240
But you didn't send the money to me!

81
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,960
It was sent to the training institution.

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,200
You signed the loan contract yourself, right?

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,110
Yes, but...

84
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
We only recognize the signer of the contract.

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,240
Later, I realized they were working together.

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,000
I thought I was just scammed out of 4,800.

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,000
My monthly base salary is 2,000 yuan.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,200
If I save carefully, I can pay it back.

89
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,280
But last month, my brother got married.

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,200
My mom bragged about me in front of others.

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,320
She said I found a good job in the city.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
Then she asked me for a wedding gift.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
I ended up giving 2,000 yuan as a gift.

94
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,160
They're like leeches.

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
I originally thought 800 yuan a month,

96
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,200
with 3% interest, was manageable.

97
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
But I never expected...

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,080
Well,

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,110
how could you do this?

100
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,880
I was just ten days late on the payment.

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,640
My monthly installment was 800 yuan.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Interest rate is 3%.

103
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
How did 4,800 turn into 8,500?

104
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
The 3% interest is calculated daily

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,680
and compounded based on the 4,800.

106
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,520
Overdue payments incur additional fees.

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,680
No, no.

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,320
This is way too unfair!

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,720
How am I supposed to pay this off?

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
Hold on, don't panic.

111
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,040
We're just following standard procedures.

112
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,280
But you still have to repay the money.

113
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,840
Let me suggest a private option.

114
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,400
The interest here is higher.

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
You can borrow there first.

116
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Use it to pay off this high-interest loan.

117
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,200
What, what option?

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,400
From that time,

119
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,160
I borrowed from one app

120
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,280
to pay off another loan.

121
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,000
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
Even if I only eat two buns every day,

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
I still can't make ends meet.

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,240
The interest keeps compounding,

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,880
and the debt just grows bigger.

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm honestly terrified.

127
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,240
I've deleted all loan apps,

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,360
and blocked unknown callers.

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,360
I thought I could escape it.

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Stay away from her.

131
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,880
Don't let her drag you down.

132
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,920
If she asks for money, say no.

133
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,280
It's a bottomless pit.

134
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,600
She borrows but never repays.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Look at the mess you've caused.

136
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,220
(Pay the money, or your family will die)

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
So vain.

138
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,960
Doesn't her chest look bigger?

139
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,340
She borrowed so much money,

140
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,464
likely for surgery,

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
to attract more customers.

142
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,080
Are you sure that's attraction?

143
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,120
I didn't.

144
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,760
Can you give me a little more time?

145
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,400
It's not that I don't want to pay.

146
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
I really don't have the money.

147
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,280
I only borrowed 4,800 yuan.

148
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Now you want me to repay 800,000?

149
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
How could I possibly have that much?

150
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,630
Listen, repay in ten days.

151
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,560
Or we'll have to take other measures.

152
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Wait, I...

153
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
Hello?

154
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,080
Hello?

155
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Still not quitting? Thick-skinned, huh?

156
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,510
If not, how would she dare not repay?

157
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,080
Look quickly!

158
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,280
Oh my, doing something like that!

159
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Hello? Mom.

160
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,640
How could you do something so shameless?

161
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
No matter what, you can't go sell yourself!

162
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,640
No, I didn't!

163
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,080
Mom, what are you saying?

164
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,120
You've embarrassed our family.

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Shameless!

166
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
How can we

167
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,120
even stay in this village now?

168
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,520
Let her stay out there and never come back!

169
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,570
Hello? Dad?

170
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,740
(Campus Belle's New Work:
The Temptation of Bondage)

171
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
That's not me.

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,600
I didn't film anything like that.

173
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,440
It's not me.

174
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,760
I said I didn't do that.

175
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
I told you it's not me, I didn't do it.

176
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,440
This is infuriating!

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,920
Those loan sharks are so despicable!

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,460
Call the police right away.

179
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
We need to bring them to justice.

180
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,360
It's useless.

181
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
We don't have any evidence.

182
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,540
They must've already prepared.

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Wu,

184
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,600
are we really letting this go?

185
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,900
(I don't feel right about it either.)

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,600
(Investigating Shengong Hall comes first.)

187
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
A reminder to the host.

188
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,320
Chance of fraud syndicate, Shadow Loan Co.

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,640
being linked to Shengong Hall: 67%.

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,280
(What?)

191
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
(Could it be)

192
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
(they're Shengong Hall's funding source?)

193
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,520
Funding source: 48%.

194
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,800
So that's how it is.

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
Wu, do you have a plan now?

196
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,720
Sort of.

197
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,890
First, let's track down the fraudsters.

198
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,640
I want in too.

199
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,720
I admit

200
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,480
what you said before was correct.

201
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
I'll immediately stop the Di Group's deal

202
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,136
with Shadow Loan Co.

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,880
Good to hear.

204
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
But you don't need to get involved.

205
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,960
After all, it's dangerous.

206
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Danger doesn't scare me.

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
Fatty still owes me half a life.

208
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Miss Di,

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,680
I'm still here, you know.

210
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,320
Alright.

211
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,720
Fine.

212
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,320
Then the Half-Life Anti-Fraud Squad

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
is officially formed.

214
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
