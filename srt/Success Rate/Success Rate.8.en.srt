2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,520
System, is it that man?

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,930
100%.

4
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,360
Darn it!

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,560
The survival rate as long as I leave?

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,470
If you get away within ten minutes,

7
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,690
fatality rate drops to 0%.

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,640
That's fine.

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,280
Mr. Bai,

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,120
are you feeling better?

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,320
Thanks.

12
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,640
System,

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,400
since there's an explosion,

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,200
will everyone here die?

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,550
In the sales office,

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,600
survival rate:

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,760
13%.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,440
Bai Wu,

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,480
what's going on?

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,800
Xiaoxiao, Siting,

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,200
there's an urgent matter now.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
Please trust me.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
You need to leave immediately.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,820
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,480
I have reliable information

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,460
that someone has a bomb

27
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,600
and will detonate it soon.

28
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,720
Anyone staying here

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,440
may die.

30
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll organize an evacuation.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,920
No, you can't.

32
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,240
If the suspect gets alerted,

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,600
he might detonate it immediately.

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
What should we do then?

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,760
Time is running out.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,240
Go as far away as possible.

37
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
Call the police.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,360
Go.

39
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,680
Okay, we're leaving now.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Bai Wu,

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
what about you?

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,040
Trust me.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,320
Just go.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Since I've unveiled Heaven's Secrets,

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,800
I can't just walk away.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
I need to save them.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
System,

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,040
how long do I have to stop the blast?

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,440
Ten minutes: 93%.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
Ten minutes.

51
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,360
If I get security's help...

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,400
The rate of alerting him

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
while assisting security: 75%.

54
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,950
(There's no time to call police.)

55
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,920
(If I evacuate and seek help,)

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
(it will alert him.)

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
(Is this a dead end?)

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,280
(What if I ambush him?)

59
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,840
Ambush success rate: 36%.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
(That's the highest rate.)

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,040
(No time to waste.)

62
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,200
(I have to take the risk.)

63
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,240
Bai Wu!

64
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,880
You...

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,280
I...

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,880
I'll go with you.

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,200
I can't let you risk it alone.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Team up with Che Xiaoxiao,

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
ambush success rate: 87%.

70
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,320
(That's so high!)

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,600
In that case,

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,200
let's put on a show.

73
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,320
Alright.

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
How do we act?

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I...

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,360
You jerk! Scoundrel!

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Nothing happened between me and her.

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,720
Who'd believe that?

79
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,240
You didn't come home last night.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,480
You must've stayed with her.

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,260
She drank too much

82
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,880
and I took her home. I can't hail a taxi,

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,860
so I slept on her couch.

84
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,760
Do you dare swear you didn't touch her?

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,680
I...

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,480
You're hesitating.

87
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,800
You dare not swear.

88
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,400
I just helped her take off some clothes.

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,320
What?

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,440
You undressed her?

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,360
What did you take off?

92
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,200
Who did you undress?

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,140
She threw up.

94
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,220
She got it all over herself.

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,440
I had to help her change.

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,360
Did you sleep with her?

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,520
You definitely did.

98
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,080
How could you do this to me?

99
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,780
I'm pregnant with your child.

100
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,220
- But you cheated on me.
- Child...

101
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,040
You're such a jerk.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
What's going on here?

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,240
What are they doing?

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,400
We are saved.

105
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
It's too late.

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,560
Today,

107
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,600
you're all going to die.

108
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,690
It's a bomb!

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,760
Help!

110
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,760
Help!

111
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,120
Password?

112
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,360
What's the password to stop it?

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
Password?

114
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,120
You'll die with me.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
Everyone must die.

116
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,920
Wrong question.

117
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,320
Can't figure out the password.

118
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,400
Say it again.

119
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,040
No time to ask one by one.

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,600
Red, yellow, black,

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
success rates of disarming?

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,520
(Black: 100%; Red: 0%;
Yellow: 0%)

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,800
Sir,

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
here's a lollipop for you.

125
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,080
Thank you. Come on.

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
High five.

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,120
Sensing a lot of energy.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,400
Energy is being collected.

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,720
(That was close.)

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
(I almost die here.)

131
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,080
Bai Wu,

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,520
how did you know that guy had a bomb?

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,480
I calculated it.

134
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
You can calculate that?

135
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
You're amazing!

136
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,640
Not as amazing as you.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You took down the suspect with one move.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
I just learned a few tricks from Grandpa.

139
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Bai Wu,

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
where did you get this jade pendant?

141
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,320
It's from my biological parents.

142
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,880
My grandpa

143
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,100
seems to have one just like it.

144
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
(Could Mr. Che have clues)

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,200
(about my biological parents?)

146
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,760
Xiaoxiao,

147
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,880
I want to ask Mr. Che something.

148
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Can you introduce him to me?

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
No problem.

150
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,280
Meet me at Guyun Pavilion tomorrow.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,850
Alright.

152
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,480
Just a heads up,

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,960
my grandpa's a bit eccentric.

154
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,640
Don't let him scare you.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bai Wu,

156
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
you're a real man.

157
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,440
You're the most manly guy I know.

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
You're my hero.

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Well, thanks.

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,480
Bai Wu,

161
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,880
do you like me?

162
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,640
Well...

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,000
I really like you.

164
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
It's too...

165
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,840
It's moving too fast.

166
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't you like me at all?

167
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
A little bit.

168
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,840
Just a little bit.

169
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,280
I can't, Xiaoxiao.

170
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,240
No, no.

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,040
Do you like me?

172
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,440
Do you like me?

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
- Do you like me?
- Don't move.

174
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,520
What are you doing?

175
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

176
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,680
Why are you so heavy?

177
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,160
Xiaoxiao, too heavy.

178
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,680
Oreo.

179
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
Hello? Miss Di.

180
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,480
I'm ready on Mr. Che.

181
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,600
So fast?

182
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,500
No wonder you're the future grandson-in-law.

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Stop joking.

184
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,060
Alright.

185
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,380
It's your first time to visit him.

186
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,560
You'd better bring a gift.

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,680
I'll prepare a gift.

188
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
What's the budget?

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sky's the limit.

190
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
(Lake City Antique Street)

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
Wu Er,

192
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,920
it's an heirloom treasure.

193
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,120
Do you think an average person

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
can afford this?

195
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,720
Why look down on me?

196
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Go ask about my strength

197
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,200
around the Antique Street.

198
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,720
I'll tell you,

199
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,920
if it's authentic,

200
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,240
I'll surely take it.

201
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,400
Exactly, exactly.

202
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Cao Laowu,

203
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,320
since we're here,

204
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,040
just bring it out

205
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,520
and let Mr. Wang take a closer look.

206
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,600
Mr. Wang, take a look.

207
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,720
(This is truly amazing.)

208
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,840
(Absolutely incredible.)

209
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,440
(Black iron water pattern blade.)

210
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,160
(Seven-colored gems.)

211
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,640
(No doubt, it's Cao Cao's Seven-star Sword.)

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,600
What do you think, Mr. Wang?

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,480
I didn't mislead you, did I?

214
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,400
It's alright.

215
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,020
The quality is pretty average.

216
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,600
But it's well-preserved.

217
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
Let's stick to what was agreed on.

218
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Alright, I'm straightforward too.

219
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,220
We'll go with the earlier deal.

220
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,480
800,000. I'll take it.

221
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,440
No way.

222
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,040
800,000?

223
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,040
At least...

224
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,320
Two million.

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
Why are you raising the price?

226
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
No, no, no.

227
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,120
Cao Laowu,

228
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,360
why are you doing this?

229
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,400
Didn't we agree with Mr. Wang on 800,000?

230
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,040
Why change now?

231
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
I agreed with you,

232
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
not with him.

233
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
Besides,

234
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,800
my grandpa said it's a treasure.

235
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,360
If you hadn't pushed me,

236
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,760
I wouldn't sell it.

237
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,680
You...

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Two million.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,920
Take it or leave it.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,640
1.2 million, no more.

241
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
Mr. Wang, sorry.

242
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,480
He's like that.

243
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,180
(Forget it).

244
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,660
(I'll buy it even if I have to borrow money.)

245
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,000
Two million is fine.

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,120
Cao Laowu,

247
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,720
did you hear Mr. Wang?

248
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,000
Hurry up and bring it out.

249
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,760
Alright.

250
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,720
Scan the code.

251
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,040
Money first, then goods.

252
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,200
Hold on.

253
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
This is trash SSR from a six-yuan top-up.

254
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,800
You can't buy it.

255
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,840
Bai Wu,

256
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
why are you here?

257
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,200
Who are you?

258
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,960
What do you mean?

259
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,680
I mean your Seven-star Sword

260
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
is fake.

261
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Nonsense!

262
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,560
I'm a direct descendant of Cao Cao.

263
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
How could it be fake?

264
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,940
As far as I know,

265
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,680
the legitimate descendants of Cao Cao include

266
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,440
the Cao family from Donggang City, Liaoning,

267
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
the Cao family from Henan Village, Shandong

268
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,600
and the Cao family from Jiangsu.

269
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,120
None of them have the sword, but you do.

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,840
So, which branch of the family are you from?

271
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Can you prove it?

272
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,320
It's none of your business.

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,080
My treasure is authentic. That's enough.

274
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,160
Alright then, since you mention it,

275
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,520
what makes you believe it's authentic?

276
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,440
Take a look.

277
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,740
This water-patterned black iron blade.

278
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,920
And these seven large gemstones.

279
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
Every part is genuine.

280
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
The water-pattern design

281
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,720
is a classic Damascus style.

282
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,050
That blade was introduced to China

283
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,524
only in the 13th century.

284
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,800
How did your ancestors have it

285
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,440
in the late Eastern Han Dynasty?

286
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,400
Speaking of gems,

287
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,120
like pearls, jade, agate,

288
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,460
jasper, amber, and argentum on it,

289
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,200
are likely genuine,

290
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,320
but not very valuable.

291
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,600
Diamonds are intriguing.

292
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,000
What about diamonds?

293
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,520
China was the earliest

294
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,480
to discover and use diamonds,

295
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,040
but this kind of cutting technique

296
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,520
only appeared in the 20th century.

297
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Yet it's on a late Eastern Han blade.

298
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Even Cao Cao would be shocked.

299
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,560
Run!

300
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,920
You two rascals dare trick me.

301
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,480
Don't let me catch you again.

302
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,320
About today's matter,

303
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,320
thank you.

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It was nothing.

305
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,600
Let's work together more in the future.

306
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,320
Forget about working together.

307
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,420
I can't figure you out.

308
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't want you to sell me out someday.

309
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,560
How much could you even be worth?

310
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
But I am someone

311
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
who knows right from wrong.

312
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,800
If you don't mind,

313
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,240
I'll give this to you.

314
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
What's this?

315
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,560
I almost spent all my savings

316
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,960
to get this not long ago.

317
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,080
It's Tang Bohu's A Lady in Spring Mountain.

318
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Thought I could snag a bargain

319
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,280
and flip it for big money.

320
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,520
Turns out Mr. Che has an identical one.

321
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
Mine's definitely a fake.

322
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,800
Unless Mr. Che got it wrong.

323
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,400
I give it to you.

324
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Take it as a decoration.

325
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,940
Out of sight, out of mind.

326
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,010
