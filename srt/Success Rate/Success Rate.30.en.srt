3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,620
Fatty, call the police now!

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,240
If it's you,

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,960
then a lot of things make sense.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,880
Like when Mr. Che investigated Shengong Hall,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,400
why his plans were always preempted.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,300
Or when we infiltrated Minglou

9
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,524
to catch Mr. Xiao,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,960
how Wanbao learned about it so early,

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,160
and destroyed all records

12
00:00:31,184 --> 00:00:32,536
related to Shengong Hall records,

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,200
and let Jin Youlong escape.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,080
Or why you're trying

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,440
to transport the national treasures today.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,760
Wu! Wu!

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,120
I've already called the police.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,600
All key routes are blocked off.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,920
That truck isn't going anywhere.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,760
If it weren't for these facts staring at me,

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,320
I wouldn't dare believe

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Mr. Sun from the Antique Association

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
turns out to be a mole from Shengong Hall.

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,040
Boost Mode activated.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,920
Impressive!

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,940
Wu!

27
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,840
- Wu.
- Bai Wu, are you alright?

28
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,360
The replica jade alone

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,800
can't threaten me.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,440
So you are

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,000
the Hall Lord of Shengong Hall.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,760
I didn't think

33
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,560
I'd end up in the hands of a kid like you.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
You're the one who killed my parents.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,480
So what?

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,680
I will

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,000
make you

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,350
pay with your life.

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,840
- Bai Wu.
- Wu!

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,680
Don't come closer!

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,720
Stop struggling.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,920
I'll set you free.

43
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,680
System, are you done upgrading yet?

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Upgrade progress: 98%.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
(I need to find a way to stall for time.)

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,300
Let me ask you a few questions.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm not obligated to answer.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm in a hurry.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,520
I'll trade for Guifu's secret.

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
Guifu?

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
What secret?

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,440
Upgrade progress: 99%.

53
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,800
Why do you put a QR code

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,200
inside the fakes?

55
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,600
If there's no QR code,

56
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,400
wouldn't it look identical to the original?

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
Idiot.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,600
If all fakes turn into originals,

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,520
then there won't be any true originals left.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,760
The antique business would collapse.

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
How did you manage that?

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,120
Enough.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,120
Wu!

64
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,000
Tell me the secret of Guifu now.

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Otherwise,

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,320
I'll end your life right now.

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,960
Fine, I tell you.

68
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
Upgrade progress: 99%.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
Recently, at Sanxingdui,

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,900
there's a new discovery...

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,520
- Wu!
- Bai Wu!

72
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,960
- Wu.
- Are you okay?

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
- Wu.
- Bai Wu!

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Do you think I'm as dumb as Meng?

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
System,

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,040
how much time is left?

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,120
38.

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,960
37.

79
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,950
36.

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,080
You're stalling for time.

81
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,040
Fatty,

82
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,200
hold him off for 30 seconds.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,720
- Fatty...
- 25.

84
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,560
24.

85
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
- You're too weak.
- 23.

86
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,960
Darn it!

87
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,600
15.

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,600
14.

89
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,600
13.

90
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,680
12.

91
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,800
Bai Wu!

92
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,960
2.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,040
1.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
System upgrade complete.

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
Danger detected.

96
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
Boost Mode activated.

97
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,840
Surrender now.

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
It's over.

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Spare me this time.

100
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll give you the Hetu Ancient Jade.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,320
Once you activate the Hetu Ancient Jade,

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,760
you can combine the two jades

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,840
and rule the world.

104
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
Sorry,

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm not interested in ruling the world.

106
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
Wait!

107
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
You don't understand

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,570
the power of combining two jades together.

109
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,760
It can reverse time and space,

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,920
and bring the dead back to life.

111
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,200
Like your parents.

112
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,800
Host's wish detected.

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,520
Exiting Boost Mode.

114
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,780
Starting combing the two jades.

115
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,120
I knew it.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Everyone

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,240
is greedy.

118
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,640
System?

119
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
System?

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,560
System?

121
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,520
The System is gone now, huh?

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,800
Bai Wu,

123
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,920
let's die together.

124
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,800
Wu!

125
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,600
Fatty!

126
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Fatty!

127
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,960
Fatty.

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,280
Fatty...

129
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
Miss Di...

130
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,280
Wu...

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
I have repaid the life

132
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,840
I owe you.

133
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,800
- No way!
- Fatty...

134
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
No way!

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,520
Fatty...

136
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,480
It hurts...

137
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
a little.

138
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,360
Fatty!

139
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,040
Kid, remember this.

140
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
In the future,

141
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,640
don't let selfish desires

142
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,600
hurt those closest to you.

143
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,040
It was my fault.

144
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,760
I was too greedy.

145
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,920
(Three months later)

146
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,940
(Half-life Hall)
(On the night Fatty sacrificed himself,)

147
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,720
(all national treasures were recovered.)

148
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,330
(Shengong Hall was completely destroyed.)

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
(But after that night,)

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
(the System disappeared.)

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,540
(Thankfully, Qingqing didn't mind me)

152
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,456
(becoming ordinary.)

153
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,940
(She agreed to be my girlfriend.)

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
(Xiaoxiao started helping Mr. Che)

155
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
(manage Guyun Pavilion.)

156
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,920
(Of course, I didn't stay idle.)

157
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,440
(I'm now the owner of Half-life Hall.)

158
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
(Running the shop every day is exhausting.)

159
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,360
Look at you.

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,840
The appraisal fee for auction items

161
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,120
could top Half-life Hall's annual profit.

162
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
Why spend your days here?

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
Why the rush?

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
It just opened.

165
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,840
Take it slow.

166
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,400
Half-life Hall will go public someday.

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,680
Go public?

168
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,520
You're just bragging.

169
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,080
Bai Wu,

170
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
I believe in you.

171
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,940
Seriously?

172
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,520
Who came up with this name?

173
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,400
Half-life Hall.

174
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,530
It's such an awful name.

175
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Yeah, it's awful,

176
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
but,

177
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,120
it's unique.

178
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
Wouldn't you agree?

179
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Yeah, it is unique.

180
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,640
Are you the owner here?

181
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,760
Yes.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
Meeting each other is fate.

183
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,480
Come in and take a look.

184
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,000
(That look,)

185
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,000
(that stance,)

186
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,360
(clearly, he's easy to deceive.)

187
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,830
Sir,

188
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,920
how much is this?

189
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,760
Sir,

190
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,880
how much is this?

191
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Fixed price,

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
10,000.

193
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
(Fatty,)

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,480
(looks like we're)

195
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,680
(giving his first lesson.)

196
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Fixed price,

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,240
10,000.

198
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
10,000?

199
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,520
That's way too expensive!

200
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,320
Expensive? Really?

201
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,320
Red sandalwood

202
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
or golden nanmu,

203
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,280
I only go for small-leaf rosewood.

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
Check out those golden specks on it.

205
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,480
That's top-notch premium quality.

206
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,680
I've stored

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,080
Fatty's body in cold storage.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
My most important mission right now

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is figuring out how to activate the jade

210
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,400
and bring this fatty back to life.

211
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,360
