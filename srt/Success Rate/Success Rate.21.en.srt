00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,440
- This...
- Kid,

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,320
this jade represents my trust in you.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,040
Don't let me down.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,680
Mr. Che, this is too valuable.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,800
I've studied the Hetu Ancient Jade for years,

7
00:00:21,824 --> 00:00:22,816
no progress.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,640
But now it seems

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,440
you're the one destined for it.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
I'm leaving.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,400
Thank you, Mr. Che.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,760
My pleasure.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,440
(This is great!)

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,080
(Maybe there's a new system to unlock.)

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,000
System,

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,040
give me a response. System!

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,560
Knew it wouldn't be that easy.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,300
I should study it carefully.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,320
Hello? Miss Di?

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
Good day, Mr. Bai Wu.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,680
I'm the secretary for Miss Di.

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,220
If there's anything, you can tell me.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
I'll pass it on.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,080
Then please tell her

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,560
how I used to foresee everything perfectly.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,120
So your ability to foresee everything before

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,360
was thanks to the System in this jade.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,880
And now you can't foresee anything,

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,160
because the System is offline, right?

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,960
Exactly.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,600
Your bad luck now

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,520
is also because the System drained your luck?

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
Yes.

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,070
For what I said to you that day,

37
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,900
it wasn't because I feared losing the System,

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
nor because I feared Shengong Hall.

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,300
Then what were you afraid of?

40
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,460
I was...

41
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,820
I was afraid

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,620
there's a mole planted by Shengong Hall.

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,740
But why do you tell me this?

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
You're not afraid I could be the mole?

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,860
You're not.

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,400
Though you are a bit calculating sometimes,

47
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,740
and you've got a bit of a temper,

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,820
you have a heart that's pure and kind.

49
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,220
Plus, you stick to your principles.

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,140
Are you praising me or criticizing me?

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,060
I trust you.

52
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,260
And I only want to trust you.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,260
Is this your way of confessing?

54
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,820
I...

55
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,420
If I confess,

56
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,340
would you say yes?

57
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,110
♪Imagination♪

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,620
Well,

59
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,300
badly, my System is offline right now.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,340
I can't calculate who to suspect,

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,340
or who is the mole.

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,860
I managed to figure out a clue.

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Want to know what it is?

64
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,780
Go ahead.

65
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,700
Minglou.

66
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,820
Under the Mu Family's name,

67
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,356
attend Minglou's underground auction?

68
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,140
That's impossible.

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,140
Minglou is an illegal auction house.

70
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,060
Its auction items have unknown origins.

71
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,540
Our family only deals in legitimate business.

72
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,140
Yi'er...

73
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,400
Qingqing,

74
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
I've told you

75
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,660
that fortune-teller is no good.

76
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
Why won't you listen?

77
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,620
And you

78
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,540
drag Qingqing around all day

79
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,060
and do these improper things.

80
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,820
You've completely misled her.

81
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,860
Don't blame him.

82
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,340
It was all my idea.

83
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,780
Look,

84
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,720
she has already been affected by you.

85
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,580
Yi'er,

86
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,700
Minglou might be Shengong Hall's

87
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,756
last funding source.

88
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,060
You're my best friend.

89
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,740
You're the only one who can help me.

90
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,700
Even if I agree to help,

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,260
Minglou wouldn't invite me to join.

92
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,980
From what I know,

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,620
as long as you get the Jade King,

94
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,820
you can get Minglou's invitation.

95
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,180
The Jade King?

96
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,140
Next week

97
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,820
is the Jade King bidding meeting.

98
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,060
Your family should be attending.

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,300
The meeting happens once every five years.

100
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,980
Sadly, our family

101
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,700
has never won the bid before.

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,420
Didn't you always brag about being capable?

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,820
If you can help my family win the Jade King,

104
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,100
I'll help you join the Minglou auction.

105
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,620
No problem.

106
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,460
Are you sure?

107
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,060
Your System's already offline.

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,060
Relax.

109
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,980
How could a system trouble me?

110
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,540
Talking secrets right in front of me, huh?

111
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,060
How about we go together?

112
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,980
No way.

113
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,900
We must avoid the mole's surveillance.

114
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
We must keep it a secret.

115
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,620
You stay behind and cover for me,

116
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,900
saying I had heart surgery

117
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,980
and need a stent installed;

118
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,380
I'm in the Intensive Care Unit now.

119
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,060
If anyone comes to visit,

120
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,720
don't let them in, no matter what.

121
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,260
Got it.

122
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,100
What's the bidding rule this time?

123
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,900
Blind bid.

124
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,820
Blind bid?

125
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,780
Eight jade stones, three bidding rounds.

126
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,220
In the first round,

127
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,340
bidders can pick any jade stone to price.

128
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,130
In the second round,

129
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,300
each stone's price is based on

130
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,460
the highest bid from the first round.

131
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,100
This becomes the base price for bidding.

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,980
The third round follows the same logic.

133
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,740
The highest bidder wins the stone.

134
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
Isn't that the Jade Teller, Mr. Wei?

135
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,100
The Tian Family actually brought him here.

136
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,180
What terrible luck.

137
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,020
Who's that?

138
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,700
A rival of the Mu Family.

139
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,540
The heir of the Tian Family from Jiang City.

140
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,940
Next to him is Wei Changqing,

141
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,020
an esteemed figure in the jade stone circle.

142
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,700
He's known as the Jade Teller.

143
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Miss Mu,

144
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,590
I haven't seen you in a year.

145
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,580
You've become even more charming.

146
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,700
Mr. Tian, you're still as annoying as ever.

147
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,540
Mr. Wei,

148
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,700
wasn't I right earlier?

149
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,940
Look at her legs. So attractive!

150
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,460
Mr. Tian, have you tried?

151
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,900
Don't say nonsense.

152
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,220
Her lover is right there, you know.

153
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,020
Watch your words, please.

154
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,420
You're asking me to watch my words?

155
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,020
What about when you stole my client?

156
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,220
What do you mean by "stole"?

157
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,660
You didn't handle your business right.

158
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,100
They came to me willingly.

159
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,780
Fine.

160
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
You have big breasts.

161
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,380
Whatever you say goes.

162
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,940
You have a good figure.

163
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,380
It's always fun working with you.

164
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,780
Why do we have

165
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,660
to compare this in this circle?

166
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,660
You...!

167
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,140
Maybe I should have a breast implant.

168
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
What do you think?

169
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,700
That's actually a good idea.

170
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,060
Go for a D size.

171
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,000
You've been suffering it all these years.

172
00:07:29,124 --> 00:07:30,476
Finally, you've figured it out.

173
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,980
Switching tracks could suit you, not bad.

174
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
Wait, who are you?

175
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,940
You're saying nonsense.

176
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,200
Who said I'm suffering it?

177
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,260
No one knows about your impotence, huh?

178
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,100
Oops, my bad. Forget it.

179
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,620
I didn't say a word just now.

180
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,540
Sorry, my apologies.

181
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,420
He actually can't make it.

182
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,820
The Tian family's is powerful.

183
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,456
But he is still not married.

184
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,020
Turns out he has a problem with that.

185
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,100
That's not it!

186
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,460
Don't make things up.

187
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,660
I don't have that disease.

188
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes, stop spreading rumors.

189
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,700
He never went to the city to see a doctor.

190
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,860
No issues in this regard. Stop gossiping.

191
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,700
You shut up!

192
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,660
Just stop it.

193
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
You shut up!

194
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,860
Alright, I'm done.

195
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,660
So Mr. Tian has some issues after all.

196
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,300
He looks so refined and proper.

197
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,620
Who would've guessed?

198
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,740
Don't believe his nonsense, everyone.

199
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,150
Don't say anything more.

200
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,740
Otherwise, your relationship will be exposed.

201
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,740
No wonder he could invite Mr. Wei.

202
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,780
Turns out they...

203
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,900
Oops, I said too much again.

204
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,580
Stop spreading rumors!

205
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,280
They are not that kind of relationship.

206
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,620
Who the heck are you, brat?

207
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,020
This is Hei Wu.

208
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,780
He's the jade stone appraiser I hired.

209
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,740
A jade stone appraiser?

210
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,860
Mu Yi'er,

211
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,460
is your family going under?

212
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Hiring someone like him to appraise stones?

213
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,980
Come on.

214
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,380
Let me introduce someone.

215
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,220
The esteemed expert, Mr. Wei.

216
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,320
I am the Chairman

217
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,616
of Jiang City's Appraisal Association,

218
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,460
professor at Qingshi University's

219
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:01,184
Gem and Jade Research Center,

220
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,260
and Vice Chairman

221
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:04,616
of the National Jade Appraisal Society,

222
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,700
Wei Changqing.

223
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,820
Hei Wu.

224
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,420
Mu Yi'er, do you dare gamble with me?

225
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,800
Let's bet on our families' business

226
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,224
for the next five years.

227
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,780
The loser will quit all competition.

228
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,380
Do you dare?

229
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,060
If not, then get lost!

230
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,620
It's settled then.

231
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,060
Let's go.

232
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,820
Let's move.

233
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,220
You're quite confident.

234
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,300
If you dare lose,

235
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,620
I'll make you suffer it.
