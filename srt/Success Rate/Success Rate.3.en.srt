3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,450
Wow.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,890
This woman is so stunning.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,800
Her long legs are amazing.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,930
What a beauty!

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,840
(So cool.)

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,120
I'll offer 300,000.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,560
Let's make a deal.

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,840
300,000...

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,480
Sorry.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Integrity matters in business.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,440
Before you made your offer,

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
I already closed the deal with Mr. Li.

15
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,840
Young man, you're honest.

16
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,680
Her offer is higher.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
A pearl deserves a beauty, after all.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,760
I won't

19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,670
take what's not mine.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,240
So then...

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,880
Still 150,000.

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,560
You've received 300,000.

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,410
Oh dear.

24
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,020
My 300,000!

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,880
Yi'er.

26
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,920
Have you met your blind date?

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,760
I'm free now and will go to check on you

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,090
to prevent you being tricked.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,080
- (Nowadays,)
- Alright,

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,740
- (girls aren't so easy to fool.)
- see you soon.

31
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,430
(She really got tricked)

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,200
Miss,

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,190
your friend

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,040
seems to have really been tricked.

35
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,160
How do you know Yi'er got tricked?

36
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,840
Believe it or not.

37
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm off.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,960
More than 300,000.

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,920
That loan will be easy to repay.

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Loan repayment chance: 40%.

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,320
(40%?)

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,350
This money is enough to pay it off.

43
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,960
Could it be

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,180
Jin Youlong messed with me again?

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,880
Jin Youlong messed with you.

46
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,770
100%.

47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,680
As long as my family is better than yours

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
and my status is higher,

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,760
I can crush you effortlessly.

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
I have the System on my side.

51
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,350
Let's see who takes down who first!

52
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,250
I hate liars more than anything.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
You have three minutes to convince me.

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
Who said I'm a liar?

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
Two minutes left.

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,120
Come on.

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,520
You wave a steel pipe around? Seriously?

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,680
System, time for work.

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,900
(Name: Di Qingqing; Gender: Female; Age: 26;
Measurements; Relationship history)

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,320
Your name is Di Qingqing.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You're 26 years old.

62
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,120
Born on September 30th, at 3:24 PM.

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,840
Measurements: 91, 65, 92.

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,160
Never been in a relationship.

65
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
You like to sleep naked.

66
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,880
You have a birthmark on your left side.

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Near your left chest...

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,160
You pervert!

69
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,080
You told me to say that.

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,120
So my friend really got tricked?

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,640
Let's go expose him together.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
How's it going?

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
Yi'er.

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Qingqing.

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
This is Mr. Pang?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,720
Who's this?

77
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,480
This is Mr. Bai.

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,720
He's a friend of mine.

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,680
A renowned Feng Shui Master

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
in Jiang City's antique industry.

81
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,480
He's best at reading people.

82
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
I brought him here to help you.

83
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,120
What are you talking about?

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,040
I just wanted you

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
to meet Mr. Pang.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,600
Mr. Pang is a finance PhD who studied abroad.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,540
He's quite impressive.

88
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,520
Just minor achievements.

89
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,660
Nothing worth mentioning.

90
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Look, your makeup is smudged.

91
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,880
Come on, let's go fix it up.

92
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,720
But...

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,000
Master Bai.

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,480
Yeah.

95
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,560
The desperate resort to schemes.

96
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,040
Some people like you

97
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,320
are just greedy.

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
Isn't it all about money?

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,080
Here,

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,920
take the money.

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Get lost.

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
Your flashy tricks

103
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,440
may fool those two girls,

104
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,140
but you don't have the qualifications

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,840
to deceive me.

106
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,120
That's not true.

107
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
First of all,

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,280
I'm not a liar.

109
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
Secondly,

110
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,380
the title "Master Bai"

111
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
is Miss Qingqing's playful nickname.

112
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,720
I've never called myself that.

113
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,280
Thirdly,

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,680
your surname is not Pang.

115
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,360
Of course,

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,360
you're not some elite overseas PhD either.

117
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,440
Your education level...

118
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,040
You barely made it to elementary school.

119
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,950
Oh.

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,540
You didn't even finish elementary school.

121
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,440
You...

122
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,480
The Mu family is renowned in Jiang City.

123
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,960
You are scheming to approach Miss Mu,

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,680
merely to deceive her for money and love.

125
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
How could you...

126
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
Hmph.

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Now I understand.

128
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,160
You're trying to trick me into talking.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
This is all nonsense.

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,240
Who would believe that?

131
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,680
How about

132
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,760
I recite your ID number for you?

133
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,000
2 9 0

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
3

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,250
2

136
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,120
0

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,720
1 9 9 9

138
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,440
0 2 2 9

139
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,320
7 6 2 1.

140
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,280
Enough!

141
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
Am I

142
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,160
right?

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,760
Master Bai,

144
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
you truly are a Master.

145
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,960
I am impressed.

146
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,400
But this matter...

147
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,400
I hope you'll let it slide.

148
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
Do not expose me.

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,840
After I win over Mu Yi'er,

150
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,480
you'll be generously rewarded.

151
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
Generously rewarded?

152
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,120
How?

153
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,280
You saw her yourself.

154
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,520
Mu Yi'er...

155
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
What a figure.

156
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,840
Once I win her over,

157
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
I'll let you experience

158
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,200
the charm of a wealthy heiress.

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
Yi'er!

160
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,040
You scum!

161
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Listen to me, I can explain!

162
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,600
Get out now.

163
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Or are you waiting for the police?

164
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
(Bai Wu)

165
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,920
(Di Qingqing)

166
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,960
I get it now.

167
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,520
You set me up, didn't you?

168
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Just wait and see.

169
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,680
Thanks.

170
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,200
No need to be polite.

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,000
This is...

172
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,220
This is an invitation.

173
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,240
(Wanbao Charity Auction)

174
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
I'd like to invite you to the charity auction

175
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
held by Wanbao Chamber of Commerce
in three days.

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,820
Wanbao Chamber of Commerce?

177
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Who's hosting it?

178
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,880
The chairman's son from the Chamber.

179
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
His name is Jin something.

180
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Jin Youlong.

181
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,800
Do you know him?

182
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,880
An old friend.

183
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,640
I'm leaving.

184
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,080
(Jin Youlong,)

185
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,600
(I really didn't expect the chance)

186
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,200
(to deal with you would come so soon.)

187
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,520
Help me look into someone.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,040
His name is Bai Wu.

189
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,420
Why are you looking into him?

190
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
I have a feeling.

191
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,920
It won't be long

192
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,760
before he's famous in Jiang City.

193
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, it's you, Mr. Kun.

194
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,720
What's the matter?

195
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,140
Need me to clean up your mess again?

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,440
Mr. Jin...

197
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,880
The Feng Shui Master of the Antique Industry?

198
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,400
I never heard of him.

199
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Who?

200
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,760
Bai Wu.

201
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,300
(Di Qingqing)
Help me buy an auction item for charity.

202
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,990
It should represent the Di family's status,

203
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,920
but not be too flashy.

204
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,280
No refunds or extra charges.

205
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,100
She knows how to delegate tasks.

206
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,480
System,

207
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,040
what's the chance of solving the loan
with 450,000?

208
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,280
26%.

209
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,440
Why does the probability drop?

210
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,120
What trick is Jin Youlong using now?

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,840
Forget it.

212
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,920
Instead of being on the defense,

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,400
why not take the initiative?

214
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,640
At the charity auction,

215
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,790
just wait and see how I deal with him.

216
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,640
(You've received 150,000 yuan.)

217
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,040
50,000 is used for buying an item.

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,080
The other 100,000 is mine.

219
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Oreo.

220
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
Oreo.

221
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
Oreo.

222
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,110
