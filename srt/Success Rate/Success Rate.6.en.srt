2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,720
That was close.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,280
Luckily, I have the iron plate.

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,480
Or I would be killed by Fatty.

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
How could you think of such a bad idea?

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
It's a bit underhanded.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,600
But at least we survived.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,840
What part is actually true?

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,200
The Xuande Incense Burner is pricey.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
But it's only worth 600,000.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
Everything else is fake.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
You liar!

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,240
You're truly a liar!

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,320
Liar!

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,280
Alright, alright.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
I'll make it up to you.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,320
We'll split the money.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
Deal.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,680
Half each.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,300
(Pay back in three days or you're dead.)

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,140
(Shadow Loan Co.)

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
(Pay the money or die.)

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,500
(Pay back in three days or you're dead.)

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,780
(Tribute)

25
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,660
(Pay the money or die.)

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,120
Shadow Loan Co...

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
System,

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
how much do I still owe?

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,800
Cash balance: 600,000.

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,150
Debt resolution chance: 12%.

31
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Xiaoxiao,

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,800
sorry, I missed your call due to an issue.

33
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,240
What happened?

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,960
It's a long story.

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,680
I need to find a new place to stay now.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,080
Find a place?

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,520
Bai Wu,

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,880
how about staying at my place?

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,800
Don't move.

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,200
Stay back.

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Lift your leg up.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,560
That way it gets clean.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,140
Don't move. Don't touch!

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Yes, wash here.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
No, stop.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
Oreo,

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
why are you so dirty?

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,480
It got chased into a pond by a cat at noon.

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
Bai Wu, I'm going to shower first.

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
Please take care of Oreo.

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,240
Sure.

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,600
Let's go, let's go.

53
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
Thanks, Bai Wu.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,080
I need to help at Guyun Pavilion.

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,480
I was worried about Oreo.

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,680
Bai Wu, you moving in helps a lot.

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,080
You've helped me a lot too.

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,920
Your grandpa is Mr. Che of Guyun Pavilion,

59
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,240
a master in the antique industry,

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,960
and the best expert in appraising treasures?

61
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,920
That's right.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
You know my grandpa?

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
Who doesn't know Mr. Che in this circle?

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,320
Then I'll leave Oreo to you, Bai Wu.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,680
Be good.

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,400
Xiaoxiao,

67
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,960
why did you come back?

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,880
This is not right, huh?

69
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,590
Xiaoxiao, what are you doing?

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Why are you licking me, Xiaoxiao?

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
Stop licking! Xiaoxiao, hold on.

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,320
Xiaoxiao!

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,880
Oreo, get down.

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,440
I'd better sleep on the couch later.

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
The bed smells entirely like Xiaoxiao,

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,980
making me have such a strange dream.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,860
How's the preparation for the auction?

78
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,920
This is our family's first public appearance.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,520
Make sure the auction item is ready soon.

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,280
Xuande Incense Burner?

81
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,380
It's a Qing-style replica

82
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,640
made by Gao Yunqi.

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
You bought it with 150,000?

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
30,000.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
30,000?

86
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
You calculated this too, right?

87
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Yeah, I did.

88
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,960
Bai Wu,

89
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,680
do you know why I invited you

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,760
to the Wanbao Charity Auction?

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
Why?

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
The Di Group plans to return to the country.

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,320
We need a local partner in Jiang City.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,080
I'm considering Wanbao Chamber of Commerce.

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,360
I need you to evaluate the pros and cons.

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
That's easy.

97
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,760
You don't already have an answer, do you?

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,480
I do, actually.

99
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,560
But I need proof to make you believe me.

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,920
At the auction day,

101
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,380
I'll give you the evidence.

102
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
So mysterious.

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,740
(Wanbao Charity Auction)

104
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes.

105
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,920
Alright.

106
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,200
Yes.

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,320
Okay.

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,520
Mr. Jin, I...

109
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,200
Don't worry.

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
I may lack some skills,

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,120
but I'm great at charming women.

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,250
Don't underestimate her.

113
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,340
Di Qingqing is no ordinary woman.

114
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,670
This time, success is the only option,

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,880
failure is not allowed.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
Understood.

117
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,560
I heard that this charity auction has invited

118
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,040
Di Qingqing, the eldest daughter

119
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
of the new richest family, the Di Family.

120
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,780
The Di Family's wealth is beyond imagination.

121
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,680
And it has a global network of connections.

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,920
Even though Di Qingqing is a woman,

123
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,520
she holds real power in the Di Family.

124
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,440
Rumor has it Miss Di is still single.

125
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
Judging by this setup,

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,080
Mr. Jin is planning to marry Miss Di.

127
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,040
Thanks for the good wishes.

128
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,080
I'll aim for success in both career and love.

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Cheers!

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
Bai Wu,

131
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,760
it's not a place

132
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,480
where people like you can enter.

133
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,960
What are you doing?

134
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,240
Letting anyone in?

135
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,160
Why can't I enter?

136
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,520
This is Wanbao Charity Auction.

137
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,040
This thing

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,840
is called an invitation.

139
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,920
An invitation, huh?

140
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
This one, right?

141
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,480
This...

142
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,320
This... Wait!

143
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,760
I know.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,080
You're just trying to freeload, aren't you?

145
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
A,

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,440
I remember

147
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,480
we reserve an area

148
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,520
for the guests' pets.

149
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,840
Get Bai Wu a chair.

150
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Let him sit over there.

151
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
This time,

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,520
make sure you eat and drink well.

153
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,640
Because you've never been

154
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,680
in such a grand event.

155
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
What's all the noise about?

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Wang Xu,

157
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,760
didn't I say a VIP is coming today?

158
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
If you ruin it,

159
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,380
I'll make you pay for this!

160
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,320
Mr. Jin, it's Bai Wu.

161
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,760
This guy can't even make 3,000 yuan,

162
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,080
yet wants to join our Charity Auction.

163
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,360
Mr. Wang,

164
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
you're being a bit harsh.

165
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
People from the lower class

166
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,040
are quite pitiful.

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,990
It's just the common struggle of the poor,

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,040
holding onto pride despite their situation.

169
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,240
All for a shred

170
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,480
of self-esteem.

171
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Self-esteem.

172
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Are you done talking?

173
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,260
If you're done, I'm heading inside.

174
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,440
If I weren't waiting for Miss Di today,

175
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,520
I'd make you pay for this.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,680
Get lost.

177
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
Security! Security!

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Let me go!

179
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Miss Qingqing,

180
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,720
I've been waiting for you.

181
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Miss Qingqing,

182
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,920
he's just here to cause trouble.

183
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,240
I'll get rid of him right away.

184
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,480
Take him away.

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,320
How dare you!

186
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,640
How dare you treat my guest disrespectfully?

187
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,080
May I ask who your guest is?

188
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm sorry, Master Bai.

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
Sorry for the scare.

190
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,280
Master Bai?

191
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,880
Guest?

192
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
Is this how Wanbao treats guests?

193
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,440
Or do you just look down

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
on the Di Group?

195
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,360
You're good for nothing!

196
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,680
How dare you neglect Miss Di's guest!

197
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,760
What are you doing?

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
Mr. Jin, didn't you say...

199
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,920
Say!

200
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,420
It's me. It's all my fault.

201
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,140
Miss Di, please don't be upset.

202
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,020
It's all my fault.

203
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,660
You don't need to apologize.

204
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,740
Yes, yes.

205
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,340
Master Bai, please forgive me.

206
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,250
It's all my fault.

207
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,860
Don't hold it against me.

208
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
So then,

209
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
can I come in?

210
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,900
Of course.

211
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,140
Please, come in.

212
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,390
Miss Qingqing.

213
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,770
Who is that?

214
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,260
No idea, never seen him before.

215
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Could he be Miss Di...?

216
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,060
Don't jump to conclusions.

217
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,250
Welcome to the Wanbao Chamber's

218
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,740
Charity Auction.

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,800
The first item up for bid.

220
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,860
Let's warm up first.

221
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,540
This painting is by young artist Wang Fu,

222
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,380
Spring Mountain.

223
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,100
Starting bid is 50,000.

224
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,660
Each increase must be at least 10,000.

225
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,940
I bid 60,000.

226
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980
80,000.

227
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,100
100,000.

228
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,180
200.

229
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,260
Does he know the rules?

230
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,000
Look at his clothes. He must have sneaked in.

231
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,080
Sorry, sir.

232
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,940
Our minimum bid is...

233
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,780
10,000.

234
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,220
I bid two million.

235
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,660
Two million?

236
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
Sold.

237
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,860
Thank Miss Di Qingqing and Mr. Bai Wu

238
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,660
for kicking off this charity auction.

239
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,460
Next, we invite Miss Di Qingqing

240
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,540
or Mr. Bai Wu to the stage.

241
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,820
Let's give a round of applause.

242
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,300
Toy boy.

243
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,900
Thank you, everyone.

244
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,100
And thank Miss Qingqing

245
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,520
for letting me speak on her behalf.

246
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,460
The Wanbao Charity Auction went very well.

247
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,260
However, I hope

248
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,860
the Chamber will improve

249
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
in preserving antiques.

250
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,900
What does he mean?

251
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,460
Is the Chamber unprofessional?

252
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,260
Mr. Bai, what do you mean?

253
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,460
First,

254
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,260
there's dust on the scroll.

255
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,120
It shows it hasn't been cleaned regularly.

256
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,380
Second,

257
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,970
when the painting was unrolled,

258
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,660
no scent of camphor or insect repellent.

259
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,260
Luckily, it hasn't been infested.

260
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,520
That is a real stroke of luck.

261
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,640
Finally,

262
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,900
this painting is damp.

263
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,340
If it is left a few more days here,

264
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,460
it might turn into a Spring Rain painting.

265
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,220
Wanbao really embarrassed itself this time.

266
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Today,

267
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,060
Miss Di Qingqing

268
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,060
donated two million in charity,

269
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,860
and saved a precious artwork,

270
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,860
thanks to your support.

271
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,540
Thank you.

272
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,060
Thank Mr. Bai for his wonderful speech.

273
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,730
- Next, let's continue.
- Didn't expect you're an expert.

274
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,690
- I thought you only calculate.
- Look at the second item.

275
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,540
I'm just showing off

276
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,020
to warm up for Xuande Incense Burner.

277
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,700
Next is the auction item of Miss Di Qingqing

278
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,590
and Mr. Bai Wu.

279
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,900
