2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,820
Why are you standing there?

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,680
Quick, catch him!

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,280
Fatty, Qingqing,

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
find the QR code!

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,360
Bai Wu!

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,750
Miss Di,

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,120
you think all this is fake, right?

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,960
If this is authentic,

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,720
I couldn't afford it even if I sold myself.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,760
If these are treasures,

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
paying money can not fix it.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,880
We can only trust Bai Wu now.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,820
Come on, search!

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,800
Fakes!

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,920
These are all fakes!

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,080
Fakes?

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,240
How could that be?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Bai Wu,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,320
where's the proof?

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,560
Spent 20 million on antiques

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,880
just to smash it.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,500
I've been watching your move

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,120
closely.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,000
How can you possibly fight me?

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,350
I'll show you I can win today.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,920
QR code.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,670
I found the QR code.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,000
I found the QR code too.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,240
They really are all fakes.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
- All fakes!
- No way.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
We've been exposed.

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,060
This can't be happening.

34
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:34,830
The location

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,080
was decided at the last moment.

36
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,720
When dealing with Bai Wu,

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,520
nothing is impossible.

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Everyone, listen to me,

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,240
you've been deceived.

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,720
These are all fakes.

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,680
Just smash it, you'll know.

42
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,880
Trust me.

43
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,830
Just smash it!

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
If I'm wrong, I'll pay.

45
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,160
Wu!

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,820
Master?

47
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
This is the master who calculated

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,360
the house demolition payment.

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,320
If he says so, it must be true.

50
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,280
I trust him. Smash it.

51
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Smash it.

52
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,000
Pay us!

53
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,560
There's really a QR code.

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,760
Turns out it's a fake.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Minglou, pay us.

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,350
Minglou, pay us.

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,210
Pay us!

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,110
Pay us!

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,690
Pay us!

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
Master, you should leave first.

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,400
We'll cover the rear.

62
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,840
Bai Wu!

63
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,230
Bai Wu, are you alright?

64
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm fine.

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
Smashed fakes worth billions.

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,590
Feels great!

67
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,680
Wu, we should get moving.

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
I was so scared.

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,020
Nothing to be scared of.

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,480
They are the ones who should escape.

71
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh no, they really ran!

72
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,380
The entrance is over there!

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,840
You're not getting away.

74
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
The police will be here soon.

75
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,920
You've recovered long ago.

76
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,040
You've been acting all along.

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
If I were still in the hospital,

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,720
your hitmen would've already

79
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,880
killed me by now.

80
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,800
Seems nothing escapes you.

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Turn yourself in.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,960
Master,

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
no,

84
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Mr. Xiao.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
When did you realize

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm the Master?

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Tonight.

88
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,080
Yesterday, I had the hospital inform everyone

89
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,720
that I moved to a private hospital room.

90
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,290
But I told you all

91
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,560
different

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,960
room numbers.

93
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,740
(Fatty: I moved to room 108.)

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
(Bai Wu: I moved to room 1030.)

95
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,990
(Bai Wu: Mr. Sun, I moved to room 1125.)

96
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,700
(Bai Wu: Mr. Xiao, I moved to room 1026.)

97
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't move!

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,300
(Di Qingqing: We caught the killer.)

99
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,800
You're the mole from Shengong Hall.

100
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,880
I knew

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
I'd be beaten by you

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,160
someday.

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,640
I just didn't expect

104
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,720
that day to come so soon.

105
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,080
I just can't understand.

106
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,450
You're both Mr. Che's son-in-law

107
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,560
and Xiaoxiao's family,

108
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,840
while running Guyun Pavilion.

109
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Why do you collude with Shengong Hall?

110
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Everything I've done

111
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,040
is to save Yu,

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
my wife.

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
When Shengong Hall approached me,

114
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
their offer

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,400
is to help Yu wake up.

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
Even the doctors couldn't do that,

117
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,880
why would you believe them?

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,200
The doctors had already given up.

119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,400
If it were not for Hetu Ancient Jade

120
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,720
of the Hall Lord,

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,960
Yu

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,200
has been gone for a long time.

123
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Does the Hall Lord possess

124
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,340
the power of the Hetu Ancient Jade?

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Yes,

126
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,730
just like the power

127
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,300
you once had before.

128
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Before?

129
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
You all know my power has vanished?

130
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,000
I can't share more than that.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Bai Wu,

132
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,800
do you think

133
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
you alone

134
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,880
can defeat Shengong Hall?

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
I can.

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,240
I absolutely can.

137
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,600
Alright.

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Very well.

139
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,560
If

140
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,720
you can regain the power

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
of Hetu Ancient Jade,

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,640
please save Yu for me.

143
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
But...

144
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,360
I don't even know

145
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,600
how to use that power...

146
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,430
- Wu, watch out!
- Bai Wu!

147
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Promise me.

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
Promise me.

149
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,840
Alright.

150
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
I promise you.

151
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,640
Good.

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,200
Yu,

153
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,440
I...

154
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,520
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Mr. Xiao!

156
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Uncle!

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
Xiaoxiao!

158
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,480
Uncle...

159
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Uncle...

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
He only did it

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
for saving his wife.

162
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,060
What's wrong with that?

163
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,980
What did he do wrong?

164
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
We...

165
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,560
we don't know...

166
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,440
You don't know!

167
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,480
You don't know anything.

168
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,520
I've never had a father since I was a kid.

169
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
Grandpa was always busy.

170
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
My uncle raised me single-handedly.

171
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,680
He's the closest family I have.

172
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,800
He's like my father.

173
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
I already lost my father,

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,640
and now I've lost my uncle too.

175
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
- Xiaoxiao...
- Shut up!

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,840
It's all your fault!

177
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,090
It's all your fault!

178
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
You drove him to his death!

179
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
He didn't even harm you.

180
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
I wish I'd never met any of you.

181
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,360
You're all terrible people.

182
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Xiaoxiao!

183
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
Don't go. Wait here for the police.

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,640
Wu,

185
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,620
the Wanbao Chamber

186
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
has been sealed by the police.

187
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
They found evidence in Xiao Ze's computer

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
tied to Wanbao Chamber and Minglou

189
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
and also Shadow Loan Co.

190
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,880
This time, they can't escape.

191
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
It's a shame

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
that the police couldn't find

193
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,830
any clues about Shengong Hall.

194
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,440
Shengong Hall is well-hidden.

195
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,850
What about Jin Youlong?

196
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,300
Even the best plans fail.

197
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,680
Jin Youlong

198
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,520
managed to slip away.

199
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,910
Jin Youlong...

200
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,120
Xiaoxiao!

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,200
Xiaoxiao!

202
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Xiaoxiao?

203
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
Xiaoxiao.

204
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,840
Xiaoxiao, are you alright?

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,840
Go!

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Hurry up!

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
Don't move.

208
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,740
(Xiaoxiao)

209
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,600
It's Xiaoxiao.

210
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,100
Xiaoxiao, where are you?

211
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,610
Xiaoxiao!

212
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,520
Bai Wu,

213
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
guess who I am.

214
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
Jin Youlong.

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,280
You still care about me, huh?

216
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,160
Figured it out instantly.

217
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
What did you do to Xiaoxiao?

218
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,200
Don't just worry about Che Xiaoxiao.

219
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,680
Your lover's with me too.

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,840
Qingqing!

221
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Here.

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,760
Talk to Bai Wu.

223
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,960
Bai Wu, call the police!

224
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,310
Qingqing...

225
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,480
Jin Youlong!

226
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,520
If you dare harm them,

227
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,760
I will never let you go.

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,080
Brat,

229
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,920
watch your tone.

230
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,680
If you don't want them dead,

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
meet me in an hour.

232
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
I've sent you the location.

233
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,400
If you dare call the police,

234
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,900
get ready to collect their bodies.

235
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,040
