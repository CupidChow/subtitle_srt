2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,240
The first round of blind bid

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,440
is now beginning.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,720
The old rules apply.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,000
Dear guests,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,720
please choose the Jade King

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,430
you like

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,600
from the eight raw stones on our stage.

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,600
Please write down the number

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,400
of your preferred raw stone on the bid.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
For the guests who choose the same stone,

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
the highest bidder wins.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,320
What's your strategy here?

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,880
I've calculated thoroughly.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,320
The Tian family's budget

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,760
is roughly 1.2 billion.

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,080
But we only have 600 million.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,520
So I devised two strategies.

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,920
Strategy one:

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,800
to bid on just one stone.

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,040
We place the highest bid

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,160
and we're sure to win.

23
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,670
(Jade stone No. 1)
But the odds of it being the Jade King

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,010
are only 12%.

25
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,640
Strategy two,

26
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,280
to bid on two stones.

27
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,480
Then the chance of getting the Jade King

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,720
can rise to 25%.

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,480
But if we bid on two stone

30
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,720
and fail,

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,390
the success rate drops to zero.

32
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,920
What do you think?

33
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,000
I choose strategy three.

34
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,600
(Jade Stone Meeting-Round One)
Mr. Wei,

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
are we really bidding

36
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,400
on these three stones?

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
Don't worry.

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,800
The Jade King

39
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,600
is definitely among these three stones.

40
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
Alright, I'll trust you.

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
The round one is now closed.

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,380
(Congrats! You bid the highest
on jade stones No. 1, 3, and 8!)

43
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,280
Nice!

44
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,400
Congrats, Mr. Tian.

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,840
The pleasure is mutual.

46
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Now let's begin the second round.

47
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,880
This round also has a 5-minute time limit.

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,820
(Jade stone No. 5)

49
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,380
(Jade stone No. 2)

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,840
Should we raise our bid this round?

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
No rush.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,120
We'll hold back for this round.

53
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
But the Mu Family...

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
No need to worry.

55
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,560
With the Mu Family's financial capacity,

56
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
they can only bid

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,760
on two raw stones at most.

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,240
It seems

59
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,920
they already failed in the first round.

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,040
In the second round,

61
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,120
she'll have to go all-in

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,920
and bid on just one raw stone.

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
In this case,

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,320
their target jade stone

65
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,400
will be exposed early.

66
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
Thank you all.

67
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
The second round has ended.

68
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,360
(Congrats! You bid the highest
on jade stones No. 1, and 3!)

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
They chose No. 8.

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Excellent.

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,160
No. 1 and No 3

72
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
are now ours.

73
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,680
The third round begins now.

74
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,240
You have ten minutes.

75
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,440
In this round, we increase our bid

76
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,840
on No. 8.

77
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Let's do it.

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,280
You stubborn girl,

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,600
I'll win against you this time!

80
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,960
Bai Wu,

81
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,520
are you sure your strategy is solid?

82
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,320
Shall we play a game?

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
You toss, I guess.

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,840
100 yuan once.

85
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,320
Is it really the time for this?

86
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,240
Come on, let's play.

87
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,380
Anyway, we're just waiting.

88
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,160
Come on.

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,400
Flowers.

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,640
Again.

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Characters.

92
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,440
Flowers.

93
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
Try again.

94
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Flowers.

95
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
Characters.

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
Characters.

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,960
Flowers.

98
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
Flowers.

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
Nine losses in a row.

100
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,040
Buddy, your luck

101
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,520
is so terrible.

102
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,640
Alright then.

103
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,580
This is the last time.

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,880
I bet it's either flowers or characters.

105
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,200
Either flowers or characters?

106
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,000
What else could it be?

107
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,000
Come on.

108
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
You just asked me earlier

109
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,400
if there's an issue with my strategy.

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Yeah.

111
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
You've seen how bad my luck is, right?

112
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
Then there's no problem.

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,960
The third round is over.

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,080
Please collect the final results.

115
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
(Sorry, your bids were outmatched.)

116
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,160
How is that possible?

117
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Who bid higher than me?

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,640
Congratulations to Wu's Alliance

119
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,120
for winning stones No. 1, 2,

120
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,280
3, 4, 5,

121
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,440
7 and 8.

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,280
Congrats to the winning guest,

123
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,520
Miss Mu Yi'er,

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
for winning bids on jade stone No. 5 and 6.

125
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,880
We won.

126
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,520
Wu's Alliance?

127
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,080
This brat

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,600
teamed up with others.

129
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
What on earth?

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
Simply put,

131
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,360
I teamed with the jade traders here

132
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,700
and created six bidding groups.

133
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,540
This is outright cheating!

134
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,990
Her qualification should be canceled.

135
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,360
The event never stated

136
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,040
joint bidding wasn't allowed.

137
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Mr. Tian,

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,440
do you still remember our wager?

139
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,640
I made the bet with Miss Mu Yi'er,

140
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,160
but she didn't win the Jade King.

141
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,360
Knew you'd say that.

142
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
The blind bidding rounds

143
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,440
have now concluded.

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Next, we will enter

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,840
the most popular part of the event,

146
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,750
which is stone cutting.

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,200
Everyone, please go

148
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,360
to the stone cutting area.

149
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,120
That's strange.

150
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,680
If the alliance is already formed,

151
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
why did the Mu Family

152
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,480
bid on No. 5 and 6

153
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,360
separately?

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,220
Let's go check it out.

155
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,260
(Jade stone No. 1)

156
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,160
Now,

157
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,560
let's witness together

158
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,480
the birth of the new Jade King.

159
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,400
The color of No. is stunning.

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
Badly, there's a crack in the middle.

161
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,680
Otherwise, it would surely be the Jade King.

162
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Such a shame.

163
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,520
No. 3 has a large jade area.

164
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,680
But it has too many cracks.

165
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

166
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,000
No. 8 looks the best.

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,840
Its color is even and texture clear.

168
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,120
Definitely top-grade icy jade.

169
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,600
Looks like No. 8

170
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,800
will be this year's Jade King.

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
We're so close.

172
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,880
Don't be upset, Mr. Tian.

173
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,840
We may not have won this young girl.

174
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,680
But she spent 600 million

175
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,520
to buy No. 5 and 6.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,240
She'll definitely lose out.

177
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,840
Don't jinx it.

178
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
I haven't even opened them yet.

179
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Even outsiders can tell.

180
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,960
These two raw stones are quite large,

181
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,280
but only have one serpent belt.

182
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,840
The others are just marginal green.

183
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,600
They're the worst

184
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,880
among these eight raw stones.

185
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,840
So you're saying

186
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,760
her money is completely wasted?

187
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Not exactly.

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Let me calculate.

189
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,080
In the end,

190
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,920
she might recover this amount.

191
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
Ten million?

192
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,360
100,000.

193
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,360
100,000?!

194
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
Spending 600 million

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,560
to buy two stones worth only 100,000?

196
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,000
Mu Yi'er,

197
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
your family is done for.

198
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
You...!

199
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,000
The results aren't out yet.

200
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,480
Isn't it too soon to conclude?

201
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,840
Exactly.

202
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,120
Do you think my title Jade Teller

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,360
is merely a false reputation?

204
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,360
I've calculated that these two raw stones

205
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,450
are bound to fail.

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880
Even the gods can't predict jade perfectly.

207
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
What if you're wrong?

208
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,040
I can't be wrong.

209
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
But what if you are?

210
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,000
If these two raw stones

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,480
can be the Jade King,

212
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,040
I'll give the title

213
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
to you.

214
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,040
And I'll leave the jade circle for good.

215
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Right.

216
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,370
If either of them could be the Jade King,

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,760
my family will withdraw from all competition.

218
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,600
Agreed.

219
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,600
It's a deal.

220
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
The final two jade stones of this event

221
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
have been fully cut.

222
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,050
