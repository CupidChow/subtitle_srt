Next,

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,900
=Episode 7=
the auction item I brought is...

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,630
What's this?

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,700
Toilet tissue?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,800
Mr. Jin...

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,400
Is the Di Group

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,840
kidding us?

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,320
(You dare offend me,)

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,040
(and I'll make you pay.)

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,920
Go to the vault,

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,600
and switch his auction item.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,600
Mr. Jin.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,880
Mr. Bai Wu,

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,920
are you trying to lighten the mood?

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,280
Lighten what mood?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,160
He obviously disrespects the Chamber,

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,720
and everyone here.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Yeah.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,280
If it's a joke, it's too much.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,000
What kind of occasion is this?

21
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,360
Exactly.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,520
He's so disrespectful to us.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,440
The Di Group is so rude.

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880
This roll of toilet tissue

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,600
is indeed my auction item.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,120
What does he mean?

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,440
However,

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,120
it's not just ordinary tissue.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Inside it,

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,080
there is a secret hidden.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,680
A big secret.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,530
(Mr. Jin, you're quite the player.)

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
(If your father)

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,640
(knew you were with his mistress,)

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
(would he break your leg?)

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,080
Wu, I...

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,160
I know.

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,480
It's not your fault.

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,440
(File folder)
Now you have a choice.

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,720
Here's 100,000.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,000
Take it to treat your mom.

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,800
Help me with something.

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,680
What can I do?

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,680
Jin Youlong

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
will definitely mess with me.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,160
Take something out of the safe
to take photos.

47
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,040
But I don't know the password.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,760
Don't worry.

49
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
It's not difficult.

50
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,320
I thought we can find something useful,

51
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
but found this instead.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,990
The starting bid for this toilet tissue

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,390
with a USB drive is 500,000.

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,430
Each bid up by at least 100,000.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,040
- What's on this drive?
- No clue.

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
Probably business secrets.

57
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,600
Mr. Jin,

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,800
this can't fall into the hands

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
of the Di Family or your father.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,040
I understand.

61
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
500,000.

62
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
600,000.

63
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,360
Mr. Jin is in too.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,480
One million.

65
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
1.1 million.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,260
There must be something great!

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,880
1.2 million.

68
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,740
1.4 million.

69
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,600
1.5 million.

70
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,520
2.1 million.

71
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
2.5 million.

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,600
Sold! 2.5 million.

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,040
Thank Mr. Jin Youlong

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,680
for donating 2.5 million.

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,000
Congratulations!

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,320
2.5 million

77
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,520
for a roll of toilet tissue.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,020
You really went all out.

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,760
If you don't solve the Shadow Loan today,

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,370
I'll make everyone in Jiang City

81
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,520
know about it.

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
Let's thank Mr. Jin Youlong

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,880

what's the next step?

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
Inform Shadow Loan Co.

89
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,080
to cancel Bai Wu's debt.

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,240

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,680

You can easily crush ants.

97

But for me,

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,040
shaking the tree as an ant

99

just wait and see.

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Mr. Bai,

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,680
why are you so interested in antiques?

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm an orphan.

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
I was adopted as a child.

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
This is the only thing

109
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
my parents left me.

110
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,120
Hetian Jade?

111
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,960
So you want to use it as a clue

112
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,160
to find your parents in the antique circle?

113
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,280
Where did you learn

114
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,240
to plan so flawlessly?

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,560
It's a secret

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
I can't reveal.

117
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,200
Alright.

118
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't like hearing lies anyway.

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,360
If you want to talk one day,

120
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,720
remember to tell the truth.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,120
As for today's matter,

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,480
I'm really grateful to you.

123
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,320
How about I repay you somehow?

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,760
Like...

125
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,280
Like what?

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,400
Like having tea.

127
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,040
Do you prefer black or green tea?

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
Why?

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,720
Are you disappointed?

130
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,160
What did you expect?

131
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
No, not at all.

132
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,760
Alright, back to business.

133
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
Mr. Che from Guyun Pavilion.

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,360
Have you heard of him?

135
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
Of course, I have.

136
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,960
He's a legend in Jiang City's antique circle.

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,160
I want to hire him

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
as my chief consultant.

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
But I've also heard

140
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,320
Mr. Che has quite an eccentric temper.

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,080
He rarely hosts guests.

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,200
I'm quite close with his granddaughter.

143
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Maybe I can introduce you.

144
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,080
Quite close?

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
How close?

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,720
Due to some reasons,

147
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,040
we're temporarily living together.

148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,880
Mr. Bai, you sure have skills.

149
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,200
Living with Mr. Che's granddaughter

150
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,060
means you've

151
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,280
secured all Guyun Pavilion's resources.

152
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,880
Living together? No.

153
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,440
We're just friends.

154
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,880
Hall Lord,

155
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,400
there's a problem.

156
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,640
Wanbao's partnership with the Di Family

157
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,440
might fall through.

158
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,680
What happened?

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,440
At the auction,

160
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,780
someone intentionally disrupted it

161
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,960
and slandered the Chamber.

162
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,320
At the auction next month,

163
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,370
no mistake is allowed.

164
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,480

165
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,400
(I'll get my chance)

166
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,560
(to replace you.)

167
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,520
Please handle Mr. Che's matter.

168
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll prepare a thank-you gift.

169
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,640
Looking forward to good news.

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,800
(I need to find a new place soon.)

173
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,560
Look at this house.

174

Bai Wu.

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,280
Xiaoxiao.

176
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,800
What are you doing here?

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm here to see a house.

178
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
What about you?

179
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
My friend works here.

180
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,480
I came to hang out with her.

181
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
Mr. Ma,

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,120
this is the four-bedroom apartment you want.

183
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
The total price is 4.86 million.

184
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960
Please take a look.

185
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm satisfied.

186
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,000

so big,

188

and so pretty.

189
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,840
Leave it to me.

190
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,120
Mr. Ma,

191
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,600
if you're happy with it,

192
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,960
shall we sign the purchase contract?

193
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,520
No rush, little girl.

194
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
How about this?

195
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
If I sign with you,

196
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,320
you'll get a commission.

197
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm being so kind to you.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,240
Shouldn't you also

199
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
show your appreciation?

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,280
Mr. Ma,

201
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,800
let me treat you to dinner.

202
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,220
You keep me company.

203
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll treat you to dinner.

204
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,600
How about it? Sound good?

205
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,120
Mr. Ma.

206
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,440
There's no need, Mr. Ma.

207
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Little girl,

208
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,600
I have plenty of friends.

209
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,680
Next time,

210
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,420
I'll introduce them all to you.

211
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,280
How does that sound?

212
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,920
Xiaoxiao,

213
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,520
that's quite intriguing.

214
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,440
Xiaoxiao?

215
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,720
You said you've got many friends.

216
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,160
Are they here to buy houses

217
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,840
or just to flirt with saleswomen?

218
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,560
That sentence

219
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
feels like both a threat

220
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,800
and a teasing remark.

221
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,000
A clever play on words.

222
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,360
Impressive, sir.

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,310
Ah, so that's how it is.

224
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,220
I learned from him.

225
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,000
That's just disgusting.

226
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,220
Shame on you!

227
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,920
Harass a little girl during buying a house.

228
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,000
Truly disgusting!

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,920
You're just a pathetic loser.

230
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,840
Want to play hero, huh?

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,360
If you're capable,

232
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,580
why don't you buy one yourself?

233
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,240
That four-bedroom apartment...

234
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,720
I'll take it.

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,640
Alright.

236
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,000
You've got less than 100 yuan on you.

237
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,480
You're so poor.

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,600
How can you afford a house worth 4 million?

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
Where's your nerve coming from?

240
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,720
Who gave you the nerve?

241
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,080
Building 6, 16th floor.

242
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,000
Sign the contract.

243
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay.

244
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,840
Young man, you're quite capable.

245
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,160
Stop pretending.

246
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,160
You're just broke.

247
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,580
You should know when to stop.

248
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't lose your dignity

249
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,560
just to please a woman.

250
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
Why are you so nervous?

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,400
Why don't you buy it first?

252
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,880
- I...
- You what?

253
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,800
You can't afford it?

254
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,680
I can't afford it?

255
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,840
Then buy it.

256
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Look.

257
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,760
The houses here are too small.

258
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,500
There isn't anything I like.

259
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,960
Your account balance is just

260
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,960
20,037.80 yuan.

261
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
I said you can't afford it.

262
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,830
I'm not wrong, right?

263
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,640
How do you know even the cents?

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,160
I calculated it.

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,240
His expression shows it's true.

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,520
Just wait.

267
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,800
Take care, sir.

268
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,400
How dare you!

269
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,730
Sir,

270
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,760
thanks for helping me out.

271
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,400
This is my friend, Siting,

272
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
Bai Wu.

273
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,200
Hi, I'm Bai Wu.

274
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm here to buy a house today.

275
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,160
Isn't staying at my place fine?

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,080
You guys

277
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,280
are living together?

278
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,200
No.

279
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,960
See?

280
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,100
She also misunderstands us.

281
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
Also?

282
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,400
Anyway now...

283
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,200
Danger warning.

284
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,640
Fatality rate of the host is 99%.

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
Take action immediately.

286
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,040
Fatality rate of the host...

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,480
There's my enemy here?

288
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Enemy related rate: 0%.

289
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,920
Heart attack or stroke?

290
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,320
Disease rate: 0%.

291
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,000
Could it be a natural disaster?

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,440
Disaster rate: 0%.

293
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Bai Wu,

294
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,800
why are you sweating?

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,360
Are you feeling unwell?

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
No worries.

297
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,840
Sorry,

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
I need some air.

299
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
(It's not an enemy,)

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
(nor disease or disaster.)

301
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,200
(Could it be a planned accident?)

302
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,640
Planned accident rate: 100%.

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
Fatality rate of the host drops to 62%.

304
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,720
(It's decreased.)

305
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,520
(Is it related to me being outside?)

306
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,600
Related rate: 100%.

307
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
(Planned accident?)

308
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,240
(It's safer outdoors.)

309
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,400
(Could it be)

310
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,360
(someone wants to bomb the sales office?)

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,600
Someone's carrying a bomb:

312
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,280
