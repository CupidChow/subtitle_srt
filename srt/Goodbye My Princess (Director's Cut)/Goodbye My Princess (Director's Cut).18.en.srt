00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,130
[Eastern Palace]

2
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,060
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,750
Greetings, Imperial Mother.

4
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,140
Yin'er, come sit.

5
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,290
Pour him some tea.

6
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,390
Prince Yi, here is your tea.

7
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,200
The Queyunxiang tea at Imperial Mother's place is indeed the best. I could never get the same taste at my manor.

8
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:24,160
Now that you have your own palace, coming to the palace is troublesome; you need permission and an entry card.

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,590
If you like, I'll let you have my tea maid.

10
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,700
No, no, no, I can't ever take her from you.

11
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,060
Besides, I'm moving back tomorrow. I'll be here every day to have tea.

12
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,390
You are moving back?

13
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,600
When I visited Grand Uncle, he told me

14
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,830
that when Imperial Father asks who to dispatch to Danchi,

15
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,740
I must make sure I stay in the capital.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,130
And Li Yan indeed recommended me to go.

17
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:00,100
So I followed Grand Uncle's advice and asked Imperial Father to let me create a guide to the Western Border.

18
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,170
In order to have easy access to the books, I asked Imperial Father to permit me to stay in Shaode Palace next to the imperial library.

19
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,970
This way, I'm living very close to you.

20
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,190
That's wonderful.

21
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,800
Yin'er, you tend to over-trust.

22
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,590
Even though the crown prince is your brother, but the killing of siblings

23
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,850
often happens within the royal family. You need to be on your guard.

24
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,750
I understand.

25
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,910
Hurry!

26
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,690
Crown Princess Consort, where are you going?

27
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,100
Princess!

28
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,670
Yongniang, we weren't sneaking out of the palace.

29
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,220
We were just walking around the palace and got lost. I wasn't planning to leave.

30
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,890
Clothing? It's just something I picked up casually.

31
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:33,300
Because your Li Empire's clothing is really complicated. You also took away my clothes from Xi State.

32
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,690
Princess, the crown princess consort of the Li Empire must be accustomed to wearing the empire's clothing.

33
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,530
You should quit wearing these casual clothes in the future to avoid being laughed at.

34
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,500
There are a lot of alleys in the palace, so it is easy to get lost.

35
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,520
If you are lost again, ask the guards to bring you back here.

36
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,300
When the princess disappears in the middle of the night, we are all very anxious. Yet we can't raise alarm.

37
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,020
If you didn't come back, I would've had to tell Great Empress Dowager.

38
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,850
Don't! Next time I'm lost, I will ask the guards.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,600
In the future, if you want to go somewhere, you can just tell me.

40
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Princess, in a few days, will be the once-a-year garden party.

41
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,500
Empress specifically instructed us to properly prepare you.

42
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,620
So you will appear more crown princess-like by the time of the garden party.

43
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,850
Princess, you are tired? I'll put you in bed.

44
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,680
Look over there! My second and fifth brother are there, too. They are probably playing the winding-stream party.

45
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,900
Winding what party?

46
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,800
Winding-stream party. Winding-stream party is a Li Empire tradition.

47
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,420
After the Spring Bathing ritual, everyone will sit by the river banks.

48
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,000
A wine glass will be placed upstream and it will follow the current down.

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,970
Whoever it stops at will have to drink the wine and make a poem.

50
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,500
Make a poem?

51
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,900
- Yes, it's really fun. Let's all go.
- Okay.

52
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,520
No. No. I can’t even read the poems that Directress Fang tells me to read.

53
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,880
Forget about making poems. I won't go.

54
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,390
That doesn’t matter. It’s just a game. Whoever loses needs to drink alcohol as a punishment.

55
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,970
- There's alcohol?!
- Yes.

56
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,690
Second Brother! Fifth Brother!

57
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,120
Divine poets, are you lacking in players?

58
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,350
You guys came just at the right time. Now, there’s finally enough people.

59
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,870
- I don’t know how to.
- Don’t worry.

60
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,600
It's all right. We'll follow the rules, but you can do as you like. Just make sure it rhymes.

61
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,390
Right, right, right. Second Brother already spoke, just play with us.

62
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,500
If you really can’t make the poem, just let Second Brother take the punishment for you

63
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,100
How about we set a theme?

64
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,450
For this round, the top line will involve the weather and scenery.

65
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,590
The bottom line will be plants and animals How about it?

66
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,300
Okay! That sounds good!

67
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,720
Okay. Everyone, go to your spots.

68
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Let's go.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,120
The night rain stopped early and turned into a clear sky.

70
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,770
Hiring a boat to visit an old friend at Peony Town.

71
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,900
Hanging slantingly is the high sail of sunset colors.

72
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
The fast rowing oars cover the sound of pelicans.

73
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,080
The fast rowing oars cover the sound of pelicans?

74
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,790
Flipping water sweep passed the many mountains.

75
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
Offering a golden carp to steam in the kitchen.

76
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,290
Rivers and streams never grow old like people.

77
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,420
The fortune-teller makes false boasts.

78
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,360
I'm not wrong. Wasn't it seven words?

79
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,380
I'll just drink another glass then as punishment.

80
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,290
Good alcohol tolerance, Princess.

81
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,780
Fifth Brother, what is the theme for this round?

82
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,520
For this round,

83
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,110
it doesn't matter the upper or the lower verse, as long as the meaning of "pair" is conveyed in each verse.

84
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,020
Pair...

85
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,350
Scenes of fireworks end in front of my eyes.

86
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,180
The story of paired geese villa is still told here.

87
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,300
Romantic dreams willingly forget the meaning of March.

88
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,490
My daughter and son are each worries for the remaining half of my life.

89
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,870
Pushing has scattered it; hence, it can't dance again.

90
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,530
Lotus flowers only bloom in pairs.

91
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,970
Destiny will make enemies meet!

92
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,590
I'm wrong again?

93
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,860
That is well said.

94
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,370
What you've said is very profound.

95
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,180
Okay, let's stop here.

96
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,020
All of you, don't waste your time here. Go and have fun!

97
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,220
- Luoxi.
- Yongning, did I embarrass myself?

98
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,590
Don't worry about it. It's only a game. Don't take it to heart.

99
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,360
That's right. When Yongning first started making poems,

100
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,150
she was punished multiple times.

101
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,010
You're making fun of me.

102
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,650
The 7-word poetry is indeed difficult to learn.

103
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,550
When I learned how to make poems at age six, it took me a whole month to learn.

104
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,400
Ninth Princess just came to the Li Empire.

105
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,860
Once you've stayed longer, after constantly hearing it, you'll naturally learn it.

106
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,360
You only took one month to learn how to make poems at age six?

107
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,400
You act like your so amazing.

108
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,530
Yongning, don't say anymore.

109
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,360
Why are you stopping me?

110
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,380
I'll take my leave now.

111
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,620
Don't target her every time you see her.

112
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,420
Isn't she just a daughter of a fighter?

113
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,520
Acting so refined since we were little. So annoying.

114
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,220
Fifth Brother, last time you asked Imperial Father to let you

115
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,950
write the Western Border Annals. How is the progress?

116
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,140
Second Brother, I've been studying the archives of the different states in the Western Border at the Grand Literature Library,

117
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,400
but these documents are mostly incomplete;

118
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,730
hence, a lot of details

119
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,540
must be thought over. The progress is quite slow.

120
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,830
What are you chatting about?

121
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,560
Ninth Princess.

122
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,960
- Crown Prince. Prince Yi.

123
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,900
Ninth Princess.

124
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,200
Fifth Brother has been ordered by Imperial Father to write the annals of the Western Border at the library.

125
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,390
Western Border Annals?

126
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,220
Does Grand Literature Library have a lot of maps and historical archives about the Western Border?

127
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,320
Yes.

128
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,040
Can I work on it with you?

129
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,450
What's wrong?

130
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,060
I can't make this decision.

131
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,760
You are the future crown princess consort. How could I let you do this kind of laborious work?

132
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,530
You have to ask Crown Prince for his permission first.

133
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,320
Princess,

134
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,370
organizing the archives is a national matter. With your status, to help in creating the annals of the Western Border, it isn't appropriate with etiquette.

135
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,700
It is! I won't cause any trouble.

136
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,180
I just miss home so I want to look at things related to the Xi State.

137
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,280
Besides, organizing the annals of the Western Border will benefit the relationship between both our countries that will last for generations.

138
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,700
I want to help, too.

139
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,580
Didn't Prince Yi just say that some documents weren't complete?

140
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,710
I grew up in the royal palace of the Xi State, which is within the Western Border. I know it very well.

141
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,800
Additionally, our royal palace has a plethora of book collections.

142
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,700
I've more or less read some of them. I can likely help you.

143
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,630
This...

144
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,460
What do you think?

145
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,940
Okay then. Tomorrow, I will request permission from Imperial Father.

146
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,830
However, I am not sure if it is convenient for Fifth Brother.

147
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:06,080
Since Princess is willing, then naturally I am excited.

148
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,020
That is great!

149
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,690
I asked for this back for you from the guards.

150
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,790
Keep it safe.

151
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,500
A'Du, life in the palace is different from the outside world.

152
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,210
Servants like us must always think for the sake of our masters.

153
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,030
The ninth princess is the future crown princess consort.

154
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,230
You are somebody by her side; hence, a lot of people will be watching you.

155
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,890
If you say or do anything out of order, it may implicate the princess.

156
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,440
I know you are a sensible child.

157
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,730
You should know what to do.

158
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,340
That one! That one looks good!

159
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,760
What are they playing?

160
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,770
They are shooting wooden ducks.

161
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,200
Xiaofeng, since you are from Xi State, you should know how to shoot arrows. Right?

162
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,190
This time, we must win against them!

163
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,650
Good!

164
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,220
Is there any punishment or rewards for losing or winning?

165
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,170
Of course. After a round ends,

166
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,720
the one who hits the least is punished to go into the pond to pull the arrows.

167
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,690
Let's go!

168
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,930
Wow!

169
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,880
Amazing!

170
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,620
She's so good!

171
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
The yellow arrow won.

172
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,730
We won!

173
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,610
The one picking the arrows is the one with the red arrow.

174
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,560
She's wearing that?

175
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,230
Right. Can she even do it?

176
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,380
Miss, be careful.

177
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,270
So, boats look like this. I've never seen one before!

178
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,310
Are you serious?

179
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,140
Xiaofeng!

180
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,280
- Xiaofeng!
- My Lady!

181
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,260
- Xiaofeng, be careful!
- My Lady!

182
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,630
My Lady!

183
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,390
- My Lady!
- Someone help!

184
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,230
My Lady!

185
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,750
Someone save them!

186
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,650
Help me!

187
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,580
- Someone fell into the water!
- Help!

188
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,570
Second Brother, I think someone fell into the water.

189
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,430
- My Lady!
- Help!

190
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,910
Help me!

191
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,820
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

192
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,590
Ninth Princess, are you all right?

193
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,170
My Lady, are you all right?

194
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,650
- My Lady.
- Yongning, take Xiaofeng back quickly.

195
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,860
Okay. Xiaofeng, let's go.

196
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,590
Thank goodness they were saved.

197
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,060
Seriously, that ninth princess...

198
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,020
Right!

199
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,530
That was dangerous!

200
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,670
Thank goodness that everyone is all right.

201
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,860
Thank goodness nothing happened.

202
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,380
That was so dangerous!

203
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,290
What was she thinking?

204
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,720
Who knows what she was thinking?

205
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,730
Your Highness.

206
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,100
Thank goodness nothing happened.

207
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,560
So dangerous!

208
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,950
She fell into the water.

209
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,660
So what's the story here?

210
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,960
Thanks, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

211
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,640
Hurry and put this on.

212
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,430
Fifth Brother, you have good water skills.

213
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,060
Thank goodness you were able to save the ninth princess in time.

214
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,910
Thank goodness they are all right.

215
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,200
So dangerous!

216
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,780
They fell into the river.

217
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,250
What was going on?

218
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,210
That's right. Luckily, the princess is all right.

219
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,120
Your Highnesses, what happened?

220
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,250
Xiaofeng fell into the water earlier.

221
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,270
Fell into the water?

222
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,590
How did she fall in?

223
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,760
She jumped onto the boat and lost her footing.

224
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,790
Thankfully, my fifth brother has sharp eyes and quick hands. He was able to quickly pull her up.

225
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,050
- Prince Yi?
- Yes.

226
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,780
A'Du, go sleep for a while.

227
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,620
Princess, you're awake.

228
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,060
Water...

229
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,020
I'll go pour you some now.

230
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,810
A'Du...

231
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,050
Did I know Prince Yi from before?

232
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,460
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

233
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,950

♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

235
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,600

236
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,650
Here's water.

237
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,250
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

238
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,610

♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

256
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,020
Your Highness just caught a cold this time.

257
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,240
Since you practiced martial arts at a young age, you have a healthier body compared to other people.

258
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,950
Logically speaking, you should have recovered by now.

259
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,780
Your Highness, I dare to ask.

260
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,530
Did you previously suffer from extreme cold or had any internal injuries?

261
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,480
When he pursued the remainder of Danchi's troops in the northern icy and mossy plain,

262
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,190
he did get injured.

263
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,020
Okay. That's the reason why.

264
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,800
You have probably not recovered completely from your previous injury.

265
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,250
It must have relapsed altogether; hence, you're having recurrent low fevers.

266
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,140
I'll write a new prescription for Your Highness.

267
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,780
Take it for two days, and you will see improvement.

268
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,690
Thank you, Doctor.

269
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:37,090
Ah Zhao, there's one thing that I couldn't understand despite thinking about it for a long time.

270
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,660
You help me think about it, too.

271
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,510
Please speak, Your Highness.

272
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,720
That day, during the garden party in the palace,

273
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,220
the ninth princess of Xi State and Sese fell into the lake at the same time.

274
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,120
Originally, I wanted to save Sese.

275
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,030
But don't know why I didn't save Sese

276
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,280
and saved the ninth princess instead.

277
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,660
It must be because the visibility underwater wasn't good and you had mistaken the person.

278
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,900
That's impossible. I saw it very clearly.

279
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:07,900
I don't know why every time I see that girl,

280
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,340
my heart feels conflicted and I get a headache.

281
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,050
I don't know what's wrong with me, either.

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,650
Your Highness,

283
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,800
Zhao family's young lady sent a request to visit.

284
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,830
Her carriage is waiting at the side door.

285
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,250
She came herself?

286
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,920
Yes.

287
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,760
Sese.

288
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,700
Greetings, Your Highness Prince Yi.

289
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,220
I heard that you caught a cold,

290
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,170
so I especially brought some medicine.

291
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,320
What cold do I have!

292
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,560
After staying inside the Grand Literature Library for days, I only wanted to take it easy for a few days,

293
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,640
and get some peace and quiet.

294
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,480
It has been impolite of me.

295
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,450
I wasn't invited but came anyway. I've disturbed your quiet time.

296
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,170
Sese!

297
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,550
I want to apologize.

298
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,770
That day in the pond, I saw you fall into the water and hurried to save you.

299
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,200
But for some reason, I—

300
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
I know that it's still inconvenient

301
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,650
to let others know about us.

302
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,390
Your Highness is scared of ruining my reputation.

303
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,790
Plus, that ninth princess of Xi State is the future crown princess consort.

304
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,870
If you save her, bystanders won't have anything bad to say.

305
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,500
Sese, you are very good.

306
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,340
Greetings, Ninth Princess.

307
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,900
May I ask. Is Prince Yi here?

308
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,200
Yes, please come with me.

309
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,410
Your Highness Prince Yi! Your Highness!

310
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,470
I came especially to thank you.

311
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,010
Thank you for saving me that day.

312
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,180
Ninth Princess, I have a cold.

313
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,620
I fear that I might infect you. If there isn't anything important, it's better that you go back now.

314
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,460
What? You're sick?

315
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,880
Is it severe?

316
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,450
It's not because of me, right?

317
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:34,610
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

318
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:40,400

319

Prince Yi, you—

320
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,760
- Don't come near.
- Your Highness!

321
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,620
Your head hurts again?

322
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,120
What's wrong with him?

323
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,670
Since Your Highness is gravely ill,

324
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,070
I won't disturb you anymore.

325
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,980
Please.

326
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,850

What happened?

329
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,330
Why did my heart suddenly hurt so much?

I'm done.

342
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,310
Not bad. Not bad. Let's go find Mi Luo now.

343
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,710
I'm going to find the best wine at her drinking house so that I can make a cold-curing medicine.

344
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,310
Not for me. Let's go.

345
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,990
Sir, the ninth princess has left the palace again.

346
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,400
I sent a stranger to follow them.

347
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,790
- Is he reliable?
- We investigated him thoroughly.

348
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,520
Their families have also been harmed by Prime Minister Gao. They are surely loyal to us.

349
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,760
Okay.

350
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,420
Sir Chai.

351
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,730
Your Highness doesn't look completely healed. How about we just talk after a couple of days?

352
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,370
Don't worry, Sir Chai, I'm fine.

353
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,400
Is there any information from the crown prince's side?

354
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,400
I asked for Imperial Father's permission to edit the Western Border annals.

355
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,050
Just so that I could get this badge,

356
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:35,030
which will allow me to look at information from every department.

357
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:39,300
I've already done enough pretending inside Grand Literature Library these past days.

358
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,650
In a few days, I will head over to the Ministry of Justice, Revenues, and Personnel

359
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,790
to look at documents regarding the crown prince.

360
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,610
It is hard to lay hands on the crown prince's side.

361
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,800
Ever since he stepped into this position, he's been accommodating and harmonious to others.

362
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,020
I'm afraid it will be difficult to find a matter you can hold on to.

363
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,480
Accommodating and harmonious?

364
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,120
Unless his actions are flawless.

365
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,240
Otherwise, public clamor can melt metal.

366
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,110
It merely cannot be done through words.

367
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,390
These few years, in order to win over more power, my second brother

368
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,830
must have spent a lot of money.

369
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,410
Okay.

370
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,230
Then, we'll attack from the monetary aspect.

371
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,580
No matter how cleanly the crown prince does things,

372
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,440
it's hard to ensure that his people will handle things very cleanly, too.

373
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,620
The first one we have to search is that Li Yan.

374
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,410
I've been thinking.

375
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,450
He gave up the position of the Assistant Minister of War,

376
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,150
and went to be a director of the managing office under the Ministry of Revenue.

377
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,150
Even though it is a much lower position, what kind of place is the Ministry of Revenue?

378
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,360
If there was nothing he could have gained from it, would he have gone?

379
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,570
I will immediately order them to start with Li Yan.

380
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,860
I don't believe that we won't be able to find his weakness.

381
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,330
Good.

382
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,130
Oh, right, Sir Chai.

383
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,630
Do you have news on my cousin's whereabouts?

384
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,410
Not yet.

385
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,280
But Your Highness, don't worry.

386
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,120
Gu Jian has gone through so much danger. He can surely protect himself.

387
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,540
Or was it because he caught a cold?

388
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,960
Anyways, I need to go find Mi Luo and get some cold dispelling grape wine.

389
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,520
You say...

390
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,590
A'Du!

391
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,590
A'Du!

392
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,150
A'Du!

393
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,750
Excuse me. Did you see a young man wearing yellow?

394
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,170
He was like a small oriole!

395
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,410
A young man wearing yellow...

396
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,460
A person like a small oriole...

397
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,790
I did see one.

398
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,910
Where is he?

399
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,200
Isn't it you?

400
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,530
It's you?

401
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,860
You remember me?

402
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,710
Someone help! There's a thief!

403
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,360
Xiaofeng, I haven't seen you in months.

404
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,370
You are still the same.

405
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,930
If you promise me not to yell,

406
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,340
I'll release your silence pressure point.

407
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,920
How do you know my name? Who are you?!

408
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't remember who I am?

409
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,990
You are... sent by my dad?

410
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,140
Or someone my grandfather sent?

411
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,760
Then, who are you?

412
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,370
I am Gu Jian.

413
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,730
I don't know you. Let go of me. I need to go find A'Du.

414
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,170
I looked for half a year before finding you.

415
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,050
Aren't you willing to chat more with me?

416
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,920
You searched for me?

417
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,030
Why do you have to search for me?

418
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,100
Did I know you from before?

419
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,890
We used to be a couple and we'd already exchanged our tokens of love.

420
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,120
We already planned to run away together.

421
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,900
But later, you fought with me and ran away due to a moment of anger.

422
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,310
Afterward, you encountered bandits and received a head injury.

423
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,070
You even forgot about me.

424
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,740
I did encounter bandits and hurt my head...

425
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,310
But even if you don't remember, it's fine, since I will make you fall in love with me again.

426
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,050
Are you sick?

427
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,390
I did forget some things,

428
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,990
but I still do remember most of my childhood.

429
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:58,110
If it was really like you said, that we planned to run away...

430
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,800
Wouldn't we have been together for a long time?

431
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,490
How come I don't remember anything at all?

432
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:09,190
That's because you hate me, so naturally, you don't remember.

433
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,420
Nonsense! Quickly release me.

434
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,540
I need to find A'Du and handle some affairs.

435
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,650
What urgent things do you have to do? Tell me and maybe I can help you.

436
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,740
I need to go and buy wine.

437
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,550
Buy wine?

438
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,120
Okay, then I'll accompany you to buy wine.

439
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,840
When we are done, I'll return your A'Du back to you.

440
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,810
How should I know whether what you said is real or fake?

441
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,090
Do I look like a liar?

442
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:45,530
With my martial arts, if I wanted to hurt you, would you be still standing here safely?

443
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:51,190
Okay, I'll believe you for now.

444
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,890
But later, if you don't return A'Du to me, I won't forgive you.

445
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,360
Come, let me give you a toast.

446
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,620
Okay, come. Come.

447
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,550
Mi Luo!

448
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,060
- Not bad.
- Indeed.

449
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,550
Xiaofeng?

450
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:16,660
Today, you didn't bring A'Du but instead brought a handsome young man.

451
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,690
This is Mi Luo, this drinking house's owner. She is also from the Xi State.

452
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,150
I'm Gu Jian.

453
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,230
Nice to meet you, Young Lord Gu.

454
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,310
Come inside. I'll treat you two to some wine.

455
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,020
No thanks. I didn't come to drink wine today.

456
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,260
I have a friend who caught a severe cold.

457
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,460
I was thinking, in our Xi State, don't we have a cold dispelling medicinal wine?

458
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,620
I want to get some here and use it to make medicine.

459
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,820
A batch just arrived from Weipin Pavilion and was just brought down into the cellar.

460
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,340
Don't you usually make your own wine? Why did it come from outside today?

461
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,860
I do make most of the wines here, but some I can't make myself.

462
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,980
For example, special local wines such as our Xi State's

463
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,480
mulberry wine. I'm unable to brew such good wine.

464
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,160
But this batch is something I asked the Weipin Pavilion merchant caravan to get straight from Xi State.

465
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,250
It's very genuine.

466
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,340
You guys even have good wines like mulberry wine?

467
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,780
Of course!

468
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,390
If you say it like that, I'm getting a craving.

469
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,290
Next time you come, tell me ahead of time.

470
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,790
Lady Boss!

471
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,820
Lord Gao is making a scene in our Singing Jade Brothel about drinking the wine that you made.

472
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,370
Quickly, go deliver him two jars!

473
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,430
Okay, wait for a bit. Let me go get his wine first, then I'll deliver yours.

474
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,830
This won't do. That Young Master Gao has a really bad temper. He won't wait!

475
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,830
What can we do? I can't be in two places.

476
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,030
- What do we do?
- I...

477
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,590
I'll help you deliver it to Singing Jade Brothel.

478
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,760
You?

479
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,530
I can do it!

480
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,170
- Singing Jade Brothel?
- Believe me.

481
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,410
Okay then. Wait here for a while. I'll get you the wine.

482
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,990
Okay.

483
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,550
Xiaofeng! You can't go to those kinds of places.

484
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,620
Why can't I go?

485
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,130
You just can't go. It doesn't fit you.

486
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,850
I haven't seen it yet.

487
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,250
This handsome mister, do you want to go to Singing Jade Brothel, too, and have a seat?

488
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,840
Right! Right! Let's go together.

489
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,880
Here. Here.

490
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,680
Thanks for your assistance.

491
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,990
You're welcome.

492
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,130
Wait for me here, okay?

493
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,480
- I'm leaving.
- Here, come this way.

494
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,940
Xiao—

495
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,100
Young lords, calm down. Calm down, all right?

496
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,890
Zhao Shixuan, don't think that I won't dare to hurt you. I clearly came here first.

497
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:14,580
What right do you have to compete for Mingyue with me?!

498
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,060
What if you came first? Mingyue doesn't want to see you at all!

499
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,320
If I don't see Mingyue today, I will immediately bring people to destroy this place!

500
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,420
- Don't!
- Mother Wang, don't worry!

501
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,820
With me here, he wouldn't dare!

502
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,810
It's all you! Ruining my good things!

503
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,370
Mother Wang, I will redeem Mingyue's freedom today!

504
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,030
Mother Wang, how much is Mingyue? I'll pay threefold!

505
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,970
I'll pay fourfold!

506
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,490
Stop fighting!

507
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,390
You two sirs...

508
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,720
You kept saying that you would redeem Mingyue's freedom, but did she agree to with any of you?

509
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,360
You two look like you are from distinguished noble families.

510
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,450
Being so shameless, aren't you afraid words will spread and you will become a laughingstock?

511
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:05,420
Where did you come from? Mind your own business!

512
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,960
Look at that.

513
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,190
You're a crude man who only has brute force which you use when you can't argue over others.

514
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,990
No wonder Mingyue doesn't like you.

515
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,030
Young Lord!

516
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,270
Young Lord.

517
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,520
People come to this place to seek pleasure and joy.

518
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,530
Why must you two fight like this?

519
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,150
- As long as you have the heart, come early tomorrow.
- You...

520
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,250
- Mingyue!
- Miss Mingyue is here.

521
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,830
MIngyue!

522
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,550
Miss Mingyue is here.

523
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,090
Mingyue...

524
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,010
I haven't been feeling well recently. Sorry to have made both of you wait.

525
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:07,470
You both are sons of important government ministers and will become pillars of the country in the future.

526
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:11,320
Please do not destroy your harmonious relation over me.

527
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,580
Mingyue, I frightened you today.

528
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,060
I'll apologize another day!

529
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,760
Young Lord, you're not staying for a while more?

530
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,100
Mingyue, sorry about this.

531
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,660
Next time... Next time, I'll come back to see you.

532
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,220
I think he admits that he is a loser.

533
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,200
Young Lord!

534
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,650
- They should have left earlier.
- They finally behaved.

535
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,550
That's right. Let's go.

536
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,760
Go, go, go.

537
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,120
Go, go.

538
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,190
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

539
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,410
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

540
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,920
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

541
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,330
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

542
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,250
♫ A long dream ♫

543
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,830
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

544
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:49,390
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

545
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:57,660
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

546
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:04,620
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

547
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,130
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

548
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:10,970
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

549
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:19,430
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

550
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,900
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

551
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,620
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

552
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,560
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

553
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,310
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

554
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,120
♫ Time reverses ♫

555
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,370
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

556
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:48,410
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

557
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,590
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

558
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,250
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

559
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,090
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

560
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,910
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

561
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,750
♫ Time reverses ♫

562
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:07,880
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

563
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:15,130
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

564
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:21,660
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

565
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:29,490
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
