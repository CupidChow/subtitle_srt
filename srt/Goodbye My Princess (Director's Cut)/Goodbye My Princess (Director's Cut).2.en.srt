00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,950
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,220
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,480
My Lady.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Is it pretty?

5
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,220
It's pretty. Our ninth princess in Han clothing

6
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,490
is absolutely beautiful.

7
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,230
Don't tell me you made it yourself?

8
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,410
I don't have this kind of skill. This dress

9
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,800
can only be made by Weipin Pavilion in the Imperial City.

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,250
There were envoys who went to the capital earlier. I specifically asked people to go to Weipin Pavilion to expedite the making of this dress and then send it back here.

11
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,000
Xiaofeng, this is my wedding gift for you.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,680
Thank you, My Lady. You are so thoughtful.

13
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,420
Xiaofeng, in the capital,

14
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,500
there are more pretty dresses and delicious food.

15
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,790
If one day you go there, you will like it.

16
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,850
Would you like to go to the capital?

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,320
My Lady, are you missing your homeland?

18
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,680
Don't worry. Wait until you get better. We will go visit the capital together.

19
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,840
Your Highness!

20
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,020
Miss Zhao.

21
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,650
I heard that Your HIghness is going to Xi State. So, I have been waiting for you here.

22
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,350
This is the sachet I personally made for you.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,950
Miss Zhao, what does it mean?

24
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,710
My feelings for you... Your Highness really doesn't know?

25
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,300
I'm a person burdened with punishment. This trip to the west,

26
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,560
I don't know when I can return to the capital. Your thoughts for me,

27
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,230
I'm afraid I won't be able to repay.

28
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,100
I'm willing to wait. If Your Highness doesn't return in a year,

29
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,570
I will wait for you for a year. If you don't return in ten years,

30
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,760
I'll wait for ten years. If you don't return in a lifetime,

31
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,700
I will then wait for a lifetime.

32
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,690
Sese.

33
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,770
It is a long journey. I hope you...

34
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,650
take care of yourself, Your Highness.

35
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,140
Is it pretty?

36
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,890
Teacher, I heard Consort Mingyuan say,

37
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,400
that in the Central Plains there are plenty of delicious foods and fun things to play, also many pretty clothes.

38
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,290
In the future, if we have a chance to go there, can you find me all those good things?

39
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,000
All right. If we have a chance to go there,

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,790
I will buy all the things that you want.

41
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,400
- I really want to go visit the Central Plains with Teacher.
- You don't behave like a lady.

42
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,250
By the way, Teacher, about my name,

43
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,450
how do I write it in the Central Plains language?

44
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,190
Come. I'll show you.

45
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,200
Qu.

46
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,760
"Qu."

47
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,960
Xiao.

48
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,420
"Xiao."

49
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,530
The wind blew it away!

50
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,460
Write it here, Teacher.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,080
Feng. Correct?

52
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,320
Correct. Feng.

53
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,660
Whoa... Imperial Brother.

54
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,580
Fifth Brother, I'm deeply moved with what you're doing.

55
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,900
But this trip is equivalent to banishment. It's still not too late for you to go back.

56
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,690
Imperial Brother, you've always treated me closely and generously. How can I let you travel west on your own?

57
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,930
In addition, if there were to be any danger on this trip, I can keep an eye on you.

58
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,200
Everyone else is breaking their heads just to squeeze into the palace,

59
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,560
yet you asked to be banished.

60
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,020
Imperial Brother, you don't know!

61
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,250
But I feel so much more comfortable and carefree here than in the palace.

62
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't ask me to go back. If I go back, I will get constantly yelled at by Royal Mother again.

63
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,670
Fair enough.

64
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,870
Godfather.

65
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,560
Jian'er, I'm here to remind you.

66
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,200
Regardless of what kind of disposition the ninth princess has, she is His Majesty's daughter.

67
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,420
It doesn't matter how you feel about her,

68
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,760
you have to keep a sense of propriety.

69
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,470
Your mission is to get revenge for the Gu family.

70
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,890
Do you understand what I'm saying?

71
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,190
I understand.

72
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,460
There are things, whether in the capital

73
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,840
or in Xi State, that will never change.

74
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,020
That's the fate for both of you.

75
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,560
How are the preparations for the dowry of the ninth princess?

76
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,330
Your Majesty, do not worry. Everything has been meticulously picked and prepared.

77
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,300
We will not allow Ninth Princess to lose her dignity.

78
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,830
That's good then.

79
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,320
Prepare more items that Ninth Princess normally enjoys.

80
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,690
She is young and still playful.

81
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,860
This time, she will be going far from Xi State to get married. She will surely miss home.

82
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,200
Yes.

83
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,440
Teacher, take me away quickly.

84
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,320
Teacher, take me away quickly. Father wants to marry me off to the Li Empire.

85
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Let me tell you... Luckily, I found it out quickly. If not,

86
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,120
I probably wouldn't be able to escape. Let's run away today, so he can't even find us. Let's go.

87
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,350
Xiaofeng,

88
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,420
I can't take you away.

89
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,810
Why?

90
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,940
Can you bear to see me married off to the Li Empire to a man whom I've never met?

91
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,200
This is about my marriage. Can you stand it if he doesn't treat me well?

92
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,260
Xiaofeng, this marriage is the affair between two countries.

93
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,030
You, as the direct lineal descent princess of Xi State, from the day you were born, your fate

94
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,900
binds together with a prince of the Li Empire. I'm only your teacher.

95
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,660
I don't have the right to take you away.

96
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,500
Then, tell me which prince? What is his name and how does he look?

97
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,000
Halt!

98
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,900
- Imperial Brother.
- Sit.

99
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,450
In fact, this is the first time I traveled so far away.

100
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,560
Imperial Brother, have you ever been to Xi State?

101
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm really curious. Say, this ninth princess of Xi State,

102
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,790
how does she look? Hopefully, she is gentle and beautiful.

103
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,730
Otherwise, how can you bear it?

104
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,330
It's a marriage between two countries that may bring permanent peace to the border areas.

105
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,150
No affection is allowed. Besides, I'm just an envoy to propose marriage.

106
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,300
The ninth princess is to be married to the new crown prince who is about to enter and host the Eastern Palace.

107
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,180
Not me, the ex-crown prince.

108
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,430
Imperial Brother, don't be so depressed all the time.

109
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,720
Now that Emperor Father asked you to do the marriage proposal, means that he still cares about you.

110
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,000
Furthermore, wait till we gain merit and return to the imperial court.

111
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,490
By then, we will go find out the truth, and you definitely will be able to return to the Eastern Palace.

112
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,640
In the palace, the most unwanted thing is the truth.

113
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,860
Imperial Brother.

114
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,450
Mother, can't you help me persuade Father?

115
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,230
Do you really have the heart to marry me off to such a faraway place like the Li Empire?

116
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,700
Xiaofeng, you should know to prioritize the greater good.

117
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,740
I have so many sisters who know that. Why must I go?

118
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,290
Moreover, Consort Mingyuan is also not a direct line princess.

119
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,600
- Didn't she still—
- Watch your mouth!

120
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,330
Consort Mingyuan is your elder! Can you just casually comment on her?

121
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,940
You shouldn't have concealed it from her, to begin with. Now, you are blaming her?

122
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,330
Stop defending her! It's time that I discipline her lawless personality.

123
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,770
Men!

124
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,100
Here.

125
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,710
Guard and look after the ninth princess for me. She is not to leave her bedchamber within half a step.

126
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,250
Father!

127
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,060
Mother, he wants to lock me up. Go talk to him.

128
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,380
Mother.

129
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,320
Mother!

130
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,780
Princess.

131
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,050
- A'Du!
- Princess.

132
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,350
- Princess.
- What brings you here?

133
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,200
Khan Tömür asked me to send a message to the queen.

134
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,310
That's wonderful! Truly wonderful! I was worried that no one could help me.

135
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,590
Take me away quickly.

136
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,670
All right. To where?

137
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,750
To...

138
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:05,130
That's right. To where? I can't go back to Danchi.

139
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,030
If Grandfather finds out, he will send me back here.

140
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,000
What should I do?

141
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,530
My father is set on marrying me to the Li Empire.

142
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,900
Please take me away! You are the only one who can save me.

143
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,650
Xiaofeng, if you were not Xi State's direct lineal descent princess, I would definitely take you away.

144
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,880
You know that I don't want to get married over there! I only want to remain here in the grassland!

145
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,340
You said before that you cared for me the most.

146
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,100
Is that so?

147
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,940
Take me away. I beg you. Isn't that good enough?

148
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,810
I'm sorry, Xiaofeng.

149
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,700
I can't take you away.

150
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,320
Teacher... Gu Jian! You won't be able to see me again once I get married off to the Li Empire!

151
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,780
I thought you were different from the others. You promised to forever protect me,

152
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,450
think for my sake, and think for my own good. What a deception!

153
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,370
Big liar!

154
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,760
Teacher... Gu Jian!

155
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,720
Good! Since you won't take me away, I will think of an idea myself!

156
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,380
Central Plains' princes... I am telling you, I will destroy each one that comes.

157
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,530
See who dares to marry me!

158
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,300
Imperial Brother!

159
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,560
The messenger reports that the fifth prince and the crown prince have reached the Sky Span Mountain.

160
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,700
That's about three days travel from Yanzhi City.

161
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,640
Fifth Prince is also coming?

162
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,500
That child Chengyin also had a pitiful background.

163
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,200
I don't know what happened in the Li Imperial Court. I just find something strange about this.

164
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,510
My heart is somehow unsettled today.

165
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,060
Brother Mu, take a few men to assist them.

166
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,170
Be at ease and focus on your recuperation. I will go pick them up.

167
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,420
My Queen, Khan Tömür asked me to come and serve you.

168
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,440
You may leave.

169
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
Yes.

170
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,050
A'Du, come.

171
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,300
Xiaofeng grew up with you. Your bond is like that of sisters.

172
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,120
You wouldn't want to see her married to such a far off place as Li Empire, right?

173
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,150
All of this was caused by that Mingyuan.

174
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,700
It was she who bewitched the king!

175
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,260
Do you know what to do?

176
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,500
Yes, I understand.

177
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,590
Hurry, escort the crown prince away from here.

178
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,050
It's you?

179
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,330
Speak, who sent you?

180
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,430
No one.

181
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:05,600
There are no grudges between you and Consort Mingyuan. Why?

182
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,960
Once Consort Mingyuan dies, His Majesty may change his mind.

183
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,720
If this happens, then Xiaofeng needs not be married off.

184
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,960
That means you were sent by the queen.

185
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,500
Why spare me?

186
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,060
If Xiaofeng finds out that her own mother wants to kill Consort Mingyuan, she'll be very upset.

187
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,810
I spare you only because I don't want to upset Xiaofeng.

188
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,900
If you care so much about her, why can't you take her away?

189
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,530
Since you want to protect Consort Mingyuan,

190
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,300
then you should know that the queen wants to prevent this marriage alliance.

191
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,900
That's why she would even attempt to kill someone who is already near death.

192
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,780
Today, you can block me, but you will not be able stop the other attacks, both openly and covertly, from the palace.

193
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:01,700
You know that only if Xiaofeng leaves can Consort Mingyuan be safe.

194
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,400
A marriage alliance is a big thing between two countries, how can I be selfish?

195
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,240
There are many other princesses in the palace who are at the right age for marriage. Why must it be Ninth Princess?

196
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,830
Today, why did you ignore your own safety to protect me?

197
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,970
Is it because you knew that the assassins wouldn't harm you?

198
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,290
- Imperial Brother.
- Fifth Brother, I know you well.

199
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,450
I also know that you have nothing to do with this.

200
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,700
Even more so, I have never doubted your absolute sincerity in protecting me.

201
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,660
But I want to tell you this. Today you may be protected by someone,

202
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,910
but you could be harmed by someone the next day.

203
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:13,830
And those people could belong to the same group of people.

204
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,830
Those are the ones who are crazy about power and chase after it.

205
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,480
I'll remember it.

206
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,100
Uncle, how are things?

207
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,840
And what about Chengyin?

208
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,890
Fifth Prince is safe and sound.

209
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,880
Didn't you say the assassins were highly trained masters? Why did they fail?

210
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,700
It was all because Fifth Prince risked his own life in resistance. He used his own body to protect the abolished crown prince.

211
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,610
So even the highly trained masters couldn't do much. You spare the rat to save the vessel.

212
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,420
Chengyin... did he find out?

213
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,300
I'm not sure. But what he has done and how he behaved,

214
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,080
he may have figured it out.

215
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,450
It's all right if he finds that out. Sooner or later, he needs to know clearly where he stands.

216
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,800
It keeps him from doing silly things again.

217
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:31,080
Since the assassination failed, Li Chengji and his people should have arrived at Xi State by now.

218
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,300
What should we do next? Uncle, you may need to make plans in advance.

219
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:43,370
Fifth Brother, what kind of archery did you use today? How did you learn it?

220
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,100
My archery is taught by a gentleman named Chai Mu.

221
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,070
He repeatedly reminded me, unless there are no alternatives,

222
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,700
I absolutely cannot use this or tell to anyone else.

223
00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:00,500
This archery is similar to the Five Beads Continuous Arrows used by the Gu family in the past.

224
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Do you still remember your biological mother?

225
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,030
My biological mother...

226
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,400
My biological mother passed away when I was young.

227
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,080
I don't remember much about her.

228
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,600
Imperial Brother, why have you asked me this all of a sudden?

229
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,010
Oh, it's nothing. It just came to my mind so I casually asked.

230
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,000
Fifth Brother,

231
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,390
you keep this letter of the marriage alliance.

232
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,540
- Elder Brother.
- Take it!

233
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,470
Who's out there?

234
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,870
Teacher!

235
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,090
What are you doing here?

236
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,270
Taking you out of here.

237
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,950
Are you still willing to leave with me now?

238
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,510
I am a man of my words, unlike some other people.

239
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,810
All right, you leave the city first. Wait for me at the Parting Sand Dunes.

240
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,720
You are not leaving with me?

241
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,290
I promised Godfather that I would take care of Consort Mingyuan. Three days.

242
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,520
After three days, once Godfather comes back, I will go look for you.

243
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,630
Just as you said, three days. You'd better not lie to me.

244
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,820
Definitely.

245
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,300
Go, quickly!

246
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,370
Imperial Brother.

247
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,090
Go, quick!

248
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,730
Go!

249
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,820
Go!

250
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,510
Imperial Brother!

251
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,000
Imperial Brother!

252
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,200
Go! Go away quickly!

253
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,950
Go!

254
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,310
Elder Brother!

255
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,740
Inspect the scene.

256
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,500
Immediately close off the areas

257
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,320
fifty miles from here. No,

258
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,950
one hundred miles. Don't even let one bird out!

259
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,900
Immediately pen a letter and urgently deliver it. Report this matter to the capital.

260
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,970
Tell the whole Protectorate General Office to await further commands and discuss the next strategy.

261
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,200
Yes, Sir!

262
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,340
Peaceful days in the northwest have come to an end.

263
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,480
General, Fifth Prince's body has not been found.

264
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,800
And the strange thing is, no dead bodies of the assassins are found either.

265
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,170
It looks like this place has been cleaned up by people, but a weapon was discovered here.

266
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,770
It was under a dead body, left behind during the clean-up.

267
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,020
A Danchi people's weapon.

268
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,510
- General Cao.
- Yes.

269
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,500
Take a team to search for Fifth Prince along the road.

270
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,810
- Report immediately any news.
- Yes.

271
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,880
The rest of you, come with me to escort the crown prince's body

272
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,410
back to the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border.

273
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,730
Yes!

274
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,430
Why has Ninth Princess disappeared?

275
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Search. Go search her out.

276
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,640
Yes.

277
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,380
This person, take a look closely.

278
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,110
- Hey!
- Come take a look!

279
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,230
Here.

280
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,780
Gu Jian!

281
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,830
Go.

282
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,270
Godfather hasn't returned yet. I can't leave Consort Mingyuan alone.

283
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,600
Go and find Ninth Princess. I'll help you look after Consort Mingyuan.

284
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,000
If you take the princess away from here, I will no longer have a reason to harm Consort Mingyuan.

285
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,460
Princess has been gone for three days. What will happen if she doesn't see you and runs into some evildoers?

286
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,200
Okay, just this once I'll trust you.

287
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,650
Why is he still not here yet? Is he lying to me again?

288
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,060
Little horse, it's lucky that you accompanied me here.

289
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,970
Otherwise, I'd die of loneliness.

290
