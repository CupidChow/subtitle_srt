♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,630
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:44,350
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

[Episode 22]

17
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,540
[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,430
Yongniang.

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,510
Princess.

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,230
The imperial doctor already said that you need to rest after spraining your ankle!

21
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,710
Just lie down and rest.

22
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,530
Let me and A'Du take care of things for you.

23
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,980
I just wanted to take a walk in the backyard.

24
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,490
You hurt your foot in the yard!

25
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,610
I just hate myself for not watching you more carefully and let you come back late.

26
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,650
My foot is already fine now!

27
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,760
Princess, your wedding is in less than a month!

28
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,730
If anything bad happens that will delay the wedding, I will lose my life.

29
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,910
And you, Miss A'Du, stop wearing that set of clothes!

30
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,810
You are the personal maidservant of the princess.

31
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,960
You keep refusing to assimilate with the palace rules. What will other people think of the princess?

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,650
And... I told you not to sleep on the roof. How many times do I have to tell you?

33
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,780
Let's go. I'll bring you to go to sleep now.

34
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,800
Rest early, My Princess.

35
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,570
Is it interesting to sleep on the roof?

36
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,450
Gu Jian?!

37
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,130
Xiaofeng, I finally waited for you.

38
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,640
You... How did you know I was going to come out from here?

39
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,090
It's like waiting at a tree for a rabbit.

40
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:14,090
When you wait long enough, a rabbit will definitely come by.

41
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm not a rabbit!

42
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,470
There aren't many horse merchants in the capital.

43
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,430
I looked several days before finding this one.

44
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,700
He is yours from now on.

45
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,170
He looks a lot like my little red horse.

46
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:46,550
I also belong to you from now on.

47
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,520
I am your guardian. You can call me anytime.

48
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,050
How do I call you?

49
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,390
Whenever you want to see me or need my help,

50
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,590
just shoot this whistle arrow towards the sky and I'll appear.

51
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,390
Why would I look for you for no reason?

52
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,640
Besides, I have plenty of guards protecting me in the palace.

53
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,900
You might not need it now, but you'll definitely need it in the future.

54
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,820
Such as, when you want to leave the palace but can't get out.

55
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,240
All right, you make a point.

56
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,440
But I don't think I'll use it.

57
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,230
- I can't talk to you anymore. I have something urgent to do.
- What about?

58
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,750
I'm going to see Mi Luo and have her investigate something in the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

59
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,960
The Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas?

60
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,950
That's a royal temple.

61
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:57,170
Mi Luo has her wine house to take care of. Why involve her in this matter?

62
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,890
But I don't know anyone else in the capital.

63
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,280
You?

64
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,460
You forgot it that fast?

65
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,220
Didn't I just tell you that I am your guardian? So, naturally, I will ensure your safety.

66
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,010
Then, let's go.

67
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,360
- Slow down.
- Be careful.
- Okay.

68
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,760
- Over here.
- Here.
- Okay, be careful.

69
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,610
Over here.

70
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,370
Be a bit more careful.

71
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,030
Over here, spread a bit here.

72
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,410
They are—

73
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,220
- Hurry. Hurry.
- Okay.

74
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,680
It's good. It's good. Right.

75
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
I will have to trouble you with this piece.

76
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,600
- Look closer, okay?
- I think this is almost done.

77
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,250
Okay.

78
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,840
In a few more days, it will be the Lunar New Year's Day.

79
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,270
You have not celebrated the Lunar New Year in the capital, right?

80
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,500
During the Lunar New Year, it gets very festive in the capital.

81
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,640
First, we offer sacrifices to the gods

82
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,310
and then we have a large banquet that happens once a year.

83
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,620
It is all very festive and noisy up to the fifteenth night of the month.

84
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,430
There are all sorts of celebrations that go on and on.

85
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,980
Do you not like it when everything is lively and bustling?

86
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,880
Xiaofeng?

87
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,310
I am talking to you.

88
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,720
Imperial Great Grandmother, I am going to tell on someone.

89
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,490
Do what?

90
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,230
Didn't you and His Imperial Majesty decree Prince Yi and I

91
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,650
to investigate and verify that copper coins case?

92
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,720
He has clearly found evidence, but he does not want to make a report.

93
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,330
And he even returned all the evidence back.

94
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,190
Tell me. Does he not have selfish motives?

95
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,670
From my perspective, he does.

96
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,450
Recently, the palace has been preparing for the New Year's Eve dinner.

97
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,570
You seem to be very tired.

98
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:40,680
Although trivial matters of the palace require a great amount of effort, it's not really mentally exhausting.

99
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,200
The only things that waste my mental energy involve you.

100
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,380
Yin'er, you are the one who defeated Danchi,

101
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,890
but you instead demanded a laborious task of compiling a book.

102
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,530
I originally thought that compiling a book was just a pretense.

103
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,700
That perhaps, you had some idea on how to make your imperial father change his mind

104
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,660
and confer you the crown prince title.

105
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,910
But I did not think that you would indeed be sincerely compiling a book.

106
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,490
Imperial Mother, actually—

107
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,570
What? Have I said something wrong?

108
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:21,840
Imperial Mother, I actually do have a matter I would like you to help me make a decision on.

109
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,460
What is it?

110
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,040
My Lady. Reporting to Empress.

111
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,700
His Imperial Majesty is calling for Prince Yi to immediately go to Assuming the Rites Hall to see him.

112
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,950
Imperial Father.

113
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,880
I've heard that these two days, you didn't summon for the book writing officials.

114
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
You must be investigating the copper coins.

115
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,240
What's the progress on it?

116
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,080
Imperial Father, I still don't have any leads.

117
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,740
Do you not have any leads or are you scared to tell me?

118
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,100
Your Imperial Majesty.

119
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,810
Princess, tell me what did you discover?

120
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,760
Replying back to Your Imperial Majesty, Prince Yi already found leads from the account books of the Ministry of Revenue.

121
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,750
I even went with him to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas—

122
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,400
Imperial Father, the evidence that Ninth Princess is referring to are all speculations.

123
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,440
It can't be presented as evidence to the court.

124
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,150
I clearly saw them putting copper powder on a clay sculpture of Buddha in the middle of the night.

125
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,360
You dare to leave the palace at night?

126
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,470
You do not dare to openly investigate, so why can't I privately investigate?

127
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:03,810
Enough. Who is supervising the construction of the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas?

128
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,260
Responding to Your Majesty, it is Li Yan.

129
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,500
Tell him to come here.

130
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,910
Yes.

131
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,870
Wait. Bring the crown prince as well.

132
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,650
I will obey.

133
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,190
What does this have to do with the crown prince?

134
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,820
Shut your mouth.

135
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,350
The crown prince is here!

136
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,370
- Imperial Father.
- Your Imperial Majesty.

137
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,930
It's... It's... It's him, Your Imperial Majesty.

138
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,310
The person that I saw at the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas was him!

139
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,840
Plus, when I knocked on the Buddha statue, he became flustered.

140
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,090
If he didn't know that the Buddha statue was made of clay,

141
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,360
why would he be flustered?

142
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,390
What are you saying, Ninth Princess?

143
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,370
I was ordered to make the statues.

144
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,460
What's wrong with me being slightly worried about the statues?

145
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,690
Let me ask you then. Where did you get the copper for making the statues?

146
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,770
Of course, it was given by the Ministry of Revenue.

147
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,740
Given by the Ministry of Revenue? Let me tell you this.

148
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,990
Prince Yi and I have investigated the Ministry of Revenue.

149
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,680
Every year, the Li Empire only mines no more than 150,000 kilograms of copper.

150
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,550
Out of all this, 50,000 kilograms are used to make official coins.

151
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,180
But currently, there are counterfeit coins that are double the number of official coins circulating in the market.

152
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,390
That means the total amount of copper on the market has now surpassed 150,000 kilograms of copper.

153
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,580
With that said, the origin of your copper must not be simple.

154
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,700
Prince Yi and you dared to privately investigate my Ministry of Revenue's accounting book.

155
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,010
When I was working on the Xi State Annals, I accidentally saw that among the archives.

156
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,610
Your Imperial Majesty, I don't know how I've offended Prince Yi and Ninth Princess.

157
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:13,410
I am unjustly accused. Your Imperial Majesty, please take charge.

158
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,150
Crown Prince, what do you think?

159
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,790
Imperial Father, I am very close to Li Yan.

160
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,230
I don't dare to discuss it since I may be considered biased.

161
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,280
I'm allowing you to say it.

162
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,640
Li Yan puts a lot of effort in watching over the production of the Buddhist statues in the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

163
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,140
I cannot say that he did his job perfectly, but he tried his best.

164
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,230
However, embezzlement of the copper used for the Buddhist statues is a grave crime.

165
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,520
I believe that Li Yan would not do such things.

166
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,920
With only Ninth Princess' words,

167
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,250
I am afraid it is too unreliable.

168
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,320
What do you mean?

169
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,680
Your Imperial Majesty, I don't understand what goes on in the court and I don't have any grudges with anyone.

170
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,850
I'm just acting under your command and I want to find the truth.

171
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,040
If they don't believe me, they can go to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas and just open up the statues.

172
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,810
Your Majesty, the Buddhist statues have already been put up for people to pay their respects.

173
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,310
If we open them up, I am afraid that the faithful will be outraged.

174
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,060
It is against the way of Buddha.

175
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,640
I am afraid it will lead to unwanted disasters, Your Imperial Majesty!

176
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,720
Isn't producing a fake statue also against the way of Buddha?

177
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,980
If we open the statues but find no problems,

178
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,210
who will take the responsibility for angering the gods and the faithful?

179
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,280
This is actually not a hard choice.

180
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,250
If we don't open up the statues, how would we know if there's any problem?

181
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,720
Your Imperial Majesty, we can tell if it's real or fake without breaking open the statues.

182
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,650
You know how?

183
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,190
If a statue is made from mud,

184
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,440
then its weight will be different from the copper weight recorded by the Ministry of Revenue.

185
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,580
Therefore, why don't we just weigh it?

186
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,960
Good, let's do it that way.

187
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,430
To prevent anyone doing any tricks...

188
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,340
- Ceng Xian.
- Present.

189
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,060
Take the Shenwu (Divine Military) Army to close the temple immediately.

190
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,890
Tomorrow, I will personally preside over the investigation.

191
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,440
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty!

192
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,610
[Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas]

193
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,900
[Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas]

194
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,790
Look, how large!

195
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,620
Yes.

196
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,220
- Where is it dragging it to?
- I've never seen anything like this before.

197
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,630
It's the first time I've seen such a scene.

198
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,840
Wow, I wish my wife was here to see this.

199
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,040
It's coming.

200
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,860
Why use the elephant to drag the statue?

201
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,890
Weighing the statue. They will use a boat to weigh the statue.

202
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,700
This is the first time.

203
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,370
Look at that!

204
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,350
What a grand sight.

205
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,590
Your Imperial Majesty, the copper statue's weight

206
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,920
is completely identical to what's recorded in the Ministry of Revenue's records.

207
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,250
Ninth Princess, how about it now?

208
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,680
Do we need to weigh another statue?

209
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,130
Your Imperial Majesty, I witnessed people brushing a mud statue with copper paint.

210
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,190
Someone must have exchanged the statue.

211
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,930
Your Imperial Majesty, I personally guarded overnight at the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

212
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,610
It's impossible that the statue was exchanged.

213
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,890
Impossible, I saw it myself.

214
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,690
Someone bet their life to force a military command.

215
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,110
Now, they want to deny it in public.

216
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,700
Li Yan, be forgiving when you win.

217
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,130
Ninth Princess is not in the military. What military command?

218
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,760
Let's treat it as setting up a stage and accompanying Ninth Princess and Fifth Little Brother to watch a show.

219
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,880
Imperial Father, since Ninth Princess insists that she witnessed it herself,

220
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,090
I recommend that we check one more statue as suggested by her.

221
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,720
Ridiculous! Do you think our royal reputation is a child's game to play?

222
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,730
Ninth Princess, from now on, these situations should be discussed with me.

223
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,240
Prince Yi!

224
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,750
Thank yoiu for talking on my behalf earlier.

225
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,430
No need.

226
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,440
I got you involved in this problem.

227
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,150
It doesn't make sense for only you to be wronged,

228
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,630
but you should stop here.

229
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,360
You're on your own.

230
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,180
Your Highness, are you confused?

231
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,880
How could you have stopped the emperor today and say those words?

232
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:56,560
She was fighting on the front line. I can't just cower behind her. Right?

233
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,410
Besides, it started with me, so I should stand by her.

234
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,060
Your reckless behavior today will upset Prime Minister Gao.

235
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:11,560
We haven't made a firm footing yet. We can't afford to alienate Prime Minister Gao.

236
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,150
Yes, I will take care of things with him.

237
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,260
Your Highness, you must think thrice before acting in the future.

238
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,890
Do not let your emotions get the better of you.

239
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,130
Yes, I understand.

240
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,140
Grand Uncle.

241
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,550
Your Highness, it's already very late. May I know—

242
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,380
Grand Uncle, sit first.

243
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,880
- Why are you here? Why?
- Please take a seat.

244
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,180
Come, sit down.

245
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,070
Your Highness, tell me why.

246
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,200
I am here to beg forgiveness to Grand Uncle.

247
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,850
I was reckless and ruined a good plan that you and Uncle had arranged for me.

248
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
Hence, I made such a big blunder.

249
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:44,450
You are still young. It's understandable that you get impulsive.

250
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,820
Grand Uncle, I was just thinking at the time that since the matter had come to that,

251
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,490
someone had to speak up for Ninth Princess because of her prestigious position.

252
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,550
So, I stood up.

253
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,960
I was too impulsive.

254
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,330
From now on, I will closely remember the teachings from you and Imperial Mother.

255
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,720
I will not do things without your knowledge.

256
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,420
Forget it.

257
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,960
Make a mistake, learn a lesson. Just remember these lessons well.

258
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,590
Yes.

259
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
[Eastern Palace]

260
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:28,240
Whenever I think of how Li Chengyin rushed to get scolded today, I just want to laugh.

261
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,650
He and Ninth Princess have become the biggest joke in the world.

262
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:44,220
- Father.
- You, get down!

263
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,260
I need to thank you for today, Uncle.

264
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,510
It's all thanks to your cautious undertaking to switch the statues.

265
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,110
Otherwise, Li Yan and I wouldn't have been able to get out of this.

266
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,220
Your Highness is overstating what I did.

267
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,670
It's still old ginger that's the spiciest.

268
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,420
So what if Li Chengyin has Prime Minister Gao behind him? He's no match with my dad.

269
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,700
Shut your mouth!

270
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,520
You made such a huge mistake. You almost lost your head!

271
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,300
Dad, isn't everything solved now?

272
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,800
You couldn't even deal with a teenager.

273
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,360
If... If not because she's the future crown princess consort, I would have taken care of her.

274
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,240
Even though we stopped the problem here,

275
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,310
Fifth has already found out about the secret dealings.

276
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,400
We can't maneuver anymore.

277
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,480
Fifth Brother knows too much. I am very concerned.

278
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,510
If you ask me, just get rid of him, so he won't trouble us anymore.

279
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,280
Quit your ridiculous talk.

280
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,590
This is the capital, not the Western Border.

281
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,090
Uncle is exactly right.

282
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,700
This is the capital; hence, we should use the capital's methods.

283
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,380
It seems Your Highness has new ideas.

284
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,900
Your Highness!

285
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,760
Sese! Why are you here?

286
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,130
Hurry! Go inside. Come.

287
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:50,940
[Prince Yi Manor]

288
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,910
Come.

289
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,920
You could have sent someone to tell me you were coming.

290
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,710
Why stand outside by yourself for so long?

291
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,930
I heard what happened in the palace today and was very worried.

292
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,020
I could only think about seeing Your Highness quickly.

293
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,860
I didn't come to blame Your Highness.

294
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,630
I know that you always do things with your own principles.

295
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,470
No matter what, I will always support you.

296
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,200
Sese, thank you for being concerned.

297
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,370
But Your Highness and that ninth princess... are...

298
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,560
We were just ordered by His Imperial Majesty to investigate this case together.

299
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,310
She is the future crown princess consort.

300
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,430
You need to watch your distance with her,

301
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:02,220
so that there won't be speculations and rumors.

302
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:08,490
Everyone knows that you and I like each other, so why would there be rumors about someone else?

303
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,530
With those words, all my worries are gone.

304
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,530
[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

305
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,140
Come.

306
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,990
They are here! Hurry!

307
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,660
Princess—

308
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,910
Quick!

309
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,050
- Xiaofeng!
- Yongning! Luoxi! You two are finally here!

310
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,230
The snow is so heavy today. I thought you wouldn't come.

311
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,560
How could we not? It wasn't easy to get this from Imperial Great Grandmother.

312
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,370
From what I can tell, you used Xiaofeng as a cover to convince Great Grandmother to allow us.

313
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,980
And for whom did I do it?

314
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,630
I heard that someone else is going today so that's why it must be today.

315
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,710
It's a good thing that it's snowing so much.

316
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,910
We can bathe in the hot spring, then drink tea while enjoying the beautiful snowy scenery.

317
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,870
That's the beauty of life.

318
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,730
Let's not talk anymore and leave now,

319
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,610
so we can bathe in the hot spring around 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.

320
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,260
Let's hurry and leave now then.

321
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,650
Let's go!

322
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,860
[Clear Dew Hall]

323
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,860
Let's go, Xiaofeng! I'll take you to find Yongning.

324
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,660
It's so beautiful!

325
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,600
Yongning runs so fast.

326
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,280
We only took a slightly longer route, and she has already gone in!

327
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,760
Be quiet. I'll scare her a little.

328
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,920
Okay, let's go.

329
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,590
I caught you!

330
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,430
Xiaofeng!

331
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,610
Your Highness, are you okay?

332
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,270
Do not turn around.

333
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,110
- Take Luoxi away.
- Okay.

334
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,080
Let's go.

335
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,840
You still are not leaving? It's disrespectful to look!

336
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,590
You are the one who burst in.

337
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,450
Why do I have to leave? It makes no sense.

338
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,490
If you do not wish to go, I am fine with that.

339
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,300
I will not leave then. What can you do to me?

340
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,340
Why does your head hurt again?

341
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,690
Am I your nemesis, causing your head to hurt every time you see me?

342
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,660
Fortunately, I do not have to marry you.

343
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,440
Then, I have to thank you for your kindness in not marrying me.

344
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,690
With a gentle and virtuous Lady Zhao,

345
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,930
it must be the world's best marriage.

346
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,120
- Xiaofeng, you are...
- Your Highness the Crown Prince.

347
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,170
I did not run into you, did I?

348
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,720
I did not think you would be here. Where are you headed to?

349
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,360
I cannot find Luoxi.

350
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,560
I just saw someone hastily rushing towards the Side Hall.

351
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,050
It seemed like it was Luoxi.

352
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,220
Xiaofeng!

353
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:32,900
This ninth princess, she is supposed to marry you, but why does she run away from you when she sees you?

354
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,000
Where can she run to?

355
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,550
Spare me! Spare me!

356
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,120
Halt!

357
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,820
Prince Yi, I beg you! Please save me!

358
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,190
Your Highness Prince Yi!

359
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,180
Prince Yi?

360
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,360
Are you not satisfied with the Buddhist statue incident that you have to meddle with the Crown Prince's affair now?

361
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,200
This is my servant.

362
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,270
Even if she is to be punished, there are palace regulations to follow.

363
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,350
It is not your place to privately punish her.

364
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:04,020
This despicable servant frightened the crown prince's horse.

365
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:08,680
If I flogged her or even if she died one hundred times,

366
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,820
it would not be a pity.

367
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,920
Her punishment should be up to me, her master.

368
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,530
No need for Heir Apparent to exert any effort on it.

369
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,220
Chan'er, get up. Let's go.

370
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,320
Yes.

371
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,000
Prince Yi, could this lowly servant be your lover? Why are you defending her like this?

372
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,850
As the heir apparent, you should watch your words.

373
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,260
Do not be like a lowly servant.

374
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,850
What did you say?

375
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:46,210
Imperial Brother, I will naturally handle my servants.

376
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,180
I will take away this servant then.

377
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:52,660
- Let's go.
- Fifth Brother!

378
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,120
Today, this servant defied me.

379
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,430
I wish for her to stay here and I will bring her back to my manor to punish her.

380
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:32,610
Unless you believe that I do not handle matters fairly?

381
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,650
I do not dare.

382
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,000
I assumed you would not.

383
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,450
Imperial Brother, the two of us should not become unhappy because of a servant.

384
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,750
Since Imperial Brother wishes to personally mete out the punishment,

385
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,930
then in a few days, I will send someone to fetch her.

386
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:05,240
I ask Imperial Brother that for my sake, allow her to live.

387
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,230
Xiaofeng!

388
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,240
- Luoxi, do you two not know?
- Yongning, what is it?
- Yongning.

389
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,490
Just now, Fifth Brother and Li Yan got into an argument over a servant.

390
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,140
Fifth Brother got stopped by the men of the crown prince, and later left in a rage.

391
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,320
That severe? Then, what about General Pei Zhao?

392
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,560
He left. If you chase him now, you might be able to catch him.

393
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:49,160
Luoxi, have you three had dinner yet?

394
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,820
Responding to Brother Crown Prince, not yet.

395
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,120
At this time, if you head back to the palace, you will miss dinner.

396
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,510
I have already had people prepare dinner.

397
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,590
Once you all have eaten, I can send you three back to the palace.

398
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,860
There is no need, Crown Prince...

399
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,390
Xiaofeng, you seem to really love drinking white fungus snow pear soup.

400
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:32,340
This is quite delicious.

401
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,200
Girls like sweet foods.

402
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,230
If you love to drink it, I can let you have my bowl.

403
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,680
There is no need, Crown Prince. How could I want your things?

404
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,250
There is no harm. In the future, we will be husband and wife.

405
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:55,810
Not just a bowl of soup, but I will give you whatever you want.

406
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,100
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

407
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,300
Even if you love drinking it, you should drink a bit slower. Otherwise, you will choke on it.

408
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,430
Yongning. Luoxi. Would you two like some sweets as well?

409
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,250
No, thank you, Brother Crown Prince.

410
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,250
Xiaofeng.

411
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,580
Xiaofeng, what is wrong with you?

412
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,310
What is wrong?

413
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,680
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

414
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,210
Xiaofeng!

415
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,040
The emperor has arrived!

416
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,930
- Greetings, Your Imperial Majesty. Greetings, Empress.
- Greetings, Imperial Father. Greetings, Empress.

417
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,520
How could she be poisoned? How is she now?

418
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,660
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty, the ninth princess was heavily poisoned.

419
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,160
For now, I have performed acupuncture on her to delay the poison.

420
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,100
But if the ninth princess does not consume the antidote within three days, I am afraid...

421
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,060
Then, why are you not concocting the antidote?

422
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,360
The poison is very peculiar.

423
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,790
I... also cannot tell exactly what this is.

424
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,460
Let me tell you! No matter what, you must get her to wake up!

425
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,070
Yes!

426
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,560
Seal off the Imperial Villa and investigate thoroughly. The assailant must be found.

427
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,490
I have received your orders.

428
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,490
You. Bring her in.

429
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,780
No, it is not me! No!

430
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,940
What have you discovered? Quickly, tell me.

431
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,360
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty.

432
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,390
I thoroughly investigated the food that the ninth princess took yesterday.

433
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,780
Aside from a bowl of white fungus snow pear soup,

434
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,660
nothing else contained poison.

435
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,880
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty.

436
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,550
I have already interrogated and investigated all the servants in the Imperial Buttery of the Imperial Villa.

437
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,110
No one was suspicious.

438
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,750
I also didn't find any poison hidden in the entire villa.

439
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,260
Then, in these past two days, who has entered the Imperial Villa?

440
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,420
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty and Your Highness the Crown Prince.

441
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,390
I, Lu Pingzhang, am the chief steward of the Imperial Villa.

442
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,090
Up until yesterday, only His Highness the Crown Prince, Prince Yi, Princess Yongning,

443
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,510
Princess Luoxi, Xi State's Ninth Princess,

444
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:07,360
and the people that Heir Apparent Li brought with him have entered the Imperial Villa.

445
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,220
Because Prince Yi arrived around noon,

446
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,980
he initially planned to leave until after lunch today.

447
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,810
But at around 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. last night, he had left with General Pei.

448
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,910
Princess Yongning, Princess Luoxi, and the Ninth Princess arrived between 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.

449
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,600
His Highness the Crown Prince and the Heir Apparent both arrived at the end of this time.

450
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,750
Apart from this, except for some of their entourage that followed them,

451
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,650
no one else entered the Imperial Villa.

452
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:39,010
Tell me clearly. Why did Prince Yi leave early?

453
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:44,860
Prince Yi was... was because...

454
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,850
Your Imperial Majesty, yesterday Prince Yi and I nearly got into a fight before he left.

455
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,590
Li Yan, be polite in front of His Imperial Majesty.

456
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,260
Your Imperial Majesty, allow me to clearly explain it.

457
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,080
Continue.

458
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,710
Yesterday, one of Prince Yi's servants scared the Crown Prince's horse,

459
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,960
so I wished to teach the servant a lesson on behalf of the crown prince.

460
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,250
But who would have thought that Prince Yi would stop me before I even said anything?

461
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,160
I also just barely escaped being hit by Prince Yi.

462
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,320
Later, due to Crown Prince's

463
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,060
strenuous persuasion, Prince Yi let the matter drop.

464
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,910
That day, Prince Yi brought General Pei with him.

465
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,000
From the look of things, if a fight had erupted,

466
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,230
I am afraid that they would have even fought Crown Prince.

467
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,790
Stop talking. His Imperial Majesty wishes for us, brothers, to be friendly.

468
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,250
It's my fault for not being able to stop him today.

469
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,630
Imperial Father, this is all my fault.

470
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,640
Lu Pingzhang, continue speaking.

471
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,590
Yes, I meticulously interrogated and investigated the servants in the Imperial Buttery, but no outsiders went in there.

472
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:56,020
Your Imperial Majesty, if there was no outsider, then that means it's someone from within.

473
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,810
Then, who exactly sent the sweet snacks?

474
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:03,250
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty. It was I who was assigned to deliver them.

475
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,190
But Prince Yi's servant, Chan'er, took the sweets from me outside the hall.

476
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,890
She personally delivered it inside.

477
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,530
Do not speak nonsense!

478
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,160
I personally saw this myself!

479
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,940
Bring her in.

480
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,060
Yes!

481
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,190
Bring her in!

482
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,970
Your Imperial Majesty, I have been wronged. I have been wronged.

483
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:31,950
Responding to Your Majesty. When we were catching this maidservant,

484
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,200
she was dumping the contents of this pouch into a pond.

♫ Matters of the past life ♫

509
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:39,120
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

510
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,070
♫ A long dream ♫

511
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,740
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

512
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:53,660
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

513
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,800
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

514
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,480
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

515
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,480
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

516
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,100
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

517
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,020
♫ Time reverses ♫

518
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,150
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

519
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:23,250
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

520
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,470
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

521
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:29,130
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

522
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:32,140
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

523
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,880
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

524
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,600
♫ Time reverses ♫

525
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,850
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

526
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:50,010
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

527
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:56,550
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

528
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:03,700
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
