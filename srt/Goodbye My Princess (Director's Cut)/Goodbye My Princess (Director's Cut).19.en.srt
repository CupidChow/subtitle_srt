[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,280
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,990
Mi Luo!

4
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,780
Mi Luo.

5
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,490
- I'm back.
- Xiaofeng, so you're back.

6
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,950
Look, A'Du has been here waiting for you for a long time.

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,700
I don't know who has provoked her.

8
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,820
She's so angry that she can't even breathe!

9
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,110
It's all right, A'Du.

10
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,440
Well...

11
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,800
How about, Mingyue, since you and everyone are here today,

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,110
I'll buy everyone a drink.

13
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,590
- That's right!
- Go. Let's go!

14
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,910
Go over there and help me bring out the dishes.

15
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,820
- Go help.
- I'll get you some delicious food to eat.

16
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,220
Mingyue, let's go!

17
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,510
Here, try this.

18
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,680
You all go ahead and eat. I'll have to go and greet the guests.

19
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,470
Wait. I have to go with you to get the cold dispelling wine. I may forget about it if I get drunk later on.

20
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,340
Let's go, A'Du.

21
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,650
Brother Gu Jian, I didn't think you were still alive.

22
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,870
Yan'er.

23
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm now Mingyue of Singing Jade Brothel.

24
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,010
I'm not the Chen family's Yan'er anymore.

25
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,850
I don't deserve that name.

26
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,600
You should just call me Mingyue.

27
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,890
But how could you be at Singing Jade Brothel?

28
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,680
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,010
Hold it carefully.

30
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,640
Sister Mingyue, don't be sad.

31
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,020
In my opinion, those rich men are all disgusting.

32
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,050
What's so great about looking so arrogant and unstoppable.

33
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,790
Just because they like Sister Mingyue, must you then do what they want?

34
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,640
Does the Li Empire even have laws anymore?

35
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,020
You don't understand.

36
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,230
The Gao and Zhao families are top government officials.

37
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,080
Especially that Gao Zhen.

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,630
He is Shangjing City's infamous young ruffian.

39
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,870
No one dares to defy him.

40
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,040
I don't believe that. Is there no one who can control him?

41
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,320
Sister Mingyue, you keep being fought over by those people.

42
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,940
Have you never thought about leaving Singing Jade Brothel?

43
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,450
Xiaofeng is right.

44
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,650
Miss Mingyue, you indeed should leave this kind of place.

45
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,800
Leave?

46
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,550
Where would I even go?

47
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,300
Who is it?

48
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,470
Jian'er...

49
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,400
Where have you been these last few months?

50
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,060
I heard from Pei Zhao that someone snuck into the palace a few days ago.

51
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,020
Was it you?

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,560
Why didn't you come and find me when you got to Shangjing?

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,580
Are you still blaming me?

54
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,180
I saw Yan'er.

55
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,720
Yan'er?

56
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,510
She's still alive?

57
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,880
Where is she?

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,650
Singing Jade Brothel.

59
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,730
These past years, she has been residing in Singing Jade Brothel and became a courtesan.

60
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,940
It's my fault.

61
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,770
You didn't tell her that

62
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,690
I was still alive, right?

63
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,300
Good.

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
It's good that you didn't tell her.

65
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,460
Jian'er!

66
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,860
Where are you going?

67
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,770
I just came to tell you about Yan'er.

68
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,520
If you want to find me, come to Mi Luo Drinking House.

69
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,720
It's dangerous outside.

70
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,810
Why don't you move back in?

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,750
No thanks.

72
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,720
I have already obtained the badge that would allow me to enter the six ministries without a problem.

73
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,750
Where should we start investigating?

74
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,740
Ministry of Revenue.

75
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,790
Your Highness Prince Yi.

76
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,180
Ninth Princess?

77
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,500
What's wrong?

78
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,980
Last time, didn't you get sick because of me?

79
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,330
I especially used our Xi State's grape wine to make you a cold dispelling medicine.

80
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,290
Also, the aged ginger in here was boiled by me for six hours.

81
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,370
Try it!

82
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,330
Ninth Princess, my cold is all cured.

83
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,730
Thank you for worrying about me.

84
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,080
How could you recover so quickly?

85
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,060
Even if you're not sick, you can still drink it. It tastes really good!

86
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,390
I am telling you, this tastes way better than the white spirits from your Li Empire.

87
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,220
Plus, I snuck out of the palace just to get this. It's from a friend of mine. Here.

88
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,720
Friend?

89
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,430
Ninth Princess, you haven't been out of the palace in these last three months, have you?

90
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,740
Where did you make this friend?

91
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,810
Oh, right.

92
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,340
You don't have to care that much. But anyway, just drink a bit every day.

93
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,940
I guarantee you'll get completely cured in three to five days.

94
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,350
You hold it for him.

95
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,230
Shi'en.

96
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,240
I truly want to thank you.

97
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,340
You saved me twice. I want to be friends with you.

98
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,070
You really want to thank me?

99
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,180
How could that be false? Tell me. What do you want?

100
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,560
I guarantee that I can fulfill it.

101
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,570
Fine. I'll pretend that you truly want to thank me.

102
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,420
Regarding the gift of gratitude, I have not yet thought it through. Allow me some more time to think.

103
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,600
- Okay.
-  Ninth Princess!

104
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
- Ninth Princess! 
- Oh, no.

105
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,650
Hurry up and hold it. Just tell me when you have thought of something.

106
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,440
I'm coming!

107
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,040
Your Highness.

108
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,370
Young Lord.

109
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,160
Young Lord Gu, we are closing.

110
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,400
Young Lord Gu!

111
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,480
Young Lord Gu!

112
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,040
Young Lord, you drank too much.

113
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,780
Young Lord Gu, where do you live?

114
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,670
How about I ask someone to take you home?

115
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,640
I have no home.

116
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,570
I see that Young Lord has a lot on your mind.

117
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,350
How about... telling me about it?

118
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,650
Those with the same misfortune sympathize with each other.

119
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,940
Grandfather passed away, I have no relatives either.

120
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,180
I don't know where to go.

121
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,630
If there's really no place where you can go, then go to the capital.

122
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,220
[Mi Luo Drinking House]

123
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,110
Greetings to Imperial Great Grandmother!

124
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,470
Sit, please.

125
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,790
Can you all see those?

126
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,920
Recently, there were some envoys from vassal states

127
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,530
who gifted us with so many tributary gifts.

128
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:51,840
Your Imperial Majesty sent me some superior ones.

129
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,130
Do you want to see?

130
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,450
Little ladies like yourselves will surely like them.

131
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,540
Go pick.

132
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,880
Pick whichever one you like.

133
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,920
Take whichever you want.

134
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,900
Imperial Great Grandmother, I pick these.

135
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,910
That's not for yourself, it's for your mother consort.

136
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,570
Since Great Grandmother already said so, I might as well pick some more.

137
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,320
Great Grandmother, I like this one.

138
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,740
Really, take it if you like it.

139
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,950
If you like anything else, go take another look.

140
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,660
Is the food more precious or the treasures?

141
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,960
Of course, it's the food!

142
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,680
What they took can only be looked at, can't be eaten.

143
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,770
It would just gather dust in my room.

144
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,010
If I wear it, I'll just worry about it getting lost. I don't like it.

145
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,550
What do you like?

146
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,990
I like to go out and play!

147
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,480
Foolish little girl, only cares about going out to play.

148
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,850
Do you want to go outside?

149
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,930
Then go out.

150
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,330
Really?

151
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,090
Xiaofeng, do you like cuju?
['cuju' is the ancient Chinese form of soccer]

152
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,510
Tomorrow, there will be a "cuju" game at the Forbidden Park.

153
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,740
All the sons of the royal family and high officials will be there.

154
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,650
"Cuju?"

155
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,970
Not only do I like it, I also know how to play.

156
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,470
At our great plains,

157
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,740
there's an annual "cuju" competition. It's so much fun!

158
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,610
Can I go play tomorrow?

159
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,030
No way. You dare join a men's "cuju" game?

160
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,610
My future sister-in-law, don't scare my crown prince brother.

161
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,890
What is the problem?

162
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,830
Since you have such an interest, why don't we...

163
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,990
Tomorrow, let Yingqiao take you all out.

164
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,920
Kicking is not possible, but watching is doable.

165
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,550
Sure! Sure! Thank you, Great Grandmother!

166
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,950
Why are we changing the audience's seating at the last minute?

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Official Zhao, sorry for causing any inconvenience.

168
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,210
This morning, Grand Empress Dowager ordered me to

169
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,690
bring the princesses here to watch the match.

170
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,880
Originally, there weren't seats for females here.

171
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,210
Now, we have to change the seats around,

172
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,710
and let the officials originally seated on the east side to transfer to the west.

173
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,530
Let the imperial consorts just sit a bit closer with the different royal relatives on the east side.

174
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,700
That way, we can fulfill Grand Empress Dowager's wishes without breaking the palace rules.

175
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,220
Please forgive us for any trouble we've caused.

176
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,680
Fine. Fine. Let's go.

177
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,330
Sister Yingqiao!

178
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,170
- This way please.
- Thank you.

179
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,560
- Xiaofeng!
- Xiaofeng!

180
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,270
Luoxi! Yongning! You're here already.

181
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,290
- You sit here.
- Why?

182
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,680
Why are you both here so early?

183
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,140
Because someone wants to see not only the "cuju" game.

184
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,070
Yongning.

185
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,300
Whose family do those two young lords belong to?

186
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,460
That one is Prime Minister Gao Yuming's youngest son, Gao Zhen.

187
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,030
See that one? He is the son of General Zhao of the Second Rank, Zhao Shixuan.

188
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:24,030
He's also Zhao Sese's brother.

189
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,830
Gao Zhen is a master when it comes to "cuju,"

190
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,170
but this time he's playing against Zhao Shixuan,

191
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,030
so he's slightly at a disadvantage.

192
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,280
Why?

193
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,850
It's because even though Gao Zhen is good at this game,

194
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,830
his team is composed of ordinary guards from his manor.

195
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,150
It's different with Zhao Shixuan.

196
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,240
His team is formed by members carefully selected

197
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,090
by him from General Zhao's Shuoyang Army.

198
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,850
They are all good players.

199
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,130
Gao Zhen won't be able to win this time.

200
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,000
Oh no! Oh no!

201
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,690
Then, Gao Zhen might get into a fight with Zhao Shixuan.

202
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,380
Why would Gao Zhen get into a fight with Zhao Shixuan?

203
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,280
Do you know those two?

204
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,940
No, I don't know them! I'm just guessing.

205
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,960
Hopefully, nothing happens.

206
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,560
Good!

207
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Good! Good!

208
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,380
Good! Good!

209
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,930
Good!

210
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,650
That's fantastic! Bravo!

211
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,220
Let's go again!

212
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,390
Listen up. With Prince Yi behind us, the Zhao team won't dare touch us.

213
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,300
When we start again, you go ahead and use your killing strikes.

214
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,430
How come this Zhao Shixuan doesn't know to back off a little?

215
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,900
This Gao Zhen is definitely looking for revenge.

216
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,220
What revenge?

217
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,630
Is there any conflict between them?

218
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,320
You don't know. It's to fight for the top courtesan at Singing Jade Brothel.

219
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Gao Zhen hasn't liked Zhao Shixuan for quite some time.

220
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,710
This time, they'll probably get into a real fight.

221
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,620
Singing Jade Brothel?

222
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,260
Older Brother!

223
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,590
Gao Zhen, you are clearly hurting people with bad intentions.

224
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,020
In the "cuju" field, the victor is the king.

225
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,510
Who told him to have such a weak body?

226
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,460
- That doesn't mean you can kick people!
- Right!

227
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,380
Stop!

228
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,810
Brother, are you all right?

229
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,790
Imperial doctor! Imperial doctor!

230
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,860
Your Highness the Crown Prince, Assistant Minister Zhao is hurt badly.

231
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,930
It was just an accident during the ball game. How could it be that serious?

232
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,640
Crown Prince, I saw with my own eyes that Gao Zhen purposely kicked my brother.

233
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,230
Sese, you misunderstood. In a "cuju" game, it is impossible to avoid some injury.

234
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,420
I was on the side earlier. Gao Zhen didn't mean to hurt your brother.

235
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,030
But—

236
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,650
Brother!

237
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,280
Sese, drop it.

238
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,330
Hurry and carry him away!

239
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,020
Sese!

240
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,860
Be careful.

241
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,030
Your Highness!

242
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,890
Zhao Shixuan and Gao Zhen have been

243
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,130
competing for the top courtesan Mingyue's affection for a while.

244
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,580
Everyone in town knows about this already.

245
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,360
That Mingyue even asked her madam not to make her see Gao Zhen anymore.

246
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,810
If we're talking about looks, Zhao Shixuan is indeed more handsome.

247
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,890
Let's talk about official business.

248
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,510
There's news from the palace that since yesterday, Li Chengyin has claimed to be ill

249
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:46,050
and practically locked himself inside the Luminous Benevolence Hall.

250
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,060
He is probably too embarrassed to see people.

251
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,570
I understand Prince Yi less and less.

252
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,180
Although the Zhao family is not as powerful as the Gao family and the Pei family,

253
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,890
their army has always been stationed at the southwestern region.

254
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,540
If the Zhao family allies with Prince Yi, then it's also allying with Prime Minister Gao.

255
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,850
We have to prevent that.

256
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,510
I initially thought Li Chengyin was just a romantic.

257
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,140
I never thought that he was wooing Zhao Sese for this reason.

258
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,150
I also used to look down on the Zhao family.

259
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,730
But Zhao Jingyu has repeatedly expressed his desire to marry his daughter to me as a second rank consort.

260
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,360
I never expected that Zhao Sese would fall in love with Prince Yi.

261
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,250
I'll have to reconsider that decision then.

262
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,180
If Zhao Jingyu has this idea,

263
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,120
why doesn't Your Highness just accept her?

264
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,990
Besides, it's not that big of a deal.

265
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,520
We'll have to see what Miss Zhao thinks.

266
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,550
If she supports Prince Yi wholeheartedly, then it would be complicated.

267
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,540
Crown Prince, Miss Zhao sent this box over.

268
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,080
[Letter from Miss Zhao]

269
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,760
Miss Zhao thanks me for being thoughtful of her

270
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,340
and says she'll repay the favor in the future.

271
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,740
Your Highness, whatever you desire is indeed coming true.

272
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,900
Enough. It's all right that your act is stiff.

273
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,050
It'll become more natural the more you do it.

274
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,270
The most important part is knowing the rules of the palace.

275
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,650
Recite the Lessons for Women.

276
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,680
I wish to know how much you understand.

277
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,520
Yes.

278
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,550
"Refined and gentle, chaste, with moral principles

279
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,340
are the inner virtues that a woman should have.

280
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,290
Plus, the external virtues filial piety, respect, benevolence, being insightful,

281
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:29,550
kindness, peaceful relations, gentleness, and submissiveness: a woman would then be completely virtuous.

282
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,450
A person...

283
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,460
A person..."

284
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,840
What is it?

285
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,050
- ...is born with these virtues—
- Directress Fang!

286
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,720
I am here!

287
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,650
You've taught the Ninth Princess for so long.

288
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,710
Why can't she even recite the "Lessons of a Woman" completely? (T/N: Should actually be the "Virtuous Nature" chapter of "Teachings for the Inner Court" by Empress Renxiaowen of the Ming Empire)

289
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,330
You're even the top female official at the ceremonial services.

290
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,160
I think your reputation is exaggerated.

291
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,460
Empress is right. I am truly at fault.

292
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,960
Since it's your fault, you need to receive punishment.

293
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,400
As of today, you are demoted two ranks, and your wage is deducted by four taels of silver every month.

294
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,230
Thank you, Empress, for your kindness.

295
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,640
Empress!

296
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:24,170
Yongniang, Grand Empress Dowager sent you to take care of the Ninth Princess.

297
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,350
Why haven't you monitored her to study better?

298
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,650
I heard that you visited Garden of Fragrance some days ago

299
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,750
and accidentally fell in the lake and caught a cold.

300
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,550
Are you not yet recovered?

301
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,560
Yongniang, you are the experienced lady-in-waiting here.

302
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,650
Why are you not more diligent?

303
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,180
If the princess is still unwell, you should've inform me and let her rest in her room.

304
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,530
To have her travel all the way here,

305
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,590
the cold wind probably made her sicker.

306
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,980
Informing Empress, Prince Yi asked Shi'en earlier to relay a message.

307
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,300
He was originally coming to read the sutra with you this afternoon.

308
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,950
However, he is not feeling well and will need to postpone it.

309
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,560
He begs for your permission.

310
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,610
This child... He's already rejected me twice.

311
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,370
What exactly is wrong with him? Has the imperial doctor checked on him?

312
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,890
Empress, I've already sent someone to check.

313
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,660
His Highness is very healthy.

314
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,330
He is just feeling fatigued and doesn't want to see people.

315
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,140
There are talks among the palace servants that

316
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,950
His Highness is lovesick.

317
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,190
Rubbish!

318
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,480
Prince Yi is still young, how can he be lovesick?

319
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,430
I heard that because His Highness sided with Gao Zhen during the "cuju" game,

320
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,780
Zhao Sese got so upset that she wouldn't see him.

321
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,220
His Highness then waited at the Zhao Manor for several days but wasn't able to see her.

322
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,230
So he refused to step out of his Luminous Benevolence Hall anymore.

323
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,730
Call Zhao Sese to come into the palace.

324
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,490
Yes.

325
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,650
Directress Fang, I'm very sorry.

326
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,940
Today, it was all because of me

327
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,350
that you were punished by the empress.

328
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,490
I promise!

329
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:40,210
From now on I won’t mess around. I’ll definitely be more diligent in learning.

330
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,820
Even your clothes are messy.

331
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,100
Life is boring inside the palace.

332
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,670
Everyone is usually following the rules, just going to their duties as assigned.

333
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,060
Your arrival has injected vibrancy in this boring life.

334
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:14,240
You were born with an unrestrained nature and you don't like to study.

335
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,680
But during these days that I spent with you,

336
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,730
I find you very interesting.

337
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,300
Directress Fang, are you complimenting me?

338
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,140
I'll take my leave.

339
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:42,080
I just realized today Directress Fang is not as annoying as I always thought.

340
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,710
She's adorable.

341
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,220
Your Highness Prince Yi.

342
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,010
Ninth Princess, you've been coming over quite frequently.

343
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,890
Ninth Princess.

344
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,550
I’ve heard... that you have lovesickness.

345
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,130
What are you talking about?! Who has lovesickness?!

346
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,100
You're not sick? That's bad.

347
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,870
This is bad.

348
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,810
Someone's in trouble because of you.

349
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,350
What do you mean?

350
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,470
The empress has ordered Miss Zhao to come into the palace earlier.

351
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,040
It's true. I was just at the empress' palace earlier.

352
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,860
That's why I sneaked over here to tell you this.

353
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:05,500
This doesn't count as a thank you gift.

354
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,970
I didn’t say it was a thank you gift.

355
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,690
Then what is it for?

356
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,850
I'm a person that returns a favor.

357
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:18,700
Since you've saved my life, I consider you a friend so I'm telling you this.

358
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,390
Being my friend isn’t a good thing.

359
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,530
I don’t believe these words. Best if you find another excuse.

360
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:40,300
My name is Sese. Greetings, Empress.

361
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,590
General Zhao's daughter is really beautiful.

362
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:49,230
I heard that you have outstanding literary knowledge.

363
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,420
Have you studied the "Lessons of a Woman"?

364
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,340
Yes, I have.

365
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,680
Do you know what womanly virtue means?

366
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,560
"Refined and gentle, chaste, with moral principles,
(T/N: an excerpt from "Lessons of a Woman" by Ban Zhao)

367
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:05,650
have shame, speaks and acts with propriety: those are the womanly virtues."

368
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,360
Do you understand their true meaning?

369
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,920
A person that is refined, gentle, and chaste is sluggish for external matters, but anxious for internal concerns.

370
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,110
She does not have any desires or lust, and focuses on cultivating virtue and expanding her contributions.

371
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:23,040
She doesn't seek to make higher connections, nor be addicted to romantic follies.

372
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,030
A person with moral principles doesn't have excessive aspirations,

373
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,740
uncontrollable arrogance, or unbridled desires.

374
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,550
She knows to prioritize when dealing with matters.

375
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,920
She knows that there are things that she can and can't do. A person with shame—

376
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,770
Very good.

377
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,960
Knowing what you can and can't do.

378
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,590
You are a well-educated girl. You should understand

379
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:52,090
that the most important requirement as a woman is to not go out of bounds.

380
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,470
If you forget your boundary, it's like forgetting yourself.

381
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,350
You start aspiring for what you should not reach for.

382
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,590
I am terrified!

383
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,950
If you really know fear, you wouldn’t have any entanglement with Prince Yi.

384
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:10,540
I sincerely love and admire His Highness Prince Yi.

385
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,990
I don’t have any impure thoughts about him!

386
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,240
No impure thoughts?

387
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,240
Good! I'll tell you the truth.

388
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,760
The future princess consort of Prince Yi has long been designated. She is Duke Wei of the State's granddaughter.

389
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,320
Everyone has a different fate. Don't blame me for being heartless.

390
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,450
If you really care about Prince Yi,

391
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,380
then quit teasing him.

392
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,560
[Clean and Peaceful Palace]

393
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Sese! Sese!

394
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,470
What's the matter?

395
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,120
Did my imperial mother say something to you?

396
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,890
Your Highness, please maintain proper decorum.

397
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,180
I am beneath your rank and do not dare harbor inappropriate thoughts

398
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,280
of being with Your Highness forever.

399
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,240
From now on, I will never intrude upon you again.

400
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,720
I will not have any relationship with you again.

401
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,500
I also ask that you never come and find me again.

402
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,870
Do not affect my thoughts.

403
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,220
Don't let me harbor any hopes about you again.

404
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,790
Sese. Se...

405
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,250
A while ago, Prince Yi would indeed go to Zhao Manor every day,

406
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,700
but Miss Zhao keeps refusing to see him.

407
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,890
These past days, Prince Yi seems to have grown tired of it and doesn't go to Zhao Manor anymore.

408
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,990
Usually, he either stays in his own manor or goes to the Grand Literature Library.

409
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,790
By the way, Xi State's Ninth Princess will sometimes go to the library, too.

410
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,150
I got it, Chan'er. You've worked hard.

411
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,180
Go get your reward.

412
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,420
Yes.

413
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,490
[General of the Second Rank Manor]

414
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,040
Your Highness Prince Yi, my daughter lacks manners and refuses to see you.

415
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,930
I hope you won't lower yourself to her level and make a fuss about it.

416
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,690
Greetings, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

417
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,620
Good poems.

418
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,540
I didn't think a warrior like General Zhao

419
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,310
was also a talented scholar.

420
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,490
You are too kind.

421
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,190
I'm only a simple soldier.

422
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,410
I don't wish to be ridiculed by others.

423
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,660
So I learned a few words.

424
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,850
General is too humble and cautious.

425
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,580
Just by looking at the writing of your daughter,

426
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,720
we know you are no simple soldier.

427
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,110
[Letter from Miss Zhao to the crown prince thanking him for lending her his cloak on the day she fell into the pond]

428
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,520
Please forgive my daughter's offense.

429
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,830
Oh? What offense?

430
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,820
Crown Prince knows what I want.

431
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,830
If you don't mind, we would like be your supporters.

432
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:38,780
We will follow your order with all our hearts.

433
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:53,920
There is a rumor in the palace that your daughter loves my fifth brother, Prince Yi.

434
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,660
She was not clearheaded and caused these unnecessary talks.

435
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,420
Our Zhao family never had any dealings with the Gao family, and we will never be connected from now on.

436
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,410
My daughter has also suffered some setbacks.

437
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,220
She learned her lesson and understood that she should entrust her future to Your Highness.

438
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,750
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

439
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,890
To receive but to not reciprocate is bad manners.

440
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,480
Please give this to your daughter.

441
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,560
It's a small token to show my appreciation and also my promise.

442
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,130
Thank you, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

443
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,450
By the way, how is Xuan recovering?

444
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,580
Thank you for caring.

445
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,370
Shixuan still cannot walk yet.

446
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,050
But he has studied martial arts since childhood, he'll recover faster than regular people.

447
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,790
In two months, he should be able to walk and move around again.

448
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,820
In the future, we'll look for the right time

449
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,150
to vent this grievance that Xuan suffered.

450
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,070
Yes.

451
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,110
Lately, I have received many memorials rushing me to decide

452
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,430
on who to name as the North Subduing Marquis.

453
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,660
Today, we'll discuss

454
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,560
who would be the best candidate.

455
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,440
Crown Prince, tell us what you think.

456
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,850
Your Imperial Majesty, I have thought of a perfect choice.

457
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,580
Who?

458
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,560
According to the people here,

459
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,010
we shouldn't shy away from recommending people we favor,

460
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,900
or select from a national security standpoint. Everybody has their point.

461
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,480
I think that neither General Gao Xian

462
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,340
or Li Yan of the Ministry of War are a good choice.

463
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:20,640
They are pillars of our nation. But Danchi is a special place.

464
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,210
Danchi not only frequently invaded our border,

465
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,320
but their other neighbor of Western Border as well. Their ambition is obvious.

466
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,030
But God is kind.

467
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,260
Genocide is too tragic.

468
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,680
General Gao, to us Li Empire, is the champion who defeated Danchi.

469
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,250
But to Danchi people...

470
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,820
If he were to be the North Subduing Marquis,

471
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,110
those people would revolt against him in time.

472
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,680
If we want the Danchi people to truly surrender to us,

473
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,050
to have them settle down in their land,

474
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,580
General Gao is not the best candidate.

475
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,180
If I can I have my choice,

476
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,590
I will send Assistant Minister Li.

477
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:27,470
But the north is a harsh place to live. He had suffered an injury during the war.

478
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:31,380
If we sent him back to that bitter cold place,

479
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,210
it will seem too cruel of me.

480
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,080
What you said makes sense.

481
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,500
So who is your choice?

482
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,980
It's Bulwark General Zhao Jingyu.

483
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,250
How come it's him?

484
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,220
Why him?

485
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,430
- That would be a great choice.
- Yes, I agree.

486
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,680
He is really good.

487
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,560
Zhao Jingyu.

488
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,520
I'm here.

489
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,800
I know you did a really great job supervising the southwestern border.

490
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,180
I also heard you liked reading the teachings of Lao-tze and Chuang-tze (the founders of Taoism).

491
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,550
Are you still reading those books?

492
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:17,200
Your Imperial Majesty, I remember you reprimanded me when I was young

493
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,330
that a warrior should not be content with being a fighter.

494
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:24,700
I wrote what you said over my bed so that I can see it every day.

495
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,350
I do not dare to even forget it by a day.

496
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,720
Excellent!

497
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,730
Then I shall issue a decree today

498
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,920
to appoint you as the North Subduing Marquis.

499
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,860
You will leave for your job in three days!

500
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,950
I shall abide!

♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

521
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,600
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

522
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,480
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

523
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,380
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

524
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:00,120
♫ Time reverses ♫

525
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:03,320
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

526
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:10,480
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

527
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,980
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

528
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:25,640
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
