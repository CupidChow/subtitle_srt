00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,090
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,560
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,470
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:52,000
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,670
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,950
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,170
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,200
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,930
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,690
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,800
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:39,230
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,800
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,550
[Episode 40]

17
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,780
[Qingluan Hall]

18
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,600
Senior Lady-in-Waiting Rongshuang!

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,350
Senior Lady-in-Waiting Rongshuang, at least leave some people behind to look after My Lady...

20
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,650
Miss Jin'er, I am sorry.

21
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,360
This is according to the empress's orders.

22
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,400
Senior Lady-in-Waiting Rongshuang! Senior Lady-in-Waiting Rongshuang!

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,330
Senior Lady-in-Waiting Rongshuang!

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,390
My Lady!

25
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,710
My Lady! My Lady, what's wrong?!

26
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,700
Come, someone! Come, someone!

27
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,750
Imperial Mother!

28
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,220
Imperial Mother, Sese has already been demoted to a peasant. Why are you still treating her like this?

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,310
How audacious! Bursting into the Clean and Peaceful Palace so early in the morning! Do you still respect me as your mother?!

30
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,300
Imperial Mother, Sese is from my Eastern Palace.

31
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,100
She is now unconscious!

32
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,070
I only beg you to remove her prohibition and let me in to see her!

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,200
If you continue to beg mercy for her, I will have her expelled from the palace!

34
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,020
Imperial Mother, if you do not take back the order you issued, I will kneel here and not get up!

35
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,200
Then kneel!

36
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,300
Crown Princess Consort.

37
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,530
Yongniang, look! Are these flowers pretty or not?

38
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:35,620
Crown Princess Consort, His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince knelt in front of the empress' Clean and Peaceful Hall for an entire day and fainted.

39
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,490
Hurry and go look.

40
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,390
Yesterday, he didn't do such a drastic action in front of the empress. Why does he have to kneel?

41
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,400
Last night, the empress made an imperial decree to seal off Qingluan Hall and dismissed all their servants.

42
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,470
She only left Jin'er to serve Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

43
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,820
Wrong, it's commoner Zhao. Commoner Zhao received a great shock and fainted.

44
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,700
His Imperial Highness heard this and rushed to Clean and Peaceful Hall early this morning.

45
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,960
In order to beg for mercy, he knelt for a day.

46
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,840
If he wants to kneel then let him kneel. What does this have to do with me?

47
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,370
- Yongniang, pay no attention to him.
- Crown Princess Consort.

48
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:14,060
Let him kneel. Let him faint. Who knows? He probably wants to act out a show for the empress.

49
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,280
Crown Princess Consort, are you not going to just take a look at him?

50
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,400
Even if he has a fever, he'll be fine in a few days.

51
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,050
- Crown Princess Consort—
- I am not going.

52
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:52,290
Responding to Your Imperial Highness. You knelt for too long, so the old wound on your thigh has recurred.

53
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,880
In addition to the emotional issues on your mind and the chilliness of the wind, it led to Your Imperial Highness to have such a high fever.

54
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,110
Imperial Physician Wang, I have something I would like to ask you.

55
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,130
Your Highness, please speak.

56
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,820
Have you ever heard of someone losing their memories?

57
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,900
- Losing their memories?
- Yes.

58
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,950
If the head had suffered a blow, the blood and qi might have been blocked;

59
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,800
hence, it can cause temporary memory loss.

60
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,890
Or, maybe, the patient had suffered from immense trauma;

61
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,890
his mind getting confused and developing "Losing One's Soul" syndrome.

62
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,110
Naturally, they will forget the things of the past.

63
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,100
For a short time?

64
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,770
So you are saying, as time goes on, the memories might come back?

65
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,870
This is possible.

66
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,340
Thank you for your trouble, Imperial Physician Wang.

67
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,260
I will prescribe another prescription for Your Imperial Highness. Your high fever isn't subsiding,

68
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,300
so you must properly nurse your health.

69
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Thank you. You are dismissed.

70
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,510
I'll take my leave.

71
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,440
Zhao.

72
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm here.

73
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,350
Take extra care of the crown princess consort. Do not let her out of the palace in the near future.

74
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,690
Yes.

75
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,110
Your Imperial Highness, it is time to take your medicine.

76
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,350
Your Imperial Highness. Your Imperial Highness.

77
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,120
I must get my memories back.

78
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,850
Remember it.

79
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,230
Remember it?

80
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,410
Remember...

81
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,820
Take the medicine away. You all go out. Don't let anyone in here.

82
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,670
Go.

83
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,080
Crown Princess Consort.

84
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,800
Crown Princess Consort, I'd heard that last night the crown prince had an unrelenting high fever.

85
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,200
He also made everyone leave him. He is not taking the medicine, nor letting anyone near him.

86
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,710
Why isn't he taking medicine for his illness?

87
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:20,700
In my opinion, I think he is not taking medicine and also not wanting anybody else to know,

88
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,660
because he thinks if the empress finds out, she will blame it on that Zhao commoner.

89
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,790
Crown Prince is still mad at the empress.

90
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,680
Does he think he can avenge for Related Lady of Excellence Zhao by tormenting himself like this?

91
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,900
Crown Prince is honest and kind-hearted. Also, he is favored by His Imperial Majesty and Empress.

92
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,750
But to do this is a little too...

93
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,960
A bit too immature and absurd.

94
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,500
Crown Princess Consort, it's better that you go take a look.

95
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,800
Those two are so in love. Why should I go meddle?

96
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,050
Crown Princess Consort, His Imperial Highness has had a high fever for three days already.

97
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,920
No one has dared to enter his sleeping chambers. If this continues...

98
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,020
That's true. It's okay if Li Chengyin dies.

99
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,820
But if he dies, I will become a widow.

100
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,700
Infinite Light Buddha! Crown Princess Consort, you can't speak such words outside of here!

101
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Why are you so anxious? He is not dead yet. Fine. Fine. I'll go with you to see him.

102
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,330
Mother...

103
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,890
This hot?!

104
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,840
Mother! Mother...

105
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,680
It's me.

106
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,530
Yongniang, get the medicine.

107
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,540
Come, Your Imperial Highness, open your mouth. Just a little bit.

108
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,300
A'Du, pinch his nose.

109
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,030
Open your mouth.

110
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,100
It's hot!

111
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,010
He swallowed it.

112
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,190
You can let his nose go.

113
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,000
Here. Be careful.

114
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,010
Miss, you are sick, but Empress will not allow any imperial physician to see you.

115
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,690
I made some congee for you. It's better than not eating.

116
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:55,500
What about His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince? Did he come to see me?

117
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:07,600
Jin'er, you sneak out and go tell the crown prince that I am sick.

118
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,710
He will definitely come to see me. Go tell him.

119
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:17,350
My Lady, you eat the congee first. When you've gotten better, the crown prince will come to see you.

120
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't want to drink it!

121
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,100
Crown Prince will definitely come to see me. He surely will.

122
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,780
When he comes, I will tell him that I didn't try to hurt Xuniang. I am not the one.

123
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:39,170
It's all Qu Xiaofeng. She planted this trap to frame me.

124
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,280
I didn't hurt her! I didn't hurt her...!

125
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,990
Crown Princess Consort, do you want to eat something?

126
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,850
What is it? Your body is numbed.

127
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,880
Then, I won't eat anymore. I will have some water.

128
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,060
All right. I will bring it over for you.

129
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,130
No... Don't.

130
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,870
Put the knife away.

131
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,210
Here.

132
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,930
They are husband and wife. Go.

133
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,970
Yongniang!

134
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,630
Yongniang!

135
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,250
What is it, Crown Princess Consort? Is your body numbed? I will massage it for you.

136
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,050
No...

137
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,320
I need to relieve myself.

138
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,700
I'll ask someone to get a commode.

139
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,590
Yongniang! Quickly block me! Block me! That side!

140
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,990
Hurry.

141
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,390
Take-Take it away.

142
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,940
Don't laugh anymore.

143
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,640
Stop laughing!

144
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,310
I won't laugh.

145
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,960
Li Chengyin, stop laughing!

146
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
Take it away. Take it away.

147
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,580
I...

148
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
Who told you to laugh?!

149
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,330
Do not harm His Highness the Crown Prince!

150
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,600
Get lost! Yongniang, move out of the way.

151
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,730
Don't harm him!

152
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,210
A'Du, drag Yongniang away!

153
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,940
A'Du, don't drag me!

154
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,720
- I'll let you laugh!
 - Don't pull me! Crown Princess Consort!

155
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,390
- You're still laughing?
- Don't harm the Crown Prince! Be careful!

156
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,000
You're not allowed to laugh!

157
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,930
A'Du, let me in!

158
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,090
Laughing again? You're not allowed to laugh!

159
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,500
If you keep laughing, I will have A'Du come over here and kill you!

160
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,320
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

161
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,000
A'Du!

162
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,250
- Li Chengyin!
- You can't catch me!

163
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,740
Give it back to me!

164
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,120
Come, come, come. If you catch me, then I will give it to you.

165
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,980
- Hand it back to me!
- You can't reach it!

166
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,220
- You can't reach it!
- Give it back to me!

167
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,300
If you can reach it, I'll give it to you!

168
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,300
- Give it back to me!
- You can't reach it!

169
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,550
What are you doing, you!

170
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:37,300
- Return it to me! A'Du, come save me! 
- Quickly drag her away!

171
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,690
- A'Du, you cannot go in. The two of them are doing what a husband and wife should be doing.
- A'Du!

172
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,530
Li Chengyin, I'm going all out with you!

173
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,190
A'Du!

174
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
A'Du, if you go in, then kill me.

175
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,000
- Today's affair must not be made known. 
 - What affair... cannot be said?

176
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,790
Kiss me.

177
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,100
Why do I have to kiss you again?

178
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,940
If you kiss me, then I will not tell anyone. Come.

179
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,930
If not because I was afraid that the two countries would go to war,

180
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:33,070
people would be plunged into misery, that blood would flow like a river,

181
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,320
and bones would be like a mountain, I'll endure this.

182
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,380
What is wrong with you?

183
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,380
You can leave now.

184
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,790
I can leave?

185
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,540
Yes.

186
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,350
Yongniang, I cannot live anymore!

187
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,370
Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort! You are not wearing shoes, Crown Princess Consort!

188
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,100
- Crown Princess Consort!
- Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort, run no more! You are not wearing shoes!

189
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,620
- Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort!
- Run slower!

190
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,500
- Crown Princess Consort!
- Crown Princess Consort, put on your shoes!

191
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,620
Crown Princess Consort!

192
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,590
- What is going on here?
- What happened with Crown Princess Consort?

193
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,180
Crown Princess Consort!

194
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,440
Reporting to Crown Princess Consort. The Crown Prince has sent someone to send something.

195
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,630
Send something?

196
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,400
His Imperial Highness said that he was momentarily impatient and tore Crown Princess Consort's belt.

197
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,760
He feels very apologetic.

198
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,410
So, he specifically made up for it with a mandarin duck silk ribbon.

199
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,680
His Highness also said that he was originally going to personally gift this to Crown Princess Consort,

200
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:06,400
but he was too exhausted and was sweating.

201
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,580
He was afraid of catching a cold, so he did not come.

202
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:15,000
His Highness also said that he will not tell anyone what happened.

203
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,970
Crown Princess Consort, do not worry.

204
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,390
I...

205
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,850
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

206
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,740
Crown Princess Consort, look.

207
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,670
Yongniang, you are still smiling?! Does everyone in the Eastern Palace now know that I came out of Li Chengyin's bedchambers with messy clothes?

208
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,800
Yes, Crown Princess Consort.

209
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,440
I... This is all your fault! It was you who wanted me to go there yesterday!

210
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,090
Crown Princess Consort, you are tired from last night. I will have someone stew a bowl of ginseng soup for you to drink.

211
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,690
This is a conspiracy. A conspiracy!

212
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,380
His Imperial Highness finally has a change of heart. The infinite light, Buddha.

213
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,500
Madam Zhao must have bewitched His Highness. Look! Upon locking Madam Zhao up,

214
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,710
Crown Princess Consort and Crown Prince are suddenly getting along very well.

215
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:18,100
I know right. Our Crown Princess Consort is such a beauty. It's totally unacceptable that she's not favored by His Imperial Highness.

216
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,640
That's right, that's right. You did not see Crown Princess Consort's expression when she saw the mandarin duck silk ribbon today.

217
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,570
Her face was red from blushing, and she was so shy.

218
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,650
If it were me, I would be shy, too.

219
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,490
His Imperial Highness, too, asking someone to send such an item over in broad daylight...

220
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,300
That's right. I saw it, too.

221
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,510
That is not what actually happened!

222
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,180
My face was red because I was angry. And our clothes were messy because we fought with each other!

223
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,140
It was not what you thought it was!

224
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,100
Crown Princess Consort, forgive our offenses! I should die! Crown Princess Consort!

225
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,300
These are the things I know. This crown princess consort has gotten what she wants now.

226
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,300
She's even going around saying that this was against her will.

227
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,320
Is that true?

228
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,410
Of course. I think that it must be because she saw you had suffered a setback,

229
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,650
and the crown prince was sick, so she went to seduce the crown prince.

230
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,200
His Imperial Highness... Could you have forgotten about me in such a short time?

231
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,240
Related Lady of Excellence, His Highness got sick because of you.

232
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,090
When the crown prince recovers from his illness, he will definitely find a way to let you out.

233
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,960
At that point, let us see if that crown princess consort will still matter.

234
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,950
There are four edifying behavioral characteristics for women: the first is womanly virtue, the second is womanly speech,

235
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,510
the third is womanly manners, and the fourth is womanly merit.

236
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,000
Refined and gentle, chaste, with moral principles,
have shame, speaks and acts with propriety:

237
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,550
those are the womanly virtues. One must frequently wash her clothes, only wear cleaned and properly dried ones,

238
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:04,700
always take a bath and dress appropriately: that is womanly manners.

239
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,400
If womanly virtues aren't manifested and your womanly manners are disordered, that is being dishonorable.

240
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,960
Crown Princess Consort, do you understand that

241
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,400
you are the crown princess consort, the legal mistress of the Eastern Palace.

242
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,200
You are a model of this country. The crown prince is young and rash.

243
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,590
You should be correcting him from the side, and not joining him in his wild actions.

244
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,710
Not just our royal family, even a wife of a commoner

245
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,000
should understand self-restraint.

246
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
Not that I didn't exercise self-restraint, it was Li Chengyin who—

247
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,500
The crown prince is still sick. Why do you not understand how to refuse him?

248
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,230
If he doesn't rest well and contract a more serious illness, how can we take it?

249
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,620
You will become the future empress.

250
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,650
You are supposed to be the role model as you take charge of the inner palace.

251
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,540
How will you have people willingly submit to you in the future?

252
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,390
We did not... did not do that.

253
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,140
You may rise.

254
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,340
What I am doing is for your good. If this was made known publicly, it would sound terrible.

255
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,600
The Central Plains is different from Xi State. Flippantly saying a phrase is like a dagger.

256
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,330
Especially in the palace, these rumors and slanderous words

257
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,910
can kill people.

258
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,000
How annoying.

259
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,810
You all must properly care for and watch over Crown Princess Consort. The crown prince is still sick.

260
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:54,300
Crown Princess Consort is young and has numerous affairs to attend to.

261
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,340
Do not allow her to serve soup and medicine to the crown prince anymore.

262
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,970
Have Crown Princess Consort copy "Lessons for Women" ten times.

263
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,570
I'm copying "Lessons for Women" again? Can't there be anything new?

264
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,450
You want something new? Then copy it twenty times.

265
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,970
Prepare paper and ink.

266
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,340
Yes.

267
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,020
I am so mad. I now know that this is Li Chengyin's trap!

268
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:43,000
- What mandarin duck silk ribbon? This is a white silk ribbon! (symbolizes death).
- Crown—
- And having me copy "Lessons for Women" ten times, is this not wanting me to die?

269
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,220
Crown Princess Consort, don't get angry. The crown prince is still sick, so it's unlikely he had thought that thoroughly.

270
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,900
You should just hurry and copy now. Or else, you will not be able to finish copying this ten times today. Oh... it's twenty times.

271
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,050
His Imperial Highness has personally looked after you and sent you a couple of additional dishes. Send them in.

272
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,020
His Imperial Highness came?

273
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,030
I heard His Highness fell sick. Is he better now?

274
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,960
I have to go visit him!

275
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,430
It's better that you understand your status well.

276
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:37,740
There are people that will take care of His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

277
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,970
You should just stay here and take your punishment in peace.

278
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,390
My Lady! My Lady...

279
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,150
My Lady... My Lady...

280
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,000
My Lady... My Lady...

281
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,010
Come.

282
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,510
[Bearing Graces Hall]

283
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,990
Quick!

284
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,530
General Pei.

285
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:47,700
Crown Princess Consort, a lot of things have happened in the palace lately. It's better that you don't leave the palace.

286
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,260
Who said I'm leaving the palace? I just can't sleep so I'm taking a little walk.

287
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,390
General Pei, you also know, the empress had me copy books all day and didn't allow me to see Li Chengyin.

288
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,070
I'm bored to death. If I don't go out to take a breather, I am going to go crazy!

289
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,780
Just let me leave for a short while. Is that okay?

290
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,580
Crown Princess Consort, the crown prince has given orders—

291
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,800
Li Chengyin is still sick. He won't know.

292
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,090
If you are still worried, come with me.

293
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,990
I haven't eaten lunch yet.

294
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,150
Sir, just enjoy your drinks slowly. Call me if you need anything else.

295
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,620
Mi Luo!

296
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,610
I had a feeling you would come this morning. I'd waited for you until the afternoon. Why are you coming just now?

297
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:02,600
Let me tell you that I feel more alive now that I've seen you. Where's Gu Jian?

298
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,360
Him? I don't know why but he has appeared like a god and disappeared like a ghost these past two days. I don't know where he is either.

299
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,850
I prepared two jars of good wine for you.

300
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,230
Good food, good wine: bring them all!

301
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,700
Okay!

302
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,790
Meat! You play, you play, you play!

303
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,860
Why would I have you play? Help me give it to that other person.

304
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,450
Wow, he can play the hichiriki, too.

305
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,880
What time is it, Shi'en?

306
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,160
It's already 5:00 a.m., Your Imperial Highness. It will be daybreak soon.

307
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,170
I am going to look for the crown princess consort.

308
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,620
Okay.

309
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,350
General Pei, so you know to play the hichiriki, too.

310
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:25,650
How come I didn't know? Not many people can play it here in Shangjing.

311
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,880
My father went on a mission to the Western Border before. There was a hichiriki among the items he brought back.

312
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,200
When I was young, I taught myself to play it when I had free time.

313
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,130
Your father is General Xiaoqi, Pei Kuang!

314
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,250
Yes.

315
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,930
Mi Luo.

316
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,790
General Pei played the hichiriki amazingly.

317
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,330
What are those people from Persia singing?

318
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,100
They are singing homesick songs.

319
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,180
It actually sounds similar to a Central Plain's phrase.

320
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,700
"The moon moves fast. I leave my hometown.

321
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,780
The moon waxes and wanes, I don't see my hometown.

322
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:28,530
The stars are bright, I leave my homeland. The galaxy shines,

323
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,390
I cannot go back to my homeland.

324
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,950
The wind is gentle, it breezes over my home soil.

325
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,650
The sky is clear, it shines on my home.

326
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,450
I wonder where I will be buried.

327
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,340
I wonder where I will...

328
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,880
be buried.

329
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,390
"The moon moves fast, I leave my hometown.

330
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,800
The moon waxes and wanes, I don't see my hometown.

331
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,030
The stars are bright, I leave my homeland.

332
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:18,470
The galaxy shines, I cannot go back to my homeland."

333
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,070
Everyone feels homesick.

334
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:38,100
These Persian people are so homesick,

335
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,340
but why don't they return home?

336
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:46,050
Not everyone is like you, not having to leave home at a young age.

337
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:52,330
Among these people whose homes are far away, how many left willingly?

338
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,020
Young Lord, you are drinking too much.

339
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:08,230
How to lessen grief? Only with Du Kang.

340
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,030
You shouldn't admire me. In total, I only know three poems.

341
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,520
This is one of them.

342
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,080
General Pei, look.

343
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:58,720
Shangjing looks really pretty in the misty rain. It's like a drawing.

344
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,870
Even the best painter in Xi State probably couldn't imagine such a scene.

345
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,960
So much prosperity, such gentleness and humidity.

346
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,500
it really is a city that could only exist in Heaven.

347
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,930
It's like a fairy castle that gods favor the most.

348
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:28,150
Tens of thousands of people come to greet and admire this capital of the Li Empire,

349
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,800
but I just can't seem to be happy.

350
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,190
No matter how nice this place is, it is not my Xi State.

351
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,080
General Pei, do you have a sweetheart?

352
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,540
When you get married, you must marry someone you love.

353
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,490
Otherwise, you'd be heartbroken and the other person would be, too.

354
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:09,040
In a marriage without love, every day feels like a year's time.

355
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,460
It's like a dark night without end. I don't want you to also live such a life.

356
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,980
I am a royal descendant. I have no control over my marriage.

357
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,820
Then, do you willingly accept such a reality?

358
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:34,100
I grew up living in splendor and on fine food,

359
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,230
enjoyed the kind of life and prestige that ordinary people don't have; this is the price that I pay.
