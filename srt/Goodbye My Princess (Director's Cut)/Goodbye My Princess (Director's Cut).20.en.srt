00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,350
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,450
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,580
Zhao Jingyu.

4
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,910
I can't believe it's him.

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,050
I thought the Zhao family maintains neutrality.

6
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,410
Why would Crown Prince speak for him?

7
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,330
What neutrality? The Zhao family was initially Prime Minister Gao's people.

8
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,990
That is how he had the opportunity to fight in the south and become a general.

9
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,830
It's surprising.

10
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,530
Crown Prince helping Minister Gao's people.

11
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,900
What people?

12
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,130
Zhao Jingyu may be the Bulwark General,

13
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,620
but it's Minister Gao who made him stay in the southeast.

14
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,730
When he finally made the southeast a good place to be,

15
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,660
Minister Gao pulled him back to the capital.

16
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,890
Once he was back, he wasn't given any position of responsibility.

17
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,420
He was only a courtier in the background.

18
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,390
Then, Prince, which side is Zhao Jingyu on?

19
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,430
Did you hear clearly what the crown prince said?

20
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,180
That shows far-sightedness.

21
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,340
You guys...

22
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,170
What are all these words?

23
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
Petty!

24
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,250
I've been here for over four hours.

25
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,560
Give me something to do.

26
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,530
You just need to stay here quietly.

27
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,360
What is staying quietly?

28
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,730
His Highness the Crown Prince sent me here to edit the book with you.

29
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,100
I should be doing something, right?

30
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,510
Crown Prince told you to come here because he knows you are homesick.

31
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,000
He doesn't really expect you to help.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,440
What do you mean by that?

33
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,810
Publishing the annals of the Western Border is a matter of national importance. These are the men's jobs.

34
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,030
Women shouldn't get involved anyway.

35
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:41,490
Tell you what. Quit telling me these unreasonable rules of your Li Empire.

36
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,010
A woman must walk behind a man.

37
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,960
A woman must bow lower than a man.

38
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,810
I can't even eat a meal properly and must put two eggs in my armpits.

39
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,680
I also can't walk properly and must have a bowl of water on my head.

40
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,980
I wouldn't suffer like this back in Xi State.

41
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,920
All right.

42
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,030
Go take a look at those books. You can read whichever one that will relieve your homesickness. Go take them.

43
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,820
I need to go get some air.

44
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,300
Where are you going?

45
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,690
Come back, Li Chengyin!

46
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,660
Li Chengyin, I haven't finished talking yet.

47
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,960
Li Chengyin!

48
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,210
Li Chengyin!

49
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,370
Weren't you ignoring me?

50
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,690
You provoked me first.

51
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,330
I'm provoking you then!

52
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,400
You want to fight?

53
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
- Fight then.
- You!

54
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,150
Strike!

55
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,110
Strike him harder!

56
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,200
You fool.

57
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,820
You ruined my good plan for a whore.

58
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,360
Even pushed the Zhao family to the crown prince.

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,660
Father, why blame me?

60
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,580
Who knew that the empress didn't want Prince Yi to be with Zhao Sese?

61
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,830
If Zhao Sese could marry Prince Yi, Crown Prince wouldn't have suddenly nominated

62
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,440
Zhao Jingyu to be the North Subduing Marquis.

63
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,220
You still talk back?

64
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,790
- Don't stop! Hit him! Keep hitting hard!
- Lighter, lighter, please.

65
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,560
Father, even if you kill Third Brother, you can't save this plan anymore.

66
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,230
How about starting a new plan? Just turn over a new leaf.

67
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,510
Now, the Zhao Family is on my side.

68
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,130
After my wedding with the ninth princess,

69
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,260
I will possess Xi State's power.

70
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,180
No matter how big the Gao family's influence is, they will not be able to contend with me.

71
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,560
Why are you sighing? Speak if you have something to say.

72
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,070
In the past, I always thought that there was something wrong with the Zhao family.

73
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,880
Thus, I sent a spy to monitor them.

74
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,890
Today, Zhao Jingyu went to Danchi to take up his new post.

75
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,660
Li Chengyin and that Zhao daughter sent him off.

76
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,750
Li Chengyin?

77
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,100
Why did you not tell me about this earlier?

78
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,540
Previously, I was suspicious but dared not confirm.

79
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,740
Only when my spy informed me earlier did I know that Li Chengyin

80
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,950
went to the pavilion five kilometers outside the capital to bid farewell.

81
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:40,060
I thank General Zhao greatly.

82
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,470
Your Highness, do you realize that there's no turning back for me?

83
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,150
Sese, do you sincerely wish to entrust the rest of your life to me?

84
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,400
Your Highness, why do you ask when you know the answer?

85
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,700
But in your family's eyes, I am not the best partner for you.

86
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,040
As long as Your Highness does not betray me, I will convince my family.

87
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,300
If I cannot earn the favors of your father,

88
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,600
how could I dare let you entrust the rest of your life to me?

89
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,860
Sese, don't worry. I will surely make your father

90
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,560
betroth you to me in peace.

91
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,400
Ridiculous!

92
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,790
General Zhao, please allow it.

93
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,990
Your Highness Prince Yi.

94
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,010
Sese and I love each other.

95
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,740
May General Zhao give us your blessing.

96
00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:00,490
I know that the crown prince is who General Zhao has his mind set on.

97
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,000
Although I have no right nor power, I can assure you that

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,900
in the future I will be good to Sese and not disappoint her love.

99
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,570
This...

100
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,360
I can assist you in accomplishing what you desire,

101
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,760
but I have to inconvenience you and Sese to act out a scene with me.

102
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,000
Crown Prince, I saw with my own eyes that Gao Zhen purposely kicked my brother.

103
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Sese, you misunderstood. In a cuju game, it is impossible to avoid some injury.

104
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,590
I was on the side earlier. Gao Zhen didn't mean to hurt your brother.

105
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,870
But... Brother!

106
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,170
Sese, drop it.

107
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,200
Hurry and carry him away!

108
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,870
Sese!

109
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,760
This is all my fault. I caused my older brother to be harmed this severely.

110
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,400
Sese, it was my fault. Don't cry.

111
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,200
I did not think that Gao Zhen would be this ruthless.

112
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,310
Sese,

113
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,890
since it is already like this, we must continue with our act or all our efforts will be for naught.

114
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,370
Then, what should we do next.

115
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,000
Although we succeeded, the crown prince may not believe us.

116
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,720
We need to put on one more act.

117
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,600
Please write another letter to the crown prince

118
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,940
saying that your family loathes the Gao family and that you desire to ally with him.

119
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,300
Miss Zhao thanks me for being thoughtful of her.

120
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,650
and says she'll repay the favor in the future.

121
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,560
Your Highness, whatever you desire is indeed coming true.

122
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,050
The crown prince is naturally suspicious and may not believe it,

123
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,540
so we must put on a show right in front of his eyes.

124
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,230
[General of the Second Rank]

125
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:57,180
A while ago, Prince Yi would indeed go to Zhao Manor everyday, but Lady Zhao kept refusing to see him.

126
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:02,540
These past days, Prince Yi seems to have grown tired of it and doesn't go to Zhao Manor anymore.

127
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,630
Usually, he either stays in his own manor or goes to the Grand Literature Library.

128
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,590
Thank you, Can'er, for your hard work.

129
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,070
As long as you remove the crown prince's apprehensions

130
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,280
so that he is convinced of your allegiance,

131
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,960
he will come and visit you himself to make an alliance.

132
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,190
Next, it will depend on General Zhao's choice.

133
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,890
Yes.

134
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,020
For the rest of my life, I will not forget the help that you have provided me.

135
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,910
I thank Your Highness greatly.

136
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,190
Your Highness, after I arrive at Tongzhou, I will dispatch a messenger

137
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,180
to exchange news with you. Please safeguard your official seal.

138
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,010
General, do not worry.

139
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,430
Father, the north is bitter cold. You must take good care of yourself.

140
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,560
Your Highness, please take good care of Sese.

141
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,700
I will not disappoint Sese, nor will I disappoint you.

142
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,740
I thank Your Highness greatly. I will take my leave.

143
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,610
Father!

144
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,090
Your Highness, what are you thinking about?

145
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:20,050
I am thinking that I finally have earned your father's approval,

146
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,000
but I don't know if your older brother will bear a grudge against me.

147
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,390
Although this time it was an act for the crown prince,

148
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:35,000
but Your Highness acted too realistically. My elder brother also did not know about the situation at the time.

149
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,880
Afterward, my father did inform him about the plan.

150
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,870
But my elder brother is quite stubborn. I am afraid that he won't listen to reason and feels discontent about this.

151
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,960
Your Highness, in the future you must treat my brother better.

152
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,570
Of course.

153
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,840
Because of selfish reasons, I've endangered my father and brother.

154
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,470
Now that the Zhao family's lifeline depends on you,

155
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,330
if you find a new love in the future and start to detest me,

156
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,290
I hope that you will look back to today's merit

157
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,690
and not spurn my father and brother.

158
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,390
Your father is a very cautious person.

159
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,710
Even with our private agreement, he was able to keep the secret well in front of the crown prince.

160
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,070
If I fail, you can take this jade pendant with you

161
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,190
and switch your support for the East Palace anytime.

162
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,580
I swear that I will never be disloyal to you.

163
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,600
The most pitiful person is me. I have wronged the crown prince

164
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,670
and am unable to fully have your heart.

165
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,760
Your Highness, I...

166
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,970
Enough. I'm just teasing you.

167
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,920
What a great plan to sneak behind me.

168
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,870
I deserve to die! I deserve to die! Please calm down, Your Highness the Crown Prince!

169
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:26,860
Leave!

170
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,260
Yes!

171
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,490
Empress, Prime Minister Gao wants to see you.

172
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,590
Empress, why don't you want to speak with Prime Minister Gao?

173
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,360
My uncle was most likely here to question me about what happened to the conferment of the North Subduing Marquis.

174
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,660
Wasn't it done by the crown prince?

175
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,550
The Zhao family leaning towards the crown prince's side

176
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,260
doesn't feel right, the more I think about it.

177
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,260
From Zhao Sese's eyes, I can see that she has real feelings for Prince Yi.

178
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,600
How could a woman's heart change so quickly?

179
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,000
If Uncle didn't come, I still couldn't be sure.

180
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:32,420
But now that he came, I suddenly understood. Chengyin must have something to do with this.

181
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,020
Should I tell Prime Minister Gao that

182
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,970
you've gone to the Grand Empress Dowager's place?

183
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,100
I can hide this time, but I can't hide forever.

184
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,960
No matter what, Chengyin didn't do it out in the open.

185
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:55,400
He is still siding with the Gao family. He is now just acting according to his own plans.

186
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,810
I'll see what Uncle has to say about this first.

187
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,070
Prince Yi has really made me see him differently.

188
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,580
What do you mean by that, Uncle?

189
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,750
If my spies didn't see Prince Yi and Miss Zhao

190
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,800
sending Zhao Jingyu out of the capital, I would still be in the dark.

191
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,360
It turned out to be a performance by Prince Yi and the Zhao family.

192
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,590
You and I watched him grow up. He has always been innocent and naive.

193
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,000
He wouldn't do such things behind our backs.

194
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,770
Is Prince Yi just as innocent as Empress says?

195
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,500
If he was innocent, would he be able to perform such great merits in Danchi? If he was innocent,

196
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,830
would he be able to strategize such a plan concerning imperial court matters?

197
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,690
He's become someone else in just a few months.

198
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,690
It's really shocked me. A mother knows her son the best.

199
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,980
Don't you think

200
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,740
he might have an expert behind him?

201
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,210
The only expert behind Chengyin would be you, my uncle.

202
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,700
All the steps he has taken until today were done from your support.

203
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,490
In my opinion, he was bewitched by Miss Zhao this time,

204
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,320
that's why he fell into the Zhao family's trap.

205
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,720
If it was really like that, then the Zhao family has exceptional capabilities.

206
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,300
On the other hand, Cousin not being able to take the title of North Subduing Marquis

207
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,540
may not be something bad. He is already Protectorate General of the Western Border.

208
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,750
His powers are comparable to any feudal lords. If he also takes Danchi under his hands,

209
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,270
His Majesty will end up being suspicious.

210
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,900
I don't mind whether he receives the title of North Subduing Marquis or not.

211
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,770
But Prince Yi doing things behind your back has really caught me off guard.

212
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,320
I am worried on your behalf.

213
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,550
Do not worry, Uncle. I will watch over Chengyin.

214
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,190
Watch me. Learn from me.

215
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,650
Lift your arm higher.

216
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,470
You are eating, drinking, and living in my place for free, and you still have the nerve to drink that much wine?

217
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,760
Don't worry. I won't forget to pay you for the wine.

218
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,810
One more jug.

219
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,040
You already owe me so much wine money, and yet you still speak with that attitude?

220
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,500
By drinking like this, do you still even want your life? I won't sell you any more wine, no matter what.

221
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,100
Just in case you drink yourself to death at my place and I end up having to take care of your funeral.

222
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,720
You can't be the last person I see before I die.

223
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,220
Did you notice that you and I are very similar?

224
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,100
In what way?

225
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,400
You get yourself drunk.

226
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,860
Because you don't want to talk about your past.

227
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,260
I opened this bar to get people drunk.

228
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,110
Because I want people to get drunk for me.

229
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,310
I don't want to think about my future. You don't have a past,

230
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,090
I don't have a future.

231
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,370
Then, why wouldn't you let me get drunk for you?

232
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,590
Because I know Xiaofeng is very important to you.

233
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:17,730
I don't know what you mean. She and I only just met.

234
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,570
Why don't you ask me first what my past job is? Do you think you can fool me?

235
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,700
I can not only see that Xiaofeng is very important to you,

236
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,710
you are also very important to Xiaofeng.

237
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,710
Maybe in the past.

238
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,500
But that's in the past.

239
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,650
Xiaofeng and I both have a homeland that we cannot return to,

240
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,750
so we treat each other

241
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,330
like family from the same homeland.

242
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,160
Since you treat Xiaofeng well, and you mean a lot to her,

243
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,330
then I will treat you like my good friend and take care of you on her behalf.

244
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,110
Just treat me as a regular customer.

245
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,870
I was born to disappoint the people around me.

246
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,750
And the closer I am to them, the more disappointed they will be.

247
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,530
Mingyue, you're here!

248
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,420
Here. Come here and help me persuade this rock.

249
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,160
He has been eating and drinking for free at my place, putting on so much debt.

250
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,250
Now, he's drinking his life away. Sit down.

251
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:50,940
Brother Gu Jian, why do you look at me that way?

252
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,300
Has anyone looked for you these couple of days?

253
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,230
No. Who was looking for me?

254
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,640
It's nothing. I thought it was those rude customers coming to bother you.

255
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,630
Here. It's for you. Enjoy slowly.

256
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,050
Brother Gu Jian, don't drink so much.

257
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,740
I can't only drink more when you are around.

258
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,240
I owe Mi Luo a lot of drinking debt.

259
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,470
When you are here, she won't kick me out.

260
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Brother Gu Jian, how did you survive back then?

261
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,500
I met someone who taught me martial arts

262
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,220
and brought me to Xi State to be raised under Princess Mingyuan.

263
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,050
But when she died, I came back.

264
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,700
How about you? Why did you come to Singing Jade Brothel?

265
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,670
Mother and I were captured, and we were waiting for Father to save us.

266
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,550
But even when we were about to be buried alive, he still didn't come.

267
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,180
I barely made it out of the pile of dirt.

268
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,600
I was saved by a group of merchants and learned how to sing and dance.

269
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,850
Then I came back to the capital and became a courtesan of Singing Jade Brothel.

270
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,050
Although I don't sell my body, I'm no better

271
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,050
than a prostitute.

272
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm sorry.

273
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,770
I was taken care of by a lot of people and didn't suffer too much.

274
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,600
You, on the other hand, had to live abroad.

275
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,120
With no one you know by your side. At least I'm still in Li Empire, in the capital.

276
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,480
I'm fine that way.

277
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,000
I just hate myself for not being able to kill my enemy.

278
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,700
Mingyue, since you are alive,

279
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,820
you have to take care of yourself. The gods will take care of the bad people. They have created so many sins,

280
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,290
so they will surely reap what they've sown.

281
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,150
I can only walk you till here

282
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,450
I will go inside first.

283
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,150
Godfather.

284
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,670
Are you here to see Mingyue?

285
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,170
Mingyue has grown up.

286
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,820
She's looking more and more like her mother.

287
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,950
Godfather,

288
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,740
why won't you go acknowledge Mingyue?

289
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,690
Chen Zheng is already dead.

290
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,190
But Mingyue's father is still alive.

291
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,620
If people know I am alive,

292
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,390
I am still a criminal of the imperial court.

293
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,890
At least, Mingyue is safe right now.

294
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,720
I cannot drag her into this and let her go through living life in fear again.

295
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,100
Godfather, if you saved your own daughter back then—

296
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,240
I never regretted anything.

297
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,000
There need to be a few people who are willing to live for a bigger cause.

298
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,710
Jian'er, I know that

299
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,250
I have passed on such heavy ideals and responsibilities down to you since you were young.

300
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,360
But we cannot forget.

301
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,880
We are alive because we are living on the Gu and Chen families' bodies and blood.

302
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,260
Godfather, I've never forgotten.

303
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,420
I am grateful for you saving my life.

304
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,820
For this bloody grudge of my family, I will continue to follow your plans.

305
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,010
Prince Yi, these are the scrolls from the Ministry of Revenue and War that you wanted.

306
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,740
- You may leave now.
- Yes.

307
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,760
[On the 16th year of Tiantong...]

308
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,810
Why are you here again?

309
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,970
I... came to help.

310
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,750
Oh right! The painter drew a map of the Xi State today.

311
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,240
Look and see if it is accurate.

312
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,160
The drawing looks quite detailed.

313
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,400
Let me see.

314
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,600
I can't even remember directions for a path that I've walked twice,

315
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,250
and he wants me to fix the map?

316
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,830
But if I can't say anything about this,

317
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,400
other people might think that I, the ninth princess of Xi State, don't live up to my fame.

318
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,050
There's an issue here?!

319
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,610
Look.

320
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,030
Even though Danchi's topography is mainly glaciers, there is actually a lot of variation.

321
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:33,860
In this valley, there's actually a hot spring.

322
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,190
Let me tell you.

323
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,170
In the summer, the sky is filled with fireflies.

324
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,450
It's really pretty.

325
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,530
What's wrong? What next?

326
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,890
Did we know each other before?

327
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,540
What?

328
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,660
I'm asking if we knew each other from a long time ago.

329
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,320
Miss A'Du!

330
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,780
I made you a new outfit.

331
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:30,130
You take off the outfit your wearing and change into this one.

332
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,530
You've been wearing this outfit for so long. It has a smell to it now.

333
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,630
Yes, I won!

334
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,990
This is yours.

335
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,460
Me next.

336
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,190
Watch.

337
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,450
I won!

338
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,390
Ninth Princess.

339
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,390
Save the formality. What are you playing?

340
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,420
Princess, the Domestic Services gave us half a day rest.

341
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,090
We have nothing to do. And the half day rest is not enough time to leave the palace.

342
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,880
So we gather here to stir noodles.

343
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,290
Stir noodles? You are making dough?

344
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,330
Princess, the phrase means heads and tails.

345
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,660
It's a game we play with a coin.

346
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,930
We use heads and tails to determine the winner and loser. The side with words is heads.

347
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,950
The other side is tails.

348
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,770
The way we play is one-on-one.

349
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,630
We put the same number of coins in our palms.

350
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,710
We throw the coins on the table or on the floor. Heads go to the first player.

351
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,350
The rest goes to the second.

352
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,320
We keep doing this until the player with the most coins wins.

353
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,050
There is punishment for the loser.

354
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:09,210
Can I have one?

355
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,800
Okay, coin.

356
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,850
How can you ask Ninth Princess for a coin?

357
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,360
I don't have money.

358
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,300
This will be my money.

359
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,480
I will return it after my winnings.

360
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,580
Okay, I give you these.

361
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,040
Okay, let's begin.

362
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,600
Let's begin.

363
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,680
I won! This is yours.

364
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,490
Ninth Princess, toss them against her.

365
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,460
Oh, okay.

366
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,930
Mine! Mine!

367
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,150
Sorry, it's all mine.

368
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,110
Keep going.

369
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,190
Keep going.

370
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,600
I don't have anymore.

371
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,620
You are so good at this.

372
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,380
You won over our half-month salaries.

373
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,360
No big deal. I'll have Yongniang pay you some more.

374
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,350
Ninth Princess, you must not let Yongniang find out we are doing this.

375
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,450
Right. Right. Right. You mustn't tell her.

376
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,920
We'll be dead if she knew.

377
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,750
Yongniang.

378
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,480
Yongniang, what brought you here?

379
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,840
Your Highness, how could you gamble with the servants?

380
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,830
It reduces your status.

381
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,630
Let's go. Follow me back.

382
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,970
Let's go.

383
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,070
- This is my money.
- This is mine.

384
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,000
[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

385
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,750
Yongniang, are all the government made coins in the Li Empire the same?

386
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,560
Yes.

387
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,570
Is there any chance that they are all government made,

388
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,870
but the sizes and thickness are different?

389
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,380
It might be because the craftsman didn't do a good job while making the coins.

390
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,020
Why is Your Highness asking about this?

391
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,790
It's nothing. I'm just randomly asking.

392
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,940
No wonder Ninth Princess has been coming so diligently here for the past few days.

393
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,880
So, you are hiding in the Grand Literature Library to slack off.

394
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,650
I made a huge discovery.

395
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,330
Come here.

396
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,330
Tell me.

397
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,810
Look!

398
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:58,580
Your Li Empire is so big and great but your craftsmanship is terrible.

399
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:02,920
You actually allowed two different quality copper coins to circulate in the market.

400
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,230
Isn't that strange?

401
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,640
Aren't they different?

402
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,100
Right?

403
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,640
What are you doing? Give it back to me!

404
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,850
Where did you get the coins? Did you steal them?

405
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,660
I won them!

406
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,230
Won?

407
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,680
- Why do you care? Give them back!
- I'm not giving them back.

408
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,290
- Give them back to me
-What's so fun about coins?

409
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,580
- I'll give you something more fun next time.
- I don't want anything better!

410
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,620
- I won't give them back!
- I don't want anything else!

411
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,930
- Give them back to me!
- No!

412
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,060
I don't want anything else!

413
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,560
Give them back to me!.

414
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,190
No, I won't.

415
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,210
Li Chengyin!

416
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,610
I am currently living in the palace, so it's inconvenient to enter and leave.

417
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,520
Since you are on duty today, please help me notify Mr. Chai of this.

418
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,540
Ask him to investigate the copper coin matter without fail.

419
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,620
Go.

420
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,540
These two coins... One is thick and the other is thin.

421
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,680
The thick one is old copper.

422
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,220
It must be a government coin made in the past.

423
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,930
On the other hand, the thin one is new copper. It must be a counterfeit.

424
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,460
Besides making coins, Li Empire's copper is

425
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,410
mostly used to make Buddha statues.

426
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:21,650
Your Majesty values Buddhism. The Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas was newly built by His Majesty when he first ascended to the throne.

427
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,620
Every year, they would create multiple new Buddha statues.

428
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,490
This year, the person supervising the production of these Buddhist statues

429
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,380
just happens to be Elder Prince Zhong's son Li Yan.

430
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,150
If it's really Li Yan embezzling the copper that's supposed to be for the Buddhist statues,

431
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,140
then it clearly has a connection with the crown prince.

432
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,350
But the crown prince’s status is already very high, why does he need so much money?

433
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,890
It doesn't matter what he wants to do. It isn't anything good.

434
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,380
It's just that if we investigate this matter privately,

435
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,620
even if the fifth prince gives the evidence to the emperor,

436
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:11,180
His Imperial Majesty will only suppress it to save the royal family's dignity.

437
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,000
So...

438
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:20,620
The emperor must order an investigation himself.

439
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,860
Princess!

440
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,960
Princess, this is Chan'er, a servant sent by Prince Yi.

441
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,260
Greetings, Ninth Princess.

442
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:09,650
Prince Yi sent me here to bring you a gift. He said it will help with the boredom.

443
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,750
I don't want it.

444
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,090
Whether you want it or not, just look at it first. There is no harm in doing that.

445
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,260
Okay, fine.

446
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,550
What's this?

447
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,190
This is a kongming lock.

448
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,700
Isn’t he making fun of me?!

449
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,540
A'Du!

450
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,620
A'Du, break it!

451
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,660
A'Du, don't!

452
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,250
Your Highness, you mustn't do so. This is called a kongming lock.

453
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:18,500
You have to have patience in order to unlock it.

454
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,880
Prince Yu said that Your Highness is such a smart person.

455
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,980
You will surely figure out the enjoyment of it.

456
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,650
Of course, I'm intelligent.

457
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,250
Tell your master that I'll unlock it by tomorrow.

458
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,880
Yes, I will take my leave then.
