00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,230
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,670
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,340
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:51,960
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,580
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,930
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery is good ♫

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,190
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,210
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,920
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,620
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,900
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:39,240
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,030
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

15
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,910
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,770
[Episode 33]

17
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,330
There's also Hedong wine, Cinnamon wine, Pearl Springs wine,

18
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,570
Pear Blossom Spring wine, and Ruoxiachun wine.

19
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,550
The names of these wines sound really nice. I've never heard of so many before.

20
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,060
What types of wine do you usually like to drink?

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,930
I have never drunk before.

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,060
No way! You never drank wine?

23
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:23,080
Then, for your birthday, we will drink our hearts out. Let's go.

24
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,970
Mi Luo, you can't.

25
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,610
It's her birthday and I'm treating her to wine. What's wrong with that?

26
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,850
She's not like you.

27
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,020
How are we different?

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,340
She has never drunk before.

29
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,520
It's because she has never drunk before, that is why she should drink.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,500
If a woman has never gotten drunk, she wouldn't know how to live clearheaded.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,640
It's all right. I can drink.

32
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,570
Great! Let's go.

33
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Good wine!

34
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,120
Yongning, that wine is very strong.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,390
Do not drink anymore!

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,070
- Drink no more!
- Cheers!

37
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,230
Cheers?

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,180
- A'Du, take it away from her.
- Cheers.

39
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,580
Cheers.

40
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,350
Yongning!

41
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,110
I am a little bunny.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,790
A little bunny.

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,400
I want to shut myself away.

44
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,060
- Yongning! What are you doing?
- Little bunny...

45
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,070
- Little bunny...
- Let us go back to the palace. Go back to the palace.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,450
Yongning, let us go back! Okay?

47
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,420
Get up! Get up! We are going back to the palace.

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,860
I am not a little bunny. I am a bird!

49
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,690
- A bird!
- Why are you...

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,660
- What do you want to do?
- A bird.

51
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,530
Yongning, what are you doing?

52
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,980
- Yongning
- Fly, fly, fly!

53
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,350
- I am flying!
- Hurry! Hurry! The candles! The candles!

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,840
- The cups!
-Yongning, slow down!
- Flying!

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,960
- Flying!
- Slow down! Be careful!

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,660
- Flying!
- Stop flying!

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,220
- I am a bird! I am a bird!
- Yongning!

58
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,950
- Get down quickly!
- I am a bird!

59
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,800
Hurry and get down!

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Flying!

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,250
- Flying!
- Yongning, hurry and get down!

62
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,660
Flying! Flying! I am a bird!

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Fly! Fly!

64
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,780
- Fly! Fly!
- Stop flying. Stop flying.

65
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,330
Fly...

66
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,110
Raising my cup...

67
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,710
"I invite the moon to drink with me."
(T/N: From the poem "Drinking Alone under the Moon" by Li Bai)

68
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,120
"Along with my shadow, there are now three of us drinking together."

69
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,160
"When one's life is in the upstroke, you should revel to your heart's content."
(T/N: From the poem "Bring in the Wine" by Li Bai)

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,910
"Do not allow this golden goblet to be empty when it faces the moon."

71
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,590
Moon... Yongning, what is the next line?

72
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,470
Bird! Bird!

73
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,160
Bird...

74
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,560
General Pei,

75
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,450
how about I recite a poem for you?

76
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,210
"Red beans grow in the southern state."
(T/N: From the poem "Yearning" by Wang Wei)

77
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,110
"When spring comes, they grow a few branches."

78
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,030
"I wish for you to pick more."

79
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,990
"These are what one yearns for the most."

80
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,240
L-Let me recite more poems for you.

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,840
"The moon grows full over the sea."
(T/N: From the poem "Longing while Gazing at the Moon" by Zhang Jiuling)

82
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,130
"The whole world enjoys this moment together."

83
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:49,060
"Lovers hate the long night, unable to sleep and keep missing their love."

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
- Slow down! Slow down!
- Xiaofeng!

85
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,550
Xiaofeng!

86
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,410
- Let me tell you. This is the happiest I have been while drinking!
- Right!

87
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,150
Yes, happy! Happy!

88
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,160
- You must not tell Imperial Father.
- Slow down! Slow down!
- Do not tell Imperial Father.

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,970
- I won't tell him!
- You can't. You can't tell Imperial Father.

90
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,560
This horse's head has a flower on it!

91
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,280
A flower!

92
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,710
- I want one, too! I want a flower as well!
- Flower!

93
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,010
A flower.

94
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,440
I want a flower, too!

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,070
Look. A flower!

96
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,720
You two getting drunk is just too scary.

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,370
Look! A pretty flower!

98
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,560
General Pei, I'm not drunk.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,130
I'm really not drunk.

100
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,130
If you don't believe me, I'll recite you a poem.

101
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:50,890
"Red beans grow in the southern state. When spring comes, they grow a few branches."

102
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,100
"I wish for you to pick more. These are what one yearns for the most."

103
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,740
"The moon grows full over the sea, the whole world enjoys this moment together."

104
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,410
"Lovers hate the long night, unable to sleep and keep missing their love."

105
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,010
I know, Princess.

106
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,950
You don't know.

107
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,800
You don't know anything.

108
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,440
That Miss Mi Luo...

109
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,550
Why is that Miss Mi Luo so pretty?

110
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,130
Why is she so good looking?

111
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:27,820
If I... If I describe her, she is amber hiding among the beans.

112
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,520
Red lips like cherries.

113
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,430
Wind breezes through and birds fly away.

114
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,140
Smiles like blossoming flowers and a voice that lingers.

115
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,810
Seductive and graceful.

116
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,440
You are drunk.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,330
General Pei.

118
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,140
- Crown Princess Consort, you have finally come back.
- Yongniang?

119
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,020
I ask of you to give us the death penalty!

120
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,290
Have I not come back? Hurry and rise!

121
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,030
Crown Princess Consort, tomorrow is Related Lady of Excellence Zhao's birthday.

122
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,970
You must not forget to prepare a gift to be sent over.

123
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,870
I have already prepared something for her. Remember to wake me up tomorrow.

124
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,070
Crown Princess Consort, wait a second! Hurry and help Her Imperial Highness wash and dress!

125
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,670
Yes!

126
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,520
Geez...

127
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,830
Crown Princess Consort?

128
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,070
Crown Princess Consort?

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,070
Instruct the Imperial Buttery to prepare a bowl of longevity noodles

130
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,820
and send it over to Related Lady of Excellence Zhao later.

131
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,180
Tell her that Crown Princess Consort especially had the Imperial Buttery make it for her.

132
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes.

133
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,760
Related Lady of Excellence, Crown Princess Consort really does not take you seriously.

134
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,580
You only have one birthday in a year, but all she sent was just a bowl of longevity noodles.

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,020
From what I can see, she is likely jealous of you.

136
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,500
She is jealous that His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince cherishes you alone.

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,070
She's using her status as the crown princess consort to be haughty and sneer at you.

138
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,540
It is best if you do not eat this bowl of noodles. Let me dispose of them for you.

139
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,440
No, since it was rewarded by the crown princess consort, then I must eat it.

140
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,980
And I have to enjoy eating it.

141
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,880
What are you doing?

142
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,810
What are you looking for?

143
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,610
I am looking for something you hid.

144
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,690
What thing?

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
- Give it to me!
- What is this?

146
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,070
What does it matter to you? Give it back to me.

147
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,320
It must be something you use to hurt others.

148
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,410
I'm using those to make a protection bracelet that I'm gifting someone in a few days!

149
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,920
I have to give it to him in a few days!

150
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,220
If I lose one bead, I will have you answer for it.

151
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,880
You are still able to sit still?

152
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,970
Why would I not be able to sit still?

153
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,750
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is now suffering from vomiting and diarrhea after eating the longevity noodles that you sent!

154
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,080
How do you explain that?!

155
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,810
When did I have someone send noodles to her?

156
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,520
You dare to act but do not dare to admit?

157
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,780
I did not do it, so why do I have to admit?

158
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,300
Xi State women have always been upright and aboveboard in our actions.

159
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,640
But you, you don't clearly investigate the situation first, did not go comfort your Related Lady of Excellence Zhao,

160
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,540
and instead came here to indiscriminately and violently criticize me.

161
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,270
With your brains, are you really fit to be the crown prince?!

162
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,910
You still dare to speak to me this way?!

163
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,750
Do you believe that I can divorce you now?!

164
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,090
- So what if you do?
- Your Imperial Highness, please forgive my sin!

165
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,980
This has nothing to do with Crown Princess Consort.

166
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,320
That... bowl of longevity noodles was sent by me.

167
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,330
But I really did not do anything to it.

168
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,320
I just thought that today was Related Lady of Excellence Zhao's birthday.

169
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
If Crown Princess Consort does not reward her anything,

170
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,650
it seemed... a bit...

171
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,330
But Crown Princess Consort had not yet woken, so without permission, I acted presumptuously

172
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,150
and ordered someone to send a bowl of longevity noodles.

173
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,870
But I did not think that Concubine Zhao would vomit and have diarrhea from it.

174
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,880
I would never hurt her!

175
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,690
I will properly investigate this affair.

176
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,170
This is all because I acted presumptuously. Please confer upon me the death penalty.

177
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:40,030
Since we did not do anything, her having diarrhea has nothing to do with us!

178
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,090
Yongniang, do not always go around asking for the death penalty.

179
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,240
Hurry and get up! You kneeling this long makes me tired.

180
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,610
Crown Princess Consort, that word is taboo. You cannot say it.

181
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,570
Your Imperial Highness, what are you going to do about the longevity noodles?

182
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,250
The longevity noodles were sent by the chief lady-in-waiting of the crown princess consort, Yongniang.

183
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,270
Yongniang used to serve Imperial Great-Grandmother.

184
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,730
She won't do anything dishonorable.

185
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,510
But in the Eastern Palace now,

186
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:24,950
there are only two harem members, Crown Princess Consort and Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

187
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,560
Who would want to harm Concubine Zhao?

188
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,480
Even though I don't want to believe it,

189
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,120
I am afraid Sese did these things to herself,

190
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,210
and then acted as the thief that cried thief.
(T/N: covering her deed by shifting blame)

191
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,770
That Concubine Zhao really had the audacity to play the thief crying the thief.

192
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,110
You're right. Related Lady of Excellence Zhao acted out this whole incident but the crown prince still believed her.

193
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,410
He even made a scene in the palace of the crown princess consort.

194
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,990
Out of anger, the crown prince even threatened to divorce the crown princess consort.

195
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,690
How can these inferior tricks fool the crown prince?

196
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,750
It's because he favors Concubine Zhao too much,

197
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,110
so he is blinded by her tricks.

198
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,010
Concubine Zhao is a menace.

199
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:21,460
I am afraid that later on, the crown prince will only listen to her and not you.

200
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,670
Empress, you should plan accordingly.

201
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,280
Have you taken care of Xuniang's incident yet?

202
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,430
I have arranged it accordingly.

203
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,990
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is quite unlucky.

204
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,470
I should go see her.

205
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,730
I haven't even given her the gift I bought for her.

206
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,850
Are you silly? You were reprimanded by my fifth brother because of her.

207
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,870
And now, you want to visit her and send her gifts?

208
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,900
It's not her fault. It's Li Chengyin who was unreasonable.

209
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,110
Either way, she is sick,

210
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,660
I should go visit her.

211
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,720
You're going to visit her?

212
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,120
If anything else happens to her, Fifth Brother will blame you again.

213
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,780
He can believe whatever he wants.

214
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,860
Girls from Xi State are always upright and righteous.

215
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,810
Why would I be afraid of him?

216
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,950
Play a card.

217
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,180
Related Lady of Excellence, the crown princess consort is here.

218
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,290
Did she find out something

219
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,320
and is here to question us?

220
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,250
Don't panic.

221
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:46,170
Let's go out and check first what her purpose in coming here is.

222
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,200
Greetings, Elder Sister.

223
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,640
I have not yet fully recovered, so I am a little tired.

224
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,940
Forgive me for my inadequate behavior.

225
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,560
You don't have to be particular about rules in front of me.

226
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,840
I am here to give you a birthday present.

227
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,650
Take a look.

228
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,370
Last time, it was because Li Chengyin angered me

229
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,660
that I forgot to give it to you.

230
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,450
Do you like it?

231
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,190
This rock looks very unique.

232
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,060
This is a malachite stone from Xi State.

233
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,060
It may not be expensive,

234
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,370
but it's very rare in the Central Plains.

235
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,370
Thank you, Sister.

236
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,880
You aren't fully recovered yet, so I won't bother you any longer.

237
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,630
Maybe I ate something bad,

238
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,500
but I know that it has nothing to do with the longevity noodles.

239
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,060
It's good that you believe me, unlike Li Chengyin,

240
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,020
who blamed it on me without any evidence.

241
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,170
Make sure to have plenty of rest.

242
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,050
Sister, stop for a bit.

243
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,540
Do you remember when you asked me about the wolf fang?

244
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,390
It might not be mine. Maybe, I mistook it for mine.

245
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,320
You don't know unless you see it.

246
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,750
Jin'er, bring my wolf fang here.

247
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,500
Go bring it.

248
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,170
Yes.

249
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,490
Crown Princess Consort.

250
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,720
Sister, take a look. Is it your wolf fang?

251
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,600
This is mine. Why is it with you?

252
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:37,550
Actually, this wolf fang is a love token gifted to me by the crown prince.

253
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,770
Li Chengyin?

254
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,520
I didn't know that this wolf fang belonged to you.

255
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,230
But since it was gifted to me by the crown prince,

256
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,310
if I gave it to you,

257
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,770
I am afraid it would not be proper.

258
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,000
Since it was like that, you should keep it.

259
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,920
I'll go now.

260
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,220
Related Lady of Excellence, why did you do that?

261
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,250
I have to make sure

262
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,070
of what relationship she has with His Imperial Highness.

263
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,210
Come, Crown Princess Consort, have some tea.

264
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,320
- Crown Princess Consort, you made this?
- Yes, I did.

265
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,620
You even have this type of craftsmanship?

266
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,380
Even the palace's treasure-holding female officials don't have these skills.

267
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,560
I may not know how to do other things but with things like this,

268
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,500
if I claimed to be second best in Xi State, no one would dare to claim first.

269
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,300
Girls in the Central Plains mainly work on embroidery and needlework.

270
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,930
There's no one that knows how to do this.

271
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,310
In Xi State, before a lady is married off,

272
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,020
she must make a waistband as a token of love.

273
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,910
So, even if the girls in Xi Sate cannot do embroidery,

274
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,980
they must know how to make beaded accessories.

275
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,470
Making this is good. His Imperial Highness will surely like it.

276
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,290
What does that have to do with me?

277
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,360
You didn't make this for His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince?

278
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,470
I made this for the person who saved my life.

279
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,360
Your savior?

280
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,000
Greetings to Your Highness.

281
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,170
General Pei, thank you for saving A'Du and me at the East Market last time.

282
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,200
I never saw you outside the palace.

283
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,200
I understand. But girls from Xi State will not be indebted to someone without repayment.

284
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,180
I made a good luck charm for you.

285
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,440
Protecting Crown Princess Consort is just a part of my duties.

286
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,710
Would you please take it back?

287
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,620
- You must take it.
- No, I cannot take it.

288
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,550
- Take it.
- Crown Princess Consort.

289
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,630
Your Imperial Highness.

290
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,970
What are you doing here?

291
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,680
This is my Eastern Palace. Why would it be strange for me to be here?

292
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,430
But you, as the crown princess consort, are not staying in your Bearing Graces Hall,

293
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,190
- and instead, came here for what?
- This is also my Eastern Palace.

294
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,480
I can go wherever I want.

295
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,310
Junior Mentor Li is still waiting. Let's hurry and leave.

296
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,480
Yes.

297
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,050
Wait!

298
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:48,370
I have something to ask you.

299
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,820
What's the matter?

300
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,290
Zhao Sese's wolf fang, did you give it to her?

301
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,690
Why are you asking?

302
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,460
I ask you if you did or did not?

303
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,970
Answer me first. Why are you asking?

304
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,880
What does that wolf fang have to do with you?

305
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,760
- That was my wolf fang!
- Just because you say it's yours doesn't mean it is.

306
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,110
You...

307
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,420
That was Grandfather's gift to me. It was his trophy from killing the wolf king.

308
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,560
- Really?
- Of course, it is.

309
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,730
I had it since I was young. How can I mistake it for something else?

310
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,940
I found that wolf fang after organizing the things I took back from the Western Border.

311
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,230
Sese liked it, so I just gave it to her.

312
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,990
You just gave it? Why would you just give my stuff to another person?

313
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,660
I didn't know it was yours!

314
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,200
Fine, I'll take care of it.

315
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,730
Let's go.

316
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,820
You'll take care of it?

317
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,360
So, are you giving it back to me or not?

318
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,730
[Mi Luo Drinking House]

319
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,950
With this many dishes, how long will it take you to finish cleaning?

320
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,850
I'll help you.

321
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,850
So, she made this to give to you.

322
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,870
This wrist protector... It's not that easy to take off by myself.

323
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,980
You're not here this late at night just to show off, right?

324
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,870
The crown princess consort asked His Imperial Highness about the wolf fang today.

325
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,800
Wolf fang?

326
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,510
His Highness also didn't know from where he got that wolf fang.

327
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,950
He then gifted it to Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

328
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,390
Crown Princess Consort then saw Concubine Zhao wearing the wolf fang,

329
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,010
so she went to ask His Highness how he got it?

330
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,130
What did His Imperial Highness say?

331
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,550
He said he found it in a box of things brought back from the Western Border.

332
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:08,400
I am worried... what if they remember something through the wolf fang?

333
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,430
Now that you mention it,

334
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,200
Xiaofeng has been acting weird these days.

335
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,990
She's been avoiding me every time she leaves the palace.

336
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,920
She even went to see a physician.

337
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,070
She might be looking for ways to regain her memory.

338
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,890
What if she is slowly remembering things?

339
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,910
What should we do?

340
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,050
Since His Highness and Xiaofeng are being suspicious because of the wolf fang,

341
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,330
then we should give them a reasonable answer,

342
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,290
so they don't keep guessing.

343
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,380
I don't know how to lie.

344
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,830
I'll teach you.

345
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,700
Your Imperial Highness, these are all the things you brought back from the Western Border.

346
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,850
Your Imperial Highness.

347
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,010
Zhao, what is it?

348
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,440
Last time, Crown Princess Consort asked you about that wolf fang.

349
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,240
- Actually...
- You know where it came from?

350
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,730
That wolf fang was found on the way back from the Western Border.

351
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,530
I found it outside the campsite.

352
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,070
I thought it was a trophy you took from defeating Danchi,

353
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,540
so I didn't think too much about it and put it in your belongings.

354
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,760
I didn't think it would lead to a conflict between you and Crown Princess Consort.

355
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,890
Should I go explain this situation to her?

356
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,600
No need to.

357
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,700
What I mean is, I'll go tell her.

358
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,580
You don't need to go through the trouble.

359
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,640
Shi'en, take these back first.

360
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,190
Yes.

361
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,800
- General.
- What happened?

362
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,560
Wannian County's Magistrate sent someone to inform us that two of our guards got involved in a case.

363
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,580
They want you to go over and check it out.

364
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,230
But I checked our records and these two don't exist.

365
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,750
Maybe it's an imposter hoping to get out of the case.

366
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,650
You can take care of this yourself.

367
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,510
Yes.

368
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,060
Wait.

369
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,760
General, do you know their names?

370
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,300
There is one called Zhou Xi.

371
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,910
Okay.

372
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,930
[Court of Wannian County]

373
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,790
What's going on? Are they swindlers?

374
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,000
They're swindlers.

375
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,670
Last time, I saw them, too.

376
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,510
How can they bully a little child?

377
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,160
How can they do that?

378
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,260
They shouldn't be doing that.

379
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,470
There are all kinds of people in this world.

380
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,750
It was my last resort to disturb you, My Lord.

381
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,940
I heard that my men pushed an innocent child into the water.

382
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,130
Of course, I have to come and take a look.

383
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,360
It is true. General, please take a seat.

384
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,550
This is the Court of Wannian County.

385
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,830
Just keep the trial going. I'll be observing on the side.

386
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,220
Yes, of course.

387
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,230
What are you still doing there? Go get a chair for the general!

388
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,990
General, this way, please.

389
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,560
Who is the plaintiff? What is your occupation?

390
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,130
Your Honor, my family name is Jia.

391
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,480
Our family lives by the river and are fishermen.

392
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,160
What are you charging this person for?

393
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,840
Your Honor, today, as my wife and I were reeling in the fishing net,

394
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,530
a fellow neighbor came to tell us that our son fell into the water.

395
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,640
So we ran over to take a look.

396
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,050
My son was wet from head to toe.

397
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,030
He was lying on the ground and shaking from the cold.

398
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,390
I asked him why did he end up in the water?

399
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,230
He told me that he accidentally bumped into this young lord.

400
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:56,690
He then pushed my son into the water, Your Honor!

401
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,740
- I...
- The weather is so cold lately.

402
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,310
My poor son is so cold to the point that he's lost half his life, Your Honor!

403
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,630
Little child sitting below the court, who pushed you into the water?

404
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,970
It's him!

405
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,870
I saved you!

406
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,230
Didn't you fall into the water and I ended up saving you?

407
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,520
When did I push you?

408
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,580
Zhou Xi, let me ask you.

409
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,160
Do you know how to swim?

410
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,830
I don't know how.

411
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,930
You don't know how to swim,

412
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,540
yet you still jumped into the river to save him.

413
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,020
If you didn't push him into the river,

414
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,190
why would you risk your life to save him?

415
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,000
Why would I think so much about saving someone's life?

416
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,770
He fell into the water; of course, I had to save him!

417
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,610
Then, how did you two get out of the river?

418
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,280
M-My friend knows how to swim. When I fell into the water back then, he saved me.

419
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,140
He learned how to swim for my sake.

420
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,640
Nonsense!

421
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,630
Humans are selfish and treasure their life the most.

422
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,820
You and the boy are strangers.

423
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,770
You don't know how to swim and you still saved him?

424
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,680
If you didn't feel guilty, then what is it?

425
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,730
If you felt guilty, then it must be because you pushed him into the water.

426
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,190
So, this is how you resolve cases.

427
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,430
That... General Pei, look.

428
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,190
How about we do this?

429
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,150
Take the little girl to the back hall first.

430
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,090
I'll ask her elder brother for now, then bring her out later.

431
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,510
Oh right. Give her some snacks.

432
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,890
Men, take the little girl away.

433
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,870
You said earlier that you were playing by the river

434
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:49,610
- and this person pushed you into the river, right?
- Right.

435
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,340
Then did he push you from behind?

436
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,960
Yes, he did.

437
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,920
Since he pushed you from behind and you don't have eyes behind you,

438
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,010
how come you're so sure that it was this person and not someone else?

439
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,960
I remembered wrong. He pushed me from the front.

440
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,220
I fell into the water with my back first.

441
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,410
All right.

442
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,080
- You're sure that your back fell into the water first?
- Yes.

443
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,670
Your Honor, you can take him to the back and give him some snacks, too.

444
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,210
Men, take him back there.

445
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,680
Bring that little girl forward.

446
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,010
Little miss.

447
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,030
Let me ask you. Did you personally see that person push your brother?

448
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,610
- It is him.
- All right.

449
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,070
Your brother was playing along the river.

450
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,440
Then he just pushed your brother into the river, right?

451
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,010
How did he push your brother?

452
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,760
He pushed like that.

453
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,430
Elder Brother was sitting there,

454
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,710
and he walked over from behind and pushed my brother

455
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,770
like that.

456
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,920
Then, did he push your brother's backside

457
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,730
or did he push your brother's shoulder?

458
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,420
He pushed my brother's backside.

459
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,890
You're sure it's the backside?

460
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:20,710
If it's not shoulders, then it's the back.

461
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,630
All right.

462
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,490
Your Honor,

463
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,520
these two children's answers are different.

464
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,700
There are too many suspicious points.

465
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,960
I hope you carefully investigate.

466
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,410
General, you are right. You are right.

467
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,670
Bring that boy who fell into the water here!

468
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,560
How audacious of you! You dared to lie!

469
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,660
I didn't lie!

470
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,690
If you still don't speak the truth, you will be dragged out and caned 100 times!

471
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,930
All mighty and powerful.

472
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,950
My father told me to do it!

473
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,770
My little sister and I are good at swimming.

474
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,020
We commonly pretend to fall into the water and trick people into saving us,

475
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:23,410
then claim that they pushed us into the water

476
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,890
so Father can get a compensation fee.

477
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,200
They were all willing to get scammed by you?

478
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,380
People usually think that children don't lie.

479
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,890
The people who saved the children are unable to give a convincing explanation and refuse to go to court.

480
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:48,410
So, in the end, they would just accept their bad luck and solve the issue with money.

481
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,620
People like you who would insist to go to court to settle this affair,

482
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,390
it's our first time running into one.

483
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,460
Now that the truth is clear, that my subordinate saved the child with good intentions

484
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,080
but ended up being framed, he is indeed innocent.

485
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,690
Your Honor, now that things are cleared up,

486
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,390
I will take my men back.

487
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,350
General, please do as you please.

488
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,560
Wait! I have something to say.

489
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,490
You just said that humans are selfish and treasure their lives the most.

490
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,110
I don't know this child and I can't swim.

491
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,230
If I risk my life saving him, it must mean I'm feeling guilty. Right?

492
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,340
Complete nonsense!

493
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,130
Protecting the weak and young, and saving those in trouble are righteous deeds!

494
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:47,400
He is a young child. If he accidentally fell into the water, shouldn't I save him?!

495
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,740
But you, on the other hand.

496
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:55,170
If you conclude cases like this, who then is willing to risk their lives to save others in the future?

497
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,610
Wouldn't it disappoint all the good people in the world?!

498
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,430
Of course. You're right.

499
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,380
Let me tell you. Things got cleared up this time.

500
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,510
Next time, if this happens again, I will still go save that person!

501
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,790
You're right. Save the people. Save the people.

502
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,300
Good! Well done!

503
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,530
- Young Lord, well said!
- Let's go.

504
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,980
Yes, great!

505
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,550
Yes, it should be like that!

506
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,390
People should be like that! Good!

507
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,600
Great!

508
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,910
Crown Princess Consort.

509
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,700
Call me "Young Lord."

510
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,480
Young Lord.

511
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:38,530
I've never seen you dressed like this before.

512
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,160
I always see you in armor and always so stern.

513
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,880
You actually look good in that.

514
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,590
Let me tell you. I was so worried when the magistrate went to find you.

515
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,720
You don't know that I used the pseudonym Zhou Xi.

516
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
What if you didn't come, or if someone who didn't know the situation came?

517
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,330
Then, wouldn't A'Du and I have to fight those people right there in the court?

518
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,400
Good thing, you came.

519
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,000
[Court of Wannian County]

520
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,730
I have learned a lesson today.

521
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,550
I didn't know parents like this existed.

522
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:17,850
The human heart is full of treachery. You should be careful.

523
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,910
I won't be able to take precautions on everything. There are too many swindlers here.

524
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,450
Unlike people from Xi State, our feelings are shown right through our faces.

525
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,990
You aren't like them. You're a good person.

526
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,100
I've caused so much trouble, and you fix it every time.

527
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,400
It looks like the colored glass beaded bracelet isn't enough for repayment.

528
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,160
I should think about what else I should give you.

529
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,590
Crown Princess Consort, it is my job to protect you.

530
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,820
I don't need any repayment.

531
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,340
I am a person who likes to repay any debts of gratitude.

532
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,500
Your Imperial Highness, you must not give me any more gifts.

533
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,990
Do you not like the things I give you?

534
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,680
It's not that.

535
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,660
It's just... you're the crown princess consort.

536
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,080
We are not of the same status, I do not dare to take it.

537
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,740
I treat you as a friend. Is it right to bring up status between us?

538
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,550
But in the palace, not everyone can be friends.

539
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,010
Who said that?

540
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,510
Yongning is my friend. Luoxi is my friend. You are also my friend.

541
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,920
Let's go.

542
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,630
Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty.

543
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,430
How is the investigation?

544
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,520
Chai Mu seems to have disappeared overnight.

545
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,040
I searched the whole capital. There is no trace of him.

546
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,500
- Ceng Xian.
- I'm here!

547
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,690
Go outside the palace with me.

548
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,950
Where did you want to go, Your Imperial Majesty?

549
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,860
Fellow customer, this way, please.

550
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,420
Here, take a look.

551
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,250
Go to Mi Luo Wine House and buy some good quality wines.

552
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:13,990
Just tell her that I have an important customer.

553
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:30,160
Miss Mingyue, did the two strangers from last time come to bother you again?

554
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,790
Didn't he give you ten taels of gold?

555
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,980
Can you show me? Maybe I can find some clues from that.

556
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,330
My Lord, you aren't here to listen to me play songs, am I right?

557
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:21,580
Are you still suspicious that I am somehow related to those two people?

558
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,000
I was raised by Mother Wang. She knows my background very well.

559
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,400
If you don't believe me, you can ask her.

560
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,050
If you don't believe Mother Wang and me,

561
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,320
then you can take me to the court for questioning.

562
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,260
You don't have to waste your time.

563
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,140
I never would've thought that you had such a strong personality.

564
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,080
Even though I was born into the materialistic world and am of lower status, I still have dignity.

565
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,890
I am not willing to let others look down and think lightly of me.

566
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,820
I only perform to those who I believe can appreciate my music.

567
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,950
I thought that you came here to listen to me play music.

568
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,990
But it turns out, you are here to do official business.

569
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,480
Then would you please do your business accordingly, and not ridicule me.

570
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,370
How audacious! Do you know who you are speaking to?!

571
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,330
Actually, I've only met you once.

572
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,900
Why do you trust me?

573
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,980
Even though I've never seen your face, I've heard your voice.

574
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,960
I know that you are different from those that use music as an excuse for their ulterior motives.

575
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,140
Your voice puts me at ease.

576
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,900
I imagined you as a cultured and fine gentleman.

577
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,770
So, my heart has developed some hope.

578
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,480
But it turns out, I thought too much

579
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,810
I shouldn't have had the delusion of having you as a bosom friend.

580
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,040
I am your bosom friend?

581
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:58,740
Honestly, I have been a little impolite.

582
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:02,290
All right, I will take the penalty of three cups of wine.

583
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,840
- My Lord!
- You may leave.

584
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,570
Earlier, I did not act properly. I spoiled your experience.

585
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,580
I should take the penalty, too.

586
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,520
So, you think of me as your bosom friend?

587
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,150
That's great. A toast to you.

589
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,920
[Singing Jade Brothel]

590
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,450
Mingyue, has His Imperial Majesty gotten suspicious of you because of last time?

591
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Brother Gu Jian, can you plan for me to meet the crown prince?

592
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,180
I have something important to tell him.
