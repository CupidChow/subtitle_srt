00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,030
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,640
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,020
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,900
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,630
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,040
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,260
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,100
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,890
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,640
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,890
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:39,130
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,800
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,670
[Episode 47]

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,250
You've peeled so many.

18
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,130
- Crown Prince is here!
- Hurry.

19
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,630
Greetings to Imperial Great Grandmother.

20
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,460
Come, come, come.

21
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,840
Why do you have free time to visit me today?

22
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,520
Don't you have that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao with you?

23
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,400
Great Grandmother, stop teasing me.

24
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,340
Do you want some walnuts?

25
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,340
Yingqiao is very good at opening walnuts.

26
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,420
Look how many she's opened. Eat some.

27
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,860
Great Grandmother, you know that I don't like walnuts.

28
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,170
How could I forget?

29
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,130
You don't like walnuts?

30
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,410
Here come the purple rice cakes. Have a bite.

31
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,040
- Here.
- I'll feed you first.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,710
- All right.
- Just like when you were young.

33
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,590
Taste good?

34
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,990
Yes.

35
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,160
You should eat more.

36
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,020
I haven't seen such a pretty moon for so long.

37
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,680
What's that?

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,550
Here, smell it.

39
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,610
Grape wine?

40
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,580
I knew you'd like it. To view the moon, you must have wine.

41
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,180
It's only after I came to Shangjing that I discovered that I love wine.

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,470
How can you resolve your worries? Only with Du Kang!

43
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,360
To hear you say that, it sounds strange.

44
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,400
Yongniang taught me that.

45
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,010
Yongniang taught me a lot of other things, too. But I've forgotten them.

46
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:51,360
To be able to forget is not so bad.

47
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,550
You know it's so different here compared to Xi State.

48
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,990
Different food, different clothes,

49
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,950
and the people are different.

50
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,720
I thought if I treated people with a sincere heart,

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,340
I would get sincerity in return.

52
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,460
I am just too naive.

53
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,230
But there are still a lot of people who are nice to me.

54
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,800
Look. Yongniang, Mi Luo,

55
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,940
Luoxi, Mingyue,

56
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,060
and Pei Zhao.

57
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,580
Also, Yongniang, who's been taking care of me.

58
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,400
When I think of this, I feel pretty lucky.

59
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,090
Let me tell you. A few days ago,

60
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,360
Crown Princess Consort made me some Ruyi cake.

61
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,600
- Was it good?
- It was bitter.

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,300
I knew it. She's so absentminded.

63
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,210
She knew to make some to bring to you,

64
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,520
but she didn't know to try them first and see if they were edible.

65
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,590
I was happy though because she made it herself.

66
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,320
So, even though it was bitter to eat,

67
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,480
it was sweet inside my heart.

68
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,150
You have always been generous and tolerant of her.

69
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,680
Let me tell you. She really is a nice girl.

70
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,060
She is different from the others in the palace.

71
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,270
She loves to have fun and play, how can she manage the inner palace?

72
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:35,670
I actually wish that she can play around in a carefree manner forever

73
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,170
and not get involved in the scheming intrigue.

74
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,170
Don't be so prejudiced.

75
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,300
She's so smart and sensible.

76
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,770
Of course, she understands her responsibility

77
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,170
and her mission.

78
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,900
There's one thing

79
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,440
that comforts me most.

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,410
That is... she loves you.

81
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,090
She doesn't love you as the crown prince or your future throne.

82
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:13,060
She sincerely really loves... Li Chengyin.

83
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,970
Return to Xi State with me.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,250
What else is here that's worthy to stay for?

85
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,740
It's not that,

86
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,340
but I've discovered that most of my memories

87
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,030
are those about Shangjing.

88
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,010
Sometimes I can't even tell clearly

89
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,100
whether I am first the ninth princess of Xi State

90
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,740
or the crown princess consort of the Li Empire.

91
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,970
Also you.

92
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,130
You are by my side.

93
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,930
Sometimes I find you familiar, a person that I'm very close to,

94
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,850
but other times you also seem like a stranger.

95
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,030
Maybe, nothing here has ever belonged to me.

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,640
It's time to wake up. And it's time to leave.

97
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,600
From now on, I will always stay by your side.

98
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Don't disturb him.

99
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,370
Let him get a good sleep.

100
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,170
Sleep.

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,960
If the crown princess consort knows that you've been praying for her day and night,

102
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,040
she would definitely return safely.

103
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,560
I hope that is so.

104
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,140
Grand Empress Dowager, when the crown prince came yesterday,

105
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,140
why didn't you ask about the crown princess consort?

106
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,320
What's the use of asking?

107
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,290
I know his temperament.

108
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,460
He will keep it all inside and not talk about it.

109
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,580
Besides, she hasn't been found yet,

110
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,360
why add to his frustration?

111
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,090
From what I see, between the crown prince and the crown princess consort, there seems...

112
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,180
How can I not know?

113
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,540
Those two are really good kids.

114
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,560
They just don't know their feelings about each other.

115
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,660
I really want to give them a push.

116
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,620
As to what the end result would be, it all depends on their love fate.

117
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,720
The way to great learning... 
(Confucius: The Great Learning)

118
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,590
is to comprehend high virtues...

119
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,710
to be close to people...

120
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,630
to never stop pursuing until perfection is met.

121
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,160
The way to great learning...

122
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,100
is to comprehend high virtues...

123
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:02,420
to be close to people...

124
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,010
to never stop pursuing until perfection is met.

125
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,760
Knowing to stop until a plan has been set...

126
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,640
Teacher, an older brother is here.

127
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,400
Grand Preceptor, I hope you have been well.

128
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,560
Greetings to the crown prince.

129
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,920
Grand Preceptor, please rise.

130
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,830
Miss Mingyue, the imperial physician is here to check your pulse.

131
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,790
Ask him to enter.

132
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,860
Please.

133
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,070
Greetings to Miss Mingyue.

134
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,750
You can all leave. I'll call if there is anything I need.

135
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,340
Yes.

136
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,310
The emperor will be here tonight. You are skilled in cooking,

137
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,300
so prepare some snacks. Make it varied. Don't be lax.

138
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,630
Yes, Miss Mingyue.

139
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,180
This is yellow chrysanthemums that I grew myself.

140
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,920
The water was collected from the mountain creek in the morning.

141
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,590
It smells fragrant and tastes slightly sweet.

142
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,670
You are thoughtful, Grand Preceptor.

143
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,970
Please don't call me Grand Preceptor anymore.

144
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,520
I am a civilian and can't bear that status anymore.

145
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,740
Grand Preceptor, once a teacher, always a teacher.

146
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,060
You will always be my teacher.

147
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,790
Are you here on anything special?

148
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,180
Is it about growing flowers, brewing tea,

149
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,840
humming poems, and writing poetry? Maybe I can be of help.

150
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,190
You are too humble. You are the only one who can help me with this matter.

151
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,280
I've left court politics for many years.

152
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm afraid that I can't help you much.

153
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,760
Do you need anything from me that's why you have to enter the palace this time?

154
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,580
It's... just to take a look at my daughter.

155
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,340
How does the emperor treat you? Is anyone bullying you?

156
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,910
The emperor is very nice to me. With him defending me, no one dares to bully me.

157
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,020
The emperor is busy with a lot of things. He can't be around to defend you all the time.

158
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,180
The inner palace is not a safe place to stay. When you recover,

159
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,280
you should leave quickly.

160
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,770
I know very well that the emperor has fallen for me.

161
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,470
Otherwise, he wouldn't have brought me to the palace.

162
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,140
If I don't grab this opportunity, there won't be another chance.

163
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,330
How much is love worth?

164
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,300
The emperor has other matters that are more important than love.

165
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,110
He can love you today,

166
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,540
but can also be vicious to you tomorrow. Don't you know that?

167
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,620
I know.

168
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,450
The inner palace should not be where you will settle.

169
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,970
The imperial court... is also not what I aspire for anymore.

170
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,890
Can you bear leaving it?

171
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,130
Can you drop everything that you've fought for?

172
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,790
All these years, everything that I've done

173
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,840
was not for the prestige and money that I'd lost.

174
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,190
Eliminating Gao Yuming is for the emperor's sake,

175
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,620
for the Li Empire!

176
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,450
For twenty years, I've never forgotten the emperor

177
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,010
who I swore supreme allegiance to.

178
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,930
To clear treachery and betrayers from his side

179
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,560
is probably the last thing I can ever do for him.

180
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,280
Aren't you also stuck in the midst of it?

181
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,470
But it only needs one person, me, to fly toward the flame like a moth.

182
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,490
You are still young, and you can have a future.

183
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,260
Father, don't think about abandoning me again.

184
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,870
This time, I will leave with you.

185
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,560
Here.

186
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,920
I'm leaving now. The inner palace is an abyss.

187
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,150
Do not ever get stuck in it.

188
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,540
Father, don't come to the palace again. It's too dangerous.

189
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,760
The emperor is here!

190
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,920
- Greetings to the emperor.
- You are excused. Sit.

191
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,620
Imperial physician, how is Mingyue's body?

192
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,870
Your Majesty, the recent prescription has been effective.

193
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,690
The imperial physician said I am fine now.

194
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,460
Is that right?

195
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,270
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.

196
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,130
You may go down now.

197
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:57,770
Your Imperial Majesty has sacred virtues that protect Miss Mingyue.

198
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,160
It will also protect the people of Li Empire and all the common people under the heavens.

199
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,480
That year, seven applicants in the imperial civil exam

200
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,180
were unjustly dropped due to being framed,

201
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,670
and they committed mass suicide out of despair.

202
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,840
You surely still remember this big case that shocked the entire court.

203
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,180
Of course, I remember. But that case was already closed at that time.

204
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,490
After so many years,

205
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,730
what's the point of you mentioning this case again?

206
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,420
That's true.

207
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,800
Every year there are many applicants who fail at the imperial civil exam.

208
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,860
However, these seven men, as if it was agreed upon,

209
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,400
hanged themselves at home on the same day.

210
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,090
These were the lives of seven well-learned scholars.

211
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,730
Do you really think it's pointless?

212
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,560
It's not up to us to judge the value.

213
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,720
People have died and mouths were sealed back then.

214
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,170
There is no proof to find anymore.

215
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,820
Yes.

216
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,210
Someone spent a lot of money to keep the case closed.

217
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,370
He pacified the family members of the dead. But he didn't know

218
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,060
that there was still a letter written in blood that has remained.

219
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,920
These dead scholars wrote a plea in blood that documented in detail

220
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,220
how they were dropped from the admitted list for no cause,

221
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,600
then got bullied and humiliated, eventually pushing them to that desperate path.

222
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,210
There was also a list of names included in the blood letter

223
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,280
that listed the real cheaters.

224
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,330
Many are now important and prestigious officials of the court.

225
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,180
The most important is...

226
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:54,400
These people are all allies of Gao Yuming, who was the chief examiner at that time.

227
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,860
As the Li Empire's Crown Prince, if I can't protect our people,

228
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,160
how will I be able to protect our land?

229
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,980
I plea for Imperial Father to reopen the case and give justice to those scholars!

230
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,620
I have a favor to ask. Please secretly take the Grand Preceptor out of Shangjing.

231
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,150
Do not let anyone know where he's gone, especially Prime Minister Gao.

232
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,640
Heaven has eyes. ("There will be justice.")

233
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,940
Master! Master! I just received news from the palace

234
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,630
that the crown prince... has been deposed.

235
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,750
I know you've always wanted to protect my eldest brother.

236
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,020
You stopped making any moves and hid the bloodletter just in time when he was in trouble.

237
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,770
You gave up on attacking Gao Yuming and, thereby, avoided more trouble for my brother.

238
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,710
Your Imperial Highness, for you to have reached your high position today

239
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,480
is partly because of Prime Minister Gao's efforts.

240
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,360
When you do this now, aren't you destroying your own base?

241
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,600
I will never forget my mother's last name.

242
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,820
To overthrow Prime Minister Gao isn't just for my mother, it's also for justice.

243
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,190
Now that I know about this wrongful case,

244
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,380
I will give justice in the name of all the scholars in the world.

245
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,100
My eldest brother was my closest sibling. Now, there is only me left

246
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,740
to finish this mission of his.

247
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,260
Your Imperial Highness, don't you know that

248
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,000
it isn't enough to knock down Prime Minister Gao based on one bloodletter?

249
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,960
I know that, but I believe it is the starting fuse.

250
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,060
I believe you also have a wish,

251
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,530
that someday the truth will be revealed.

252
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,710
"The way to great learning is to comprehend high virtues." You taught me that.

253
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,180
I will never forget it.

254
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,960
[...Cao Shu, Luo Yongtian...]

255
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,200
I will exert my full force to achieve it.

256
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,520
Gao Yuming thinks that I am frustrated now for not finding the assassin.

257
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,440
He wouldn't have imagined that

258
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,090
someone would reopen this old case at this time.

259
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,020
This bloodletter mentions many powerful nobles.

260
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,190
You touch one and you will be shaking the whole picture.

261
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,590
With this one move, there will be chaos in the court.

262
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,240
I exactly want Imperial Father to see

263
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,150
how many close associates Gao Yuming has in court.

264
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,280
And how these associates used dirty schemes to get to their high positions.

265
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,200
The case about the assassin. The case about the scholars.

266
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,490
Just based on these two cases, it's enough for Gao Yuming

267
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,760
to exhaust all the trust the emperor has in him.

268
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,010
He is vicious in how he does things. For self-preservation,

269
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,540
he will definitely deploy ruthless methods. We must be careful.

270
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,270
Now that we have the bloodletter,

271
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,540
all we need is a brave scholarly official.

272
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,040
Court Minister Xi Qingzhuo of the Court of Judicial Review.

273
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:06,260
[List of names...]

274
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,790
Why is there no one here at Bearing Graces Hall?

275
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,210
The servants are probably not in the mood to work when the mistress is missing.

276
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,230
Forget it. Let's go.

277
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,650
Miss A'Du, Related Lady Of Excellence is here to bring you some items.

278
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,960
This is the snack that My Lady has brought you.

279
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,970
And a pretty dress that any girl would like.

280
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,630
A'Du, don't be shy.

281
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,760
I am like a sister to your mistress.

282
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,950
When she is not here, I should take care of you.

283
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,400
A'Du, since your mistress has been missing for so many days,

284
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,490
isn't there any news at all?

285
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,420
Has the crown prince come here recently?

286
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,890
Did he tell you something?

287
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,970
Or did you hear him tell other people something?

288
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,750
That's right, she can't speak.

289
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,960
Jian'er, go get some paper and a brush.

290
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,330
Yes.

291
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,140
Be careful.

292
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,770
Don't rush. Eat slowly and think slowly.

293
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,100
Don't you like this dress?

294
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,550
Then, I will bring something else for you next time.

295
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,240
A'Du, I know that you can't write Central Plains words.

296
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,970
It's okay. You can draw instead.

297
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,700
What does that mean?

298
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,640
Are you drawing... a target?

299
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,950
A'Du is my sister. I can't leave her behind there.

300
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,020
If you don't go with me, then I will go by myself to get her.

301
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,710
I didn't say I wouldn't go with you. But it is too dangerous to go now.

302
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,930
We may not be able to leave if we return now.

303
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,640
Yesterday, you said you would stay beside me forever.

304
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,720
My mom was right.

305
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,670
Men are full of promises, but break them at the critical moment.

306
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,600
That is the Eastern Palace. It is not as simple as stealing wine from the storehouse.

307
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,970
Didn't you use to go in and out at night all the time?

308
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,590
The Eastern Palace has much tighter security now than before.

309
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,960
Going back now is deliberately walking right into a trap.

310
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,700
I don't care. I definitely cannot leave A'Du by herself in the Eastern Palace.

311
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,120
Xi State is my home. It is also A'Du's home. I must bring her home together.

312
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,020
The Eastern Palace cannot keep A'Du caged. If she wants to leave,

313
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,170
no one can imprison her. But you are different.

314
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:19,490
The Eastern Palace can imprison you until death because you are their crown princess consort.

315
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,360
I refuse to personally bring you back to that prison.

316
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,470
I also refuse to leave A'Du behind.

317
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,000
If you don't bring her along, I won't go back to Xi State.

318
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,300
A'Du, are you thinking of crown princess consort again?

319
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,790
Crown Prince also hasn't eaten much at lunch today.

320
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,440
He must be worrying, too.

321
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,170
I really don't know what kind of assassin that was that even the Yulin Palace Guards are at their wit's end.

322
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
A'Du, let me do this.

323
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,070
If crown princess consort were here,

324
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,550
I could serve her to put this garment on.

325
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,700
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

326
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,040
The two of you may go down now. I want to stay here by myself for a bit.

327
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,590
Yes.

328
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,060
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

329
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:49,200
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

330
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,780
Move over.

331
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,220
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

332
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,570
♫ A long dream ♫

333
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,450
Such a good temperament when she is asleep.

334
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,600
What are you doing? This is my bed. This is my blanket.

335
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,850
- Give it back.
- What are you grabbing?

336
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:18,480
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

337
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,480
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

338
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,080
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

339
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,720
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

340
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,300
- I will give it back if you can grab it.
- Give it back!

341
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,950
What are you doing?

342
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,460
What are you doing, Li Chengyin?! If you dare to bully me,

343
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,780
I will tell A'Du to come and chop you to death!

344

It's windy. You might get a headache.

JIng'er, listen. Isn't that the crown prince playing the flute?

378
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,830
It sounds like it.

379
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,020
Why does it sound so sad?

Let's go.

382
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,600
Why did you lie to the princess?

383
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,970
I know. You must think I am despicable.

384
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,930
I think I am despicable, too,

385
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,820
for silently acknowledging it whenever I hear Xiaofeng call me Gu Xiaowu.

386
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,400
There was even a moment when I actually thought I was Gu Xiaowu.

I know that her gaze for me is fake,

388
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,600
but I treat it as real.

389
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,300
You lied to the princess, but you are actually lying to yourself.

390
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,850
Six months.

391
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,420
What six months?

392
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,120
I only have six months left.

393
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,440

394
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,740

395

Was it because of me?

396
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,220
Was it because you saved me at that time?

397
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,840
No. Don't worry. It has nothing to do with you.

398
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,440
My spirit should have returned to the Gu family a long time ago. To have lived up to now,

399

400
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:44,520
love me wholeheartedly once, even for a moment, I can now die without regrets.

401
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,160
You say I'm lying to myself.

402
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,620
Yes.

403
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,180
Just let me lie to myself for once.

Only in my dreams can I forget that I'm now just an exiled guest,

405

(T/N: From the poem "Waves Washing Sand" by Li Yu)

406
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:24,560
Your Imperial Majesty, this is a bloodletter written by the innocent scholars who died after being framed years ago,

407
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,020
and a petition signed by 10,000 people!

408
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,960
I think, a nation's talents

409
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,760
are like pillars that hold up a building.

410
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,730
But now, just for some selfish reason,

411
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,700
someone changed these high-quality pillars into substandard ones.

412
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,900
This will disintegrate our foundation!

413
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,880
If we don't give justice to this matter, what's lost today

414
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,210
are the lives of seven scholars who took an imperial civil exam, but tomorrow what we'll lose

415
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,960
is the heart of Li Empire's people!

416
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,540
I plead for Your Imperial Majesty to thoroughly investigate this case

417
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,160
and give justice to the people!

418
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,930
Prime Minister Gao, how do you explain this matter?

419
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,500
Your Imperial Majesty, my conscience is clear.

420
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,800
If you doubt me, I am willing to undergo a full investigation.

421
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,350
However, I have to say something.

422
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,730
After every year's imperial civil exam, there are always failed applicants who commit suicide.

423
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,100
So many lives have gone.

424
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,560
If we follow what Minister Xi said, if we don't want to disappoint the people,

425
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,160
does that mean we need to allow every applicant to pass the exam?

426
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,560
If all the lost lives are considered my fault,

427
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,290
then how many lives do I have to compensate? What's important to remember is...

428
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,820
this case was already closed by the previous crown prince.

429
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,500
The conclusion was that the failed applicants committed suicide because they couldn't accept the result.

430
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,090
Their fathers and brothers have also signed the findings. The case was fully documented.

431
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,210
Now Minister Xi is mentioning an old case,

432
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,330
I wonder if there is an ulterior motive.

433
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,400
Prime Minister Gao, the case was closed back then due to insufficient evidence.

434
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,730
But who can guarantee that those scholars' fathers and brothers

435
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,670
were not paid off to settle the case?

436
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,860
And now that we've found these scholars' bloodletter,

437
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,670
then this case cannot be considered closed.

438
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,890
Why can't we talk about it?

439
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:24,760
Fine then. Minister Xi, may I ask you.

440
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,540
How did you get this bloodletter?

441
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,590
How can you guarantee that this bloodletter is truly written by those scholars that committed suicide?

442
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,310
This...

443
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:39,790
Is my question that difficult to answer?

444
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,850
Actually, anyone could see that among the 10,000 signatures,

445
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,710
many were written by the same hand.

446
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,240
And now, Minister Xi can't explain the source of the bloodletter.

447
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,320
This is enough to prove that the alleged evidence

448
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,450
is a fabrication.

449
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:03,320
Prime Minister Gao, I am not related or connected to those scholars. To fabricate the evidence,

450
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,240
- what advantage would I gain?
- Then Minister Xi, pray tell

451
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,920
where the scroll with 10,000 signatures came from?

452
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,170
It... It dropped from Heaven.

453
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,530
Your Imperial Majesty, I was practicing calligraphy one night.

454
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,560
Suddenly, the candles extinguished and it was darkness all around.

455
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,920
By the time I lit up the candles again,

456
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,980
I discovered this bloodletter on my desk.

457
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,110
Your Imperial Majesty, everything I've said is true. I do not harbor any motive for personal gains.

458
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,820
- I ask Your Imperial Majesty—
- Your Imperial Majesty, please exercise wisdom.

459
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,620
Minister Xi, you are the minister of the Court of Judicial Review.

460
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,110
Usually, you worship the ancestors and various gods.

461
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,250
Have you lost your senses?

462
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,470
I'd like to give you some advice.

463
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:08,570
Ancient rituals and realistically governing the nation are two separate matters.

464
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,390
Your Imperial Majesty, Prime Minister Gao is a highly acclaimed contributor to the nation.

465
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:18,060
Please do not be fooled by someone with an ulterior motive

466
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,890
and harm the truly virtuous patriots.

467
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,220
Please consider wisely, Your Imperial Majesty!

468
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,070
Please consider wisely, Your Imperial Majesty!

469
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,710
Please consider wisely, Your Imperial Majesty!

470
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,880
Please consider wisely, Your Imperial Majesty!

471
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,720
Since everyone thinks Prime Minister Gao

472
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,590
is your stellar role model,

473
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,850
then we should definitely investigate thoroughly

474
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,320
and exonerate the prime minister.

475
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,720
Crown Prince.

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,870
What's the matter?

479
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:11,370
Imperial Father, the assassin still hasn't been found.

480
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,340
I feel regretful that I haven't lived up to your confidence in me.

481
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,610
Additionally, due to the disappearance of the crown princess consort,

482
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,780
I am still feeling unsettled.

483
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm afraid that I feel too stretched to take on this investigation.

484
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,760
I recommend Minister Zong Hwan to be in charge of this case.

485
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,490
Minister Zong oversees the Ministry of Justice. It makes sense and logical that he should investigate the case.

486
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,530
He is also more experienced than I am.

487
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,620
All right then, do as Crown Prince has suggested.

488
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,560
I will definitely do my best, Your Imperial Majesty.

489
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,210

Minister Wei, what do you think about what took place in court today?

Everyone knows that Zong Hwan was promoted by Prime Minister Gao back then.

494
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:22,600
When the crown prince recommended him for the case, it's obvious that it'll be a simple look-over.

00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,290
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

515
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,320
♫ Time reverses ♫

516
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,510
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

517
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:35,460
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

518
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:42,120
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

519
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,990
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

520
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,340
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

521
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,570
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

522
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,030
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

523
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,290
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

524
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,290
♫ A long dream ♫

525
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,100
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

526
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:25,990
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

527
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,130
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

528
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,820
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

529
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,750
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

530
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,370
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

531
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,290
♫ Time reverses ♫

532
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,410
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

533
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:55,470
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

534
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,760
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

535
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,460
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

536
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,340
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

537
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,090
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

538
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,930
♫ Time reverses ♫

539
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:15,090
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

540
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:22,200
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

541
