00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:41,190
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,350
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,020
How could there be something so coincidental in this world?

4
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,580
The best man in the world?

5
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,800
I think you are just a slick-talking rogue!

6
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,150
Did he agree to help you?

7
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,630
He wants me to understand the written words before he will help me.

8
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,630
Isn't this making it hard for me?

9
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,960
But talking about this, even if that Gu Xiaowu helps you,

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,920
His Majesty wouldn't agree to letting you marry a tea trader.

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,350
Who says I want to marry him?

12
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,110
Ungrateful person. Don't let me see him again!

13
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,180
Princess, don't worry. When I see him again,

14
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,180
I will help you to teach him a lesson.

15
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,450
By the way, Princess,

16
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,480
tomorrow is the deadline set by His Majesty for the envoys from the two states.

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,780
What do you plan to do?

18
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,270
That's right. Tomorrow is the...

19
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,190
It's tomorrow.

20
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,700
What should I do?

21
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,970
- My Queen.
- What should I do?

22
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,410
My Dear Princess, what's wrong?

23
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,900
- Who made you angry?
- Mom.

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,270
Let me tell you. If I can't convince your father,

25
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,730
don't forget, there's still your grandfather to help.

26
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,790
Grandfather?

27
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,200
That's right! My grandfather is Khan Tömür.

28
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,320
- When my father sees him, even he has to respect him.
- That's right.

29
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,900
I already made the arrangement.

30
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,390
Go to Danchi and hide for the time being.

31
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,460
With Khan Tömür protecting you,

32
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,890
your father wouldn't be able to do anything either.

33
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,030
Okay. Okay.

34
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,460
A'Du, set out for Danchi tonight.

35
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,800
Notify Heshi to receive Xiaofeng along the road.

36
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,590
Yes!

37
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,330
When the time comes, I will send some of my personal bodyguards

38
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,080
to personally escort you to Danchi.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,930
Mom, can you let my teacher go with me?

40
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,990
I don't trust him.

41
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,340
I know that you don't like people from the Central Plains.

42
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,220
But he's highly skilled in martial arts. He will definitely be able to protect me.

43
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,840
Why do you trust that Central Plain man so much?

44
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,610
Because he said he would protect me forever

45
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,330
and wouldn't let me be harmed.

46
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,170
Is that okay, Mom?

47
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,990
I beg you.

48
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,800
Okay, I give you my consent.

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,020
Thank you, Mom!

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,800
Your Majesty, the three days' deadline is here.

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,710
I wonder what your thoughts are regarding the alliance marriage with the ninth princess.

52
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,770
General Gao, based on your tone of speaking,

53
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,200
you are pressuring His Majesty.

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,620
Using money to lure people, that is not the act of a gentleman.

55
00:04:52,620 --> 00:05:02,190
Your Majesty, could it be that you really want to use the ninth princess' marriage alliance as a deal?

56
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,890
With just a measly ten years of tribute,

57
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,450
is the ninth princess that cheap?

58
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,850
- The ten years of tribute is—
- Your Majesty!

59
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,050
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, Her Highness Mingyuan...

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,180
Her Highness Mingyuan is not doing well!

61
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,650
Go and take a look now!

62
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,290
Your Majesty,

63
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,370
once I'm gone,

64
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,700
please bury me at Sky Span Mountain.

65
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,240
Nonsense.

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,840
I won't let you die.

67
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,060
I will definitely have your illness cured.

68
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,200
Your Majesty and I have loved each other for only seven years,

69
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,490
but I already have no regrets.

70
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,650
All these years, the thing that kept me going,

71
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,620
other than Your Majesty's love,

72
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,650
is that I can personally see

73
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:13,080
that the border is peaceful with people living and working happily.

74
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,390
Don't worry.

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,570
Your wish will definitely come through.

76
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,330
Your Majesty,

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,030
I'm a bit tired. I want to sleep for a while.

78
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,270
Have a good rest then.

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,250
Perhaps, tomorrow,

80
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,620
you will be better.

81
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,860
Teacher!

82
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,820
What is he doing here?

83
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,150
Cousin wanted me to come.

84
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,700
Xiaowu is my distant cousin.

85
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,760
He has been trading tea on the Western Border.

86
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,720
Hence, he's more familiar with the topography.

87
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,170
In addition, this trip is quite dangerous.

88
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,590
The more people, the more help.

89
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,370
Look at how weak he is like the wind.

90
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,920
Wouldn't he be a hassle for us?

91
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,690
Cousin,

92
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,620
do you know what the favorite food of the blind bears in the northern face of the mountain

93
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,470
and the man-eating lizard in the desert is?

94
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,800
Their favorite food is little girls who have sharp tongues, delicate skin, and soft flesh.

95
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,510
Trying to scare me? Let me tell you that I grew up scared!

96
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,820
What man-eating lizards and blind bears?

97
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,790
Even if it's the white-eyed wolf king, I'm not afraid of it!
(white-eyed wolf is usually used to refer to someone)

98
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,900
Princess Mingyuan has passed away.

99
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,870
Starting from today, everyone in the palace must wear plain clothes

100
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,110
to mourn for the consort.

101
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,940
During this mourning period, weddings are not allowed.

102
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,730
With regards to the marriage alliance of the ninth princess,

103
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,720
the discussion will be pushed back to 49 days after.

104
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,150
It's Consort Mingyuan.

105
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,840
I left my country for over a decade.

106
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,970
I'll never see my homeland again while I'm alive.

107
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,650
I hope after I die, I can see its land on top of Sky Span Mountain

108
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,820
from a far

109
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,120
so I can alleviate my home sickness.

110
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,460
Princess.

111
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,800
I picked this place specifically for you.

112
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,400
Li Empire is right over there.

113
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,030
From now on,

114
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,750
you can see your homeland from a far.

115
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,100
You'll never be lonely again.

116
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,690
Where is Ninth Princess?

117
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,360
Why is she not here to pay respect for Consort Mingyuan.

118
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,860
Ninth Princess... has disappeared.

119
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,860
Ridiculous.

120
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,770
Mingyuan treated her like her own daughter.

121
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,220
She's acting ungratefully for not being here.

122
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,980
Like her own daughter? I'm Xiaofeng's real mother.

123
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,270
Besides,

124
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,990
Mingyuan died of illness. It has nothing to do with Xiaofeng.

125
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,550
Like mother like daughter.

126
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,530
It's because you didn't teach her properly

127
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,440
and let her be unruly,

128
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,120
that's why she doesn't show any respect.

129
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,230
That's right. I don't have the manner of a princess from the Central Plains.

130
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,500
Hold on.

131
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,170
Do you know where Xiaofeng went?

132
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,210
Your Majesty.

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,100
Xiaofeng must've sneaked out of the palace to have some fun.

134
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,240
She didn''t know about Mingyuan.

135
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,100
If she knew, she would've headed right back.

136
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,470
Your Majesty, it's more important that we finish the funeral process.

137
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,060
Teacher,

138
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,420
I miss Consort Mingyuan.

139
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,110
She was really good to me.

140
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,410
She taught me to write.

141
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,850
Taught me to play music.

142
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,440
She taught me many, many things.

143
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,600
I really miss her.

144
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,580
Consort Mingyuan...

145
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,460
used her life in exchange for the two kingdoms' prosperity and peace.

146
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,100
It avoided any war.

147
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,970
She is a great woman.

148
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,920
She is a great woman.

149
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,290
But how many people could understand her difficulties.

150
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,920
She was married off to such a faraway place,

151
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,430
living alone in a foreign kingdom.

152
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,050
Every year, she eagerly awaited

153
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,760
for several ambassadors to bring back letters from her empire.

154
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,120
Teacher,

155
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,270
I don't want to be like Consort Mingyuan.

156
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,250
I just want to be with the person that I like.

157
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,500
Live a free and unrestrained life.

158
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,030
[Danchi]

159
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,770
[Xi State]

160
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,200
[Li Empire]

161
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,990
Princess Mingyuan's death

162
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,000
has the country in mourning.

163
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
Your Imperial Majesty must refrain from excessive grief

164
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,670
which may harm your body. Please don't grieve.

165
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,500
Please don't grieve excessively.

166
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,710
Your Imperial Majesty, Princess Mingyuan had always been an understanding person.

167
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,930
She had been married to Xi State for 15 years.

168
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,900
She left a legacy in both of our countries.

169
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,620
Her intelligence and virtue

170
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,290
promoted the prosperity between our two countries

171
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,510
and enabled the people to leave in peace.

172
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,150
If I could request Your Imperial Majesty

173
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,390
to posthumously honor Princess Mingyuan.

174
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,600
Record her life in the history book.

175
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,970
Allow our descendants to admire her accomplishments.

176
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,430
I heard the prince has made an offer to the king of Xi State.

177
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,560
Has the king given a reply?

178
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,510
Your Imperial Majesty.

179
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,530
I heard King of Suobo also made an offer of marriage to the king of Xi State.

180
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,930
Qu Wencheng used the funeral of Princess Mingyuan

181
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,760
to delay replying to the marriage offer to 49 days later.

182
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,490
Since we don't have a crown prince yet, I fear...

183
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,680
Fear what?

184
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,970
Our great Li Empire will be

185
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,950
scared of Suobo?

186
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,700
Minor Suobo has nothing to fear.

187
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,960
- I fear...
- We will have the marriage alliance.

188
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,990
Immediately notify Protectorate General Office

189
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,170
to have the princes

190
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,730
oversee the matter.

191
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,440
I understand.

192
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,290
Dismissed!

193
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:01,550
Father, the emperor seems a bit cold-blooded.

194
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,780
Princess Mingyuan passed away and he didn't even...

195
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,100
- grieve.
- Emperor's blood is supposed to be cold.

196
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,790
Not everyone can sit there.

197
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,000
Our emperor, now, is no longer Li Zhe of old.

198
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,700
Kun'er, remember what I tell you.

199
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,030
As a subordinate, we should never shine more brightly than our superior.

200
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,450
It's hard to be an emperor. It's harder to be a courtier.

201
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,790
No matter who we will work under,

202
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,810
the country belongs to the Li.

203
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,400
That fact will never change.

204
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,450
I understand.

205
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,810
Since you like my cousin, you should tell him outright.

206
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,080
Who says I like him?

207
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,730
Your eyes say so and you still say you don't like him?

208
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,250
Princess, you don't need to be embarrassed.

209
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,090
Men are like kites in the sky.

210
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,360
If you don't tightly hold onto the string,

211
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,750
the kite will be blown away by the wind.

212
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:13,170
But I don't know if he likes me.

213
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,030
Since you want to know, I can help you test him.

214
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,090
Ah, but I'm not helping you for free.

215
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,920
I heard that in the Danchi khan's tent, there's a lot of weird, interesting treasures.

216
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,840
I don't know if at that time the princess can let me go in and pick some treasures.

217
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,080
Such a profiteer.

218
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,570
Since the princess won't appreciate my help, then never mind.

219
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,180
Wait!

220
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,130
You can't go into the khan's tent.

221
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,030
But if you really want something,

222
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,440
I can help you get one or two items.

223
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,830
Okay, it's a deal.

224
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,900
Imperial Grandmother.

225
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,390
Don't be too sad over Mingyuan.

226
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,380
My granddaughter died over there.

227
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,080
My great-grandson also died over there.

228
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,370
Is that place cursed?

229
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:31,740
Great-grandmother, I'm also sad over Princess Mingyuan.

230
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,910
As for Chengji,

231
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,180
it was his fate.

232
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,250
Since the beginning, the disaster always

233
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,640
starts in the palace.

234
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,800
Now that Mingyuan is gone,

235
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,300
the situation will change on the Western Border.

236
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,950
Right now, we don't have a crown prince.

237
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,540
Your Imperial Majesty, you must appoint one right away.

238
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:17,430
Have him marry Ninth Princess into Eastern Place: thereby, secure the Western Border.

239
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:22,180
And thus prevent trouble within and without.

240
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,510
What you said, Imperial Grandmother, is right.

241
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,030
Your Imperial Majesty, do you have a candidate in mind?

242
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,290
I've been observing the children.

243
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:43,810
Chengyuan is witless. He is not emperor material.

244
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,720
Chengwen is not strong-minded.

245
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,550
If I were to make him crown prince, he will probably do whatever his mother tells him to do.

246
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,070
As for Chengyin, he is trusting and doesn't dwell on right and wrong.

247
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,710
Even though his abilities are no less than any other prince,

248
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,940
his biggest failing is being impulsive.

249
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,880
Chengye is the only one left.

250
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,580
I think he is a good choice. Calm. Open-minded.

251
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:26,940
And he has the will to do anything to accomplish his goal.

252
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,270
It seems you have your choice already.

253
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,020
Then, make your decision soon.

254
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,790
Yes.

255
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,440
Hello, Young Master.

256
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,850
Feed me.

257
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,960
What are you doing? You don't know how to feed yourself?

258
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,740
Don't you want me to help you test my cousin?

259
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,780
Otherwise, how else are we going to find out if he cares about you?

260
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,580
That's right.

261
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,890
What are you doing? Don't turn around. Look straight at me.

262
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,980
Hurry.

263
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,920
Sir, please eat some.

264
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,170
How is it? How is it? Is there any reaction from your cousin?

265
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,400
There doesn't seem to be any reaction.

266
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,280
How about you feed me another piece?

267
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,610
Fifth Prince, you should not forget about your main business. Don't spend all day playing around with a child.

268
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,720
So, in your eyes, Xiaofeng is just a child

269
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,240
and not a woman?

270
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,310
What Fifth Prince needs to be clear about

271
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,380
is your own business

272
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,460
and not worry about other people's private affairs.

273
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,140
If I want to find the khan's tent, I must gain her trust.

274
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,910
Because of Aunt Mingyuan's death, her spirits have been low.

275
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,790
I just want her to be a bit happier.

276
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,190
This way, she won't be so cautious towards me.

277
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,160
As long as you can differentiate between play and work, then that's good.

278
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,350
Gu Xiaowu, what did my teacher just tell you now?

279
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:19,590
He... asked if I was feeling tired lately.

280
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,090
- He asked you if you were tired?
- Yes.

281
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,700
Why didn't he ask if I was tired?

282
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,010
You still haven't dropped the idea of liking him?

283
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,760
Based on what I can see,

284
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,710
my cousin has no feelings for you.

285
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,250
You shouldn't be asking for disappointment.

286
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,190
After you came, my teacher hasn't cared about me.

287
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,130
Xiaofeng?

288
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:10,000
- Teacher.
- What's wrong?

289
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,140
Why? Did Xiaowu bully you?

290
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:20,390
How did he bully you?

291
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,010
He said that I'm not like the girls from the Central Plains.

292
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm capricious and love to fool around,

293
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,000
not gentle or pretty.

294
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,620
These past few days, I've seen that you guys get along pretty well.

295
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,980
Why would he say such severe words?

296
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,000
But I feel that what he said is true.

297
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,180
Otherwise, why else would nobody like me?

298
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,760
How could you think about yourself in this way?

299
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,590
Then, if there is someone who likes me, how come I can't feel it?

300
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,130
Silly girl, everyone loves you.

301
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,130
Then, what about you?

302
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,250
Of course, I like you.

303
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:34,100
Otherwise, why would I take you as my disciple?

304
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,780
No, no. I'm not talking about this.

305
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,230
Besides this type of like,

306
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,120
is there another type of like?

307
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,280
Aside from this sort of liking,

308
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,200
I...

309
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,540
don't have any other feelings.

310
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,310
I was just teasing you!

311
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,430
Just now, Gu Xiaowu said that you don't have any humor. I didn't believe him.

312
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,280
In the end, he said it right.

313
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,550
I won't tease you in the future. I'll leave now.

314
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,180
Bring him back with us.

315
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,100
- Let me go!
- Let's go!

316
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,380
The manpower of Protectorate General Office,

317
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,720
combined with the army I brought with me,

318
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,810
will it be enough to deal with Danchi?

319
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,660
Your Highness, if we can find the khan's tent,

320
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,750
our combined manpower

321
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,950
will definitely defeat Danchi.

322
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
Fifth Brother has been looking for the khan's tent for many days.

323
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,290
There is still no news. So we can't rely on him.

324
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,950
Once we quash our enemy,

325
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,320
the merit will go to you.

326
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,550
Thank you, Your Highness.

327
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,090
Your Highness!

328
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,490
Your Highness. General.

329
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,160
I've brought Batuer back to answer for his crimes.

330
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,140
This man is...?

331
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,260
Responding to Master. This man's name is Batuer.

332
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,720
On the fifteenth of the seventh month, he participated in the attack on our border.

333
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,250
The fifteenth of the seventh month?

334
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,330
I suddenly thought of something.

335
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,970
On the fifteenth of the seventh month, which was the day you and your people massacred our city,

336
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:11,900
the crown prince of our Li Empire was also assassinated while passing near Haizhou City.

337
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,150
I originally did not connect these two together,

338
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,360
but now thinking back to it,

339
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,130
this is just too coincidental.

340
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,720
Perhaps, Khan Tömür used this as a cover up

341
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,640
to assassinate our crown prince.

342
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,330
You're slandering the khan!

343
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,230
Danchi people are upright.

344
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,740
You're right. I ransacked the city.

345
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,190
And regarding your damn crown prince,

346
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,830
I've never seen him before!

347
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,170
On what grounds should I believe you?

348
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,980
Throw him into prison. I want to personally interrogate him.

349
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,990
- Yes!
- Take him away.

350
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:58,990
- Move!
- Let go of me!

351
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,290
Look. It's in that direction.

352
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,880
- What are you doing?
- Princess.

353
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,690
If you're brushing the horse here, how can other people get water?

354
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,850
I brush my horse and you get your water.

355
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,260
Can people still drink water that's been used to brush a horse?

356
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,750
If you want to brush your horse, go downstream.

357
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,810
Well, if you want to get water, go upstream then.

358
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,260
Are all Western Border women unreasonable like you?

359
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,880
If this was Central Plains, no one would marry you!

360
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,590
Who are you calling unreasonable?

361
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,950
I am going upstream.

362
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,480
Didn't you say that I was unreasonable?

363
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,720
I will show you what unreasonable is!

364
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,130
The horse is running off!

365
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,610
Gu Xiaowu!

366
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,250
Come at me!

367
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,360
You don't know my capability!

368
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,390
Who is fierce?

369
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,460
Gu Xiaowu!

370
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,670
- Come!
- I am going all out on you!

371
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,950
Who is afraid of whom?

372
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,080
Gu Xiaowu!

373
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,330
Do it again!

374
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,680
Let everyone get ready to go.

375
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,250
Yes.

376
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,610
Teacher's look earlier... was that an illusion?

377
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,770
Come.

378
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,400
Listen up. We must get out of the death valley before nightfall!

379
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,610
Sir, I will check up ahead.

380
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,180
Okay.

381
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,060
Everyone, our king

382
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,810
has lost a slave.

383
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,150
As long as you cooperate and give her to us,

384
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,220
I will not give you more trouble.

385
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,930
General, I am a tea merchant from the Central Plains.

386
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,170
My caravan is en route to the Western Border to trade teas.

387
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:38,460
We're just passing by and did not see your slave.

388
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,620
She's the one. The female standing next to you

389
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,570
is the slave we're looking for.

390
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,260
Bullshit!

391
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,660
Your Shuobo king is so shameless.

392
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,500
He even thought of such an ugly trick.

393
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,330
You want me to go back to Shuobo with you?

394
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,390
No way!

395
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,780
A slave is a slave. You prefer the harsh way?

396
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,230
Men, attack!

397
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,440
Don't kill the female! I want her alive!

398
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,160
Teacher!

399
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,390
Teacher!

400
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,190
Xiaowu, take the princess away! We'll meet at Gongyue City.
("gongyue" means moon bow)

401
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,050
- Teacher!
- Take good care of her!

402
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,840
Yes!

403
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,090
Teacher! Teacher!

404
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,190
- What about Teacher?
- Let's go!

405
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:22,720
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

406
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,950

♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

415
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,500
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

416
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:18,210
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you’ve extended ♫

417
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,450
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

418
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:26,200
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

419

420
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,810
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

421
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,680
♫ Time reverses ♫

422
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,920

423
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,980
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

424
