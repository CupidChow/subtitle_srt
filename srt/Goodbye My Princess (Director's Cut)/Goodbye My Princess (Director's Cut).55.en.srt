00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,030
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,550
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:37,310
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:45,320
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,790
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:57,510
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,130
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,130
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:18,040
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,590
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,790
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:39,190
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,690
♫  For only you are my heaven  ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,620
[Episode 55]

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,130
- Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng! I'm coming!
- Your Imperial Highness.

18
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,780
- Gu Xiaowu is coming to rescue you. I'm coming.
- Your Imperial Highness.

19
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,150
Your Imperial Highness, you have finally awakened.

20
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,880
You have been in a coma for seven days and seven nights.

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,950
Where is Xiaofeng? Where is Xiaofeng?

22
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,000
Your Imperial Highness, I have some urgent military news to report.

23
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,650
Say it!

24
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,530
Gao Xian has colluded with King Qu Tianze of Xi State

25
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,680
and has launched a rebellion.

26
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,280
What?

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,640
Your Majesty, with our current military force,

28
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,180
it is still risky to go on a head-to-head battle with Central Plains.

29
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,990
If we are able to join forces with the king of Danchi, then

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,130
our chances of success will be higher.

31
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,210
But to convince that old stubborn man,

32
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,620
it will be quite difficult.

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,710
No matter if he agrees to help or not,

34
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,560
since we have set up our military camp,

35
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,250
no matter how huge the chances of winning are,

36
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,110
my Xi State will never retreat midway.

37
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,870
Your Majesty, our aim is to win.

38
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,810
I will handle the mediation with Zhao Jingyu.

39
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,010
If they will not agree,

40
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,920
it is fine.

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,390
It will surely not be easy if he just wants to be caught in the middle

42
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,500
and still live peaceful days.

43
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,920
Fine. I will leave you people from the Central Plains

44
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,390
to play your winding games.

45
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:57,120
Your Majesty, in your hands,

46
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,160
there is also a chip that will ensure your victory.

47
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,820
What do you mean?

48
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,710
I heard that the ninth princess has been back for two days.

49
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,990
So?

50
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,760
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,580
the Li Empire's emperor is currently gravely sick.

52
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,900
He has no energy to manage his imperial court.

53
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,030
The crown prince, Li Chengyin, is now considered half an emperor.

54
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,500
You could also say that he is the emperor.

55
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,420
But just for the ninth princess,

56
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,130
he has pushed the daughter of Zhao Jingyu to insanity.

57
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,260
It shows that

58
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,250
Li Chengyin has deep feelings

59
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,120
for the ninth princess.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,660
We can use the ninth princess

61
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,850
to take Li Chengyin hostage.

62
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,920
What is the difference between doing that with how my royal father sent Xiaofeng for a marriage alliance before?

63
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,530
The men of my Xi State are not afraid of bleeding and sacrificing.

64
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,910
We will never let a woman stand in front to block swords and spears.

65
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,710
I agreed to join forces with you this time against the Li Empire

66
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:05,430
just to vent out this anger and prove to everyone

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,600
that my Xi State is not a cowardly man that only knows to curry favors and be manipulated by others!

68
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,200
If I drag my little sister into this again,

69
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,050
what is the point of doing all these?

70
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,510
I urge you to sever this thought.

71
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,350
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,390
you are indeed a man with guts.

73
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,740
In front of you, I look dumb-witted.

74
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,310
But, Your Majesty, I might just be worrying too much.

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,570
Do you know why the Li Empire kept using marriage alliances

76
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,780
to pacify the conflicts on its borders?

77
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,970
It means that the Li Empire's military power

78
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,520
is strong on the outside, by dry on the inside.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,200
Or else, they would have long sent soldiers to flatten the Xi State.

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,500
Why wait for today?

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,520
What "for the good of the citizens"?

82
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,910
What "for the good of the imperial court"? All are just words.

83
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,570
Your Majesty, the citizens will follow

84
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,670
whoever the victor is.

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,820
In managing an empire, one must not be short-sighted.

86
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,290
Your Majesty,

87
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,210
your future is promising.

88
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,100
Brothers!

89
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,360
The day to seek vengeance for our humiliation has come! Bring out all your courage!

90
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,680
Let the emperor of Central Plains taste how formidable we are!

91
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,360
Fight a bloody battle to rid us of our past shame!

92
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,050
Fight a bloody battle to rid us of our past shame!

93
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,450
Fight a bloody battle!

94
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,190
Brother!

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Must you go to war with Li Empire?

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,070
Yes, Sir!

97
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,930
- Yes.
- Brother, the Central Plains did not want to start any conflict with us.

98
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,520
Must you take the initiative to provoke them?

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,160
The arrow has left the bow.

100
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,690
Moreover, I did not take the initiative to provoke it.

101
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,170
I am just retrieving the lost dignity of Xi State.

102
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,400
This has always been my dream.

103
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,060
It is also the desire of all men of Xi State.

104
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,450
Furthermore, why did you run back here?

105
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,050
Was it not because of hate? Because of unfairness? Because they caused you to suffer?

106
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,290
- I will get justice for you, Little Sister.
- No, Older Brother.

107
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,640
I did not come back because of those.

108
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,250
I originally thought that my coming back was correct.

109
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,240
But now, I do not know what I—

110
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,350
If you are still a crown princess consort in Central Plains now,

111
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,020
I will not be as fearless and open as I am now.

112
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,940
I can slightly sense that

113
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,690
this must all be destined by Heaven.

114
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,040
I clearly know everything that you have said.

115
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,250
You instigated Xi State to go against Li Empire.

116
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,330
But the difference in military power is so obvious, like throwing eggs to a rock.

117
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,410
Why would I risk this danger with you?

118
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,390
Brother Jingyu,

119
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,540
here in the northwest border,

120
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,830
Xi State and Shuobo

121
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,340
are all my people.

122
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,140
Even if I'm unable to defeat the Central Plains,

123
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,240
I will only at most get an infamous reputation of being a rebel,

124
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,300
can you completely be unscathed?

125
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,610
If the two of us join forces, plus the forces of Xi State,

126
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,390
it will be totally different.

127
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,320
Here in the northwest,

128
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,370
our army is very familiar with the topography. We have enough reinforcements.

129
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,570
It will not be easy for Li Chengyin to win against us.

130
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,640
As long as we can persist until they call for a peace negotiation,

131
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,220
we will request to be an independent state.

132
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,960
By then, in this vast grassland,

133
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,030
will it not be so satisfying for us to be carefree kings?

134
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,840
Brother Jingyu,

135
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,950
your daughter suffered so much humiliation in the Eastern Palace.

136
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,890
She has been driven mad by Li Chengyin.

137
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,740
Could it be you still choose to loyally serve him?

138
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,980
Zhao Jingyu,

139
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,360
you have no more time.

140
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,670
Okay. Danchi will send out a 30,000 iron cavalry

141
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,220
- to reinforce you.
- Okay!

142
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,850
Brother Jingyu, we will wait for you to mobilize your forces and set up camp.

143
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,220
Please.

144
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,100
My Lord, are you really going to revolt with Gao Xian?

145
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,060
Once we choose this path, we will never be able to turn back.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,190
How could I get dragged down

147
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,190
by this desperate fool?

148
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,980
Then, Master, why did you promise him?

149
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,430
You...

150
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,300
Think about it.

151
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,510
If I don't keep him in line,

152
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,190
will a desperate fugitive like him let me go?

153
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,140
The Central Plains probably knows the current situation.

154
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,750
If I ally with Gao Xian, Central Plains will surely have a hard time suppressing the rebellion that Gao Xian started.

155
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:53,140
The imperial court will then offer more generous conditions and more army to draw me over.

156
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:57,600
If Danchi does not get involved, once the war starts, Central Plains will surely win.

157
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,410
Right now in the imperial court, Prime Minister Gao has already been toppled.

158
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,620
If I return to the Central Plains

159
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,470
bringing with me such glorious achievement,

160
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,600
I will then be peerless in the imperial court.

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,770
My Lord, you are so brilliant.

162
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,990
I received a report yesterday saying that the crown princess consort has fled back to Xi State.

163
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,450
Then, once Li Chengyin ascends to the throne,

164
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,690
my daughter will be the empress.

165
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,780
Even if she has gone mad or is sick,

166
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,370
she will still be the empress.

167
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,870
Grandma, where are you going?

168
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,200
I heard that we will go to war.

169
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,790
Once the emperor of Central Plains starts fighting, they will surely destroy entire clans. We are all leaving to hide out.

170
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,680
When our homes are gone, what is the point of hiding out?

171
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,530
I also do not know. We will just go with the crowd.

172
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,420
In reality, at my age, leaving serves no purpose.

173
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,310
Is it not only a matter of dying one day earlier or one day later?

174
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,340
I am only worried about my son.

175
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,430
Once he enters the battleground, will he be able to return alive?

176
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,210
Young lady, you should leave soon, too. Hurry.

177
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,140
Please move aside! Move aside!

178
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,510
Dad. Mom.

179
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,540
I have come back, but you are no longer here.

180
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,300
Pei Zhao said to me before

181
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,330
that if I come back, the matter between me and Li Chengyin

182
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,120
will become a matter between Xi State and Central Plains.

183
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,990
I knew that it would happen, yet I still came back without giving it more thought.

184
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,660
Tell me. Did I make a mistake?

185
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,220
Princess, the king had already decided to go to war before you came back.

186
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,970
All the men of Xi State are willing to sacrifice their lives to get Xi State's dignity back.

187
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:55,880
They are all brave warriors of Xi State.

188
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,400
They only chose what they believe is the correct course.

189
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,690
But is bloody violence the correct course?

190
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,520
I thought that I left behind the pain and suffering back in Shangjing.

191
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,430
But now, it seems that I not only brought it back to Xi State,

192
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,440
I also brought it upon the innocent people of Xi State.

193
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,780
I should've endured with it more.

194
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,130
I really do not want to see Xi State becoming like Danchi before, with blood streaming like a river.

195
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,190
No!

196
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,670
Princess, this is not your fault.

197
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,020
But unconsciously, I did give Elder Brother a shove. Right?

198
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,050
That is Heaven's punishment for me.

199
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,050
I knew from the start that in this world, there is no escape other than death.

200
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,770
But I still unrealistically hoped that I could return to Xi State

201
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,860
and start everything over again.

202
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,860
- I was only lying to myself.
- You didn't lie to yourself.

203
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,130
When you were standing on top of Jade Pass,

204
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,320
didn't you already make a decision in your heart?

205
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,780
What were you thinking then?

206
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,890
I only wanted to put Li Chengyin down, to let Gu Xiaowu go.

207
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,810
Then, you had already let go at the moment you jumped down the gate tower.

208
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:15,330
The current princess shouldn't be that princess who was in pain and conflicted

209
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,400
over her memories and on deciding to love or not.

210
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,880
You belong to Xi State. I also belong to Xi State.

211
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
What you said is right.

212
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,170
I cared too much about love and hate in the past.

213
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,600
I forgot what my duties were.

214
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:39,390
Elder Brother chose to fight. That is his way of living for Xi State.

215
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,930
And I...

216
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,410
must live for Xi State's peaceful existence.

217
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,260
Princess,

218
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,450
have you figured it out?

219
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,870
Yes, I have.

220
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,820
Me, too.

221
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,070
I am fortunate that I can be with you like this.

222
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:07,360
A'Du...

223
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,180
My best sister forever.

224
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,540
Even if we cannot stop this war,

225
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,480
even if we die for this...

226
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,970
No regrets.

227
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,760
- Cao Ji.
- Here.

228
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,000
Immediately send my decree to the Danchi Royal Residence at the Western Border.

229
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,060
I am conferring Zhao Jingyu as Protectorate Generalissimo.

230
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,650
He is to assist in pacifying the revolt.

231
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,630
Your servant will obey your command.

232
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,120
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince will be triumphant at one stroke!

233
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,810
You shall return victoriously!

234
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,760
Princess,

235
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,140
I am leaving now.

236
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,200
General, the war will start tomorrow.

237
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,340
You must rest well tonight.

238
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,420
You haven't slept for three days and three nights.

239
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,970
Please have your rest.

240
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,130
A'Du.

241
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,840
A'Du?

242
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,670
A'Du!

243
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,440
Brother, have you seen A'Du?

244
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,660
- Did she come here?
- I didn't see her.

245
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,740
A'Du has gone missing.

246
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,390
Your Majesty!

247
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,770
- Speak quickly.
Your Majesty, Official Gao was assassinated.

248
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,150
What? Where's the assassin?

249
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,210
The assassin is dead at Official Gao's camp.

250
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,410
Who is so daring?

251
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,390
Warriors of Xi State!

252
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,490
Today...

253
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,080
- is the day that we wipe away our past humiliations!
- Yes!

254
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,970
Kill!

255
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,010
Stop!

256
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,540
- Younger sister!
- Xiaofeng!

257
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,700
Gao Xian is already dead!

258
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,160
This biggest traitor of Central Plains

259
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,110
has already received the end that he deserved!

260
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,530
Fighters of Central Plains,

261
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,230
I know that you were brought here by Gao Xian to join this war.

262
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,790
Your original intent surely is not to fight against Central Plains to the end,

263
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,800
because you are also from the Central Plains.

264
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,840
But because of Gao Xian's own selfish intent,

265
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,910
he dragged all of you to be sacrificed,

266
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,730
to fight against your comrades. Are you all really willing to resign to such a fate?!

267
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:08,370
- What are you doing, Younger Sister?!
- Do not come over!

268
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,700
- Xiaofeng, don't act recklessly!
- Do not move!

269
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,800
If you dare to move,

270
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,520
I will go join A'Du right now.

271
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,860
Elder Brother, please stop the battle!

272
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,390
Do you still not understand?

273
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,850
All of this was a set up by Gao Xian.

274
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,310
It is all his evil scheme.

275
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,460
Because of his greed,

276
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,000
tens of thousands of lives from Xi State must be lost. Is that worth it?

277
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,180
Think of Danchi...

278
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,590
When Danchi was annihilated, people were plunged into the abyss of misery.

279
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,740
Only a few bloodlines are now left behind.

280
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,940
Do you want Xi State to follow that same path?!

281
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,760
Why?

282
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,830
Why can't prosperity and happiness be passed down instead?

283
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,910
Why can't allegiance be used to exchange for peace?

284
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,420
Elder Brother, you think that everything that royal father

285
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,970
did for Xi State

286
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,790
were all acts that diminished our state's dignity?

287
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,680
That is not the case!

288
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,650
Being born as a king,

289
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,510
you should not live for the sake of venting out a moment of anger.

290
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:55,900
It's to endure for the sake of your people's future.

291
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,780
All the pain of compromising...

292
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,020
One must endure all the pain of compromising in exchange for our people's happiness!

293
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,950
That is the dignity

294
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,780
that a true king of Xi State should have!

295
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,900
Gu Xiaowu!

296
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,900
Do you now remember

297
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,160
that I called you this way?

298
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,340
The only person who I once deeply loved

299
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,890
was not someone else.

300
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,300
It was you, Li Chengyin.

301
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,540
You lied to me,

302
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,750
betrayed me, killed my beloved family.

303
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,270
I still cannot convince myself to kill you!

304
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,140
I once told myself numerous times

305
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,910
that I should hate you. I should hate you!

306
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,010
But I still cannot do that even now!

307
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,170
Now, all of that is in the past.

308
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,160
I only want to live and die for the people of Xi State.

309
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,210
If you still understand me,

310
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,400
still want to compensate me,

311
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,740
please stop the battle!

312
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:13,110
As Ninth Princess of Xi State, I married into the Li Empire.

313
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,940
I did it for the continued peace between Xi State and Li Empire.

314
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,060
Today, if you still must cross swords on the battleground,

315
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,910
then I've failed in my duty to Father.

316
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,190
I've failed Consort Mingyuan.

317
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,300
I also failed the grand empress dowager.

318
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,820
Most importantly, I failed tens of thousands of people of Xi State!

319
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,820
If today...

320
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,750
you really must start this battle,

321
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,190
regardless of which side I stand with,

322
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,110
it is betrayal.

323
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,970
Therefore, if my life

324
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,380
can wake Elder Brother and Crown Prince up to the truth,

325
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,230
can bring back true peace and happiness to Xi State,

326
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,890
then I will not have any more regrets.

327
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,990
- Xiaofeng!
- Younger Sister!

328
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,500
- Don't be reckless!
- No!

329
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,190
Gu Xiaowu.

330
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,540
It's not that I can't release you.

331
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,370
But since you saved my life, you should repay me.

332
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,290
If you promise me three things, I will let you go.

333
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,640
You once promised to do three things for me.

334
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,410
- Do you still remember?
- I remember!

335
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,740
The first thing, I want you to catch one hundred fireflies for me!

336
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,280
How difficult is that? Wait for me.

337
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,780
You still owe me two things. I want you to definitely do them.

338
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,150
Okay! Tell me!

339
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,090
The first thing...

340
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,790
is that for the rest of your life,

341
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:01,930
the armored cavalry of Central Plains will never enter Xi State again, not even half a step!

342
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,670
Okay! I promise you! Put the sword down!

343
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,120
If you die,

344
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,070
I will not live by myself!

345
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,990
Release your hand! Let go! You will be dragged in by me!

346
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:27,450
I will not!  We came here together so we will leave together!

347
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,820
Xiaofeng!

348
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,110
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

349
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,510
I will forget with you.

350
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:43,990
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

351
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,700
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces ♫

352
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,110
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

353
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,450
The last thing!

354
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,290
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

355
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,190
Promise me...

356
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,330
that you will live well.

357
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,720
No!

358
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,420
Little Sister!

359
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,650
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

360
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:38,020
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

361
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:44,650
♫ Setting sail to a far land, but couldn't get over being
perplexed ♫

362
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:50,200
♫ In coping while in exile, you can't fight against desolation ♫

363
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,140
What type of attitude is that?

364
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,680
I am your savior!

365
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,350
- Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!
- Little Sister!

366
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:06,520
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

367
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,970
- Little Sister...
- Xiaofeng.

368
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:21,750
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

369
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,430
Can you be reasonable?

370
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,370
You cannot even swim! You will drown!

371
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,600
Even if I drown, I do not want to be kissed by you!

372
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,740
I don't want to kiss a woman whose heart belongs to another!

373
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,770
I beg you, do not leave me.

374
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,560
I beg of you!

375
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,710
My grandfather indeed dislikes the people of the Central Plains,

376
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,430
but he will soon like you like how I do.

377
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,870
- You have not even married. Why are you covering up for him already?
- Drink no more!

378
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,910
Even trying to control her man.

379
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,260
Xiaofeng, will you go anywhere

380
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,610
as long as it is with me?

381
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,650
I will go with you. In the future, I will go wherever you go.

382
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,440
Gu Xiaowu...

383
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,230
She is my wife.

384
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:27,140
No one can take her away!

385
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,000
I cannot marry Li Chengyin.

386
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,110
I hate him. I hate him!

387
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,730
But she cannot hate.  She must let go.

388
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,180
Only by letting go can she get something

389
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,300
more important in return.

390
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,210
After everything has ended,

391
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,550
he will surely compensate her well.

392
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,870
It's just that I don't know if that friend will wait for him when that time comes.

393
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,120
Turns out...

394
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,240
that fox...

395
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:27,080
was not able to wait...

396
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,330
for her girl.

397
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,620
Xiaofeng... Xiaofeng!

398
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,860
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

399
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,310
Xiaofeng!

400
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,250
Li Chengyin, I forgive you.

401
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,910
I forgive all our happiness,

402
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,570
debts, wild hopes,

403
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,650
and despair.

404
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,670
- Your Imperial Highness!
- Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

405
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,640
- Your Imperial Highness!
- Xiaofeng!

406
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,170
- Xiaofeng!
- Your Imperial Highness.

407
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,890
- No!
- Your Imperial Highness!

408
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:38,110
No! Xiaofeng! Come back!

409
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:42,340
Xiaofeng, you come back!

410
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,610
Greetings to Retired Emperor.

411
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,050
How come you sought me here?

412
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,320
After the abdication ceremony, you disappeared.

413
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,980
Everyone was very anxious.

414
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,500
So I thought that you probably came here,

415
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,730
I then came over to check.

416
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,630
The new emperor has ascended the throne.

417
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,950
I already gave this prosperous and peaceful country

418
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,270
to the eldest son of Third Royal Brother.

419
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,500
This is the first time

420
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,900
that there was a peaceful transfer of the throne here in Li Empire.

421
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,840
After all these years, you've been melancholic.

422
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,570
Putting all your energy on court matters.

423
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,670
I am worried that once you retire now—

424
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,100
Do not worry. I have more important things to do.

425
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,090
I want to go to Xi State to find her.

426
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,220
Find her?

427
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,400
Retired Emperor, Xiaofeng had already left for so many years.

428
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,760
You should let go now.

429
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,570
Pei Zhao, you are too gullible.

430
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,730
You actually believed what Xiaofeng wanted you to believe.

431
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,860
Carefully think. She is being angry at me.

432
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,130
Punishing me.

433
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,570
She must be hiding somewhere

434
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:58,410
and living well.

435
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,040
Not wanting to be discovered by me.

436
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,410
She just wants to see me anxious and suffering.

437
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,810
Your crown princess consort has long been dead.

438
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,650
Her tombstone in Xi State is overflowing with green grass.

439
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,810
She cannot come back.

440
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,210
No! She isn't dead.

441
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,540
How could she be dead?

442
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,460
Pei Zhao, you are too silly!

443
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:32,200
She is the most brilliant woman in this world.

444
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,370
She must be living well.

445
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:38,410
She has tricked us all.

446
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,100
Too stupid.

447
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,370
This memory...

448
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,910
is too heavy.

449
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,100
Your subject pleads for you

450
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,380
to forget all this.

451
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,130
Forget?

452
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,370
The water of the River of Oblivion

453
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,460
aids in forgetting love.

454
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,660
But where is

455
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,080
the River of Oblivion?
