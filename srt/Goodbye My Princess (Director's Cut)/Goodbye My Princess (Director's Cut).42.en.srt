00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:25,160
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,690
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:45,420
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,950
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,570
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,210
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:11,260
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,990
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,680
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,870
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:39,160
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,610
[Episode 42]

17
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,930
The crown prince has always liked things to be clean. I'll order people to take these clothes back with me first.

18
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,450
They will be cleaned and ironed.

19
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,500
After the crown prince comes out, tell him to come to my palace to get them.

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,620
The distinguished crown princess consort of the Li Empire actually went to Singing Jade Brothel?!

21
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,720
All right. All right.

22
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,600
Don't you know that there are people listening through the walls? Why are you shouting?

23
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,780
I just went to broaden my horizons.

24
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,270
I didn't do anything bad.

25
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,590
Next time, when you go to Singing Jade Brothel again,

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,860
bring me with you.

27
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,660
The distinguished crown prince of the Li Empire actually goes to the Singing Jade Brothel?!

28
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,250
I just want to broaden my horizons. I'm not trying to do anything bad.

29
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,230
Don't even talk about Singing Jade Brothel,

30
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,020
but we don't even know when we'll be able to leave here.

31
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,190
That surely is another congee with medicine.

32
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,640
If this continues, we'll starve to death.

33
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,870
We need to think of a way to leave.

34
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,850
I have an idea. You pretend to be sick.

35
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,090
Why is it me?

36
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,830
Because you aren't fully recovered from last time. It's more suitable for you to act sick.

37
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,370
No. I don't know how to act.

38
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,970
Someone come! Crown Prince fainted!

39
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,740
- Someone come!
- Are you crazy?

40
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,980
Hurry! Someone come! Crown Prince...

41
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,020
Crown Prince fainted!

42
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,100
Your Highness! Your Highness!

43
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,880
- What's wrong with you, Your Highness?!
- Shi'en, hurry up and get the imperial doctor! Why are you just standing there?

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,460
Yes! Yes!

45
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,380
Hurry! Hurry!

46
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,520
How is he?

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,990
Reporting to Empress Dowager.

48
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,320
His Highness Crown Prince's pulse is a bit superficial, and he is lacking in middle qi.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,640
He was just dizzy for a little bit. There aren't any big problems.

50
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,940
Oh, so that's how it is.

51
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,940
Then, please prescribe some medication, Imperial Doctor Wang.

52
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,970
You should know as well. Tomorrow, we are offering a sacrifice to Heaven.

53
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,720
Let him stay in the palace to properly recuperate.

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,710
Yes, I will take my leave.

55
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,300
All right.

56
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,280
Imperial Great-Grandmother, does that mean I don't have to be locked up here anymore?

57
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,180
You can leave now, too.

58
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,750
I need to return to Longevity and Benevolence Palace.

59
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,480
Listen carefully. Escort Crown Princess Consort back to her palace carefully.

60
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,700
Nurse her health well.

61
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,940
Yes, Grand Empress Dowager.

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,140
Thank you, Great-Grandmother.

63
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,710
Prepare to return to the palace!

64
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,550
Your Imperial Highness!

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Yongniang, let's go.

66
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,970
Shi'en, bring my clothes over, too.

67
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,880
Your Highness, you're all right. Yes!

68
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,280
It's not those. It's the ones I wore before I came in.

69
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,610
Yongniang said that the empress took them last night for cleaning and ironing.

70
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,100
She also said to have you go get them when you get out.

71
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,550
- Empress?
- Yes.

72
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Then, where's my jade pendant?

73
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,890
Jade pendant?

74
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
Imperial Mother.

75
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,930
You're here to get your clothes, right?

76
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,500
Yes.

77
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,120
I already had the servants finish washing and ironing them.

78
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,930
Thank you, Imperial Mother.

79
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,130
I often see you wear half of this jade pendant,

80
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,750
but I'd never seen this other half before, though.

81
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,180
Where did it come from?

82
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,560
When I came back from the Xi State, Aunt Mingyue gifted it to me.

83
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,430
Did she ever tell you where this jade pendant came from?

84
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,970
She didn't say anything about that.

85
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,020
She just said that if I liked it, she could gift it to me so they could become a set.

86
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,750
And then, she told me to carry it all the time and think about her.

87
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,730
What's wrong?

88
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,000
Nothing. I just never saw you wear it before.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,160
After coming back from the Xi State, I've worn it every day and night.

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,020
You just never noticed.

91
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,430
Very good.

92
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,020
Since it's so important, you have to make sure to keep it safe.

93
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,220
Yes, Mother.

94
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
Then, I will leave.

95
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,200
Shi'en, go find General Pei immediately. Tell him I have something important to discuss. Hurry.

96
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,700
Yes.

97
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,360
Your Imperial Highness, you have closely looked at the empress' expression. Did she or did she not believe it?

98
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Of course, she would not believe it. I don't know why but she didn't expose me.

99
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,990
Because of that, I am more worried about what her next step will be.

100
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,520
Once the empress becomes suspicious, you won't be able to hide it anymore.

101
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,350
Why don't we take the first step and control the situation?

102
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,270
Your Imperial Highness, report this matter to the emperor tomorrow morning in court.

103
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,000
Sir, what you mean is I should tell my imperial father that Aunt Mingyue said

104
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,680
that my mother was killed by the empress?

105
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,580
Would my imperial father believe me?

106
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,930
That's better than not doing anything.

107
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,560
Empress is a very meticulous person. She will surely do something.

108
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,940
Oh right! Didn't we bring evidence back from the Xi State?

109
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,890
If you give the evidence to the emperor, he will definitely believe you.

110
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:20,120
Okay. Imperial Father will be meeting with the ministers of the Six Ministries tomorrow, so he won't have time to see me.

111
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,600
After the court meeting on the day after, I will see Imperial Father.

112
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,280
I wasted my energy raising him all these years! He knew about my painstaking efforts to raise him,

113
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,730
but he wants to repay me with revenge?

114
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:44,480
Empress, if you had known about this, you should have rid yourself of the roots earlier.

115
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,490
These past years, I've been with Chengyin day and night.

116
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,890
I saw him grow up day by day.

117
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,110
He was always a very obedient and good child.

118
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,970
Why is he... Why?

119
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,870
Rongshuang, do you think that Chengyin will be that heartless

120
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,750
and tell the emperor about what happened?

121
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,260
He was raised by me. He is my child.

122
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,200
He won't, right?

123
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,720
Empress, we can't care about that much anymore.

124
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,530
It's hard to tell what others are thinking. Right now,

125
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,170
we need to protect ourselves first.

126
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,760
Won't he consider at all...

127
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,660
consider my gracious act of rearing him?

128
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,350
If I knew this would happen, I would have never kept him.

129
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,740
How is it?

130
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,580
Congratulations, Your Imperial Majesty! Congratulations!

131
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,040
Lady of Handsome Fairness Gao is pregnant.

132
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,360
I will go back immediately to prescribe some medication.

133
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,150
- All right. Leave.
- Yes.

134
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,370
Empress.

135
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,510
Empress.

136
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,570
Congratulations to Your Imperial Majesty. Congratulations to Little Sister.

137
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,670
Empress, you came at the right time.

138
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,260
For this period of time, I will have to bother you in properly taking care of Lady of Handsome Fairness Gao.

139
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,470
Even if Your Imperial Majesty didn't say it, I would still properly take care of Little Sister.

140
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,200
Older Sister, why is your hand so cold?

141
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,910
That is right. I do not know why but recently,

142
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,220
my body has been afraid of the cold.

143
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,960
Empress! Empress!

144
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,950
Empress! Empress! Empress...

145
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,500
This will be my end. I have no other road to walk now.

146
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,560
What should I do? What should I do?

147
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,930
Empress, what do you mean by these words? Do not scare your servant!

148
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,880
Gao Ruyi is pregnant!

149
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,790
The Gao family will not care about me anymore.

150
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,200
Chengyin wants to report my crime, too!

151
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,990
He does not want me either.

152
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,270
If His Imperial Majesty learns that I killed his woman,

153
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,900
he will surely depose me!

154
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,470
- Empress!
- What should I do?

155
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,560
What should... What should I do?

156
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,090
Empress, at this time, the more you must keep a clear head.

157
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,660
Do not worry! I will forever stay by your side.

158
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,360
No, the emperor... he will depose me.

159
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,510
Wrong! He will surely grant me death!

160
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,260
It can't be! It can't be! What should I do? Hurry and find a way for me.

161
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,090
Empress, with your one word,

162
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,720
I am willing to go through any difficulties and dangers, and risk my life for you!

163
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,950
I cannot allow them to abandon me. I...

164
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,490
I will definitely find a way.

165
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,590
Empress! Keep a clear mind!

166
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,810
I just need your one word!

167
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,790
Your one word!

168
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,350
Empress!

169
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,120
Leave!

170
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,250
- All of you leave!
- Yes.

171
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:39,290
Today, I do not need anyone in Magnificent Main Hall! All of you, leave!

172
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,560
Yes, yes, yes! Quickly go.

173
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,630
Your Imperial Highness, what happened to you?

174
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,740
You leave as well.

175
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,800
Yes, I will leave. Do not hurt yourself. I will leave.

176
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,030
Leave!

177
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,530
Yes.

178
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,640
Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort!

179
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,260
Shi'en asks to see Crown Princess Consort!

180
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,580
Shi'en? Come in quickly.

181
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,210
Greetings to Crown Princess Consort.

182
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,970
What happened? Why are you in a panic?

183
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,330
Responding to Crown Princess Consort. Ever since His Imperial Highness returned from the empress' palace yesterday, he has been weighed down with anxiety.

184
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,930
Today, I don't know why, but he got himself absolutely drunk

185
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,770
and locked himself in his room. He will not allow anyone to serve him.

186
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,430
In all the years that I've served him,

187
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,420
this is the first time that I have seen him like this. Even I do not know what is wrong with him.

188
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,020
I am scared to impetuously tell the empress and the grand empress dowager about it,

189
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,160
so I am asking Crown Princess Consort to go there and persuade His Imperial Highness.

190
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,590
What use is there for me to go there? Will he listen to my persuasions?

191
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,040
Crown Princess Consort, recently, your relations with the crown prince have gotten better.

192
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,250
I beg you to go and take a look.

193
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,900
Crown Princess Consort, you should go take a look.

194
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,600
A'Du, you wait here for me. I'll go take a look.

195
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,570
Li Chengyin.

196
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,590
Li Chengyin?

197
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,170
Li Chengyin?

198
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,450
Go out!

199
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,150
It is me.

200
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,050
I said that I do not need anyone in my chamber today. Leave immediately!

201
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,110
Shi'en said that you are in a bad mood, so I came to check on you.

202
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,950
I am very worried about you. Can you tell me what exactly happened?

203
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,120
You leave first. For the next two days, do not come here.

204
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,630
I will explain it to you later. You must leave now.

205
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,420
Why?

206
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,740
A'Du! There is an assassin!

207
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,420
How are you, Chengyin?

208
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,900
Your Imperial Highness! Your Imperial Highness!

209
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,500
Shi'en, hurry and call the imperial physician!

210
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,890
Yes!

211
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,600
Left Battalion, protect Fasting Palace. Right Battalion, search the Eastern Palace and catch the assassin!

212
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,110
Yes!

213
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,200
[Eastern Palace]

214
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,340
Xiaofeng...

215
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,770
Chengyin...

216
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,470
Are you hurt?

217
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,560
Does it hurt a lot?

218
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:30,300
The imperial physician will come soon. Hold on a little while more. Just hold on.

219
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,290
I have never seen you cry before.

220
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,370
Are you afraid...

221
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,790
afraid of being a young widow?

222
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:45,280
Say no more. Say no more. Do not say anything.

223
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,670
Do not talk. Do not talk.

224
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:54,830
Do not speak. Do not say anything.

225
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,470
Are you really scared?

226
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,700
Who asked you to be so fierce to me in the past?

227
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,300
Let me tell you, Li Chengyin. You are not allowed to die before me, do you know?

228
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,550
Do you know that? You must push through this.

229
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,390
Li Chengyin?

230
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,930
Li Chengyin!

231
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,620
- Search!
- Yes!

232
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,190
Responding to Your Imperial Majesty. His Highness the Crown Prince's wound is very deep and he has lost a lot of blood.

233
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,000
This injury...

234
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,400
What?

235
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,900
He is in an extremely dangerous state, Your Imperial Majesty.

236
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,380
What are you afraid of? He was able to live through

237
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,340
Danchi's million bold warriors. I am telling you, he will definitely be able to live through this, too.

238
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,860
If you cannot heal him, I will have your head!

239
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,960
Your humble servant will follow your orders.

240
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,280
Your Imperial Majesty! Your Imperial Majesty!

241
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,320
A'Du?

242
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,500
What's going on?

243
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,560
I found A'Du passed out on a palace path, but I did not see the assassin's shadow.

244
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,510
I saw that A'Du was injured gravely, so I brought her back first.

245
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,690
Your Imperial Majesty, I beg you to please save A'Du!

246
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,570
She probably saw the assassin's appearance.

247
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,520
Imperial Physician, hurry and save her!

248
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,490
Yes, I will obey!

249
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,270
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty!

250
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,690
Hurry!

251
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,220
Imperial Physician Wang, how is it?

252
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,840
Responding to Crown Princess Consort. A'Du's internal injury

253
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,580
has shattered her inner organs. Even with the best miracle drug,

254
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,430
I am afraid it will be hard to cure.

255
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,700
A'Du...

256
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,350
A'Du...

257
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,860
I am sorry.

258
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,420
I am sorry. I should not have let you chase that assassin.

259
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,830
It is my fault.

260
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,300
I am sorry.

261
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,180
I am sorry.

262
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,960
[Eastern Palace]

263
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,190
Yulin Palace Guards, listen.

264
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,100
From this day on, without a pass to leave the palace, no one is allowed to leave the palace!

265
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,740
Yes!

266
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,400
You all should not cry.

267
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,180
If crying could wake him up,

268
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,390
His Imperial Majesty would have had one hundred people kneel here to cry.

269
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:52,030
Xiaofeng, I know that in your heart, you feel very terrible. You should just cry.

270
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,200
After you cry, your heart will be able to bear it better.

271
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,170
Xiaofeng.

272
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,000
Xiaofeng, people outside only know that

273
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,900
you and Fifth Brother would frequently fight,

274
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,270
but I know that you have him in your heart.

275
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,550
Stop acting tough. Take care of yourself,

276
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,140
so you will have the strength to take care of Fifth Brother.

277
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,140
- Please forgive us for any trouble caused.
- General Pei, take care.

278
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,610
Crown Princess Consort, you have to eat something.

279
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,270
His Imperial Highness has been unconscious for three days, and you've been beside him for three days.

280
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,120
If this keeps going on, how will your body handle it?

281
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,270
Shi'en, do you think he'll be able to regain consciousness?

282
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,020
Crown Princess Consort, if you want to cry, then cry.

283
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,070
Don't keep it in and hurt your health.

284
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:16,280
Girls from the Xi State don't cry all day.

285
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,910
Shi'en, did you know that night,

286
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,090
he shielded me and stood in front of me.

287
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,690
He got stabbed instead of me.

288
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,870
Li Chengyin!

289
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,600
- Your Imperial Highness!
- Li Chengyin, are you awake now?

290
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,170
- Your Imperial Highness.
- Mother.

291
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,660
What are you trying to say?

292
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,990
- Mother.
- Mother?

293
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,730
Crown Princess Consort!

294
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,830
Shi'en, hurry and ask for the empress to come. He's calling for her.

295
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,990
Yes! Yes! Open the door!

296
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,180
Li Chengyin, just hold on. The empress is coming.

297
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,220
Chengyin.

298
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,990
Chengyin.

299
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,700
Chengyin, my child.

300
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,620
Chengyin.

301
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,650
Mother.

302
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,350
Mother.

303
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,920
Chengyin! I am here. I am here.

304
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,750
I am here. I am here, Chengyin.

305
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,930
Chengyin, my child... I am here.

306
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,100
Imperial Mother.

307
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,780
Crown Princess Consort! It's bad!

308
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,480
A'Du... is on the verge of death.

309
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,120
Crown Princess Consort, hurry and take a look at her!

310
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,970
Imperial Doctor Wang, how is she?

311
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,920
Crown Princess Consort, I am afraid that Miss A'Du...

312
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,780
I am afraid that she will not make it past tonight.

313
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,750
Xiaofeng!

314
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,390
Teacher, you're here.

315
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,600
Such a big commotion happened in the palace and I was worried about you, so I've been waiting here all this time.

316
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,720
Hurry and go see A'Du. She has severe internal damage.

317
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,450
The imperial doctor said she might not be able to make it past tonight. You're the only one who can save her.

318
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,360
- Hurry. Take me to her.
- All right.

319
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,000
If you just cultivate in peace, do not deplete your essence and internal energy,

320
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,040
do not suffer another huge trauma, you may be able to live longer.

321
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,890
But if you use your nascent energy and hurt your heart's energy,

322
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,410
then your outcome will not be good.

323
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,890
You already died once.

324
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,900
Your second life is starting to disappear.

325
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,790
When you are done repenting and your heart's soul has been released from the guilt,

326
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,000
by that time, your body

327
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,590
will suffer from the pain of a thousand arrows piercing through your heart.

328
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,780
Responding to Crown Princess Consort, A'Du's vital energy channels have all cleared up.

329
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,900
That's great!

330
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,340
I will return to prescribe some more medication.

331
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,500
- As long as Miss A'Du can eat, she won't have any big issues.
- All right.

332
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,610
I will take my leave.

333
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,900
Teacher, the imperial doctor said that A'Du is safe now.

334
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,530
Thank you.

335
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,490
I still have a favor to ask you.

336
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:56,470
Since you can save A'Du, could you think of a way to save Li Chengyin, too?

337
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,420
He's been unconscious for a few days already. He still hasn't woken up yet.

338
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,020
The imperial doctors have no idea what to do.

339
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,740
You're being too greedy.

340
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,510
I saved A'Du because she's your best friend.

341
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,200
Why should I save Li Chengyin? He's always bullying you.

342
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,530
He is my husband.

343
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,220
Husband...

344
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,500
He got injured because of me. If he dies,

345
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,000
I will feel guilty for the rest of my life.

346
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,990
Teacher...

347
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,970
The crown prince is suffering from an external injury. My internal energy won't save him.

348
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,830
This is a medicine for external wounds. Go and try it on him.

349
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,230
If he can live or not, depends on his fortune.

350
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,580
You don't look too good. Let me escort you back.

351
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:13,630
I'm fine. I've already given Xiaofeng the wound medicine that godfather wanted me to give to His Imperial Highness.

352
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,440
But that medication is too strong. I don't know if the imperial doctor will dare use it.

353
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,380
We can only give it a try.

354
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:29,180
Oh right! A'Du is the witness of this assassination. You need to protect her.

355
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,470
When she wakes up, she'll be able to identify the empress.

356
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,060
I understand.

357
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,550
You should hurry and protect His Highness.

358
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,670
You really don't need me to escort you back?

359
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,860
When did you become such a nag?

360
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,940
Okay.

361
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,940
Gu Jian!

362
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,340
Gu Jian!

363
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,950
Come.

364
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,750
This is a miracle drug from Xi State. Please hurry and try it on His Imperial Highness.

365
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,690
Yes.

366
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,970
Then, your humble servant will leave.

367
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,230
Pei Zhao sent me back?

368
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,210
Why are you looking at me like that?

369
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,890
Brother Gu Jian, are you hiding something from me?

370
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,190
How can I be hiding something from you?

371
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,920
The doctor just came to see you and he said that your body—

372
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,630
Nothing a little rest cannot help.

373
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:17,270
Why did you not care about yourself and just went to save A'Du?

374
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,070
If anything bad happened to A'Du, Xiaofeng would feel terrible.

375
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,270
But the doctor said that you...

376
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,460
How can you not care about your own life and go save her?

377
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:37,000
Life and death are in the hands of fate. Do not feel terrible anymore.

378
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,230
My existence is to hasten the clearing of the grievances suffered by the Gu family

379
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,290
and to let Xiaofeng be happy.

380
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:51,920
Then what about yourself? What about your own happiness?

381
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,740
I have my adopted father and you, my little sister.

382
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,440
If I have you two by my side in my last living moment,

383
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,540
I am already very blessed.
