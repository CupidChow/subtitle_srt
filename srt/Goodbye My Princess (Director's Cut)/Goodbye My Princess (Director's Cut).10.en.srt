00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:41,100
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,370
[Episode 10]

3
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,430
- Watch out, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty, be careful!

4
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,820
Surround them!

5
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,750
You bold spy! Why did you come to Shuobo?

6
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,780
Slow down, Your Majesty.

7
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,940
- Be careful, Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

8
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,390
My King, it was he

9
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,730
who colluded with Danchi to defeat us!

10
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,540
He is definitely a spy! You can't believe him!

11
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,160
Silence!

12
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,730
This is Fifth Prince of the Central Plains.

13
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,120
How can an uncivilized person like you criticize him?

14
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,820
- You...
- Second Brother!

15
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,570
Royal Uncle, when I went to the Xi State to request for a marriage alliance,

16
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,910
the Central Plain prince that I saw there was indeed him.

17
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,110
Is he the prince from the mainland?

18
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,890
Yes.

19
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,450
Fifth Prince, there must be a misunderstanding.

20
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,710
Please forgive us. Hurry up and take your men away!

21
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,450
Leave!

22
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,700
May I ask why you have come to our Shuobo State?

23
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,070
I heard that the Shuobo people were interested in business.

24
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,470
I want to make a business deal with Your Majesty.

25
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,700
You want to do business with me?

26
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,710
Sure.

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,120
This Night Pearl is yours.

28
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,420
How much money will you give me?

29
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,930
I want to hear what exactly

30
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,520
is your explanation.

31
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,770
In recent years, Danchi has frequently attacked our northern border and oppressed its neighboring small kingdoms.

32
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,180
This has always been a problem that worried my imperial father.

33
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,620
My imperial father has always wanted to get rid of them.

34
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,410
So, I hope that Shuobo can cooperate with our empire to send out an army to attack Danchi with us.

35
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,270
You want us to attack Danchi with you?

36
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,760
Everyone knows that Danchi has a strong army.

37
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,010
Besides, our kingdom never had any intentions of going to war.

38
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,620
Your Majesty's hesitation is understandable.

39
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,820
But according to my imperial father,

40
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,310
the territory of Danchi can be split up and governed separately.

41
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,450
We can give the Glacier Road to your Shuobo State.

42
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,860
Shuobo is in the center of the desert and constantly needs water.

43
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,550
This glacier has a lot of water and can resolve your immediate concerns.

44
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,270
Besides, the fur of the snow foxes and polar bears on the Ice Plain are very valuable.

45
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,540
Even the Byzantine and Persian nobles scramble for it.

46
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,940
Your Majesty, I believe that what the fifth prince of the Li Empire said has a point.

47
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,690
I also heard that ever since Your Majesty married Khan Tömür's eldest daughter,

48
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,430
Danchi hasn't gone to war with Shuobo for ten years.

49
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,180
But last year after Her Majesty died from illness,

50
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,970
Khan Tömür thought that you were tired of her so you caused her death.

51
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,210
He then has constantly sent armies to capture Shuobo's borders

52
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,210
and steal from merchants using the trade route. This has made citizens suffer.

53
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,100
Are you really going to overlook these crimes?

54
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,110
My wife definitely died from an illness.

55
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,870
I wrote him letters to clarify it multiple times.

56
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,930
Not only did he not believe me, his attacks even got worse.

57
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,910
Even when I tried to request a marriage alliance with the ninth princess of Xi State,

58
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,820
he also kept on interfering.

59
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,680
Your Majesty, this is the perfect time for us to send troops.

60
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,400
Besides, we even have the Li Empire's army as allies.

61
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,380
We have to take advantage of this.

62
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,170
Your Royal Uncle, this opportunity is rare,

63
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,430
but I still have concerns.

64
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,550
Once the war starts, Danchi and we will become enemies.

65
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,880
Li Empire has many troops and expansive territory, so it doesn't fear wars.

66
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,710
Shuobo, however, will probably be the one attacked first.

67
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,530
What Prince Lidun said makes sense.

68
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,800
Danchi warriors are fierce fighters.

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,670
Even if we have more troops pressing on their borders,

70
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,650
there is no guarantee that we'll win.

71
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,440
That old Shuobo king is a coward.

72
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,160
His nephew Lidun also kept disagreeing with us.

73
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,330
If Shuobo won't cooperate,

74
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,810
I don't think we have enough forces to defeat Danchi.

75
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,050
We can only go to the Western Border Protectorate General Office to look for General Pei.

76
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,870
Sending troops across regions requires an imperial decree.

77
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,900
I don't think we have time for it.

78
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,560
Then...

79
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,950
Stop! Stop!

80
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,480
Since we didn't agree on a business deal, you don't have to keep us in Shuobo.

81
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,870
Who said there is no deal?

82
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,210
You didn't do business with my uncle.

83
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,240
But Fifth Prince, our business

84
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,580
hasn't even started.

85
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,520
Fifth Prince. Mister Chai. Let's talk more over there.

86
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,970
This is the best grape wine from my Kasa Castle.

87
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,120
My stingy uncle was unwilling to share it with guests.

88
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,770
I would like to apologize for him.

89
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,310
Please.

90
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,520
May I ask why you asked us to stopover here?

91
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,770
I'm willing to send a hundred thousand soldiers and horses

92
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,820
to help Li Empire conquer Danchi.

93
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,300
That can't be. His Majesty clearly rejected our proposal.

94
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,320
How will you be able to send the army?

95
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,200
And that's why

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,020
we need to change to another king.

97
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,630
If I'm able to dispatch the army

98
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,460
and help Li Empire annihilate Danchi,

99
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,060
I hope Fifth Prince can advocate on my behalf

100
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,960
in front of His Imperial Majesty.

101
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,560
All right! Prince Lidun, you are truly a frank and straightforward person.

102
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,180
Cheers!

103
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,510
What is it?

104
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:26,530
Princess, are you anxiously waiting for the hero who will kill the white-eyed wolf king?

105
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,490
Definitely not. No one in the grasslands can kill the white-eyed wolf king.

106
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,180
I know someone who can definitely kill it.

107
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,410
Who?

108
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,250
It's your good teacher, Gu Jian.

109
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,120
You should have seen your longing appearance earlier.

110
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,160
Are you anxiously waiting for him?

111
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,030
It's not him.

112
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,600
Then it's...

113
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,230
- It's that...
- Gu Xiaowu!

114
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,490
Princess, you're not even willing to marry a prince of the Li Empire.

115
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,500
Are you really willing to marry that tea trader from Li Empire?

116
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,940
The difference is too large.

117
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,770
I just like him.

118
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:23,050
But didn't you say that you weren't willing to marry off to a place as far away as the Li Empire?

119
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,720
[Protectorate General Office]

120
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,690
Your Highness, Fifth Prince has come back.

121
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,900
He said that he has already found the royal tent.

122
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,940
He currently commissioned someone to draw a map.

123
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,150
We rode the horse west for three kilometers.

124
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,250
For thirty minutes, we traveled on flatlands.

125
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,230
The sun...

126
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,850
...was at my left.

127
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,560
For an hour, around five kilometers,

128
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,100
we crossed a marsh midway.

129
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,420
There was a five-kilometer long reed marsh.

130
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,090
The reed marsh's height... just brushed past my eyes.

131
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:00,910
For an hour, five kilometers, I passed by an expanse of shrubbery.

132
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,170
The shrubs were as tall as a horse.

133
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,450
For an hour and a half, two and a half kilometers,

134
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,000
we passed by a hill lined with tea shrubs.

135
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,770
From the sound of the wind, I could hear the sound of sand.

136
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,240
And...

137
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,060
five kilometers,

138
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,580
for an hour,

139
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,200
I went through a gully.

140
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,520
The wind was very strong.

141
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:03,070
Then I arrived at Danchi.

142
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,380
It was surrounded by three mountains, and a river passed through it.

143
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,540
Second Brother.

144
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,340
Your Highness.

145
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,410
Yes, it's just like this.

146
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,850
Fifth Prince, you were blindfolded the entire way there. This map—

147
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,360
General Gao, don't worry.

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,790
I went through this route twice.

149
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,960
All the parts I remembered fuzzily have been verified.

150
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,090
There is absolutely nothing wrong.

151
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,020
Fifth Brother, it was hard for you to get to the Danchi military compound.

152
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,820
Why didn't you stay there for a few more days to figure out their military situation?

153
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,980
Second Brother, Khan Tömür's natural disposition is distrustful.

154
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,150
The longer I stayed, the more likely I wouldn't be able to get out.

155
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,440
So I thought that I should hurry and bring back this information first.

156
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,430
Your Highness, Fifth Prince is unfamiliar with the topography here in the Western Border.

157
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,260
In such a short time he was able to find Khan Tömür's royal tent.

158
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,750
It is really an outstanding accomplishment.

159
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,270
Fifth Brother is really smart and full of strategies.

160
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,190
I indeed worried too much.

161
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,980
That's right, Second Brother. I also have another thing.

162
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,970
After I entered the Danchi's main camp, I roughly analyzed the armaments around the royal camp.

163
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,860
The Danchi people are brave and good fighters. They have very tight security. If we attack forcefully,

164
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,910
I fear that our probability of winning isn't even more than a half.

165
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,280
So I decided on my own to pass by Shuobo on my way back.

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,010
I borrowed an army of 100,000 men from Shuobo's Prince Lidun to help us attack Danchi.

167
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,070
That is a good thing. A good thing!

168
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,090
But you should have discussed it first with me.

169
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,540
Shuobo people aren't trustworthy and can go back on their words.

170
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,530
If Danchi gets wind of something, it will ruin our plan.

171
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,440
Second Brother, you don't need to worry.

172
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,060
There won't be any leaks.

173
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,070
Prince Lidun and the Shuobo king have been in conflict for some time.

174
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,280
Prince Lidun wants to use this chance

175
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,820
to take over the throne by helping our endeavor.

176
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,520
Actually, before I went to Shuobo to borrow the troops, I wanted to report to you first.

177
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,950
But it only took two days of journey to go to Shuobo from Danchi,

178
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,360
while it would have taken more to go there from the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

179
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,320
On such an urgent matter, I decided to do it first before reporting.

180
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,190
I hope Second Brother won't be upset.

181
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,470
Why would I be upset?

182
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,900
We can win now since we have Shuobo's help.

183
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,390
Now that we've found the Danchi khan's tent,

184
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,670
Second Brother just needs to mobilize and setup the military formation, devise a unified strategy to seize the overall situation.

185
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,010
Good, since everything is prepared,

186
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,860
we will attack them after a month.

187
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,290
- General Gao.
- Present.

188
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,420
- Colonel Pei.
- Present.

189
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,220
We'll rely on you two to prepare all the necessary supplies

190
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,110
- for the Western Border Patrol General Army.
- Yes.

191
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,760
Remember to not leak any information.

192
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,090
Yes.

193
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,800
For the next few days, I plan to reorganize the troops

194
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,660
and layout the best formation to battle with Danchi.

195
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,410
Fifth Brother, you worked hard. Rest well for now.

196
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,060
I will send an envoy to Shuobo

197
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,210
to further discuss the military tactics.

198
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:17,520
Once the battle starts, I want you to take charge of the Protectorate General Office.

199
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,030
Thank you, Second Brother.

200
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,690
I think Second Brother doesn't want me to join the battle.

201
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,720
Don't worry, Fifth Prince. Sir Chai has already entrusted you to me.

202
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,160
You can follow my Light Cavalry Brigade to head to Danchi directly.

203
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,290
Just find an excuse afterward. As long as you achieve military merit,

204
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,280
His Imperial Majesty won't penalize you.

205
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,630
That is indeed the only way to go.

206
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,060
In one month's time, there will be a big battle. What will happen to Ninth Princess?

207
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,510
I will take Xiaofeng away from Danchi.

208
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,480
But Fifth Prince, the war is pressing.

209
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,450
You should stay here in the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

210
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,240
I will go in your stead.

211
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,730
But the person Xiaofeng is waiting for is me.

212
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,150
I am her teacher. She will definitely go with me.

213
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,500
Cousin, don't worry, I absolutely won't hurt her.

214
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,510
We are already hurting her.

215
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,910
Little Princess, it's no use waiting here all day.

216
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,030
If Gu Xiaowu comes, my brother will know about it.

217
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,860
I'm just hoping to

218
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,180
see him as soon as he gets back.

219
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,980
But it's been many days,

220
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,060
did he really go kill the wolf king?

221
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,010
Say, the Sky Span Mountain is so vast. There are many wild beasts and strange rocks.

222
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,180
How could a tea merchant like him

223
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,250
really kill the white-eyed wolf king?

224
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,360
Someone has killed the white-eyed wolf king!

225
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,470
What did they say?

226
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,640
It sounded like someone has killed the white-eyed wolf king?

227
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,480
Xiaowu!

228
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,220
- Let's go!
- Go!

229
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,010
It's so big! Look!

230
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,810
The khan has promised that anyone who kills the white-eyed wolf king

231
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,920
will marry Ninth Princess! I want to see Khan Tömür.

232
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,300
- This is the white-eyed wolf king?

233
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,810
- Indeed.
- I want to look!

234
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,330
Yes.

235
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,510
- You take a look, too.

236
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,520
- Indeed.
- That's amazing.

237
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes.

238
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,250
Xiaofeng, go back first.

239
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,950
So this is the wolf king?

240
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,990
Where did you find it? How did you kill it?

241
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,300
I chased him for ten days and ten nights in Sky Span Mountain.

242
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,840
It got tired and was resting among the bushes. I picked up my blade—

243
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
- Grandfather, this is fake white fur.
- Fake?

244
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
- How dare he!
- It's fake.

245
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,050
How dare he!

246
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,820
You dared to cheat the khan and the princess?

247
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,660
- Guards!
- Yes!

248
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,050
- Take him away! Tie him behind horseback and drag him for five kilometers!
- Yes!

249
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,750
Please forgive me, Great Khan!

250
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,740
Great Khan!

251
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,640
- How could the white-eyed wolf king be killed so easily?

252
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,870
- Indeed. No one in the grasslands can kill the white-eyed wolf king!

253
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,560
Right!

254
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,740
- Unbelievable!
- Liar! He deserves the punishment!

255
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,130
You said it right. It's just talk. Who has seen the wolf king?

256
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,990
I never expected

257
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,740
that this fifth brother of mine would become more skilled on this Western Border trip of his.

258
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,920
He outsmarted me.

259
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,290
Your Highness, what about...

260
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,250
Stupid!

261
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,700
The crown prince just died. A war is looming ahead.

262
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,160
If Fifth Prince dies suspiciously right after achieving a successful alliance,

263
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,950
you think His Imperial Majesty wouldn't be able to guess the cause?

264
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,240
I am stupid.

265
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:33,640
I won't touch him.

266
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,360
Given his current personality, he won't be content to stay at the Protectorate General Office when the battle with Danchi begins.

267
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,470
If he runs onto the battlefield, blades and swords don't have eyes.

268
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,710
Have you heard?

269
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,430
- Everyone is looking for the wolf king.
- Really?

270
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,830
They say no one can catch

271
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,400
the prairie's white-eyed wolf king.

272
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,780
Impossible.

273
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:43,090
Zhao, for the days that I'm away from the Protectorate General Office, tell others that

274
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,750
I just wanted to improve my skills so I went with you to the military camp by the border.

275
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,070
Rest assured, Fifth Prince, I'll have everything ready.

276
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,810
But when you go back to Danchi this time,

277
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:59,100
how can you take Ninth Princess away right under the watchful eyes of Khan Tömür?

278
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,950
This...

279
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,500
What's wrong with you?

280
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,460
We agreed that if I give you a white-eyed wolf king, you'll give me the rest of the money!

281
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,750
Why are you going back on your promise?

282
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,720
Your white-eyed wolf king is a ridiculous fake.

283
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,790
Just touch the fur and the color comes off.

284
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,500
How dare you still ask me for money? Consider yourself lucky that I am not asking you to pay me back the deposit!

285
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,370
You... Fine, we won't do business anymore!

286
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,720
Wait, Sir.

287
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:44,920
I want to ask you something. What's this thing about the white-eyed wolf king?

288
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,170
Don't mention it. The market is full of fake white-eyed wolf kings.

289
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,760
A cheap one is worth ten taels each.

290
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Yet I spent fifty taels and got a really poor quality one.

291
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,490
I'm so upset!

292
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,900
Fifth Prince, the matter of killing the white-eyed wolf king is now a hot topic in the Western Border.

293
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:14,630
I heard that eight to nine out of ten of the brave warrior per state have gone into the mountains to catch the wolf.

294
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,720
I have already announced that

295
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,050
our Xiaofeng will marry the bravest hero on this prairie land.

296
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,220
Whoever kills the white-eyed wolf king in the Sky Span Mountain

297
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,470
will get to marry my little princess.

298
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:36,660
Let me ask you. As long as someone kills the white-eyed wolf king,

299
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,150
regardless of who he is, you will marry him?

300
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,780
Of course! My grandfather's word cannot be unsaid. How can I let him go back on his words?

301
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,090
Zhao, find a reliable hunter

302
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,400
and get me a squad of Light Cavalry Soldiers.

303
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm going to kill that white-eyed wolf king.

304
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,040
Fifth Prince, this...

305
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,440
Yes.

306
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,000
Gu Xiaowu, oh Gu Xiaowu,

307
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,070
when will you come back?

308
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,780
Don't you know I've been waiting for you?

309
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,880
- Princess!
- A'Du! What's the matter?

310
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,220
Some guys were arguing earlier. Everyone went towards Khan Tömür's tent.

311
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,160
I was afraid for your safety, so I ran back here.

312
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,830
Has a war started?

313
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,710
I didn't hear any war drums. It probably isn't.

314
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,000
Little Princess! Little Princess!

315
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,810
- Little Princess!
- What's the matter?

316
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,560
Little Princess, the khan wants you at the practice field.

317
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,060
What's all that noise over there? What happened?

318
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,100
It seems someone has caught the white-eyed wolf king again.

319
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,760
Someone caught it again?

320
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,470
Why is the white-eyed wolf king so easy to catch?

321
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,110
Could it be another liar?

322
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,170
Let's go! I want to see what he used this time to dye the wolf's fur.

323
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,650
Let's go!

324
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,540
- Is this one real?
- It looks fake.
- It looks just like the last one.

325
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,620
- This one looks quite real.
- Could it be fake again?

326
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,320
- It seems to be real.
- It's real.

327
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,410
- It looks real.
- Have you seen the real one?

328
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,950
Gu Xiaowu.

329
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,550
Were you waiting for me?

330
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,550
Who's waiting for you?

331
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,960
Why would I wait for you?

332
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,250
Waiting for me to marry you.

333
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,000
Gu Xiaowu, did you really kill this wolf?

334
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,490
- Yes.
- Isn't he from the Central Plains?

335
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,120
How can the princess marry him?

336
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,980
Right! How can she marry a person from the Central Plains?

337
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,420
Right.

338
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,170
- You really killed it?
- It doesn't matter if he's from Danchi or not.

339
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,350
He is still a warrior.

340
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,360
The white-eyed wolf king doesn't mean his fur is white.

341
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,780
Instead, he has a white-colored eye.

342
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,980
This is the real white-eyed wolf king.

343
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,360
- This is the real one?
- This is real?

344
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,570
- My Khan.
- He really caught it.

345
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,080
I heard my brother killed the white-eyed wolf king.

346
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,750
Brother, Gu Xiaowu is so powerful!

347
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,770
My Khan, is this the real wolf king?

348
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,290
You're really something.

349
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,630
What's wrong, Brother?

350
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,550
Nothing.

351
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,390
You're injured.

352
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,900
- It's fine.
- Someone call the official doctor!

353
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,380
Yes!

354
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,300
Grandfather, we're going to bandage the wound first.

355
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,990
Let's go!

356
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,230
Grandfather, are you really going to marry Xiaofeng off to a guy from the Central Plains?

357
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,260
I don't go back on my words.

358
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,380
But we don't know this person's background.

359
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:57,830
We don't ask where heroes come from.

360
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,560
If he's willing to stay in Danchi for the little princess, then it's fine.

361
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,320
A tea merchant

362
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,700
is capable of killing the white-eyed wolf king? It's hard for me to believe.

363
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,290
Why don't we investigate more?

364
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,130
You are injured severely. It was clearly a fight to the death.

365
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,450
Xiaowu!

366
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,460
Xiaowu!

367
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,750
Xiaowu!

368
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,300
Don't worry! Girls shouldn't see this.

369
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,070
Go. Get me some wine.

370
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,210
I won't go anywhere. I'm staying here with you.

371
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,180
I'm staying with you.

372
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,990
Okay.

373
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,010
Xiaowu.

374
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,420
Xiaowu!

375
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,210
Brother Gu, I would like to make a toast to you.

376
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,650
Cousin, he can't drink wine.

377
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:28,960
Sister, you haven't even married him yet. Why are you shielding him already?

378
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:35,240
Brother Gu, you killed the white-eyed wolf king. You must be a master fighter.

379
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,770
Why don't you show off a little?

380
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,560
I propose that you and our number one hero, General Heshi, compete with each other.

381
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,830
- Let everyone broaden their horizons.
- Yes, compete!

382
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,350
My Khan, I'm willing to compete with Brother Gu.

383
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,540
But I can't take advantage of him.

384
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,360
Exactly! Grandfather, Xiaowu is injured right now. This isn't fair.

385
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,130
Brother Heshi, I'm injured and can't compete with you in terms of fighting.

386
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:09,000
But I don't want to ruin everyone's mood.

387
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,030
How about this? Why don't we change the competition type?

388
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,480
Okay. What does Brother Gu want to compete in?

389
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,580
Why don't we choose archery?

390
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,780
Archery?

391
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,610
What? You want to compete in archery with my brother?

392
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,980
