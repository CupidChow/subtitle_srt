00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:24,280
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,630
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:44,530
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,970
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,470
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,970
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,160
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,120
♫  so what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,880
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,670
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,810
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:39,210
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,580
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,590
[Episode 52]

17
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,270
Kun'er, immediately send this letter to your elder brother.

18
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,150
Afterward,

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,010
you should leave right away, too.

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,020
Father, do we not have any room to turn it around?

21
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,600
Crown Prince and Chen Zheng are colluding.

22
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,090
Their sword has been aimed at me for a long time.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,540
I've guarded against everything but left out the one that was the most important.

24
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,400
He indeed was someone I watched growing up.

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,450
Won't the emperor consider any old affection?

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,590
My Lord, Chief Eunuch Cao Ji from the palace is heading here.

27
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,030
Eunuch Cao, what's the reason that you've come today?

28
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,000
- Kun'er, serve us tea.
- Yes.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,040
Prime Minister Gao, no need to be courteous.

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,350
Noble Consort suddenly contracted a severe illness. I'm afraid there is danger.

31
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,320
The emperor asks that you immediately enter the palace.

32
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,970
What? My sister is normally very healthy.

33
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,420
How could she suddenly get severely sick?

34
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,420
Is there a problem with her unborn child?

35
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,180
Prime Minister Gao.

36
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,830
Chief Eunuch.

37
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,590
What is this for?

38
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,550
Thank you, Chief Eunuch.

39
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,380
Please allow me some time to leave orders with the household.

40
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,350
The emperor's order is for you to enter the palace immediately.

41
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,030
Please change your clothes quickly.

42
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,910
Don't make it difficult for me.

43
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,250
Thank you, Chief Eunuch.

44
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,960
Remember all the things I told you to do.

45
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,220
Make sure the letter is sent safely. Then, you leave Shangjing immediately.

46
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,670
Forget about your wife, child, and possessions.

47
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,490
Do not hesitate. You mustn't stop even for a moment!

48
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,030
Remember that.

49
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,600
What about you, Father?

50
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,580
It may be good that I enter the palace.

51
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,880
Perhaps, I can get some time for you.

52
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,780
Father...

53
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,850
Don't cry.

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,770
Don't cry.

55
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,700
Don't cry.

56
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,490
Preserve the mountain.
(T/N: Stay alive for the future.)

57
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,430
Go.

58
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,810
- Father...
- Hurry up and go!

59
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,150
Eunuch Cao, this is not the way to the Splendor and Happiness Hall.

60
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,650
It looks like the way toward the Grand Literature Library.

61
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,030
You have a good memory, Prime Minister Gao.

62
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,830
The emperor is waiting at the Grand Literature Library.

63
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:46,210
In those years, I and Gu Ruhuei accompanied the princes in their studies.

64
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,960
We started early and left late.

65
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,270
It's been several decades.

66
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,340
Back then, the emperor was one of the princes.

67
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,660
He was later selected to succeed the throne.

68
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,300
We said to each other that we accompanied the right person.

69
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,490
Say, in us accompanying the emperor in his studies that time,

70
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,000
do you think we did it right or did it wrong?

71
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,800
The principle of Dao is to recognize virtue.

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,160
To be close to the people. To stop before goodness.

73
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,900
To know when to stop and then make a determination.

74
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,730
To make a determination and then to settle down.

75
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,110
To settle down and then to be at peace.

76
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,570
To be at peace and then to analyze.

77
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,330
To analyze and then to obtain.

78
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,150
There is an order to things, as well as, a beginning and an end.

79
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,730
Knowing what comes first is the way of Dao.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,820
Your Imperial Majesty, Prime Minister is here.

81
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,720
Greetings, Your Imperial Majesty.

82
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,930
The principle of Dao is to recognize virtue.

83
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,000
To be close to the people. To stop before goodness.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,970
To know when to stop and then make a determination.

85
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,760
To make a determination and then to settle down.

86
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,090
To settle down and then to be at peace.

87
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,610
To be at peace and then to analyze.

88
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,290
To analyze and then to obtain.

89
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,090
There is an order to things, as well as, a beginning and an end.

90
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:54,190
Knowing what comes first is the way of Dao.

91
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,630
That's the first thing we learned in school.

92
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,320
You were sitting there.

93
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,910
Ru Hui sat next to me. Over here.

94
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,730
Cao Gongong informed me that the royal consort was ill and asked me to come in.

95
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,480
May I ask how the royal consort is?

96
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,550
Back then, Ru Hui was the fastest at memorizing.

97
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,650
You were the slowest.

98
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:35,520
So the teacher had you copy the article ten times.

99
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,280
At the time, we joked that you were stupid.

100
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,490
But who would imagine

101
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,530
you would become my most important prime minister.

102
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,660
Think about it. It's quite interesting.

103
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,810
I'm still stupid.

104
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,280
I still do not understand Your Imperial Majesty's meaning.

105
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,770
Gao Yuming, do you know what your crime is?

106
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,090
I do not. Please tell me.

107
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,690
Aren't you tired of bending your head to talk?

108
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,720
Enough! Raise your head.

109
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,240
I understand.

110
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,660
This is my crime.

111
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,870
I've been pretending to be ill for so long, I almost believe it myself.

112
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,720
When did Your Imperial Majesty find out I was pretending?

113
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,490
I've always known about it.

114
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,910
Why didn't you expose me?

115
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,050
Do you remember when we were youngsters we watched from the wall a lion catching an antelope?

116
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,480
The lion didn't care

117
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,490
whether the antelope was old, young, disabled, or sick.

118
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,940
It only cared that it was hungry.

119
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:21,880
The rules were set by the lion and not the antelope.

120
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,560
Gao Yuming, you thought too highly of yourself.

121
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:35,870
Let me ask you. What has Gao Xian been doing?

122
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,930
My son, Gao Xian, is at the border putting down the Suobo rebellion on behalf of Your Imperial Majesty.

123
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,930
Suobo rebellion?

124
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,740
Or your rebellion?

125
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,850
Making deals with foreigners and supporting criminals to do his bidding.

126
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,920
Wanting soldiers, money, and position.

127
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:05,180
Now you use border security to threaten me. What is your intent?

128
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,880
I hope you will not believe the false words that villains will use to alienate us

129
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,820
and to disappoint our soldiers at the border.

130
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,830
You think I would believe slander?

131
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,080
What about the scholar exam case? It had irrefutable evidence. What do you have to say about it?

132
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,820
Emperor, do you wish to hear my argument,

133
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,380
or to have me admit to those false charges?

134
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't get it. Even now...

135
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,560
Yuming, you are still thickheaded.

136
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,320
Back when you were acting, you had all the setups.

137
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,610
So it wasn't ridiculous. But today, you don't even have your mask.

138
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,120
And you dare to continue to act in front of me?

139
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,930
Don't you think it's awkward?

140
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,580
I don't know how to act.

141
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,320
I only know that my niece and daughter

142
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,540
are married to the emperor, governing the harem,

143
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,750
raising the children. That is not an act.

144
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,290
My son is loyal.

145
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,080
He stayed at the border wasteland for over a decade

146
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,650
to keep the border secure. That is not an act.

147
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,490
I analyze and advise the emperor day and night,

148
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,160
keeping the government running. That is not an act.

149
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,740
Keeping the government running for me?

150
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,300
So you know this country belongs to me!

151
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes, your niece and daughter were

152
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,000
granted the title of the empress and royal consort by me.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,090
Your son was granted the position of general by me.

154
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,530
These honors were granted by me.

155
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:56,530
Without these, you couldn't even stand here to playact.

156
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,220
But you?

157
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:04,260
You colluded with the empress and royal consort. You built up your power base in the harem and in the court.

158
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,340
You even let your son have criminals to do his bidding.

159
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,570
You think I didn't know any of it?

160
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,000
It was until Zhonghuan's investigation revealed your handiwork behind the exam cheating.

161
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,990
The people riled up against the scam.

162
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,510
What did I do?

163
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,470
I suppressed the issue.

164
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,230
I didn't immediately punish you.

165
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,520
Yuming, oh Yuming, did you not think of how to pay me back?

166
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,370
The country is naturally yours.

167
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,330
I am only your duster.

168
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,000
Wherever there is dust, your hand swings there,

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,850
and I have to help you wipe it away.

170
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,250
If you say I'm acting,

171
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,120
then my best act

172
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,090
is the one I did with you.

173
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,100
What do you mean?

174
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,200
You set the stage.

175
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,020
You wrote the script.

176
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,440
I played only a minor role in it.

177
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,790
But in the end, I became the main character.

178
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,510
I deviously knocked down Gu Ruhui.

179
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,300
I was your scapegoat for over a decade.

180
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,430
I carry the shame of falsely accusing honorable officials.

181
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,910
Did I perform well in that play?

182
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,390
Gao Yuming, how dare you?

183
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:59,040
If that is the case, I have committed no crime.

184
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,360
No matter what you say, you will die today.

185
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,510
Emperor is wise.

186
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:30,010
Stop the car.

187
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,930
Master ordered us to leave immediately.

188
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,030
If we don't go, we will be too late. Young Master!

189
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,060
We are going back!

190
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,570
- Young Master!
- Go home!

191
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,240
Move these.

192
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,300
Let's go. We don't have time.

193
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,530
Husband, that time we were in the palace

194
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,870
the empress dowager gave me a jewel pin. It's not here.

195
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,940
It's not the time for this.

196
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,380
If we don't go now, we won't be able to leave.

197
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,240
Go, go, go? Even if we leave, we will just starve to death.

198
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,400
I'd rather die right here.

199
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,280
Looking at you. I should've never come back.

200
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,800
Look, look, look. What are you looking for?

201
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:30,790
It's snowing. What a coincidence.

202
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,340
I remember when Gu Ruhui was jailed,

203
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:41,430
it was also cloudy and soon it was snowing.

204
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:47,480
It's as if all that had happened was just yesterday.

205
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,580
Especially, the Gu Ruhui's expression.

206
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:58,180
Then one day, I looked in the mirror and suddenly

207
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,400
saw that I had a similar expression

208
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,120
as Gu Ruhui.

209
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,960
Gao Yuming,

210
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,390
in Gu Ruihui's downfall,

211
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,700
can you honestly say you had no personal interest?

212
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,570
Yes. My interest was to align with yours.

213
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,480
For me?

214
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,860
Since the first time I stepped into this place,

215
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,300
you had never looked me in the eyes.

216
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,690
After you finally became the emperor,

217
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,130
I knew you would definitely appoint your best friends,

218
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,740
your most trusted ally Gu Ruhui.

219
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,910
But you came to me in person.

220
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,700
To tell me that you wanted my service.

221
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,800
From that day on, right here in Grand Literature Library,

222
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,650
the place where Gao Yuming was always scorned and laughed at,

223
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,080
I was wanted and needed.

224
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,180
From that day, I swore

225
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,940
I would do anything for you.

226
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,500
Plotting, destroying the government,

227
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,100
not respecting me: is your way to pay me back?

228
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,010
I was afraid.

229
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,090
I was afraid I would

230
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,640
become the next Gu Ruhui.

231
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,100
So I pretended to be sick, to be dumb, to be crazed,

232
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,200
to be indifferent, to care.

233
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,880
I know it is not perfect.

234
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,400
But what else can I do?

235
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
You think I'm a fool.

236
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm not a fool either.

237
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,700
I know the emperor's trust rotates between players.

238
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,010
Can you tell me truthfully

239
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,530
if you have anybody you really trust?

240
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,260
I was lucky.

241
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,060
I tried really hard to dig my escape route.

242
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Escape route? It's a dead end.

243
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,050
You have reached the end.

244
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,430
Who isn't walking into a dead-end?

245
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,270
In the court, is there another road to take?

246
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,010
Gu Ruhui was incredibly smart.

247
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,400
He chose you who was not the legitimate heir nor the eldest son,

248
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,330
who did not want the throne.

249
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,490
Back then, he thought he was walking on a happy road.

250
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,980
He... was overconfident.

251
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,730
He was too ambitious.

252
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,280
He used a burning heart to light up a hopeless prince's ambition.

253
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,500
Then used his burning heart to burn down

254
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,580
all obstacles laid before you.

255
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,400
Until the moment you sat on the throne,

256
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,310
looked at your subjects,

257
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,290
you saw Gu Ruhui's burning fire still had not died down.

258
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,360
No one can tolerate the burning fire

259
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,430
turning into a disaster.

260
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,820
You saw it clearly.

261
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,220
So what if I was clear.

262
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,790
I ended up the same way.

263
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,890
When Gu Ruhui was at the height of his life,

264
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,080
I was only a little governor of Jingzhou.

265
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,190
I diligently did my job without fire in my heart.

266
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,480
Who knew it would become my asset.

267
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,780
I admit I formed cliques.

268
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,500
I accepted bribes. And my son Gao Xian

269
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,450
paid criminals to do his bidding. He betrayed the emperor.

270
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,600
But none of it is the reason I must die.

271
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,070
Then what?

272
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,730
Emperor, why do you ask what you already know?

273
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,480
After Gu Ruhui with a burning heart died, I was there to take over.

274
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,190
When my heart started burning, a new person took over.

275
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,670
Since the time of old, all the capable officials

276
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,300
had some skeletons in their past.

277
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,120
If one day, they overshadow the emperor, you can just get rid of them.

278
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,000
They will have no impact on the throne, the country.

279
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,700
You just need to waste some hypocritical show of affection.

280
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,230
People! Eventually, they will wake up.

281
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,060
Too bad, I woke up too early.

282
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,140
Even you didn't anticipate

283
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,560
the change would be so fast.

284
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,360
But who will be the next

285
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,700
to wake up?

286
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:08,050
You said I put on a hypocritical show of affection. You are half right.

287
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:15,960
As for Gu Ruhui, I do feel guilty toward him.

288
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:22,190
Because he had done nothing against me. But you?

289
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,740
- You deserve to die.
- Do you mean Mingyue?

290
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,000
She is but a woman I love.

291
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,370
Why did you try to kill her?

292
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,300
Emperor.

293
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,260
Are you the man who sat in this seat?

294
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,410
Chen Zheng. Mingyue was his daughter.

295
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,200
I indeed cannot tolerate Mingyue. But that assassin

296
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,390
was not sent by me.

297
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,010
Royal Consort was set up to take the fall.

298
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,660
Take me, for example. Mingyue never stated that she wanted revenge against me.

299
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,900
But everything that happened to her was my fault in the end.

300
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,960
That only means that everything that happened

301
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
was carefully planned to target

302
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,620
me directly.

303
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:36,700
You may not believe me. But if I tell you

304
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,910
whom Chen Zheng is advising,

305
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,730
then you will believe me.

306
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,060
To whom is he advising?

307
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,710
Chen Zheng, Ming Yue,

308
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,530
Crown Prince.

309
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,000
Crown Prince...

310
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:23,010
Even if it is him, it's not too bad.

311
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:26,520
At least he is my biological son.

312
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,590
Gao Yuming.

313
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,800
Before you die,

314
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,530
you still try to anger me.

315
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,550
You've done it.

316
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:49,610
I should die for my crime. It's my habit.

317
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,800
Before I die, I still want to offer you my help.

318
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,680
Why?

319
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,540
I have a request to make.

320
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,070
Speak.

321
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,100
Please spare Royal Consort's life since

322
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,200
she is carrying your child.

323
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:29,930
- All right.
-Thank you, Emperor.

324
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,270
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

325
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,610
Mr. Gao, my apologies.

326
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,530
Mother, I want Father.

327
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,420
Husband!

328
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,700
- Master.
- Husband!

329
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,960
- Husband!
- Master.

330
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,050
- I want Father!
- What should we do?

331
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,220
It's snowing.

332
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,030
A'Du.

333
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,930
A'Du! A'Du!

334
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,850
It's snowing.

335
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,250
It's snowing.

336
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,610
If we were in Xi State,

337
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,870
the snow would've come earlier.

338
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,280
A'Du, you are finally awake.

339
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,760
Princess, I'm sorry.

340
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,920
Why are you apologizing?

341
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,770
I made you worry.

342
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,660
It's good you are awake, A'Du.

343
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,990
I only have you left.

344
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,660
In Xi State, the first snow

345
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,450
is to honor the dead.

346
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:44,660
That way, the lost soul will go to where the white snow came from

347
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,530
and enter into an innocent rebirth.

348
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,730
Princess, if you really have forgiven him,

349
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,970
then let me venerate his soul

350
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,340
tonight in the garden.

351
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,040
Lost and lonely soul, listen to my bells.

352
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,290
Under the moon, the bells knock on your door.

353
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,270
Lost and lonely soul, do not hesitate.

354
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,460
Where the snow came from is where you should return.

355
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,170
Lost and lonely soul, don't be sad about the journey.

356
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,850
There is eternal life after death.

357
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,580
Lost and lonely soul, listen to my bells.

358
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,380
The bells will point you to the way to rebirth.

359
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,570
It's Gu Jian.

360
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,490
He has left.

361
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,340
He finally has a place to return to.

362
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,960
Princess, we should go back to Xi State now.

363
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,190
Before we go,

364
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,730
there's still one thing I have to do.

365
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,620
I'll kill Li Chengyin.

366
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:03,180
The criminal subject Gao Yuming

367
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,040
has grown his power by grooming personal allies, falsely persecuting the innocents,

368
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,460
and corrupting the imperial civil examination. His son Gao Xian has bred bandits for personal gain,

369
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,830
embezzled from military budgets, lied to the emperor,

370
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,070
causing difficulty for the imperial court to resonate its might and leading to the blocking of the path of numerous innocent souls.

371
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:20,320
He is a sinned subject of the empire.

372
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,200
The Gao clan's crimes deserve the punishment of annihilation with immediate executions.

373
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,950
Their allied associations, regardless of their levels and positions,

374
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,890
will be sent to the frontier camps.

375
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,300
Considering Gao Ruyi is good-natured

376
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,110
and has served as my wife, she is therefore waived from the death penalty. Her title being removed,

377
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,480
demoted to a commoner status.

378
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,130
Regarding the case of Gu Ruhui, it originated from Gao Yuming's deception of the court,

379
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:53,110
condemning a patriot to unjust convictions is finally exonerated today.

380
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:57,090
However, a loyal minister has died. I am full of regrets.

381
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,490
Now, I'm pardoning Gu Ruhui's conviction

382
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,470
and proclaiming him posthumously as Duke Zhong of the State,

383
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,840
to be buried in the Cemetery for Patriotism and Filial Piety, to pay respect to his spirits.

384
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,040
This decree must be promulgated!

385
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,280
Your Imperial Majesty is wise.

386
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,590
- Commoner Gao.
- What is the meaning of this?

387
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,810
The emperor ordered this pregnancy comfort medicine for you.

388
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,190
Pregnancy comfort medicine?

389
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,910
I am due this month.

390
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,660
Why do I need pregnancy comfort medicine?

391
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,580
- I won't drink!
- You better drink it.

392
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,830
Drink it, then everything will be well.

393
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,440
Your Majesty,

394
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,170
you are so cruel.

395
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,350
So cruel!

396
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,720
General, a secret report from Shangjing.

397
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:57,180
My son Xian, very soon, the emperor will likely

398
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,390
condemn me because of the Gu family case.

399
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,550
I sense the coming of calamity.

400
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,250
To save your life, escape as soon as you can.

401
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,730
Remember so. Signed, Father.

402
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,740
General, we've been waiting for more than half a day here.

403
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,410
Have they mistaken the time of our fight?

404
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:21,410
Should we order someone to find out?

405
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,470
General?

406
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,750
Count all the men and horses.

407
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,410
Get everyone ready to exit the border gate.

408
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:11,210
Exit the border?

409
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,520
Yes.

410
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,360
We'll go to Xi State.

411
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,930
General, we can't recklessly enter Xi State.

412
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,500
And what about the Protectorate General Office?

413
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,200
We can't go back to the Protectorate General Office anymore.

414
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,780
Hurry and go!

415
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,410
Yes!

416
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:13,520
[Memorial Tomb of Gu Jian]

417
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,160
I want you to know that Mr. Chai risked his life

418
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,340
and put in all his effort

419
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,220
to save the last remaining bloodline from the Gu clan.

420
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,930
He is your uncle Gu Ruhui's only son.

421
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,610
He is your cousin Gu Jian.

422
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,390
Cousin.

423
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,560
The Gu clan used to be a prestigious clan.

424
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,450
Prime Minister Gao confused truth and falsehood in front of the emperor.

425
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,710
He accused the Gu and Chen of treason.

426
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,890
The emperor didn't know the truth

427
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,900
and only believed in what Prime Minister Gao said.

428
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,920
In anger...

429
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,370
Mother, I swear

430
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,050
to avenge you and the Gu family.

431
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,370
We've finally finished everything.

432
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,220
Yes.

433
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,500
Everything is over.

434
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,560
The Gu family's conviction was not only reversed,

435
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,620
Uncle has also been posthumously proclaimed by Imperial Father as Duke of Zhong of the State

436
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,700
and buried in the Cemetery for Patriotism and Filial Piety. This kind of grace

437
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,750
shows that Imperial Father has never forgotten his sentiments for the Gu family.

438
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:02,120
For so many years, even if I was forced to wander far from my empire,

439
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,110
I've always believed that the emperor trusted me and Ruhui.

440
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,450
It's precisely because of that,

441
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:14,000
I was willing to dedicate over half of my lifetime

442
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,200
to repay the emperor's grace in appreciating my contribution.

443
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,730
Sir.

444
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,950
You can find a chance to reveal your identity to Imperial Father.

445
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,690
He will definitely give you a high position again.

446
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:31,630
Besides, I will need your counsel in the future.

447
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:36,440
I am grateful for your trust in me,

448
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,340
but I have firmly decided to retire into obscurity.

449
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,700
Retire?

450
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,190
Didn't you say that you had dedicated yourself to repaying Imperial Father's grace in appreciation for you?

451
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,600
The devious Minister Gao has been eliminated.

452
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,300
I have fulfilled my wish.

453
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,610
Besides, if I stay by the emperor's side,

454
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,740
can I really repay his favor that way?

455
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:09,160
Ruhui and I were by his side, too, back then,

456
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:14,640
but we could only watch helplessly as he was constrained by those treacherous wrongdoers.

457
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,300
He couldn't even protect those he trusted the most.

458
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,560
Enough. It's enough now.

459
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,750
Since you're so determined, I won't force you to stay.

460
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,330
Your Imperial Highness, may I ask you

461
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,160
to take a message to Mingyue?

462
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,070
She chose her own road.

463
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,720
There's nothing more I can say to convince her otherwise.

464
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,590
Just tell her to be cautious

465
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,150
and take care.

466
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,870
I will tell her.

467
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,990
Thank you very much.
