16

[Episode 23]

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,730
You wretched servant!

18
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,780
What kind of feud do you have with the Xi State's Ninth Princess that you must harm her this way?

19
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Your Majesty, there's a matter that I want to report.

20
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,510
Say it!

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,150
The bowl of fungus pear soup that Ninth Princess took in originally belonged to Crown Prince.

22
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,800
Crown Prince saw that Ninth Princess liked to eat it,

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,980
so he gave his bowl to Ninth Princess.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,050
Is that true?

25
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,790
Replying to Your Imperial Majesty. That is indeed what happened.

26
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,900
Oh my! So this wretched servant was intending to poison you, Your Highness the Crown Prince!

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,730
And I was wondering

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,300
why Prince Yi didn't consider his lofty position and jumped out to fight for you.

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,000
When he left, he didn't take you with him and instead left you behind to receive punishment in the Crown Prince Manor.

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,290
Talk. Was it Prince Yi who commanded you to poison the crown prince?!

31
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,100
Li Yan, how dare you accuse Prince Yi in such a manner?!

32
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,830
I have a basis for it. The material evidence and eyewitness are all here!

33
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,560
Imperial Father, please do not listen to Li Yan's nonsense.

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,900
Fifth Brother would definitely not commit such a rebellious act of defying one's superior.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,850
Your Imperial Majesty, spare my life!

36
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,580
- Ceng Xian!
- Here!

37
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,040
Immediately bring your troop to Prince Yi Manor, seal it and search it! No one may enter or leave without my decree!

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,460
Yes!

39
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,120
- Immediately return to the palace. Send someone to notify Prime Minister Gao as soon as possible.
- Yes.

40
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,320
Who are you people?! How dare you trespass into here?!

41
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,710
Move aside!

42
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,110
What is happening?

43
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,550
Per His Imperial Majesty's decree, the Prince Yi Mansion is placed on lockdown.

44
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,950
No one may leave without His Imperial Majesty's permission.

45
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,120
What?

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,530
[Court of Judicial Review]

47
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,730
Talk. Who incited you to poison the crown prince?

48
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,650
Everything was my idea.

49
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,180
I hated the crown prince for punishing me.

50
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,730
No one else commanded me.

51
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,540
Don't! Don't!

52
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,010
Once you enter the Court of Judicial Review, you won't be able to avoid the torture.

53
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
But it would be suspicious if you confessed immediately after the torture has just started.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Your testimony would then be unbelievable.

55
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,150
However, even the toughest bones can not hold out

56
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,610
for more than three days inside the Court of Judicial Review.

57
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,260
I understand. I must persist up to three days for them to believe my words.

58
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,200
I will wait until that day to make the confession.

59
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
I appreciate your suffering.

60
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,740
It is my honor to work for Your Highness.

61
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,220
I will never forget your kindness

62
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,830
that Your Highness has shown me.

63
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,110
I will take care of your family. Don't worry.

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,500
You are really a tough one.

65
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,090
However, we have plenty of methods here to get you to open your mouth.

66
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,700
I advise you to clearly think about it soon to avoid bodily pains.

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,510
My Lady! Hurry!

68
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,400
Hurry up!

69
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,740
Stop!

70
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,710
Elder Brother!

71
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,950
Where are you going at this late hour?

72
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,600
I just...

73
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,450
Do you know that Prince Yi Manor is now surrounded by the Shenwu Army?

74
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,320
Not only you, but even a fly can't fly into there!

75
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,270
But Brother, Prince Yi is in trouble right now!

76
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,500
Am I supposed to just sit in our manor, worry and do nothing?

77
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,530
If I can just see him, I would be a little bit less worried.

78
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,690
What do girls know? If you make one wrong move,

79
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,200
our Zhao family will lose the whole game, too.

80
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,620
Prince Yi is currently unable to protect himself. I will not allow you to get involved in these muddy waters, either!

81
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,060
No! I must go out today!

82
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,600
Come back! Servants!

83
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,750
- Send Lady back into her room!
- Let me go!

84
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,820
- She is not allowed to leave without my orders!
- Let go of me!

85
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,130
- Brother!
- My Lady!

86
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,100
- Brother!
- My Lady!

87
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,720
Let me go! Let go! Brother!

[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

89
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,930
It's almost the third day. Where is the antidote?

90
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,520
Princess!

91
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,460
You want to change into palace clothing? I'll go get them for you.

92
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,340
Your Highness.

93
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,380
Isn't this the Danchi servant who is always by the ninth princess' side?

94
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,330
She is usually wearing a Danchi outfit. Why has she changed into clothes from the Li Empire today?

95
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,970
What are you doing?

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,610
You've worked hard.

97
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,700
Your Highness, in my opinion, we don't have to bother with this servant.

98
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,010
She is not only a mute, but also stupid.

99
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,060
I know you're worried about the ninth princess, but the person who poisoned her is Prince Yi.

100
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,200
If you want the antidote, you shouldn't find me.

101
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,910
Go back. Kneeling here won't do anything.

102
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,820
Let go!

103
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,170
Your Highness, it's been three days already.

104
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,500
Tomorrow morning at the imperial court, the witnesses and evidence will be presented to His Imperial Majesty.

105
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,700
It's over for Li Chengyin.

106
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,920
- Search the place!
- Yes!

107
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,400
- This way!
- Yes!

108
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,800
- Look carefully!
- That way!

109
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,390
- We didn't find anything!
- Look over there!

110
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,830
Look over there!

111
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,480
- Search!
- Okay!

112
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,840
General, we found it!

113
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,540

A'Du.

117
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,730
She has been poisoned using a Western Border mysterious poison, Blood Thorns.

118
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,930
It's too late to make the remedy now.

119
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,800
I know a way to force the poison out of her.

120
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,170
A'Du, go and fill two copper tubs with clean water.

121
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,330
Then, guard the door for three incenses time (1 1/2 hours to 3 hours).

122

I had expended some internal energy. I just need to get some rest.

155
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,930
Young man, my healing skill is only mediocre.

156
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,750
Your injury is too severe.

157
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,000
Vital areas are damaged.

158
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,030
Your internal organs are injured, too.

159
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,130

How long do I have?

161
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,600
If you don't waste your energy and not get agitated,

162
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,000
you may live longer. But if you suffer more internal damage,

163
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,770
then I don't know.

164
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,400
Inside your body is a little vial of poison.

165
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,210
Any little accident would tip it over and spill the poison out.

166
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,940
It will then spread all over your body. You must be very, very careful.

168
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,240
The suspect of Ninth Princess' poison case, Chan'Er, has confessed.

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,950
She is an assassin of Prince Yi.

170
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,200
She tried to poison the crown prince per Prince Yi's order.

171
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,840
By accident, she poisoned Ninth Princess instead.

172
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,000
According to the suspect's confession, we found the poison in Yi Manor.

173
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,880
We have both the witness and the evidence. However, this case involves a prince,

174
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,150
we dare not make our judgment. Therefore, we ask Your Imperial Majesty to preside over the case.

175
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,810
Lock Prince Yi in the Court of Judicial Review and I'll question him personally.

176
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,150
I understand.

177
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,450
Report if you have anything to say and retreat if you don't!

178
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,090
I have something to say.

179
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,300
Please speak, Minister Gao.

180
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,400
Your Imperial Majesty, thank you for letting me speak.

181
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,200
The servant's action and testimony are not enough to prove Prince Yi's guilt.

182
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,300
She could either be lying or framing him.

183
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,480
Prince Yi's mild temperament and kindness are well known.

184
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,930
There may be something more behind this case.

185
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Your Imperial Majesty, please give Prince Yi a retrial.

186
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,770
Your Imperial Majesty, please reconsider.

187
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,340
I haven't determined his crime yet.

188
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,970
But you are already defending him.

189
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,370
I finally realize today how popular he is.

190
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,100
I'm concerned that the servant is being used by an unscrupulous person

191
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,630
to embarrass the royal family.

192
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,790
Your Imperial Majesty!

193
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,100
Your Imperial Majesty, we have a witness and evidence. There is nothing more we need to investigate.

194
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,020
Everybody has said Prince Yi is kind. I don't think so.

195
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:55,650
He and the ex-crown prince went to Eastern Border together but only he returned.

196
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,680
And he defeated Danchi. That means...

197
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,110
Li Yan!

198
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,800
Please don't listen to his nonsense. Even if Fifth Brother hates me because of the servant girl,

199
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,120
he would never hurt Big Brother.

200
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,230
Withheld three months of Li Yan's salary and suspend him for one month.

201
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,810
You all may leave.

202
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,600
A'Du,

203
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,190
what happened to you?

204
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,700
If you admit to your crime now, I'll go light on you.

205
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,100
Imperial Father, I did not do it. How should I confess?

206
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,490
The evidence all points to you. How should I believe you?

207
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:59,000
Imperial Father, if I really wanted to poison the crown prince, I would've sent someone I don't know.

208
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,040
Why would I send my own servant and let others get hold of me?

209
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,820
Everything that has happened blatantly points to me. Don't you think it's suspicious?

210
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,200
If the crown prince had died, then there is nothing to be suspicious of.

211
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,960
If you are willing to believe that crude evidence, then I have nothing to say.

212
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,190
Then, I'll ask something else.

213
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,410
How do you explain Chengji's death?

214
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,030
Imperial Father, what do you mean?

215
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,580
I don't understand.

216
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,320
Back then, you went to the Protectorate General Office in the Western Border together.

217
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,660
But in the end, why did you only come back?

218
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,470
Imperial Father, can you not see who the real benefactor is?!

219
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,310
I'm going to tell you something.

220
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,920
Some will protect you today, then some will hurt you tomorrow.

221
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,120
These people will be the same type of people.

222
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,070
They chase after power and crave for power.

223
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:55,780
In the palace, the last thing they need is the truth.

224
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
So that's what you meant.

225
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,520
Big Brother,

226
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,290
so that's what you meant.

227
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:16,220
Your Imperial Majesty, Embracing the Moon Pavilion sent news that Ninth Princess is awake.

228
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,980
His Imperial Majesty is here!

229
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
Your Imperial Majesty.

230
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
You can rise.

231
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,880
How is she?

232
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,390
When I arrived, she just woke up.

233
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,280
She is still weak. So after she took the medication, she went back to sleep.

234
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,540
But the doctor said that she will be fine in time.

235
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,750
Good. Doctor, how was her poison cured?

236
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,650
Your Imperial Majesty, I do not know either.

237
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,840
Princess may have taken a magical pill.

238
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,010
Yongniang.

239
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,390
Your Imperial Majesty. Your Imperial Highness. I don't know either.

240
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,550
I came this morning and found the Princess awake.

241
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:29,070
A'Du was with the Princess last night, but she is a mute and can't tell me what happened.

242
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,370
As long as she is awake.

243
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:38,210
Empress, get her some medicine that helps with recuperation.

244
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,480
Take care of the princess.

245
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,810
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.

246
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:50,900
[Longevity and Benevolence Palace]

247
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,440
Your Imperial Majesty, it took me a while to find out.

248
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,570
The servant of the ninth princess knelt in front of the Eastern Palace the whole night.

249
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,600
This morning, the princess woke up.

250
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,550
It's only gossip among the servants.

251
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,750
I've punished those who spread it.

252
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,760
Your Imperial Majesty! Your Imperial Majesty!

253
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,280
Your Imperial Majesty,

254
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,390
I visited Assuming the Rites Hall several times but I wasn't able to see you... I...

255
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,580
Meiniang, I know you are worried about Prince Yi.

256
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,550
But this case is very sensitive.

257
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,420
I don't want to seem unfair so I didn't see you.

258
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,120
I hope you don't blame me.

259
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,810
I would never.

260
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:47,130
My concern for my son made me act inappropriately.

261
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:53,120
Don't worry. Minister Gao and other courtiers have spoken for him this morning.

262
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,690
Besides, Prince Yi is my favorite son.

263
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,220
I won't do anything to him.

264
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,220
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

265
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,410
Sir!

266
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,460
What did you find out?

267
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,370
It's on the outskirts of the capital. Li Yan is too audacious.

268
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,020
He actually put up the copper coin refining workshop near the practice arena of the Tongchang Suwei (lodging guard) Army.

269
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,520
He really knows to pick a location.

270
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,740
Tongchang Suwei Army...

271
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,440
Aren't they the private manor guards of Elder Prince Zhong?

272
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,480
No wonder we can't find anything after searching the city upside down.

273
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,190
Li Yan and the crown prince have closed that workshop.

274
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,220
Now that there's no one inside the palace to coordinate with us.

275
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,550
How shall we reveal this to the emperor?

276
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,950
In the capital,

277
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,760
if you want to let the emperor hear something, it's not that hard.

278
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,190
Reporting to Your Imperial Majesty.

279
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,730
I have encountered a strange matter today,

280
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,370
that I especially came to report to you.

281
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,570
What strange matter?

282
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,150
I heard that there are some commoners

283
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,390
who were able to dig out a lot of copper coins

284
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,780
near the Tongchang Suwei Army practice arena.

285
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,670
I then sent some people to investigate.

286
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,710
As a result, I found out that

287
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:44,650
these copper coins compared to the government made copper coins have a slight difference.

288
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:48,040
I found this matter odd and felt that this was an important matter.

289
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,960
Therefore, I came to report it.

290
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,420
Tongchang Suwei Army?

291
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,300
Isn't that...

292
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,560
They are exactly the manor guards of His Highness the Elder Prince Zhong.

293
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,820
You may not tell this matter to others. You may go now.

294
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,090
Yes, Your Imperial Majesty.

[Court of Judicial Review]

296
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:35,430
Ninth Princess, His Imperial Majesty decreed that no one may see Prince Yi.

297
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,120
But I am not a subject of your Li Empire.

298
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,270
Everyone says Prince Yi poisoned me.

299
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,000
I need to ask him personally. Please let me in.

300
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,800
Ninth Princess, even when Empress came to visit Prince Yi, she was stopped.

301
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,020
You better return. Don't give me a hard time.

302
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,610
Princess, I've told you already. We definitely can not go inside.

303
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,040
Let's go back.

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,050
Whenever you want to see me

306
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,760
or need my help, just shoot this whistle arrow towards the sky

307
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,100
and I will appear.

308
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,100
You really came.

309
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,160
Are you feeling better?

310
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,040
Much better.

311
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,430
Didn't you tell me that regardless of what matter,

312
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,730
as long as I request it, you will help me?

313
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,730
I have a matter now. I want to go inside the Celestial Prison.

314
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,410
Because of Prince Yi?

315
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,110
He was imprisoned in the Celestial Prison because of poisoning you.

316
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,720
He is my friend. I believe that he wouldn't do such a thing.

317
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,880
That's why I want to go in person to find out what exactly happened.

318
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:45,360
The whistling arrow I gave you was not meant for this purpose.

319
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,030
But since you requested, I will surely help you.

320
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,720
Come with me.

321
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,230
The prisoners in this Celestial Prison are mostly royal relatives and nobility.

322
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,190
Also, they are just temporarily imprisoned; hence, there are no outsiders.

323
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,120
I will stand watch for you here. You go and return quickly.

00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,700
Are you better?

328
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,990
This princess is worthy of being helped by the heavens. I recovered just by sleeping it off for a few days.

329
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,890
It's good that you are well.

330
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,820
I brought you some snacks. They're still hot.

331
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,950
Eat them while they're still warm.

332
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,350
Do you believe that I've been falsely accused?

333
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:23,570
Of course, I believe you. We just finished investigating the matter regarding the crown prince and Li Yan,

334
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,120
and then we successively got into trouble.

335
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,970
Just thinking about it and you'll realize that something is fishy.

336
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,610
But Imperial Father doesn't believe me.

337
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,680
I can help you go beg for His Imperial Majesty's pardon.

338
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,880
No need.

339
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,630
You just recovered.

340
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:47,790
You should rest more. Don't cause any more trouble.

341
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,190
You need to tell me how I can help.

342
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,040
It's my fault for I didn't consider things in a more thorough manner. I caused you to suffer as well.

343
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,940
It's not your fault.

344
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,660
No, I was too eager for instant success and quick profits.

345
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,070
Just to grab hold of evidence against the crown prince,

346
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,820
I implicated you in this.

347
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,040
I am the one who caused you harm.

348
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,590
I'm sorry.

349
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,080
You shouldn't say that.

350
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,920
I can not normally stand by these fraudulent and deceptive matters.

351
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,600
I should've listened to you at that time.

352
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,760
If I didn't act so rashly, we wouldn't have inadvertently alerted the enemy.

353
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,950
The matter is already so. There's nothing we can do about it now.

354
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:50,450
But... But the crown prince has already taken action against you. There's no guarantee that he won't do it again.

355
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,050
It's hard to guard against hidden enemies in the inner palace.

356
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:55,150
While I'm not beside you, you must learn to protect yourself.

357
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,890
Understand?

358
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,780
What about you?

359
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,270
Are you willing to be stuck here and be wrongly charged?

360
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,630
Me?

361
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,110
The royal family is like this.

362
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,430
The one who succeeds is the king, the one who loses is the bandit.

363
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:32,180
You should leave quickly; or else, you'll get in trouble if they see you.

364
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,360
It's cold here. You keep this

365
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,560
Take care of yourself.

366
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,250
I am going now.

367
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,960
You, too.

368
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,200
Good.

369
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,130
Crown Prince, your critiques on the memorials have improved a lot.

370
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,150
Methodical and orderly. Shows good understanding.

371
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:38,170
It's Imperial Father who has shown me proper guidance.

372
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,010
Crown Prince, today in the imperial court,

373
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,950
when they were discussing the ninth princess' poison case, you didn't make any comments.

374
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,900
There are no outsiders here. Tell me your opinions.

375
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:02,690
Fifth Brother and I are blood siblings.

376
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,340
I don't believe that he would do something like this.

377
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,840
But the Court of Judicial Review has already obtained testimony from a witness.

378
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:15,690
At Prince Yi's residence, there was also hard evidence found. He already couldn't dispute it even if he had a hundred mouths.

379
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:22,780
Crown Prince, it is you who Prince Yi originally wanted to poison.

380
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,990
Why then do you still believe in him?

381
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,900
Imperial Father,

382
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,420
even if it's truly Fifth Little Brother's doing,

383
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,000
I still will not blame him.

384
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,790
As the elder brother, I wasn't modest.

385
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,660
Even if Fifth Brother really resents me, it is normal.

386
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,890
I ask that Imperial Father give a lighter sentence to Fifth Little Brother.

387
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,440
You truly have a broad mindset.

388
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,920
You are able to tolerate what others can not tolerate.

389
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,070
I am comforted.

390
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:07,280
Imperial Father, you've overpraised me. It's your conduct that is my role model.

391
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,600
I am only following your footsteps.

392
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,260
Oh right.

393
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:19,600
When Li Yan mentioned the deceased crown prince case today,

394
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,530
my heart suddenly felt cold.

395
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,930
You have a good relationship with Li Yan.

396
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,400
What do you think about this?

397
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,500
You have already closed the case. The deceased crown prince was killed by the Danchi people.

398
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,090
Li Yan is really insubordinate in saying what he did.

399
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:45,300
But since Imperial Father has already punished him,

400
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,690
he is surely repenting on his mistakes now.

401
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,460
Crown Prince, do you really think that this matter

402
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,590
has nothing to do with Prince Yi?

403
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,920

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,020
