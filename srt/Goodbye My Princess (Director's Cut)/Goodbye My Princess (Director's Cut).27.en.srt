00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,080
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,510
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,100
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,810
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,660
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,060
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,190
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,070
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,940
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,730
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,900
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:39,200
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,580
[Episode 27]

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Mother!

18
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,470
Mother.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,490
Mother...

20
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,270
Wen'er.

21
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,060
The empress...

22
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,300
The empress is bullying us intolerably.

23
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,050
I won't believe that her maiden clan hasn't committed any crimes outside the palace.

24
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,990
- I will go investigate!
- You can't go!

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,390
The empress has had the emperor's trust for many years.

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,860
She also has the support of the Gao clan.

27
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,750
Eliminating us is as easy as killing an ant.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,400
We can't fight back.

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Mother,

30
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,940
am I just going to watch you suffer?

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,600
Wen'er,

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,590
don't be rash, please?

33
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,460
Mother, I am now the eldest son.

34
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,840
I am more qualified than Li Chengyin to be the crown prince.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,140
You might be able to endure this grievance,

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,660
but I cannot!

37
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,600
Don't go!

38
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,710
If you could successfully become the crown prince,

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,690
even if I have to die, I have no regrets.

40
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,330
But we can't fight against the empress.

41
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,850
We can't fight against the Gao family.

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,850
I'm afraid, in the end, even you...

43
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,430
Mother, we're talking about the owner of the Eastern Palace, the position of the crown prince!

44
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,220
It is the world!

45
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,770
All that power is just an illusion.

46
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:53,390
Staying alive is the most important thing.

47
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,030
Right, the situation right now is special.

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,340
The empress will surely not want to create any problems.

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,680
She won't be pushing us to our deaths. We still have room to turn around.

50
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,570
Go! Go ask His Imperial Majesty for a fief.

51
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:13,130
You and I... will leave the capital in peace.

52
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,970
Okay, Wen'er?

53
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,330
Promise me.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Promise me!

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,150
I'm begging you, Wen'er.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,740
Imperial Father,

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,970
I am not intelligent. It would be difficult for me to assist you in making any progress in political affairs.

58
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,640
I am willing to take my mother with me to go and remain guarding in the Shu Region.

59
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,440
I hope Imperial Father can fulfill my wish.

60
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,480
The Shu Region is indeed a good place.

61
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
It hasn't ever been placed under anyone's supervision.

62
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,740
You are well suited to go there.

63
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,820
I approve.

64
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,130
I...

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,190
thank you, Imperial Father.

66
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,420
Look!

67
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,770
Let's go!

68
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,620
Hold it carefully.

69
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,680
This one is pretty!

70
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,720
My Lady, why don't we go look somewhere else?

71
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,610
- Okay. Let's go and look!
- Yes.

72
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,220
Look and see if they have left or not!

73
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,550
Boss, we don't want it. I'll give it back to you. Thanks.

74
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,110
Hurry!

75
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,160
Hold it carefully.

76
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,420
Let's go up there and look.

77
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,500
How much are you selling this for?

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,980
Sorry, we don't want it anymore.

79
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,060
Hurry! Hurry!

80
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
It's so pretty!

81
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,750
Is she gone?

82
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,650
Scrolls.

83
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,490
She's gone! She's gone!

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,020
Go!

85
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,240
This one is pretty.

86
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,100
Where does she want to go?

87
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,300
Move over. Move over.

88
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,490
Move over!

89
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,860
Your Imperial Highness Prince Yi.

90
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,970
Ninth Princess, did you want to see me so badly that you followed Sese all the way here?

91
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,100
Who said that? How would I know that she came out to meet with you?

92
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,920
Scrolls.

93
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,280
I just accidentally came here while browsing around.

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,800
Oh, Lady Zhao is here! What a coincidence!

95
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,730
Let's go.

96
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,790
- Your Highness Princess.
- Lady Zhao.

97
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,750
- Prince Yi.
- Sese.

98
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,710
Today, I came out because... I...

99
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,520
wanted to browse around the cloth shops.

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,540
I've noticed that Lady Zhao's clothes are very pretty. So, I wanted to ask if you would join me.

101
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,330
Is Prince Yi willing to lend your Lady Zhao to me?

102
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,330
I can't make decisions for Sese.

103
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,190
You should ask her if she wants to or not.

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,740
I'm willing to be at your service.

105
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,200
- That's great! So...
- Fine.

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,650
I won't take part in a lady's hobby anymore.

107
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,700
- Let's go then.
- Okay.

108
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,660
[The Country Is Prosperous and People Are at Peace]

109
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,660
Lady Sese, come over here.

110
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:40,220
I think this outfit goes well with your skin tone. What's it called?

111
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,790
A dress made of colorful zhuanghua satin with clouds and falling snow embroidery and silk embroidered with flowers and butterflies.

112
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,620
Right. A silk dress embroidered with flowers and butterflies. It fits you so well.

113
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,810
Look to see if you like it or not.

114
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,730
Sese, you look very pretty in this pink outfit.

115
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,330
This one looks better with your skin tone compared to the bright red outfit you wore before.

116
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:59,570
Your Imperial Highness doesn't like bright red?

117
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,300
Every time I see bright red, my heart feels tight and uncomfortable.

118
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,930
In my manor, there aren't any objects that are bright red either.

119
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,940
It might be because I've seen too much blood on the Western Border.

120
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,620
I don't like red.

121
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,890
Red is so pretty!

122
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,740
I think red suits your beautiful appearance.

123
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,720
I'll go into the fitting room with you so you can try it on.

124
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,010
Try it on?

125
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,820
Okay.

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,460
Okay! Would you please, Xiaowei?

127
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,760
Okay. Let's do it.

128
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,250
Come on.

129
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,190
Ninth Princess, what are you doing?

130
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,650
I'm helping you take off your clothes.

131
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,160
Princess, you are of precious status. How can I trouble you into helping me?

132
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,910
Jin'er, come in and help me change!

133
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,060
Jin'er, no need to! It's not inconvenient for me.

134
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,760
- You don't have to, Your Highness!
- No, no! It's not inconvenient for me!

135
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
- No need to do this, Princess.
- Lady Zhao, it's really not inconvenient.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,750
- No need, Princess. Jin'er! Jin'er!
- Lady Zhao, it's really not inconvenient.

137
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,860
- Jin'er! Jin'er!
- My Lady!
- Lady Zhao! Lady Zhao!

138
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,220
- Just let me do it, Lady Zhao!
- What are you doing?!

139
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,070
- Lady Zhao!
- Let go of me!

140
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,360
Lady Zhao!

141
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,580
Ninth Princess, what are you doing?

142
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,930
I'll be frank. I just want to see the wolf tooth you have.

143
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,550
What wolf tooth?

144
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,130
It's the one that you wore before.

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,790
Ninth Princess, why do you think so highly of this wolf tooth?

146
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,060
It's a symbol of my grandfather's hometown. It looks very familiar.

147
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,770
Could you let me see it again?

148
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,150
I have too many accessories,

149
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,530
- I don't remember wearing a wolf tooth.
- How could you not remember?

150
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,160
I have some things to do today so I can't accompany you anymore.

151
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
Jin'er.

152
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,540
Lady Zhao! Lady Zhao!

153
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,150
Grandfather and you are the people that treat me the best in the world.

154
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,180
In the future, I will treat you even better than your grandfather.

155
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,330
Then, you can't betray me.

156
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,010
How could I?

157
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,740
If I do, you can punish me however you want.

158
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,660
If you betray me,

159
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,800
I will go drink the water of the River of Oblivion and forget you forever.

160
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,950
Who do I want to forget?

161
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,360
Who are you?

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,440
- Who do I want to forget?
- Who do you want to forget?

163
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,610
You scared me to death!

164
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,380
If I knew that in your dreams, you were this good in saying romantic words,

165
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,850
I wouldn't have put so much effort to handle your love life.

166
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,740
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,890
Today is the 15th.

168
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,830
Yesterday, Yongning asked Imperial Great-Grandmother for permission to go and see the lanterns outside.

169
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,760
Lanterns?

170
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,290
Plus, I will have Prince Yi

171
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,530
and General Pei Zhao to accompany us.

172
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,820
Great! Great! I haven't seen the Li Empire's lanterns yet!

173
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,730
- Let's go.
- Go! Go! Go!

174
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,710
Hurry, Luoxi!

175
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,780
Your Imperial Highness.

176
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,390
Fifth Brother.

177
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,550
Pei Zhao greets the three princesses.

178
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,100
General Pei.

179
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,330
Let's go.

180
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,160
Xiaofeng, what do you think about my fifth brother.

181
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,490
What do you mean?

182
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,760
I'm asking... what do you think about him?

183
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
I don't know.

184
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,590
Don't know?

185
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,480
You're almost about to get married to my fifth brother.

186
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
How could you not know?

187
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,240
Why is it him?

188
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,550
The battle for the crown prince is now only between my fourth and fifth brother.

189
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,000
My fourth brother has been cowardly ever since he was born.

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,360
So, everyone in the palace is leaning towards one side right now.

191
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,900
They all bet that my fifth brother will become the crown prince.

192
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,140
Xiaofeng, in about ten more days, you are going to be a bride.

193
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,390
Sister Yongning is doing this

194
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,120
because she wants you and my fifth brother to start developing your relationship.

195
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,750
[The Country Is Prosperous and People Are at Peace]

196
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,680
Small items!

197
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,590
Come look!

198
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,620
Look at this.

199
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,660
This too.

200
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,520
I really like it.

201
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,240
Today is the Spring Lantern Festival.

202
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,990
Are you planning on staying here all day?

203
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,760
You really don't want to wander the street with me.

204
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,680
What kind of role are you here as?

205
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,220
His godson? A customer of Singing Jade Brothel?

206
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,360
Or...

207
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,280
Your friend.

208
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,750
No matter what happened before, we are still friends. Right?

209
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,860
I don't want to see you depressed.

210
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,860
Mingyue, let's not talk about bothersome matters today.

211
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,790
I've been in Shangjing for so long,

212
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,090
but I haven't seen the busy markets before.

213
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,630
You can act like your just accompanying me. How about that?

214
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,340
Come in and have a look.

215
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,530
Buy one.

216
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,620
How about you look, too?

217
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,900
Take a look.

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,870
Mister.

219
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,890
Take a look.

220
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,650
Luoxi, didn't you want to go to Weipin Pavilion? We'll go now.

221
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,310
- Xiaofeng, you don't have to come with us.
- I...

222
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,680
Let my fifth brother accompany you.

223
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,000
General Pei, you escort us over.

224
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,340
Let's go, Luoxi.

225
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,120
Fifth Brother, you have to take good care of Xiaofeng.

226
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,500
- Yongning! Luoxi!
- We're leaving.

227
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,590
Then let's go, too.

228
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,050
Great!

229
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,960
When you and Sese were looking through the clothing shop the other day, you bought this outfit?

230
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,090
Do you think I look pretty?

231
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,190
Before, I didn't really like bright red,

232
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,410
but you look really pretty in it.

233
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,710
Do you want to eat a sugar figurine?

234
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,830
But I didn't bring any money.

235
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,780
Oh no! I didn't bring any money either.

236
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,580
Normally, Shi'en is in charge of my coin purse. I forgot it today.

237
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,670
It's okay. Let's go.

238
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,740
Okay!

239
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,650
Amazing!

240
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,480
That's impressive!

241
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,550
Amazing!

242
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,580
Amazing!

243
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,770
I have an idea. Let's go.

244
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,150
[Weipin Pavilion]

245
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,810
Look.

246
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,540
Yongning, do you think we rushed it too much?

247
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,360
The crown prince hasn't even been announced yet.

248
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,370
Don't worry.

249
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,610
I think Fifth Brother and Xiaofeng are a good match.

250
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,520
Plus, Xiaofeng's face was blushing a moment ago.

251
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,930
It was as red as this rouge.

252
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,230
Then, the girl you two are talking about must be an unbelievable beauty.

253
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,000
My store's rouge

254
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,590
is made from rare safflower petals that grow only in the Rouge Mountains of Xi State.

255
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,460
They were grounded and mashed up to make that.

256
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,660
Whoever wears it will look beautiful but not seductive.

257
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,340
Xi State.

258
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,810
Isn't Xi State Xiaofeng's home?

259
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,770
Luoxi, Xiaofeng has been in Shangjing for so long.

260
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,010
She must miss home. We'll gift this to her.

261
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,290
Xiaowei, pack this for me.

262
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,840
All right.

263
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,970
I wonder how well she and Fifth Brother are getting along now.

264
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,800
Let's not worry about that.

265
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,850
This rouge shouldn't be the only thing we buy from here today.

266
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,200
Come. Look.

267
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,900
Come and take a look!

268
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,070
All the elders and fellow citizens of Shangjing!

269
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,010
The best sword dance performance that can be seen in Shangjing is about to begin!

270
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,760
For those with money, please spare some for us! For those without, please watch and spare us some applause!

271
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,570
- We show respect to you all!
- Showing respect to everyone!

272
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,110
Good! Good!

273
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,790
He has some capability.

274
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:57,100
Good! Good! Good!

275
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,590
That's right!

276
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,630
Good! Good! Good!

277
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,200
Amazing!

278
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,960
Here! Here! Thank you, audience members! Thank you!

279
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,810
If you have money, please spare it!

280
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:17,000
Thank you! Thank you, audience members!

281
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,090
Thank you!

282
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,130
My Lady, look at this lantern! It's so pretty!

283
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,160
My Lady, look! Look!

284
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,360
Good! Good! Good!

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,470
Good! Good! Good!

286
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,420
Amazing!

287
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,040
One more time!

288
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Thank you, everyone! Thank you!

289
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,280
This is mine.

290
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,120
Here! Here!

291
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,220
Thank you, audience members!

292
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,160
Amazing!

293
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,440
All right!

294
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,690
Thank you, shopkeeper.

295
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,680
Hurry up and count it. We have enough this time, right?

296
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,050
We have enough! So many coins!

297
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,330
- Let's go buy sugar figurines then.
- Okay! Let's go!

298
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,940
Wait a minute.

299
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,750
Your sword dance was pretty good.

300
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,700
Thank you.

301
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,260
Come.

302
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,640
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

303
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,520
- Amazing! Amazing!
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

304
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,300
- Good! Good!
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

305
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,770
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

306
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,770
- Amazing! 
♫ A long dream ♫

307
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,260
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

308
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:32,370
- Amazing! 
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return  ♫

309
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,750
Shopkeeper, give me two sugar figurines.

310
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,810
- I have to pay.
- Oh...

311
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,910
I... I will wait for you over there then.

312
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,720
Your Imperial Highness!

313
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,120
Sese.

314
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,130
I guessed that you would be here! Sure enough, I got to see you!

315
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,380
What a coincidence. You're here, too.

316
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,900
Sorry.

317
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,330
What are you looking for?

318
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,680
Ninth Princess was over there with me before.

319
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,180
I just turned my back for a second and she's gone.

320
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,690
Then, I'll help you find her.

321
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,640
All right. Let's go then.

322
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,760
Is this pretty, Brother Gu?

323
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,120
Xiaofeng!

324
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
Sister Mingyue, you're here, too!

325
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,620
Xiaofeng.

326
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,410
Gu Jian.

327
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,950
Why are you alone?

328
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,290
I...

329
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,450
Xiaofeng!

330
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,950
My friends are here to find me! You two have fun!

331
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,240
I'm going now.

332
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,350
Don't worry, Your Highness.

333
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,390
It must have been too crowded before.

334
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:16,200
That's why the princess got separated from you.

335
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,530
Once it gets later, there will be fewer people,

336
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,370
so we will be able to find the princess.

337
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,100
- But—
- Your Highness!

338
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:30,130
I know that you are bent on obtaining the position of the crown prince.

339
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,420
And Ninth Princess will surely become the crown princess consort later.

340
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,480
I'm happy that you are able to fulfill your wish.

341
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:44,390
I also know that you can't do as you please in that position.

342
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,140
I won't ask Your Highness for a title.

343
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,360
I just wish that Your Highness will always keep me in your heart.

344
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,540
Sese...

345
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,940
Fifth Brother! Fifth Brother!

346
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,130
Yongning!

347
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:58,320
General Pei, thank you for accompanying us today.

348
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,640
It's my duty.

349
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,860
General Pei, what do you do when you're not on duty?

350
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,380
I read military books at home.

351
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,560
Read military books? What kind of military books do you read?

352
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,070
I read everything.

353
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,130
General Pei, could you lend me some of your military books next time?

354
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,660
Okay.

355
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,770
That lantern is so pretty, General Pei!

356
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,330
Let's go buy it.

357
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,140
- Sure. I'll buy one for you.
- Okay.

358
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,550
Xiaofeng, don't worry too much.

359
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,140
That Zhao Sese can't pretend to be gentle and kind for the rest of her life.

360
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,710
My fifth brother will discover how good you are sooner or later.

361
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,840
What are you talking about? There's nothing like that.

362
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,170
No matter how much Zhao Sese is liked by my fifth brother right now,

363
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,360
you will be the only crown princess consort.

364
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,070
Furthermore, the wedding will take place in ten days.

365
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,510
You just wait happily to become a bride.

366
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

367
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,510
I'm not the one that your fifth brother wants to marry.

368
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,600
I don't want to force someone who has another person in his heart.

369
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,010
My Crown Princess Consort. My Future Sister-in-Law.

370
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,180
Why don't you look at it in a more positive way?

371
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,450
Marrying my fifth brother is better than marrying my fourth brother who blushes once you start talking.

372
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,670
I heard that the guesthouse of the Court of State Ceremonials is filled with envoys and ambassadors from different countries.

373
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,130
They are all here to celebrate your marriage.

374
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,770
That Zhao Sese won't ever have this honor.

375
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,400
Did you say envoys from different states?

376
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,550
Where do they live?

377
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,100
In the guesthouse of the Court of State Ceremonials.

378
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,810
Then, can I see envoys from the Xi State then?

379
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,930
Since we are outside the palace today, I'll go check it out.

380
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,320
Xiaofeng, you can't go.

381
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,080
It's too crowded today. It would be too dangerous for you to go alone.

382
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,560
On top of it, everyone in the guesthouse are men.

383
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,900
It's inconvenient for you to go there.

384
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,810
Then, I'll go another day.

385
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,410
Say, I have already written so many letters to Xi State,

386
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,220
but I have not received a single reply.

387
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,680
My marriage will be happening soon.

388
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,570
Is my father going to send me off during the ceremony or not?

389
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,670
Or is it because he does not agree to this marriage?

390
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:13,640
If he disagrees, he should send a letter saying so then.

391
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,440
Okay already. I can see that you are tired, too.

392
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,780
Go and rest earlier today, okay?

393
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,520
Who is it?

394
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,420
You're done sending Mingyue back to her place?

395
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,840
Today, you look a bit unhappy.

396
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,930
I'm not.

397
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,920
I only see Mingyue as a little sister.

398
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,730
Do not misunderstand.

399
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,600
I did not misunderstand.

400
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,390
I am unhappy not because of the two of you.

401
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,970
And besides, you are both very good friends of mine.

402
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,680
If you two are really together, I would be so happy.

403
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,880
If today was traded for the past, you would definitely have complained.

404
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,670
Back in Xi State,

405
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,770
one time you were on the streets shopping

406
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,760
and chanced upon Dimo and me at a hairpin store.

407
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,650
At that time, you were so mad that you immediately turned and ran away,

408
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,910
telling me that you did not want to see me for the rest of your life.

409
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,000
After that, you did not speak to me for three entire days.

410
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,470
Actually, that time, I had Dimo accompany me to pick out a gift for you.

411
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,510
In the end, after I gave you the gift,

412
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,390
I spent a lot of effort until I was able to stop you from being mad at me.

413
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,630
So, today on the street, after bumping into you,

414
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,950
I was very worried that you would be mad.

415
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,630
I do not remember anymore.

416
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,350
I do not remember any of the things you just said.

417
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,380
I also do not remember you.

418
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,620
The only one left is the fourth prince.

419
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,000
Your Imperial Highness,

420
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,770
now is the most critical time.

421
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,760
We should just sit tight.

422
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,560
The more anxious you feel,

423
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,480
the easier it is to reveal your weakness.

424
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,030
Why not wait for the fourth prince to make his move first?

425
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,950
Your Highness, Prince Yi is here.

426
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,630
Prince Yi arrives!

427
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:49,030
- Fourth Elder Brother.
- Fifth Younger Brother.

428
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,520
Please take a seat.

429
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,560
I guessed it right. You're playing chess against yourself.

430
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,960
This chess game...

431
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,690
I just like spending time in messing about on the chess game.

432
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,640
What brings you here?

433
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,960
Fourth Brother, I'm here to bring you a gift.

434
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,550
Your gift must be something precious.

435
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,250
It is not something precious.

436
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,190
I see that in your manor, you don't lack any priceless treasures.

437
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,820
Therefore, today I specifically bring you an unusual gift.

438
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,730
Fourth Brother, do you still remember this bow?

439
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,870
This is...

440
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,680
I remember when I was young,

441
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,320
before Imperial Father taught archery to all the brothers, he would make them learn how to make bows first.

442
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,400
The back of this bow was polished by Elder Brother. The bow face was made by Second Brother.

443
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,070
And this bowstring. It was the best bowstring selected by Third Brother.

444
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,180
I remember back then,

445
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,390
you insisted on practicing with this heavy bow and hurt yourself accidentally.

446
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,870
And so all the brothers gifted this bow to me.

447
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,290
I've been taking the utmost care in safeguarding it.

448
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:23,080
And now... Elder Brother is dead.

449
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,500
Imperial Father sentenced Second Brother to death.

450
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,080
Third Brother has left for the Shu Region.

451
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,050
Among all the brothers, only you and I are here.

452
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,280
I'm returning this bow to you.

453
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,050
I hope in the future, we will help and support one another, love and respect each other as good brothers should.

454
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,240
What makes you bring up the past?

455
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,930
Congratulations, Fourth Brother! You will soon enter and host the Eastern Palace.

456
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,820
Me?

457
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,430
Imperial Father, I've been sickly since I was little.

458
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,050
I would like to relocate to the south to recuperate.

459
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,390
I hope Imperial Father will allow it.

460
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,670
Jiangnan (or the area south of the river) is indeed a good place.

461
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:07,350
You have a gentle personality and like literature.

462
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,170
That area is very suitable for you.

463
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,990
You are given permission.

464
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,850
Thank you, Imperial Father.

465
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:48,570
Chengyin, see if you can taste what herbal medicines are inside this tea.

466
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,240
Shoeblackplant?

467
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,290
Correct.

468
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,240
It's a medicine of a cold nature

469
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,340
and is used to eliminate fiery heat.

470
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,380
Oftentimes, I have too much heat inside me.

471
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,460
I will use this flower to alleviate it.

472
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,390
Imperial Father, I actually think when you're overheated,

473
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,070
you shouldn't use cold-natured medicine, for it will scatter all the heat.

474
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,100
Then, I'll ask you this.

475
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,940
What if there is a treacherous minister

476
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,790
making the nation stagnant with stifled heat,

477
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:04,050
shouldn't you use cold-natured medicine

478
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,660
to immediately dampen and eliminate it?

479
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,290
Imperial Father,

480
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,980
if such a treacherous minister has stifled the nation,

481
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,260
it means he has damaged the core spirit of our state.

482
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:23,780
Then, we should take a page from traditional medicine to gradually cure it and not agitate him in one go,

483
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,530
to prevent excessive treatment which can leave permanent damage.

484
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,780
Good!

485
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,370
Kneel!

486
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:29,160
His Imperial Majesty has a decree. Fifth Prince, listen to your conferment.

487
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,430
"In the past, King Shun banished the four banes and contributed outstanding achievements.

488
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,800
There are seven virtues when it comes to using force, for you to settle the citizens down.
(by King Zhuang of Zhu, one of the five hegemonies: no violence, avoid wars, build strength, stabilize victory, steady society, unity, economic progress)

489
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,390
Since time immemorial, there are meritorious people who received fortuity from the gods.
(by King Zhuang of Zhu, one of the five hegemonies: no violence, avoid wars, build strength, stabilize victory, steady society, unity, economic progress)

490
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,180
Those who hold high righteousness becomes the master of the cosmos.

491
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,760
I now proclaim Chengyin, the fifth prince, the honor of having legitimate rule over the dragon building (Imperial Palace).

492
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,260
He has luminously shown the qualities of being the master of the crown prince residence.

493
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,760
He should receive a grand ceremony. He must practice great kindness and perfect morality.

494
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,530
He is being conferred the position of Crown Prince.

495
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,430
The Ministry of Rites is ordered to select a lucky date for an official ceremony.

496
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,910
All of the aforementioned decrees are to be enforced now!"

497
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,210
Bow!

498
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,500
Confer the scroll!

499
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,940
Confer the treasures!

500
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,870
Bow! Thank the graces of His Imperial Majesty again!

501
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,840
Rise.

502
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,130
Congratulate!

503
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:34,670
Long live Your Imperial Majesty for tens of thousands of years!

504
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,320
Long live Crown Prince for thousands of years!

00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:41,320
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

524
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:47,960
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

525
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:54,780
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

526
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,130
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

527
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:11,340
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

528
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,720
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

529
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,050
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

530
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:20,110
♫ A long dream ♫

531
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,790
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

532
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:32,000
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

533
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,810
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

534
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:40,470
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

535
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:43,530
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

536
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:47,190
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

537
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,040
♫ Time reverses ♫

538
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,130
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

539
00:46:54,130 --> 00:47:01,300
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

540
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,470
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

541
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:07,140
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

542
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,210
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

543
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,790
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

544
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,610
♫ Time reverses ♫

545
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:20,840
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

546
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:28,050
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

547
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:34,610
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

548
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:42,090
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
