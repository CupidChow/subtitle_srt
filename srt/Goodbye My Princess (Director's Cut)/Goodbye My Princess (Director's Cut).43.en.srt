00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,660
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,460
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,900
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,530
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,220
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,200
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,940
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,710
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,800
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,700
[Episode 43]

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,960
Here.

18
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,950
A'Du, you are not allowed to leave me again. You are not allowed to make me worry.

19
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,400
You must recover soon. When you feel better, we can go to Mi Luo Drinking House to drink.

20
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,800
Head of Court of Judicial Review Wang Shu greets Crown Princess Consort.

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,160
I am here by the emperor's request to

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,600
investigate the attempted assassination of the crown prince.

23
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,290
Miss A'Du fought with the assassin.

24
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,420
I want to ask her a few questions.

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
A'Du, will you be able to?

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,590
Go ahead, Official Wang.

27
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,950
Yes.

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,460
Did you clearly see the assassin's face the night of the assassination?

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,430
Your Imperial Majesty, Miss A'Du said the assassin

30
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,240
was the empress' lady-in-waiting...

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Rongshuang.

32
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,220
[Rongshuang]

33
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,650
- Search!
- Yes!

34
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,260
What are you doing?!

35
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,420
Empress, I came under the order of the emperor to arrest the assassin. Sorry, if I will be offending you greatly. Arrest her!

36
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,800
No! Preposterous! Who dares to touch her!

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,220
What proof do you have that Rongshuang is the assassin?

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,400
- The witness A'Du woke up and identified Rongshuang as the assassin. Take her away!
- Go! Go! Hurry!

39
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,500
- No, you can't! Let go of Rongshuang!
- Empress! Empress!

40
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
- Let Rongshuang go!

41
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,080
Empress, you need to take care of yourself! Empress!

42
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,900
- Let Rongshuang go!
- Empress!

43
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,570
Empress, take care of yourself!

44
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,620
- Let her go! Let go of Rongshuang! Let her go!
- Empress!

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,820
Imperial Doctor Wang, why hasn't the crown prince woken up yet?

46
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,160
Was the medication I gave you not effective?

47
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,820
Please forgive me Crown Princess Consort. I studied the medication.

48
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,500
This medication can help the wound heal quickly, but it is too strong.

49
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,160
The crown prince is a person of eminence.

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,780
We don't dare to use the medication on the crown prince.

51
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,800
You don't dare to use it? What time is it already? Are you all just going to watch him lay right there?

52
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,290
My life is also at risk if I'm unable to cure the crown prince.

53
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,090
Give me the medicine. If there are any consequences, I'll bear them!

54
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,100
This...

55
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,300
Crown Princess Consort! This...

56
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,720
Give it to me!

57
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,230
[Rongshuang]

58
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,920
Are you still not confessing?

59
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,470
I don't know when I offended the crown princess consort's lady-in-waiting.

60
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,600
Why would she frame me?

61
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,670
Your Imperial Majesty! That female servant from Xi State has only been in the palace for a year!

62
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:50,300
How can we believe her words? Rongshuang has been by my side all these years. She would never do such a thing!

63
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,190
I saw the crown prince grow up. Why would I want to assassinate him?

64
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,870
Do you think the crown prince and Miss A'Du would use their lives to frame you?

65
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,210
If it wasn't you, then you were ordered by someone.

66
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,900
Tell me! Who ordered you to assassinate the crown prince?

67
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,090
If you still don't confess, I will be using torturous means.

68
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,760
Chengyin is my son! Why would I kill him?

69
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,400
When Chengyin wakes up, we'll know why you wanted to kill him then.

70
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,790
Until we figure out the situation, you stay in Clean and Peaceful Palace!

71
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,330
Your Imperial Majesty!

72
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,500
The empress wants to assassinate the crown prince? Why?

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,900
All the information in the palace has been sealed off. Even I have no way of knowing things.

74
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,750
Does Ruyi not know either?

75
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,710
Sister is focusing on her pregnancy right now.

76
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,750
We shouldn't let her be bothered by these things for it might affect her pregnancy.

77
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,360
Father,

78
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,900
should we intervene in this matter and protect the empress?

79
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:11,330
Protect the empress? The empress is no longer of one mind with us.

80
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,470
Assassinating the crown prince is a crime punishable by death.

81
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:18,600
It's wiser to preserve ourselves. Let's not meddle in this trouble.

82
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,460
Moreover, my Ruyi is pregnant.

83
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,310
Why would we still keep that worthless chess piece?

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,730
Send some gifts to the palace for Ruyi.

85
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,110
Yes.

86
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,500
Imperial Physician Wang, the crown prince's fever won't break and he keeps throwing up the medication.

87
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,760
Crown Princess Consort, the medication is too strong.

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,990
His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince is asthenic and cold. I fear that...

89
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:03,000
he can't bear it. We all are at our wit's end.

90
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,030
I understand. You are all dismissed.

91
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,400
Yes.

92
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,750
Li Chengyin, rest assured.

93
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,490
If you die, I will die alongside you.

94
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,330
The person you wish to see the most...

95
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,410
should be her, right?

96
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,310
Just hold on for a little longer. I will get her for you.

97
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,350
I beg you to let me out!

98
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,450
Let me see His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!

99
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,450
My Lady!

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,410
I will kneel to you all!

101
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,540
I just beg you to tell His Imperial Majesty and the empress

102
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,180
to let me see the crown prince!

103
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,320
After I come back, I will accept any punishment.

104
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,610
Even if you lock me up for one year,

105
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,610
three, five, ten years are all okay with me!

106
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,980
I just beg you to let me see His Imperial Highness just once!

107
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,210
- Crown Princess Consort.
- Just one glance!

108
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,910
I beg you all!

109
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,890
Jin'er, what should I do?

110
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,800
If His Imperial Highness suddenly dies,

111
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,570
I would not be able to live on.

112
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,390
My Lady...

113
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,290
If the empress should punish anyone for this, I will bear it all.

114
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,620
Let her out.

115
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,190
Yes.

116
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,620
My Lady.

117
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
Go see His Imperial Highness.

118
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,150
How is he?

119
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,470
Tell me!

120
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,340
What happened to him?!

121
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,180
He only wishes to see you right now.

122
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,130
My Lady! My Lady!

123
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,850
Crown Princess Consort.

124
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,430
You go inside.

125
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,210
But do not cry anymore.

126
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,300
Thank you, Crown Princess Consort.

127
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,290
Hurry and go in.

128
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,870
Crown Princess Consort, it is windy now. You should go back first.

129
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,090
Let Related Lady of Excellence Zhao stay here a bit longer.

130
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,920
With Lady Zhao here, he will definitely recover.

131
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,030
Your Imperial Highness...

132
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,950
Hurry and wake up. Hurry and wake up.

133
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,660
I beg you.

134
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,200
Hurry and wake up.

135
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,690
If you do not wake up, what will happen to me?

136
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,000
Your Imperial Highness...

137
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,750
Crown Princess Consort, it is not very good to let commoner Zhao stay here for too long.

138
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,120
Have her return to her palace earlier.

139
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,280
I will go in now.

140
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,480
Then, I will leave now.

141
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,180
The wind is actually this big...

142
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,450
Li Chengyin, people are really very strange sometimes.

143
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,520
Before, whenever we saw each other, we would argue.

144
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,550
The only thing I would think about was how much you angered me.

145
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,900
But now that you are lying here in front of me,

146
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,000
my eyes are only filled with all the good deeds you did to me.

147
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,550
Actually, I did not hate you from the moment I saw you.

148
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,620
I still remember that day

149
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,570
when Yongniang told me that you would soon become the crown prince.

150
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,370
I was actually quite happy,

151
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:57,360
even though I knew back then that the person you liked was Lady Zhao.

152
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,880
And then not long after that,

153
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,720
I heard about how you attacked Danchi.

154
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,490
I really wanted to kill you with a slash of a sword.

155
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,080
Do you still remember the night we married?

156
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,260
You were in front of me.

157
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,060
I looked at you.

158
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,330
And in my heart I thought,

159
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,050
"Should I just stab and kill you now?"

160
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:42,680
I hated you, but I hated myself even more.

161
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,650
I hated that I could not do it.

162
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,160
I hated myself for I seemed to have liked you a bit.

163
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,870
Hurry and wake up, okay?

164
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,750
What you said is right.

165
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,730
I am quite afraid of being a young widow.

166
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,680
In Xi State, the women whose husbands that had died,

167
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,990
had to marry their husband's younger brother.

168
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,080
But if you really die like this,

169
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,890
who else would I be able to marry?

170
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,160
How can I marry someone else?

171
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,270
Won't I really become a young widow for the rest of my life?

172
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,460
I also have a secret I have not told you yet.

173
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,790
When I was young, Lady Mingyuan taught me words from the Central Plains, but no matter what, I just could not learn them.

174
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,580
After I came here, it was still the same.

175
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,130
All I did was mechanically copy each and every stroke.

176
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,380
For example, your name.

177
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,020
The "yin" from Li Chengyin.

178
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,510
At first, I thought it was read as "qin."

179
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,820
I heard that the people of the Central Plains are very particular about naming their children.

180
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,540
What does your character, "yin," mean?

181
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,910
- Yin State.
- Yin State.

182
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,790
The founder of the dynasty

183
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,540
was originally from Yin State.

184
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,140
It is east of Central State and south of Liang State.

185
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,220
It is the place from where the dragon (symbol of the emperor) prevailed,

186
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,050
so...

187
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,520
that is why I am called "Chengyin."

188
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,000
I am not dreaming! I am not dreaming!

189
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,870
You are awake?

190
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,180
Li Chengyin, you are awake. Li Chengyin, you are awake.

191
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,450
You are awake. You are awake.

192
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,120
Hurry and summon the imperial physician! Shi'en, hurry and summon the imperial physician!

193
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,480
- What happened, Crown Princess Consort?
- What's wrong?

194
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,550
The crown prince is awake!

195
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,510
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince! Your Highness!

196
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,890
Your Highness!

197
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,770
Do not cry.

198
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,370
Crown Princess Consort, do not cry.

199
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,730
Everything is fine now.

200
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,480
Your Imperial Highness, you are awake?

201
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,080
Your Highness.

202
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,120
Sese,

203
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,650
why did you come here?

204
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,850
It was Crown Princess Consort who let me come.

205
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,900
She wanted me to stay and be by your side.

206
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,990
I am fine now.

207
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,050
His Imperial Majesty has arrived!

208
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,820
You are all dismissed.

209
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,550
Yes.

210
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,080
Imperial Father.

211
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,610
How are you?

212
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,660
I am a lot better now.

213
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,760
A'Du has already identified who tried to assassinate you.

214
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,120
It was the empress' servant, Rongshuang.

215
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,190
What do you mean?

216
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,860
You still remember this jade pendant, right?

217
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,910
This was left by my biological mother.

218
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,110
Originally, this jade pendant only had one half.

219
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:03,920
The other half was given to me by Aunt Mingyuan when I went to Xi State.

220
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,270
At her deathbed, Aunt Mingyuan told me

221
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,820
that the person who caused my mother to die

222
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,270
was the empress.

223
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,250
Rongshuang, how dare you be so extremely bold as to assassinate the crown prince?!

224
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,660
His Imperial Majesty is here now. What more have you got to say?

225
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,330
Your Imperial Majesty, Rongshuang has been framed.

226
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,950
It was not me. It really was not me.

227
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,550
I really did not try to assassinate the crown prince! I plead for Your Imperial Majesty to give me justice!

228
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:46,720
The evidence is here. It is irrefutable.

229
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,390
Tell me! Who was it who ordered you to assassinate the crown prince?

230
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,010
No one ordered me.

231
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,560
The person I wanted to murder was not the crown prince,

232
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,360
but... but the crown princess consort.

233
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,510
The crown princess consort is barbaric and unreasonable. She treated me disrespectfully on many occasions.

234
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,810
That is why I wanted to kill her.

235
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,400
You went to the crown prince's palace to assassinate the crown princess consort?

236
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,580
How did you know that the crown princess consort would be there?

237
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,060
I followed her there.

238
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,740
That is a bunch of nonsense!

239
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,510
I am really telling the truth! I would not dare to deceive His Imperial Majesty!

240
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:25,140
You do not dare betray your emperor?

241
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,650
Let me ask you one question.

242
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,320
Was it or was it not the empress who instigated you?

243
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,830
This affair has nothing to do with the empress!

244
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,260
Your Imperial Majesty, please do not listen to the slanders of villains!

245
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,670
The empress and you have had deep spousal relations for so many years.

246
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,470
Your Imperial Majesty, you must believe the empress!

247
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,790
The crown prince has already woken.

248
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,730
Your Imperial Majesty, has this case been thoroughly investigated?

249
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,690
It has nothing to do with Rongshuang, correct?

250
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,100
I'm asking you...

251
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,400
That year, when Pure Consort was being plotted against,

252
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,420
which we found out later that she had consumed lethal poison,

253
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,280
this poison... was it given by you?

254
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,030
It wasn't me. Your Imperial Majesty, please do not listen to the nonsense of those people around you.

255
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,680
Yuyao and you were close as sisters.

256
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,860
You even raised Chengyin to adulthood.

257
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,570
I have always thought that you were a magnanimous empress,

258
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,230
until...

259
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,470
Mingyuan told Chengyin the truth.

260
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,530
Only then did I know that.

261
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:26,060
I had kept a poisonous snake by my side.

262
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,420
Your Imperial Majesty...

263
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,540
Isn't it enough that you caused the death of Yuyao?

264
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,110
Today, you still try to kill Chengyin? You are really ruthless!

265
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,400
Your Imperial Majesty, we have been married for more than thirty years.

266
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,670
I never expected that in your heart,

267
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:51,440
I am held in such a deplorable opinion.

268
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,970
You have always been so deplorable!

269
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,700
I have never questioned you about anything in the inner palace, but it doesn't mean that I didn't know anything!

270
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,700
All this while, I thought that because you wanted to defend yourself,

271
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,070
that is why you came up with so many ploys.

272
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:16,090
If Chengyin can't even deal with all these, how is he worthy to assume the position of the emperor?

273
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,360
But I... never imagined that

274
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,780
you were actually someone who was insane and ridiculous!

275
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,570
You could even bear to kill your own son!

276
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,980
Your Imperial Majesty, I didn't do it!

277
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:43,240
How could I bear to kill Chengyin?

278
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,040
I love him more than anyone else!

279
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,200
If you do not believe me,

280
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,640
please have this case investigated thoroughly and return justice to me!

281
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,550
Stop acting!

282
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:58,250
Do you really want me to have you brought to the Court of Judicial Review and be interrogated before you'll confess?

283
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,670
For the sake of our married relationship of more than thirty years, I will not take your life!

284
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,840
Your Imperial Majesty, I have been falsely accused!

285
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,960
I am really being falsely accused!

286
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,570
I have already written the edict to abolish your empress status.

287
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,660
I will announce it at the imperial court tomorrow.

288
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,950
No, Your Imperial Majesty!

289
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:37,530
Even if you've written an edict, the chancellery won't promulgate it that soon.

290
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,380
And my uncle...

291
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,690
He would not just sit idly and be indifferent.

292
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,160
You still are putting your hope on that uncle of yours?

293
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,500
Lady of Brevy Gao is already pregnant.

294
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,750
She will be bestowed with the title of Noble Consort very soon.

295
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:56,720
One of you is a niece who has not given birth to a prince before,

296
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,900
the other is a daughter who is pregnant with the emperor's son.

297
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,600
Who do you think Prime Minister Gao will choose?

298
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,180
Your Imperial Majesty! Your Imperial Majesty!

299
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,420
I have always treated you wholeheartedly!

300
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,660
Go away! Get lost! What wholeheartedly?

301
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,680
If you treated me wholeheartedly, would you murder my most beloved woman

302
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,050
and kill your son?!

303
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:39,010
Up until now, everything was caused by yourself! You harmed yourself!

304
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,740
Now your uncle, your relatives, are all distancing themselves from you.

305
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,210
In the harem, there is no one left who will speak for you.

306
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,910
Even more so, no one will want to get close to you now because your palace maid has been caned to death!

307
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,090
However, you are still my wife. I will now give you two choices.

308
00:28:56,090 --> 00:29:01,250
Either, starting today, we will completely seal your palace and imprison you inside.

309
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,130
We'll get someone who's deaf and mute to bring your meals to you!

310
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,890
You will then spend the rest of your life in this manner!

311
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,300
Or...

312
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,490
I, Meiniang, have been betrothed to His Majesty since childhood.

313
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:50,380
Ever since I first laid eyes on you,

314
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,380
I have never had anyone else in my heart.

315
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,400
I know Your Imperial Majesty has always loved Pure Consort Gu.

316
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,460
But these many years,

317
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:12,460
you have always taken care of me with affection.

318
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:21,620
I only want to know,

319
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:32,550
if I was ever in your heart.

320
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,290
You know the answer in your heart.

321
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,590
No need to ask me.

322
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,410
Your Imperial Majesty!!

323
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,270
Empress of the Zhang clan is filled with resentment and brought disaster to the imperial harem.

324
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,800
She disobeyed the decree on numerous occasions, unable to appease and cherish the children of others.

325
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,310
If there's a sparrow hawk (ruthless and evil) in the inner palace,

326
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,210
there isn't any virtue of the ospreys (fair and moral),

327
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,950
but murderous actions like that of Empresses Lv and Huo (both are Han dynasty empresses).

328
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,210
She's not suitable to respectfully bear such grand worship.

329
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,330
Today, I'm ordering the Court of the Imperial Family to clean up the filth and fulfill their duty.

330
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,580
Today, the official seal of empress is being taken back from her.

331
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,640
For the sake that she has come into the palace and served for a long time,

332
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,290
she is spared the death sentence and will live in the side palace.

333
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:25,630
Until she dies, she will not be allowed out of it. End of decree!

334
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:06,240
[Clean and Peaceful Palace]

335
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,920
Who is it?

336
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,090
Chengyin? Is that you?

337
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,820
Who is it!

338
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,990
Is it Chengyin?

339
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,390
Chengyin? Is that you?

340
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,480
It's me.

341
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,680
Chengyin...

342
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,970
Back then,

343
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,700
it was indeed because of my selfish reasons

344
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,630
that I caused the death of your mother.

345
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:17,940
But these years, I treated you as my own and raised you with great care.

346
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,520
I placed all my heart and expectations on you.

347
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,180
I really wanted you to become the wise ruler of the future.

348
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,010
You're right.

349
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:35,920
These years, you did raise me with great care.

350
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,880
But all those things should have been given to me by my own mother!

351
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,600
You took my mother's life

352
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,270
and took away the happiness that should have belonged to me.

353
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,210
Do you know...

354
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,750
how much I hoped you wouldn't hire someone to assassinate me,

355
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,900
how much I hoped that you truly treated me as your son?

356
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,830
But I was wrong.

357
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,650
I was completely wrong.

358
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,950
This stab...

359
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,630
has woken me up.

360
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,550
Chengyin! Chengyin!

361
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:29,040
I was only a pawn to help protect your own position.

362
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,550
I was only a chip you used to retain Imperial Father's affections!

363
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,810
To you, my life meant nothing!

364
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,840
You never thought of me as your own son.

[Clean and Peaceful Palace]

366
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,950
I thank you for all the years that you've raised and cared for me.

367
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,860
Chengyin!

368
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,650
Chengyin!

369
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,030
With that stab, I've returned half a life to you.

370
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,800
We are cleared from any debts to each other now.

371
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,200
Chengyin!

372
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,130
From now onward, the fate we share as mother and son has come to an end.

373
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:58,690
Chengyin! Chengyin! Chengyin!

374
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,880
Chengyin! Chengyin, come back!

Come back, my son!

376
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,240
Chengyin! My son!

377
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,570
Come back!!

378
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,940
Please come back!

379

My son...

Reporting to Your Imperial Majesty, the empress...

381
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,590
Wrong... Commoner Zhang passed away just now.

382
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,990
Did she leave any last words?

383
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,440
None at all.

385
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,650
Shi‘en, please get up first.

386
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,210
Yes.

387
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,420
It's not that I do not want to go with you and visit him.

388
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,260
It's just that... in a time like this, it's useless no matter who visits him.

389
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,230
It's good for him to be quiet by himself.

390
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,700
But...

391
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,170
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to him.

392
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:23,410
He needs to be able to cry freely before this matter will pass.

393
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,780
Yes. You are the one who understands His Imperial Highness best. I'll believe in whatever you say.

Congratulations to My Lady for resuming the position of Related Lady of Excellence.

Your Imperial Highness, I can finally see you.

The hard times are finally over, and the good times are just beginning.

400
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,430
No one will separate us again.

401
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,400
You really suffered much during this period.

402
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,670
Your Imperial Highness, when you went through such life-threatening danger, I couldn't eat or sleep each day.

403
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:21,840
From now onward, I want to be with Your Imperial Highness in both life and death.
