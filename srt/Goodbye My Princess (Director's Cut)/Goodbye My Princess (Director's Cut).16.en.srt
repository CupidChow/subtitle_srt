00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,930
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,010
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,930
I've heard that you haven't been feeling well since your arrival at the capital. You've been sick for a long time.

4
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,140
Are you feeling better now?

5
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,240
Much better.

6
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,080
Then, are you getting used to the weather here?

7
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,710
It's fine... but...

8
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,640
sometimes I feel so bored.

9
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,570
Second Brother, we're here to see you for something.

10
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,370
What's the matter?

11
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,690
Tomorrow's hunting... Can you take us, too?

12
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,810
Hunting is for men. Why do you all want to go?

13
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,670
When we were young, Imperial Father took me and Luoxi along for mounted archery.

14
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,780
Besides, Xiaofeng is from Xi State, mounted archery is nothing difficult for her.

15
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,670
Second Brother, can you just take us along? We won't disgrace you.

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,070
Since all of you are so interested in going, I'll go ask Grand Empress Dowager

17
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,530
and Empress for a favor. I'll take you all there.

18
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,180
Thank you, Second Brother.

19
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,180
Oh right! Do you all have riding apparel?

20
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,330
[General of the Second Rank Manor]

21
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,720
Father. Elder Brother.

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,580
Father, do you like what I am wearing today?

23
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,100
In terms of beauty, no one can surpass my younger sister.

24
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,450
No wonder even the pure and innocent Prince Yi is so drawn to you.

25
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,980
Elder Brother.

26
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,120
Sese, don't get too close to Prince Yi.

27
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,670
I think Prince Xuande is an outstanding and promising young man.

28
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,540
Among all the princes, he is most likely to become crown prince.

29
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,100
Today's hunting is a great opportunity.

30
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,730
You need to find a way to get close to him.

31
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,030
Dad, I don't like Prince Xuande.

32
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,780
The one I like is His Highness Prince Yi.

33
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,480
In my life, I seek not to be splendid and wealthy,

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,290
but only to be with someone I love forever.

35
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,990
Dad, I also think His Highness Prince Yi is no less qualified than Prince Xuande.

36
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,400
His achievement was great in the war against Danchi.

37
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,110
He even decapitated a powerful man like the Khan of Danchi himself. His courage

38
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,770
is above everyone else.

39
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,140
Currently, the seat of the crown prince is still undecided.

40
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,860
I think Prince Yi has just as good a chance.

41
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,870
Why don't you let Sister get her wish?

42
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,930
You don't understand. Prince Yi is not the biological son of the empress.

43
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,220
Among his supporters is Prime Minister Gao, a power that worries the emperor.

44
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,970
How could His Imperial Majesty proclaim him as the crown prince

45
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,600
and let the faction of Prime Minister Gao monopolize the court's power?

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,210
Even if Prince Xuande was appointed as the crown prince, the ninth princess would definitely be the crown princess consort.

47
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,500
If Sister married Prince Xuande, she could only be a side consort.

48
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,620
Even if she was just a side consort, but when the crown prince is enthroned,

49
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,690
she would become the noble consort.

50
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,630
If she married Prince Yi and the crown prince position was decided,

51
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,880
I wouldn't know what place he would get exiled to.

52
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,900
Do you want your sister to suffer in a foreign land?

53
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,580
That's right.

54
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,480
You have been pampered since childhood. If you were being sent off to the borderland and had no one to take care of you,

55
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,670
we couldn't even see each other. How about just take Dad's advice.

56
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,110
Take Prince Xuande into consideration.

57
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,210
I won't.

58
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,800
- How do I look?
- Beautiful!

59
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,610
A'Du, let's go to the hunting today. Hurry and get changed.

60
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,230
Go!

61
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,590
Okay, if you don't want to change your clothes, that's fine.

62
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,430
Princess, usually in the palace,

63
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,400
A'Du is protected by Grand Empress Dowager and she can get away from any punishments.

64
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,890
But today's hunting, the emperor will be there, too.

65
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,410
If A'Du is dressed like this, it's really not proper.

66
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,520
Yongniang, did you forget that A'Du grew up in Danchi.

67
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,700
So it's quite normal that she's not used to the clothing from here.

68
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,260
Moreover, I don't think His Imperial Majesty would give her a hard time just because of her clothing, right?

69
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,830
- Let's go, A'Du.
- Ninth Princess, please spare me from the death penalty!

70
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,100
Li Empire is not like Xi State. Princess, you can't just do things as you please and ignore the propriety of both countries.

71
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,770
Since I took the order from Grand Empress Dowager to manage Embracing the Moon Pavilion,

72
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,270
for your sake and for the sake of everybody here,

73
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,110
I definitely won't let A'Du go today.

74
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,080
Yongniang, you...

75
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,060
Okay, don't go then.

76
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,170
Get up quickly, Yongniang.

77
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,540
Let me go now and I'll be back soon. Don't worry!

78
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,100
I'm leaving.

79
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,710
Second Brother.

80
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,470
Yongning and Luoxi are here.

81
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,520
Greetings, Third Brother and Fourth Brother.

82
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,120
Let me make the introductions.

83
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,900
This is the ninth princess of Xi State, Xiaofeng.

84
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,240
Greetings, Ninth Princess.

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,420
They are my third little brother, Prince Rong (glory), and fourth little brother, Prince Yun (just).

86
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,650
Greetings, Prince Rong and Prince Yun.

87
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,980
What are you looking at?

88
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,510
- Hurry and go.
- Let's go.

89
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,660
Where is fifth little brother?

90
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,670
He greeted us earlier.

91
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,840
General Zhao and his family are here, too.

92
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,600
He must be having a date with Lady Zhao now.

93
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,240
Second Brother, Imperial Father is still waiting for us at the Black Horse Palace to present our hunts.

94
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,740
Grand Empress Dowager will be here at around noon. Do we still wait for Fifth Brother?

95
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,760
In that case, let's not wait for him. Let's start our hunt in separate directions.

96
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,240
We'll meet here again before noon. Watch out for your safety.

97
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,850
Ninth Princess, it's dangerous in the woods and it's your first time hunting.

98
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,820
Why don't you enter the woods with me?

99
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,990
It's all right! I'll go look for Yongning and the others.

100
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,040
That uncultured woman doesn't know manners.

101
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,760
General Pei!

102
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,110
Let's go.

103
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,730
Greetings, Princesses.

104
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,150
General Pei, Luoxi cannot ride nor shoot. I'm pretty bad myself.

105
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,970
Will you teach Luoxi so that she won't get hurt?

106
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,930
General Pei.

107
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,040
- All right.
- Then, thank you.

108
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,520
Come here!

109
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,300
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

110
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,010
Sese!

111
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,320
- Your Highness, why are you here? Didn't they start the hunt already?
- I came to see you.

112
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,130
Why aren't you wearing riding clothes? Didn't we agree to hunt together?

113
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:03,300
I don't know how to ride or shoot. Father won't allow me to wear riding clothes.

114
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,300
I see. That's fine. You rest here.

115
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,850
I'll go catch a little rabbit for you later.

116
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,580
Thank you, Your Highness. But I'd rather ask you to be kind when you hunt.

117
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,550
Don't let them hurt too much.

118
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,730
All right, just wait for me.

119
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,170
This is strange. Why isn't there even a pheasant?

120
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,430
Did they all get scared away?

121
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,730
We'll be so embarrassed when we go back like this.

122
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,920
The woods are so vast. We'll see something.

123
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,940
Besides, with me around, you won't be empty-handed.

124
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,530
Xiaofeng, wait for me.

125
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,530
I remember you studied horseback riding when you were young.

126
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,700
Imperial Father taught me and Yongning when we were young.

127
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,900
But I am very rusty.

128
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,850
Okay.

129
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,830
Thank you, Brother Pei Zhao, for leashing my horse.

130
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,970
Your Highness, don't call me that. Just call me Pei Zhao.

131
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,970
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

132
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,800
Did you know this is the Imperial Forbidden Park? Regular people are forbidden to enter.

133
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,480
I am the ninth princess of Xi State.

134
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,930
So you are that ninth princess of Xi State.

135
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,720
The future crown princess consort of Li Empire.

136
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,370
It's good that you know.

137
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,920
If you are impudent to me, the Grand Empress Dowager won't let you off easily.

138
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,870
Why does such a nice girl just casually scare people like that?

139
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,460
Do you know who I am?

140
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,090
My father is the present emperor.

141
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,780
My father is a tea business owner.

142
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,690
My mother is the current empress.

143
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,180
My mother is the lady of a tea farm.

144
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,240
My grandfather is an ordinary tea merchant.

145
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,290
I am Xi State's Ninth Princess. My father is the king of Xi State.

146
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,500
My mother is the daughter of the Khan of Danchi.

147
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,120
Do you know who I am? I am Gu Xiaowu from the Central Plains.

148
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,450
Xiaowu!

149
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,760
I am the fifth prince of Li Empire, Li Chengyin.

150
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,970
Wake up!

151
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,630
Wake up!

152
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,260
Wake up!

153
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,480
Prince Xuande should return soon.

154
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,180
Sese, I will introduce you to Prince Xuande later.

155
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,490
You must do your best, do you hear?

156
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,080
- Today is really a carefree day.
- That's right.
- How did your hunt go?

157
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,440
I saw that one and shot it dead with one arrow.

158
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,620
Greetings, Prince Xuande.

159
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,600
Prince Xuande, this is my daughter Sese.

160
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,780
Sese, quickly greet the prince. Hurry.

161
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,400
Greetings, Prince Xuande.

162
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,560
Sese.

163
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,710
Prince Xuande, my daughter today especially—

164
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,220
Quickly get the imperial physician!

165
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,460
Hurry! Get the imperial physician!

166
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,490
Prince Yi?

167
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,490
Imperial physician! Quick!

168
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,510
- Get the imperial physician now!
- Yes.

169
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,380
- Get the imperial physician now!
- This...

170
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,980
She was fine earlier. Why did she suddenly faint?

171
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,440
Your Highness, don't worry. Ninth Princess just got scared.

172
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,960
She should be fine after some rest. I'll take my leave.

173
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,500
Who brought me back here?

174
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,400
It was my fifth brother. Luckily he found you, or we would have been so worried.

175
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,940
How is he? Is he all right?

176
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,250
He is fine. He already went to the banquet hall.

177
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,180
We should go, too.

178
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,740
Get some rest.

179
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,710
I'll tell Imperial Great Grandmother that you're ill. Don't force yourself.

180
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,400
For today's hunting, the results are out.

181
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,410
Second Prince has hunted ten pheasants,

182
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,750
two wild boar, two deer,

183
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:03,640
and five rabbits. Third Prince has hunted one deer,

184
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,460
and five rabbits. Fourth Prince has hunted one wild boar,

185
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,270
and five pheasants. Fifth Prince has hunted ten pheasants,

186
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,780
three wild boar, and five deer.

187
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,330
Today's hunting, the winner is Second Prince.

188
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,260
What a pity! If it wasn't because Fifth Brother had to go save Xiaofeng,

189
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,880
he probably would have hunted more animals than Second Brother.

190
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Fifth Brother doesn't like to compete, winning or losing is really not his concern.

191
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,690
The fun part of hunting is in the process, not the result.

192
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,090
All of you can give your game to anyone here.

193
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,770
Speak. To whom do you want to give your game?

194
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,110
- Chengwen, you go first.
- Yes.

195
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,520
Imperial Father, I plan to give my game

196
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,230
to my royal mother.

197
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,660
Your Imperial Majesty, Chengwen is naive. Your Imperial Majesty—

198
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,080
Who says he's naive? You have such a

199
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,110
filial son, you should be gratified.

200
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,720
Thank you, Imperial Father.

201
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,820
Chengyuan, speak.

202
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,710
I'd like to give my game to Grand Empress Dowager.

203
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,890
Wishing Imperial Great Grandmother good health and longevity.

204
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,800
Imperial Grandmother, this child is surely thoughtful.

205
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,640
He remembers his great grandmother.

206
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,740
I owe the honor all to Your Imperial Majesty.

207
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,700
Chengye, what about you?

208
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,310
I wish to dedicate my game

209
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,410
to Empress.

210
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,380
Imperial Father rules the country based on filial piety. Empress is the motherly model of the nation.

211
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,800
She is not only my mother but also the mother of all the citizens of the nation.

212
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,470
I, on behalf of the citizens of the nation, thank the empress' kindness.

213
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,920
Second Prince, you are overpraising me. Thank you for your love and devotion to me.

214
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,570
Your Imperial Majesty, I am curious,

215
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,160
to whom will Chengyin dedicate his game?

216
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,720
Chengyin, tell us quickly. Your Empress Mother can't wait.

217
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,780
I would like to fulfill the filial duty on behalf of my older brother. I dedicate my game

218
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,900
to his mother Noble Consort Hui.

219
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,560
Chengyin is thoughtful.

220
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,310
Then let Prince Yi's game be sent to

221
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:21,190
Consort Hui's palace.

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,500
Today, could there be no one who wants to dedicate their game to me?

223
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,070
I, Yongning, want to give the game to Imperial Father.

224
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,010
Is that right? What have you hunted?

225
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,910
A skylark.

226
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,300
You just got such a small creature?

227
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,410
Imperial Father, don't belittle it. The creatures hunted by my brothers were those running on the ground.

228
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,100
Mine was flying up in the sky. This is called "A thing is priced if it is rare."

229
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,690
Also, its speed was so fast. I had a hard time to catch it.

230
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,580
Good! A thing is priced if it is rare. I like your gift.

231
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,640
Grant a reward to Yongning.

232
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,350
Thank you, Imperial Father.

233
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,330
Brother, can you teach me how to ride and shoot starting tomorrow?

234
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,540
You are just a girl. Why do you want to learn that?

235
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,700
I want to learn anything that Prince Yi likes.

236
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:39,550
Once I learn it, I will be able to ride shoulder-to-shoulder with him next time at the hunting grounds.

237
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,370
You are really attentive when it comes to Prince Yi.

238
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,480
That's enough. Get in the carriage now.

239
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Your Imperial Majesty,

240
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,070
how is your headache today?

241
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,400
All the medications prescribed by the imperial physicians can only alleviate the symptoms but can't cure the cause.

242
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,870
Only your fragrant incense can help my headache.

243
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:33,930
You work hard on national matters every day. You should pay attention to your health first.

244
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,040
Your good health will spread blessings to all our people.

245
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,700
Even though I am the head of state,

246
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,300
I won't be able to escape from illness and death.

247
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,720
I just hope that my successor

248
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,410
will preserve my empire.

249
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,050
Today, what Chengyin had said at the Follow Virtue Palace

250
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:07,600
makes me very happy.

251
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,190
Chengyin, this child, values love and loyalty deeply.

252
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,670
He did show a lot of improvement after returning from the Western Border.

253
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,700
I've been worried that I didn't guide him properly and have let Your Imperial Majesty down.

254
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,550
You brought him up single-handedly.

255
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,840
You see him as your own son.

256
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,900
I understand and do appreciate it very much indeed.

257
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,340
Your Imperial Majesty, you regard me as an outsider.

258
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,140
I am good to Chengyin, not because of his mother.

259
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,980
I truly love this child.

260
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,950
According to Erya: "In the chamber, you move around slowly.
(T/N: Erya/Approaching Correctness: a dictionary-like glossary from the Han period. It is one of the Thirteen Confucian Classics.)

261
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,600
In the hall, you take careful steps. Outside the hall, you may walk slowly.

262
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,340
Outside the doorway, you may walk faster. In the atrium, you may trot.

263
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,150
On a broad road, you may run faster."

264
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,620
Stop. Step back.

265
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,500
Princess, you are now in the chamber, you should walk calmly.

266
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,700
Dignified and leisurely. Only walking this way

267
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,760
would make you look like a classy lady. Like water streams downward.

268
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,940
The body is heavy but the steps are light.

269
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,460
Princess, what happened? Are you all right?

270
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,960
I'm okay.

271
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,600
Slightly lift your dress, kneel down with your right leg,

272
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,700
follows by the left leg.

273
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,850
Stretch out both hands and place them together at the front of your chest.

274
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,200
Lower your head until it touches your hand. This is called the "Rite of Kongshou."

275
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,220
Steady. Rise.

276
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,700
Slightly lift your dress, first rise up with your right leg,

277
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,010
then followed by the left leg.

278
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,740
Be steady and dignified.

279
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,400
Princess, you should not walk at the front.

280
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,750
Why?

281
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,900
The crown prince is your husband. Your husband is your superior.

282
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,970
Whenever you walk along with the crown prince, you always have to be a few steps behind him.

283
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,470
Why? In the Western Border, women are superior than men.

284
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,400
Women have a say on lots of things.

285
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,080
This is Li Empire, not Western Border. Li Empire has its own rites and rules.

286
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,600
You just do as I say.

287
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,060
Next, we will learn how the husband and wife bow to each other at the wedding.

288
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,920
Princess, please follow me and do the high hand-fold greeting.

289
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,840
Husband and wife bow to each other.

290
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,200
Why don't you bow?

291
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,400
You need to bow first.

292
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Why?

293
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,350
When you bow with the crown prince, your head must bow lower than his.

294
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,390
After the crown prince rises, you will then slowly get up.

295
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
Why?

296
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,050
It's the palace's rule. There's no "why."

297
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,620
Your Highness, follow me again.

298
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,150
Perform high hand-fold greeting.

299
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,220
Husband and wife bow to each other.

300
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,450
Your Highness, your head needs to be lower.

301
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Lower.

302
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,940
You can't move.

303
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,520
Rise.

304
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,910
Directress Fang! Directress Fang, are you all right?

305
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,230
- Are you all right?
- I'm so sorry.

306
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,400
- Are you all right?
- Your nose is bleeding!

307
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:41,500
Sorry, Yongniang. I didn't do it deliberately.

308
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:46,400
Directress Fang told me to get up, that's when I got up. I didn't mean it. I didn't think this would happen.

309
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm sorry! I didn't do it on purpose, Directress Fang.

310
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:55,640
Directress Fang, haste makes waste. I don't think these etiquettes can be learned in a few days.

311
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,700
Her Highness is already tired today. How about you go back and rest for a little?

312
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,620
I'll teach the princess how to write for a while, all right?

313
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,030
Are you okay, Directress Fang?

314
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,000
Wipe your face. Here, wipe it.

315
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,430
Sorry, Directress Fang! Sorry!

316
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,910
I'm leaving.

317
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,840
Sorry, Directress Fang!

318
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,960
That Directress Fang... She talks so much every day, but she's not even tired.

319
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,760
She's not thirsty,

320
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,060
but I am.

321
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,820
Even though Directress Fang is strict, she's looking out for you.

322
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,600
If Your Highness put more effort into learning these rules quickly, then you wouldn't have to be this tired.

323
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,420
At the bottom of it all, you are just missing the freedom in the Xi State.

324
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,430
That's why you dislike Directress Fang so much.

325
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:07,950
Let's not talk about that. Let's learn how to write. What is Your Highness thinking about right now?

326
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,990
Thinking about... home. Thinking about home.

327
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,600
How about I teach Your Highness how to write home?

328
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,500
A'Du, help the princess to come over here.

329
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,930
Home.

330
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,190
I really miss home.

331
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,430
I wonder how my dad and mom are doing.

332
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,530
A'Du, what's wrong?

333
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,000
You aren't crying from the ugliness of my words, are you?

334
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,830
It's okay. It's okay. Do you miss home, too?

335
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,260
Write one, too. Come. Hurry.

336
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,020
Come.

337
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,250
Here, A'Du.

338
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,240
Okay. Okay. Don't write anymore. A'Du, don't cry.

339
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,590
You crying makes me miss home, too.

340
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,930
My sweet A'Du, don't cry.

341
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,870
Young man, you are awake?

342
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,800
Are you feeling better?

343
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,660
Please bless and protect him!

344
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,660
Mister old man, thank you for saving my life.

345
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,970
Hurry and lie down... lie down.

346
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,900
Why am I here?

347
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,270
You fell from the cliff. You've been lying here for more than two months.

348
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,530
More than two months!

349
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,340
That's right. Only because your inner energy is so strong

350
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,560
that you can last this long.

351
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,960
I've been lying here for more than two months.

352
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,750
Imperial Great Grandmother, I heard that you haven't been able to sleep lately.

353
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:00,790
I brought these incenses back from the Xi State. They have a calming effect.

354
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,630
My precious great-grandson,

355
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,210
you are so thoughtful.

356
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,320
Imperial Great Grandmother.

357
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,840
These few days, your Aunt Mingyuan

358
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,890
has been in my dreams.

359
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,880
She must be missing home.

360
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,110
Great Grandmother.

361
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,220
But she can't come back anymore.

362
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,860
She has a home that she can't come back to.

363
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,080
You must've seen her on this trip to the Xi State.

364
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,770
Did she have any words for you to bring back?

365
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,030
Aunt Mingyue's grave is on Sky Span Mountain.

366
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,070
It faces towards us, the Li Empire.

367
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,650
Imperial Great Grandmother, when you miss her a lot,

368
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,230
then look in the northeast direction.

369
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,810
Lady-in-Waiting Ying, are you all right?

370
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,300
Shien, what's wrong? Why are you in such a rush?

371
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,990
I was looking for my lord and wasn't watching where I was going. Did I hurt you?

372
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,460
I'm fine. But your clothes...

373
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,980
You can't see Great Empress Dowager this way.

374
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,270
Follow me. We'll change you to clean clothes.

375
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,910
Okay.

376
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:37,790
Prince Yi.

377
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:41,460
Great Empress Dowager.

378
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,910
You may rise.

379
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,260
Thank you, Great Empress Dowager.

380
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,640
Prince Yi, it's time for the meeting.

381
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,460
Imperial Great Grandmother, at home

382
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,440
I have arrangements to make and need to take my leave. I'll visit you another day.

383
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,940
You are leaving already?

384
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,410
Since you are having things to handle, go take care of them.

385
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,850
Go.

386
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,660
Imperial Great Grandmother.

387
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,790
I must get out of the palace today.

388
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,030
Prince Yi, I left my palace entry card at Lady-in-Waiting Ying's place.

389
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,380
Prince Yi.

390
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,290
- I'll go get it right away.
- No need.

391
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,980
There is a place in this palace that you can leave without an entry card.

392
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,940
Go!

393
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,230
Good!

394
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,900
[Mi Luo Drinking House]

395
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,610
It's music from the Xi State.

396
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,630
Good!

397
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,890
That one looks better.

398
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,560
This one looks nice.

399
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Sese.

400
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

401
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,680
"Blue is your collar, longing is my heart.

402
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,470
Although I can't go see you, why haven't you sent a letter?

403
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,340
Blue is your pendant, longing is my mind.

404
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Even though I can't go see you, can you not come to see me?

405
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,640
I keep pacing and climbing the lookout tower of the city wall.

406
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,920
One day without seeing you is like three months to me."

407
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,190
Sese.

408
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,220
What's wrong with you hand?

409
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,240
I regret being unable to wear horse riding equipment and

410
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,580
ride with Your Highness last time.

411
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,790
With my brother's help, I've been learning how to ride a horse.

412
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,830
Next time you go hunting, I can ride side-by-side with you.

413
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,600
Sese.

414
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,480
When we were hunting last time,

415
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,650
I suddenly felt sad for my elder brother,

416
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,550
so I presented my prize to his mother.

417
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,230
You have been so devoted to me, but I forgot my promise to you.

418
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:07,620
Your feeling of love touches me.

419
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,450
Your Highness must not blame yourself.

420
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,900
Sese never wanted you to kill.

421
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,470
As long as you remembered me, I'll be happy enough.

422
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,900
Delicious.

423
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,910
Here! Cheers to the two of you.

424
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,760
Let me introduce myself.

425
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,860
I'm Miluo from Xi State. I'm the owner of this bar.

426
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,020
- You are from Xi State, too?
- Yes.

427
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:43,910
No wonder the food here reminded me of home.

428
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,640
- You are from Xi State, too?
- Yes, we are.

429
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,020
Really? What should I call you?

430
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,020
This is A'du.

431
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,590
Uh... My last name is Shou and my first name is Xi. You can call me Mr. Zhou.

432
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,090
Here is your drink.

433
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,430
- Mr... Zhou.
- Mr. Zhou.

434
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,320
Nice to meet you.

435
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,830
I'm not trying to brag, but Shangjing City has three treasures.

436
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:11,030
First is the fragrant incense of the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas. Second is the beautiful women of Singing Jade Brothel.

437
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,430
The last one is the wine at my Mi Luo Drinking House.

438
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:19,030
Merchants from the Western Border all want to have my grape wine.

439
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,480
Okay, we'll come here for wine from now on.

440
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,130
Cheers!

441
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:29,760
How long have you had your business here?

442
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,200
About a year or so.

443
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,450
And you? I don't believe I have seen you before.

444
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,430
Us...

445
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:39,450
We haven't been here long.

446
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:42,940
We came to the capital...

447
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,100
The capital...
