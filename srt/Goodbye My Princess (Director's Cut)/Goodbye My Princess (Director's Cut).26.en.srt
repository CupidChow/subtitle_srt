♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

[Episode 26]

17
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,020
Your Highness, no need to hurry. Let's take it slow.

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,180
It's still early.

19
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,520
Your Highness, who's that? G-G-General Pei!

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Zhao.

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,660
- Fifth Prince.
- What's wrong?

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,390
Nothing is wrong. I just don't feel well.

23
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,850
Oh right! Your Highness, the ninth princess sneaked out of the palace again tonight.

24
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,420
Yongniang is worried so she told me to come and search around privately.

25
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,360
If the ninth princess isn't back in the palace by tomorrow morning,

26
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm scared that there's going to be an issue if the empress finds out.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,290
She snuck out again?

28
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,560
She's so bold.

29
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,930
Your Highness, this is none of our business.

30
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,280
We have to hurry and meet Lady Zhao. We don't have much time.

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,950
Earlier, didn't you say we had enough time?

32
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,360
Right! We have enough time! Let's find her!

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,810
Let's go.

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,750
I don't want to be the crown princess consort.

35
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,850
I miss my dad. I miss my mom.

36
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,170
My Lady, Your Highness must have forgotten the meeting with you.

37
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,340
It's already dark. How about we go back?

38
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,750
No! We'll wait a little more.

39
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,150
There must have been something that caused a delay.

40
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,370
Cousin?

41
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,980
Cousin, thank you for saving her. I'll bring her back to the palace.

42
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,700
I don't want to go back! I don't want to return to the palace!

43
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,220
I want to drink alcohol.

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,180
Cousin, are you and Ninth Princess old acquaintances?

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,430
We already knew each other back in Xi State.

46
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,190
For a person of precious status like Princess,

47
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,280
it's better that she limit herself going out of the palace like this.

48
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,460
I'll take her back to the palace, now.

49
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,800
I don't want to go back.

50
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,350
I don't want to go back.

51
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,490
Where are you taking her?

52
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,740
Away.

53
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,790
Nobody can take her away.

54
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,870
You already got what you wanted.

55
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,350
And she doesn't want to stay here anymore.

56
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,280
You can't leave with her today.

58
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,580
Don't leave me here alone.

59
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,630
I'm Li Chengyin.

60
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,260
Li Chengyin! I want to drink water!

61
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,790
You are a girl. Please don't sneak out and get this drunk again.

62
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,450
I miss home!

63
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,420
This is your home.

64
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,280
This isn't my home!

65
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,020
Xi State is my actual home!

66
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,500
Here, I'm just an object on display.

67
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,720
I mustn't suffer any bump or knock.

68
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,840
Every day, I have to look pretty.

69
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,060
Actually, it's the same for whoever is in this position.

70
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,260
There isn't anyone who truly cares about me here.

71
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,320
There's no one who truly cares about me!

72
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,910
There's me.

73
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,550
I'll care and protect you.

74
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,630
You're Li Chengyin.

75
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,990
You're Zhao Sese's.

76
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,730
Princess.

77
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,010
Princess, what are you thinking about?

78
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,140
Yesterday, how did I get back?

79
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,380
Princess, you even have the nerve to ask. You were still not back at a very late hour.

80
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,150
I asked General Pei to help find you.

81
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,320
General Pei eventually found you in the Imperial Buttery.

82
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,270
The Imperial Buttery?

83
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,290
General saw that you were completely drunk, so he carried you back.

84
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,380
Princess, in the future, you must not sneak out of Embracing the Moon Pavilion again.

85
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,460
Was there anyone other than General Pei?

86
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,670
Not really. What's wrong, Princess?

87
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,720
Nothing. Nothing.

88
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,370
I'll go prepare your breakfast then.

89
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,940
Go ahead.

90
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:58,870
Sorry.

91
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,280
I won't go out alone next time.

92
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,600
I will bring you wherever I go. Cheer up.

93
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Smile!

94
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,990
Your Highness, these are all the items we brought back from the Western Border.

95
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,840
It's just a bunch of knickknacks. Why did you suddenly think of these?

96
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,070
Isn't Ninth Princess from the Xi State?

97
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,690
I only want to see if there's anything that I can give to her

98
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,720
to ease her homesickness.

99
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,620
Ninth Princess?

100
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,170
I will take my leave now.

101
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,760
All right.

102
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,250
Your Imperial Highness, what's wrong?

103
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,390
Why did you come?

104
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,350
Do you still remember that you were supposed to meet me yesterday?

105
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,550
I waited all night, yet you didn't come.

106
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,730
I was afraid you were unwell,

107
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,100
so I came to visit.

108
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,650
Are you all right?

109
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm fine.

110
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,900
Imperial Mother called for me yesterday.

111
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,810
I forgot to tell you. Sorry, Sese.

112
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,050
I'm at ease then.

113
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,460
What is this? It looks so unique.

114
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,500
It's wolf teeth I brought back from the Western Border. It's an ominous item.

115
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,510
I'm not afraid of anything ominous.

116
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,610
My father is the North Subduing Marquis and has taken control of Danchi.

117
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,140
I am considered half-Danchi now.

118
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,870
This suits me just right.

119
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:30,070
Why don't you give this to me?

120
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,020
What's good about a wolf tooth? I'll give you a high-quality hairpin another day.

121
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,330
Just take it as an apology for standing me up yesterday.

122
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,010
Okay. If you like it, I'll gift it to you.

123
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,430
This counts as the first present you gave me.

124
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,230
Can you put it on me?

125
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,760
Okay.

126
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,370
"Heaven's pillars hold up the day.

Spring growth has no root.

129
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,570
It depends on the gust of eastern wind.

130
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,340
The heartbroken moon was clouded.

131
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,650
The grass on the plain was green.

132
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,570
Life gave away to grey hair.

133
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,110
And spring breeze no longer holds attraction."

134
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,030
No, this poem is not good.

135
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,500
Brokenhearted moon... unlucky.

136
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,260
Brother Gu Jian, you seem sad.

137
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,730
What's on your mind?

138
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,090
What could be on my mind? Dear Ms. Mingyue is by my side.

139

Playing music for me. I have nothing more to ask for.

140
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,100
But I see you are depressed and distracted.

141
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,320
Is it because of... Mr. Zhou?

142
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,240
But I have to say it to you.

143
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,250
You know her identity.

144
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,050
You can never be with her. Why do you hold on?

145
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,310
I owe her.

146
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,560
But this way, you hurt yourself and worry us.

147
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,660
You can satisfy everyone in life.

But there are others that are not the ninth princess.

It's on the house. You don't need to pay.

00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,000
so I came over to pay the bill for you to avoid you causing trouble for Mi Luo.

178
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,860
Mingyue cares about me the most.

179
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,240
All right. You two chat.

180
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,770
What if we just chat tomorrow?

181
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,630
Mi Luo will close shop soon. I will walk you back first.

182
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,430
No rush. Since I am here, I will have a drink with you.

183
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,470
Ming... Mingyue!

184
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,620
Yan'er.

185
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,680
Dad!

186
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,210
Dad! Is it really you?

187
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,300
Your Imperial Majesty, Prince Rong has asked to see you.

188
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,020
Announce him.

189
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,830
Prince Rong!

190
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,690
Your son, Chengwen, greets Imperial Father.

191
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,680
Rise.

192
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,390
Chengwen, what is it?

193
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,250
Imperial Father, I was in class recently and came up with an unpolished thesis of my own.

194
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,960
I wrote a few theses. I hope Father can take a look and give me some advice.

195
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,920
Show me.

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
[Theory of Consorts Interventions]

197
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,130
Consorts interventions had always been a problem since ancient times.

198
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,050
I think we should get to the root of the issue.

199
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,180
We should stop using relatives of consorts.

200
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,190
Is this what the teachers have been teaching you?

201
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,080
Yes, Imperial father.

202
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,090
The teachers advised me on a few things.

203
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,710
I felt like I've been enlightened.

204
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,750
In what way?

205
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,380
I learn that there are more to books.

206
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,520
I never liked books, only weapons.

207
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,830
But from now on,

208
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,870
I will pay more attention to court matters and help relieve some of Father's burdens.

209
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,630
Help me relieve what kind of burdens?

210
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:06,590
Imperial Father, our court is in peace because of your excellent rule.

211
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,850
But without a crown prince, the courtiers form cliques and factions.

212
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,800
It's become a great hidden danger.

213
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,890
Imperial Father, I would like to resolve this problem for you.

214
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,090
I will never form cliques.

215
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,440
Both consorts' relatives and our blood relatives only serve to boost the emperor's power.

216
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,120
The ability to harness their power is what makes an emperor.

217
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,260
I wouldn't be sitting if I couldn't keep them in balance.

218
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,460
But if you like to study,

219
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,420
I will get you a few highly revered scholars as your teacher.

220
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,160
They shall teach you to analyze a situation and not be biased.

221
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,420
Chengwen, you have much to learn.

222
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,800
Thank you, Imperial Father.

223
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,790
[Virtue]

224
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:40,600
Your Imperial Highness, an attendant saw Prince Rong visiting the emperor yesterday.

225
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,900
They were talking about consort interference.

226
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm afraid he is targeting someone.

227
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,150
He's too eager.

228
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,260
Trying to insinuate me and Prime Minister Gao.

229
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,680
It seems he wants to be the crown prince.

230
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,370
Our Prince Rong doesn't have that kind of ambition.

231
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:06,590
It must be his mother's

232
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,050
idea.

233
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,490
Rongshuang.

234
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,060
Yes.

235
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,990
Dad.

236
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,080
Here.

237
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,400
Dad, that day, when I saw you drinking with Brother Gu,

238
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,690
when did you two bump into each other?

239
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,080
Was it recently?

240
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,040
Brother Gu didn't tell me about it.

241
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,940
Twenty years ago.

242
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,980
Twenty years ago?

243
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,210
Twenty years ago.

244
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,610
That day, I was trapped inside the army camp.

245
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,990
I found out that the Gao people had already sent people to the Gu residence to capture them.

246
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,650
My subordinate risked his life to get me out.

247
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,360
But when I arrived at the Gu residence,

248
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,490
I discovered that the only survivor

249
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,180
was Gu Jian.

250
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,920
Why?

251
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,500
Why after you escaped,

252
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,330
you didn't come home to look for mom and me first?

253
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,150
Didn't you think at that time that our family was also...

254
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,920
You did think of it.

255
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,180
What were you thinking?

256
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,860
You thought of it but didn't come to rescue us.

257
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:39,760
That day, our entire family of over scores of people were buried alive.

258
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,700
Mother was protecting me beneath the yellow earth.

259
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,920
At her last breath, she was still telling me,

260
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,020
"Yan'er, don't be afraid.

261
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,730
Yan'er, don't be afraid.

262
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,020
Your father will come to save you."

263
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,160
Where were you at that time?!

264
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,880
The Gu family is important to you.

265
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,860
So, Mother and I are not important to you?!

266
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,370
We are your family!

267
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,620
I am sorry.

268
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,340
I had a reason and some difficulty.

269
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,110
Difficulty?

270
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,450
Are you right to abandon your wife and child for this difficulty?!

271
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,970
Yan'er.

272
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,420
Yan'er!

273
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,840
Sir Chai, my father Chen Zheng already died twenty years ago.

274
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,060
I lived by myself for this long already.

275
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,730
I can live on my own in the future as well.

276
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,750
I don't need a home.

277
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:22,460
Just like you, I also don't need a home.

278
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,400
Xiaofeng, your gourd of wine smells really good.

279
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,980
Did you secretly leave the palace again?

280
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,050
This is a newly fermented wine I received from a friend.

281
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,520
Later, I will bury it under the plum blossom tree.

282
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,920
Next spring, I'll dig it out to drink. Very savory!

283
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,890
- Luoxi, what do you have here?
- Don't touch it!

284
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,310
Don't even try to fight with her about that. She treasures that box very much.

285
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,920
What is stored in there? Let me see.

286
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,350
Do you know what day it is today?

287
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,150
Today... It's the 7th.

288
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,860
You're right, the 7th is "People's Day."

289
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,990
Every year on this date, there will be a festival to reward all the officials.

290
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,160
Besides sharing poetry to liven the mood, you also have to cut ribbons.

291
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,440
What is that?

292
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,770
- Be careful!
- I won't ruin it.

293
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,000
So pretty! What is this flower?

294
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,730
- It's a hibiscus.
- Hibiscus. Who made this?

295
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:10,930
Of course, it is our Little Sister Luoxi, who is very good with her hands.

296
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,690
In every year's ribbon-cutting event, Luoxi would always get first place.

297
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,160
Of course, this year is no different.

298
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,960
That is Imperial Great-Grandmother's favorite.

299
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,400
I do this just to entertain her.

300
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,450
How come I didn't know that you learned these crafts

301
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,500
just to stand out in great-grandmother's eyes?

302
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,580
You...

303
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,250
I even thought you were a drunkard whose intention wasn't in the wine itself (have an ulterior motive).

304
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,570
Xiaofeng, help me punish her!

305
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:43,220
- Don't run!
- Where are you running to, Yongning?

306
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,520
- Quick, punish her!
- Come here! Yongning, don't run!

307
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,050
Don't run! Luoxi, quick!

308
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,110
- Quick, come here!
- Stop right there!

309
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,400
Slow down! Yongning, stop running!

310
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,080
- Three Princesses.
- General Pei.

311
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,070
- General Pei.
- General Pei, are you okay?

312
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,940
I am all right.

313
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,330
Oh right, General Pei. Last time, I got drunk in the Imperial Buttery and it was you who found me.

314
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,690
I haven't had a chance to thank you yet!

315
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,350
Since Princess Luoxi is here, I'll have Princess Luoxi thank you for me.

316
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,710
- Here.
- Princess, please stop kidding with me.

317
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:27,140
Keep it safe! This is Princess Luoxi's handkerchief.

318
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,380
Treat it as our apology gift.

319
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,390
Thank you, Princess.

320
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,070
- Are you happy? Are you happy?
- Are you happy?

321
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,110
You're annoying!

322

[Clear Dew Hall]

323
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,210
Stop right there.

324
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,560
Your Highness, why are you standing here?

325
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,750
Give me the handkerchief.

326
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,000
Give it to me!

327
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,650
Luoxi...

328
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,620
Earlier, I wanted to use a handkerchief. Now, I don't need it anymore.

329
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,200
Here.

330
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,320
Your Highness, are you all right?

331
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,930
I'm fine.

332
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,890
Stop!

333
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,350
What are you holding?

334
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,810
Prince Yi.

335
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,920
I just want to bury this wine under the plum blossom tree.

336
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,890
Ninth Princess, how long ago was it that you got drunk and passed out in the Imperial Buttery?

337
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,040
Is your addiction to alcohol acting up again?

338
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,350
You know about this matter, too?

339
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,330
Half the palace knows about it! Aren't you embarrassed?

340
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,650
Did you see how I looked like while drunk?

341
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,330
I didn't.

342
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,160
Then, how did you know that I looked embarrassing?

343
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,310
If I were you, I wouldn't even have a place to hide in shame.

344
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,110
Weird.

345
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,800
You really weren't there?

346
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,920
I definitely saw you that night.

347
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,480
Perhaps, you dreamed of me that night?

348
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:17,820
I'm glad it was just a dream.

349
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,350
But why would I dream of him?

350
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,940
Lady Zhao!

351
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,310
Lady Zhao, what are you wearing on your neck?

352
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,510
Can you let me take a look?

353
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,550
This is my treasure. I don't want to show others.

354
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,870
I won't steal yours. I just want to take a look.

355
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,400
This... It really isn't convenient.

356
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
I'm just going to take a lo—

357
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,950
Ninth Princess, I will take my leave.

358
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,090
[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

359
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,380
A'Du!

360
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,840
A'Du, hurry!

361
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,850
Sit. Let me tell you something.

362
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,430
Today, I saw a wolf tooth on Lady Zhao.

363
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:39,130
How come I feel like that item is mine? Why is it with her?

364
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,660
Maybe, I knew her before?

365
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,470
I don't think so.

366
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:05,830
You are saying, that wolf tooth might not be mine?

367
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,400
I was standing a little far, so I can't be sure either.

368
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:22,670
I should find a chance to clear everything up.

369
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:44,930
Greetings, Empress.

370
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,860
You look well.

371
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,820
It must be something good happening.

372
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,010
Emperor hired a few teachers to instruct Chengwen on the court matter.

373
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,850
Since he comes to the palace more often, I get to see him more, too.

374
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,420
I naturally feel happy about it.

375
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,990
Prince Rong has been progressing nicely lately.

376
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,180
I heard he was even discussing with the emperor the matter of outside relatives getting involved in politics.

377
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,780
It looks like he really learned a lot.

378
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,510
Chengwen just has a few humble opinions.

379
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:29,050
In front of His Majesty, he is merely displaying incompetence before the connoisseur.

380
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,910
Speaking of the extended family interfering with official matters,

381
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,370
I am ashamed.

382
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:45,930
My uncle is the prime minister in court.

383
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,160
I cannot avoid him helping me from time to time.

384
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:53,940
Is this considered a relative interfering in political affairs?

385
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,430
Xiuyi Wei is different.

386
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,520
Prince Rong is His Majesty's trusted son.

387
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,090
Xiuyi Wei must adhere to the rule even more so and not interfere with official matters.

388
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:13,040
Why would Empress say something like that?

389
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,460
Your father originally was the magistrate of Yu County.

390
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,990
These past years, he was promoted to be transferred to the capital and became the Assistant Minister of Personnel.

391
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:33,110
He also has been buying and selling official posts near Yu County, taking in quite a large fortune.

392
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,320
A few days ago, he bought a mansion in the capital.

393
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,800
Your own brother was a gentlemen bully of the countryside.

394
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,430
He killed a girl from the same village.

395
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,710
The court didn't charge him with any crime.

396
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:54,090
In a year's time, he became a military officer in the capital.

397
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,840
I really don't know who determined the law of the land?

398
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,220
Your cousin owns a pub in the capital.

399
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Not only is he not paying rent, but he is also even forcibly demolishing the stores around him.

400
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,820
He is also forcing citizens to buy or sell from him.

401
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,910
Officials cannot dare touch him, just because he is an imperial relative.

402
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,590
- And there is your uncle--
- Please forgive us, Your Imperial Highness.

403
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,940
I... I reside inside the palace.

404
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,950
I didn't know my family had done all those things. I will teach them a lesson.

405
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,200
I will report them to the police and have them investigated.

406
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,110
Prince Rong is thought highly by His Imperial Majesty.

407
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,000
He just doesn't support the rule set for imperial relatives.

408
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,640
What would happen if His Imperial Majesty got his hands on this memorial?

409
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,240
This... The problems caused by my family,

410
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,440
Prince Rong doesn't know about it!

411
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:55,600
But I have many letters from him in my possession.

412
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,560
They indicated that he asked the local officials to be lenient on the matters.

413
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,650
The fortune your family garnered

414
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:10,390
was used by Prince Rong to bribe the local officials.

415
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,520
Did you not know any of it?

416
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,930
I... didn't know.

417
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,350
If His Imperial Majesty found out about this,

418
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,850
a light punishment includes penalties for you and Prince Rong,

419
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:34,530
a serious punishment includes you being demoted to a commoner and Prince Rong being exiled out of the capital.

420
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,650
Who knows what His Majesty will do?

421
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,420
He can even bestow death upon the late crown prince without hesitation.

422
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,090
Do you think he will let anything pass by this time？

423
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:56,980
Prince Rong is finally valued by His Majesty.

424
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,990
But now it may...

425
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,290
Empress, I am wrong! I am wrong!

426
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,860
I am wrong!

427
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,420
I am wrong!

428
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,390
Sister.

429
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:22,330
Will Empress please help me find a way out?
