[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,240
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,370
The little prince's older brother once told him

4
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:57,580
that the Eastern Palace was actually a blood-filled imperial palace.

5
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Must the little prince be that way?

6
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,250
Can't he try another path?

7
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:18,300
In order to become the crown prince, he needed to perform a mission that he almost couldn't complete.

8
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:32,690
For this reason, he had no choice but to deceive a very important friend.

9
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,870
He really valued this friend.

10
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:41,340
So the little prince thought that after everything ended,

11
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,450
he would definitely make it up to her. But he just doesn't know if by that time,

12
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,460
will that friend of his forgive him or not.

13
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,440
If it were you, would you forgive the little prince?

14
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,680
Of course, I will.

15
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,930
- Really?
- Really.

16
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,390
The little prince is so pitiful yet kind. If it were me, I'd definitely forgive the prince.

17
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,400
What happened afterward?

18
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,820
That's it. Go to sleep.

19
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,980
That's it? How can you tell a story halfway and stop?

20
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,580
How am I supposed to sleep?

21
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,820
If that's it, then that's it. If there's nothing else then there's nothing to tell. Go to sleep.

22
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,310
You...

23
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,430
Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng!

24
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,130
Time to go.

25
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,940
[Court of Judiciary Review]

26
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,110
Move!

27
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,560
Kneel down!

28
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,760
Batuer,

29
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,140
in your confession, you said that you and your companions

30
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,350
were instigated by Khan Tömür.

31
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,880
On the fifth day of the sixth month, near the official road of Haizhou City,

32
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,380
you assassinated my empire's crown prince in order to

33
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,200
thwart my empire and Xi State's marriage alliance.

34
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,890
Is this correct?

35
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,770
That's right. I killed the crown prince.

36
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,180
I also have put my fingerprints on the confession book. Just straight up kill or cut me into pieces if you want!

37
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,350
Is what you said the truth?

38
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,780
Every word of it.

39
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,440
Lift up your head.

40
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,350
Lift your head!

41
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,370
Immediately cut off his head!

42
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,130
Yes!

43
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,610
Take him away.

44
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,410
Get up. Let's go.

45
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,380
Earlier, I was really sweating for Prince Xuande.

46
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:31,780
I never thought in his personal interrogation, we were able to easily deceive His Imperial Majesty.

47
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:40,620
That's right. I thought that His Imperial Majesty would gather the courts and six ministries to try this case.

48
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,670
If he doesn't find out the truth, he won't stop.

49
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:46,540
I never thought that he would close this case so fast.

50
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,410
I will immediately leave to go to the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

51
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,290
I'll tell this good news to Prince Xuande.

52
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,430
Father, say, His Imperial Majesty initially made such grand acts,

53
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:25,730
but then without even examining closely, he decided to execute the criminal. What is His Imperial Majesty thinking?

54
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,940
Kun'er, do you think these rocks are quite painful to step on?

55
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,300
- Hm?
- Does it hurt?

56
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,350
A little bit.

57
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,900
You think it hurts because your feelings are connected to your heart.

58
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,030
A lot of affairs in the imperial court not only need to be examined with the eyes but to be listened to with the ears.

59
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,150
Most importantly, you must use your heart to feel.

60
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,450
Kun'er, you've been an official for so long but still aren't using your heart.

61
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:05,370
Father, I am confused. I don't understand what you mean.

62
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,740
Today, regardless, if this criminal case was examined or not, there was only one outcome:

63
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,430
that the emperor wants to fight.

64
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,500
Why didn't Your Imperial Majesty question Batuer some more before executing him?

65
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,310
I know what I needed to know.

66
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,290
Rest is not important.

67
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,950
Your Imperial Majesty took one look at Batuer and decided he was the real murderer.

68
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,460
The real murderer should be someone else.

69
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,540
So Your Imperial Majesty don't think he was the real murderer?

70
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,660
Do you think an assassin with death would fear me?

71
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,930
Then Your Imperial Majesty, if you think that Batuer is not the real murderer,

72
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,210
do you really wish to wage war with the Danchi?

73
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:34,420
It has become second nature for the Danchi to plunder, causing disaster on our border.

74
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,760
It is time to teach them a lesson.

75
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,810
Your Imperial Majesty.

76
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,080
That place in front is already Danchi. Colonel Pei Zhao, just escort us here.

77
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,860
Okay then. I'll escort you up to here. I'll take my leave.

78
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,350
Colonel Pei Zhao, I'll teach you how to blow a hichiriki next time we meet.

79
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,010
Okay.

80
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,390
Teacher! Xiaowu! Let's go.

81
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,170
Wait, Little Princess. This might be a bit difficult.

82
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,500
The khan has ordered that no stranger is to enter the royal tent.

83
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,110
Who's a stranger here? Teacher and Xiaowu are both my friends.

84
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,770
Heshi...

85
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,310
What Brother He said is correct.

86
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,770
Xiaofeng, your grandfather does not like people of the Central Plains.

87
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,700
And besides, we have been out for such a long time, I should report back to the khan about your safety. Otherwise, he'll worry.

88
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,730
It's just, Xiaowu, your tea caravan has wandered off. What's going to happen to you?

89
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,810
Xiaowu...

90
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,860
Xiaowu can enter with us, right?

91
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,530
I'm afraid...

92
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:03,430
Geez, just don't make it hard for me. I cannot go back on the khan's order.

93
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,920
Heshi, Xiaowu is just a tea merchant, and he has separated from his tea caravan.

94
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,130
He has nowhere to go. Why don't we just take him in?

95
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,020
Grandfather said that if there's kindness, it must be repaid. Xiaowu is my savior.

96
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,650
Is it okay, Heshi?

97
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,630
Well, okay then.

98
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,070
Don't worry. If Grandfather reproaches us, I'll take all the blame.

99
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,830
How can your grandfather bear to punish you?

100
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,500
It's just that Brother Gu, you might need to suffer a little.

101
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,540
If you are not a Danchi tribesman, you must put on a blindfold to enter our territory.

102
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,400
Okay.

103
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,960
Here.

104
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,980
Xiaowu.

105
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,760
After we get there, my grandfather will properly reward you.

106
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,000
I won't be humble.

107
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,610
- You really want a reward?
- Of course. If I don't get it, it'll be wasted.

108
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,860
Xiaofeng. Xiaowu.

109
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,050
I'll be leaving then. You guys take care.

110
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,550
Teacher, be careful.

111
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,800
Come on then.

112
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,150
Here.

113
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,310
We're good now.

114
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,300
The wind here is strong. Tread slowly.

115
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,260
Princess!

116
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,830
A'Du!

117
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,030
Princess!

118
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,650
- Princess!
- I missed you so much!

119
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,300
I'm seeing you at last! I missed you!

120
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,510
Princess, I missed you, too.

121
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,480
Wait! Let me introduce you to someone.

122
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
Okay.

123
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,080
- Little Sister!
- Brother!

124
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,590
Let's go.

125
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,740
- Are you all right, Brother?
- How could I get hurt? I'm so skilled.

126
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,380
Princess, this is?

127
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,260
Gu Xiaowu.

128
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,110
What? This is the Central Plains tea merchant that Gu Jian introduced to you?

129
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,020
A'Du, don't be rude.

130
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,610
Xiaowu is my friend and also our guest.

131
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,780
Xiaowu, this is Heshi's sister and my best friend, A'Du.

132
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,960
It's them again.

133
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,890
- How dare you still come?!
- Xiaofeng, don't be rash!

134
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,100
You're back!

135
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,440
Cousin, what are they here for?

136
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,070
What are they here for? To propose marriage to you!

137
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,510
Propose marriage?

138
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,650
That despicable person?

139
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,660
They followed me the entire way here and almost kidnapped me!

140
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,340
Silly girl, look how nervous you are.

141
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,710
Grandfather didn't even see them and asked me to send them away.

142
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,350
- That's good.
- Xiaofeng,

143
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,400
hurry and go see your grandfather. He missed you so much.

144
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,740
Right! I'll go right away!

145
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,590
Xiaowu, let's go see Grandfather!

146
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,130
Why is there a Central Plains person here?

147
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,040
Friend.

148
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,150
Friend?

149
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,050
What friend?

150
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:37,780
Today, whoever can battle and win against me,
I will award this war helmet to him.

151
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,580
Come!

152
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,140
Who else?

153
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,450
- Grandfather!
- Xiaofeng!

154
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,280
- Xiaofeng!
- Grandfather!

155
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,440
My Xiaofeng has gained some weight again.

156
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,140
I'm already grown up. Stop seeing me as a child.

157
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,820
- You did grow up.
- You have always seen Xiaofeng as a child.

158
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,220
Xiaofeng is already a lady who is going to get married.

159
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,770
You've grown up. Our little princess has already reached the age to marry.

160
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,610
Who says I'm getting married? I won't marry.

161
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,680
When a girl grows up, they will have to marry sooner or later.

162
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,370
Come, sit and tell me. Have you thought of what kind of person you want to marry?

163
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,280
I don't want to marry off to such a faraway place.

164
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:19,870
My mother said that if I get married off to Shangjing, then I probably won't be able to come back forever.

165
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,740
I don't want to leave Mother or you.

166
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,000
Back then, your muddled father was mesmerized by that Li Empire woman.

167
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,840
Now, he cannot see the situation clearly.

168
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,730
Grandfather, let me introduce you to a person.

169
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,680
Gu Xiaowu. He's a tea merchant.

170
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,030
Don't be fooled by how delicate and pretty he looks! He was the one who escorted us all the way back here.

171
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,130
Grandfather, you don't know how dangerous our journey was.

172
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,230
Not only did the Shuobo Army chase us, we even encountered quicksand.

173
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,320
Thankfully, Xiaowu was around, or you wouldn't be able to see me.

174
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,800
My little princess suffered a lot on the way.

175
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,550
I will immediately order people to prepare food for you.

176
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,050
- A'Du, prepare the food.
- Yes.

177
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,580
Grandfather, are you going to show any gratitude towards him?

178
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,390
Yimoyan, go get the five-colored glazed gem given as tribute a couple days ago from the nomadic tribes and reward it to him.

179
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,020
Yes.

180
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,600
Xiaofeng, you've never asked for a reward from Grandfather before.

181
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,110
You treat this man so well.

182
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,680
It can't be that you like him?

183
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,780
Cousin, don't say nonsense!

184
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,630
Yimoyan, the people of the Central Plains are overcautious and have too many intentions. They can't be considered great warriors.

185
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,870
- Yes.
- They can't match up to our Xiaofeng.

186
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,870
Grandfather, you can't say things like that.

187
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,180
Xiaowu isn't an overcautious Central Plains person.

188
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,380
He's the one who saved Heshi and me. In my heart, he's not any less worthy than our Danchi people.

189
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:25,070
Xiaofeng, that sacrad war helmet is Grandfather's protective talisman. It has accompanied him in countless battles which all went so successfully.

190
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,790
Don't play around with it! Take it off!

191
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,110
No worries!

192
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,400
Xiaofeng is Danchi's most precious princess.

193
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,260
Only she is worthy of my lucky charm.

194
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:44,470
I have already released news that our Xiaofeng is going to get married to the most valorous and powerful hero of the grasslands.

195
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,730
Whoever can kill the white-eyed wolf king of Sky Span Mountain,

196
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,940
can marry my little princess.

197
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,850
Did you really say that?

198
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,790
Why if I don't like the person who kills the wolf king?

199
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,080
No one in this world has the ability to kill the wolf king

200
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,230
or to force you to marry someone you don't like.

201
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:07,650
Grandfather, you are the best!

202
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,710
Xiaowu?

203
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,410
Xiaowu!

204
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,490
Come in.

205
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,270
It's this late yet you're still not sleeping?

206
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,330
I can't sleep.

207
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,700
I'll take you to a fun place. Let's go.

208
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,300
- Come on.
- Go where?

209
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,760
Look! It's this place.

210
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:36,460
It's really beautiful. On top of the glacier, there is such warm, lush water vegetation?

211
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,600
This is Danchi's warmest location. The flowers bloom here every season.

212
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,200
Look! Fireflies!

213
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,780
It seems like your grandfather doesn't like me very well.

214
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,510
Don't worry. My grandfather indeed dislikes people from the Central Plains,

215
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,620
but it can't be too long till he likes you like how I like you.

216
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,450
Gu Xiaowu,

217
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,600
do you still remember that you promised me three things?

218
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,220
Of course, I remember. Tell me. What do you want me to do?

219
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:32,170
The first thing is, I want you to catch 100 fireflies for me.

220
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,880
This isn't too difficult. Wait for me.

221
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,910
Pretty, right?

222
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,100
Don't let them leave.

223
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,800
Wait for me.

224
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,270
That's right! Over there!

225
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,550
There's more! There's more!

226
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,370
Look.

227
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,010
Hurry and count.

228
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,430
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

229
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,500
They escaped.

230
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,740
So pretty.

231
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,070
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

232
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,930
So pretty... They're like shooting stars.

233
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:05,420
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

234
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:13,290
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

235
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:19,990
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the rim of my eyes  ♫

236
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,730
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

237
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:33,250
♫  The wind blows by, dragging the candlelight with it, but no one is there to appreciate its solo dance. ♫

238
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:42,110
♫  Leaving the petals to flutter in the wind  ♫

239
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:50,050
♫  Only you are my heaven. ♫

240
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,140
Person from the Central Plains.

241
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,870
Are you lost?

242
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,620
How can that be?

243
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,870
I was just enchanted by this unique landscape.

244
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm shocked by nature's extraordinary abilities.

245
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,480
You do not belong here.

246
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,230
Person from the Central Plains, you can leave this place now.

247
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,050
There is no business for you here.

248
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,910
Xiaowu!

249
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,090
Xiaowu!

250
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,290
Xiaowu...

251
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,550
Hurry! Hurry up!

252
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,300
Keep up! Hurry!

253
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,000
Follow along! Hurry! Get in!

254
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,640
Hurry up and get in!

255
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,690
Keep up! Hurry!

256
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:45,010
Hurry!

257
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,380
Hurry!

258
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,990
Go in!

259
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,250
Behave!

260
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,370
Young Lord.

261
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,580
Are you a person from the Central Plains?

262
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,990
Save us! Save us!

263
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:17,770
Sir, save us!

264
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,750
I'm begging you! Save us!

265
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,960
Save us from here...

266
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,950
We're begging you...

267
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,160
Save us...

268
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,750
Save us...

269
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,650
Save us...

270
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,500
Save us from here...

271
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,340
What are you doing?!

272
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,680
Behave!

273
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,800
Squat!

274
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,510
Behave! I'm telling you to behave!

275
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,310
Squat well!

276
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,850
Heshi!

277
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,390
Heshi, have you seen Gu Xiaowu?

278
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,490
You scared away Gu Xiaowu this quickly?

279
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,130
Look! Isn't your beloved coming right now?

280
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,390
Xiaowu! Where did you go?

281
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:17,710
I thought you left. You scared me.

282
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,040
I was roaming around the place; looking for a person.

283
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,790
Looking for who?

284
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,330
That's right, Brother Heshi.

285
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,950
That... Have you heard of a person called Batuer?

286
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,930
Why are you asking about him?

287
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,420
A few months ago, I met him. He wanted to buy tea from me.

288
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,520
Hence, this time, I brought a load of good tea,

289
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,830
but I haven't seen him since.

290
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,180
Don't mention him anymore. A few days ago, he was captured by the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

291
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,120
What happened?

292
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,850
Isn't it because of some feud with the Li Empire?

293
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,760
Otherwise, we wouldn't be keeping our grievances to ourselves.

294
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,080
Our brother got captured, but we can't even get revenge for him.

295
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,120
We feel oppressed.

296
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,880
What feud? This severe?

297
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,250
Okay, don't worry. With the Little Princess around,

298
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:10,640
you still fear that your tea leaves won't get sold?

299
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,930
You talk too much.

300
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,780
Xiaowu, you haven't eaten yet. Right? Let's go.

301
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,100
What exactly is in this basket?

302
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,570
Look for yourself.

303
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,170
Clothes? For me?

304
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,800
It's so cold here and you people from the Central Plains have very weak health.

305
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,550
If you get sick, no one will care for you.

306
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,420
Do you know that in the Central Plains, girls cherish their feet like they were their lives.

307
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,050
Aside from their husbands, they cannot be seen by anyone else.

308
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,270
Then what will happen if someone sees them?

309
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,920
Then you marry her.

310
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,140
Didn't you hear my grandfather?

311
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,080
Only the person who kills the white-eyed wolf king can marry me.

312
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,530
Let me ask you. As long as that person can kill the white-eyed wolf king, regardless of who he is, you will marry him?

313
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,130
Of course!

314
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,400
My grandfather's word cannot be unsaid. How can I let him go back on his words?

315
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,440
But he said

316
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,510
that in this world, there's no one who is able to kill the white-eyed wolf king.

317
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,840
Gu Xiaowu,

318
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,940
will you kill the white-eyed wolf king for me?

319
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:27,390
What can I do since I already saw your feet?

320
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,090
Wait for me.

321
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,560
Oh right!

322
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,650
Your breakfast.

323
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,430
I prepared it for you.

324
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,450
Not properly pulling the cart!

325
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,380
- You couldn't even pull a cart?
- We were wrong.

326
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,250
You're wrong? Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!

327
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,150
Stop!

328
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,840
Princess.

329
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
What crime did they commit that you have to keep hitting them?

330
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,220
Princess, they are slaves.

331
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,690
They are captured prisoners from the Central Plains.

332
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,720
We treat our captured prisoners as slaves!

333
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,920
- Mula, go back and admonish your slaves.
- Yes.

334
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,290
Cousin, slaves are still people. How could you treat them like that?

335
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,560
Xiaofeng, A'Du is looking for you.

336
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,810
A'Du?

337
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,180
That's right. Go and see what she wants.

338
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,450
I'll be back in a moment. Wait for me.

339
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:55,660
Did Khan Tömür tell you to send me away?

340
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,340
Okay, then help me give something to Xiaofeng.

341
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,100
Okay.

342
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,690
A'Du!

343
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,330
What's up? You were looking for me?

344
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,670
I just got a new pot of good wine.

345
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,640
Princess, let's go and try it.

346
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,180
Let's go!

347
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,420
It smells really good.

348
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,410
Let me go and get Gu Xiaowu,

349
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:43,620
so he can taste some of our good wine.

350
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,870
- How does that sound?
- Sure.

351
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,510
Wait for me.

352
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,720
- Heshi?
- Brother?

353
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,460
Little Princess, Gu Xiaowu has already left.

354
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,150
Left?

355
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,000
Let me go look.

356
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,570
It's too late. He has already gone far.

357
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,990
Oh right. He had me give this to you.

358
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,250
How come that person just left without a word?

359
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,550
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

360
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,760
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

361
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,240
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

362
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,680
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

363
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,540
♫ A long dream ♫

364
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,160
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

365
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:48,060
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

366
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:55,990
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

367
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:02,940
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

368
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,500
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

369
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,270
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

370
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:17,900
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you’ve extended ♫

371
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,230
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

372
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,980
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

373
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,860
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

374
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,550
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

375
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,370
♫ Time reverses ♫

376
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,660
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

377
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:46,760
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

378
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,900
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

379
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,490
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

380
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,490
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

381
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,290
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

382
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,070
♫ Time reverses ♫

383
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,190
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

384
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:13,390
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

385
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:19,960
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

386
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:27,690
♫  Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
