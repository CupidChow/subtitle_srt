00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,550
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental

00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,300

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,670
[Episode 49]

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,100
If Young Lord continues to drink like that, you'll make yourself drunk.

18
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,640
Just blame MIss Mi Luo's wine for tasting so good like always,

19
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,930
I couldn't help but drink a few more cups.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,830
It's the Spring Lantern Festival today.

21
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,790
The emperor and the crown prince will both go out of the palace to climb up the city tower.

22
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,940
Don't you need to organize the security?

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,340
Look at the festive occasion outside.

24
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,100
Everyone is chatting and laughing with others while hiding away their secret thoughts.

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,290
Even the emperor must forget the border turbulence tonight

26
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,810
and stand atop the tower to put on an act that all is well.

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,320
Then, why can't I drink a few cups here by myself, sneaking a moment of leisure?

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,230
I think you are already drunk.

29
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,380
Perhaps, you haven't been here for long and are not used to my strong wine.

30
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,480
Last time I came, it was with the crown princess consort. It has been a long time.

31
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,050
Xiaofeng indeed hasn't been here in a while.

32
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,200
Is it because she is too busy to get away from the palace?

33
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,890
I don't know where she is either. The crown princess consort has disappeared for quite some time.

34
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,460
No one knows if she is even alive or dead. The Yulin Palace Guards have searched the whole city.

35
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,900
They can't even find this one woman.

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,860
So, you are worried about work.

37
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,580
Shangjing City is big but not too big. The person you want to find will appear sooner or later.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,840
If you drink more, you'll really be drunk.

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,400
I'll go make some sobering tea for you.

40
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
Or else, there may be big trouble at the Spring Lantern Festival today.

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,010
[Mi Luo Drinking House]

42
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,400
Other than the Singing Jade Brothel, that's the only place I've stayed in Shangjing.

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,320
I want to visit her. Let's go.

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,690
Your wine is as good as it's always been.

45
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,750
There are many people who are complimenting my wine today.

46
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm sure of that. People who come here must be wine connoisseurs like me.

47
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:15,210
All right! If you like it, I'll give you a few jars that you can take with you.

48
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,050
Mi Luo, sit down.

49
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,130
From now on, I won't be able to come anymore.

50
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,540
Why? Who dares not let you come?

51
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,020
I'm going home, back to the Xi State.

52
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,210
So this time, I'm here to say farewell to you.

53
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,670
But will they let you leave?

54
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,400
This is not the same as sneaking out from the palace to drink.

55
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I sneaked out this time. No one knows.

56
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm only telling you. You need to keep my secret.

57
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,780
That's for sure. But have you really decided to leave everything here?

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,150
Xiaofeng, you need to know that

59
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,100
in this cold capital, there will be people

60
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,000
secretly caring about you in places that you can't see,

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,550
worrying about you.

62
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,160
That doesn't matter anymore. When I return to my Xi State, going back to my world,

63
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,150
there won't be any Shangjing, or Eastern Palace,

64
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,500
or a person who is making me sad.

65
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,830
You used to drink and make merry, looking like there was not a single worry.

66
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,800
I thought you had already let go of your worries.

67
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,690
I'll continue to drink wine and make jokes,

68
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,040
because I've found my most important person.

69
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,550
Don't worry.

70
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:09,350
You can finally go home.

71
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,600
Mi Luo, if you come to Xi State, you have to come and find me first.

72
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,940
Hiding in Shangjing,

73
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,400
being an owner of a wine house for the rest of my life,

74
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,900
I'm actually quite content.

75
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,230
Perhaps, this place makes me feel at ease.

76
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,600
Isn't feeling at ease the reason why you want to go home?

77
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,990
Mi Luo, for someone so carefree like you,

78
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,510
you'll be fine wherever you are. Here. Cheers to you.

79
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,090
- Here! Cheers to everyone!
- Let's toast the Mi Luo's Drinking House!

80
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,160
- All right!
- Cheers!

81
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:19,150
Young Lord, you better drink some sobering tea. If you keep drinking like this, the wine will stay with you beyond tomorrow.

82
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,460
There's a practice from my hometown.

83
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,500
One can use the leftover wine stain under your cup

84
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,630
to make a prediction on how the person you are thinking now

85
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,710
is doing.

86
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,800
How do you explain this wine stain?

87
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,500
The wine stain under your cup is evenly spread out.

88
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,400
That means, the person you are thinking about now

89
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:56,190
is safe. She might be currently doing what she wishes to do.

90
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,680
Mi Luo, I hope you are not lying to me.

91
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,190
If you believe then there is.

92
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,080
Sometimes, I really do wish that she can leave Shangjing.

93
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Only once she leaves this place, can she probably be truly safe.

94
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,170
The divination symbol already indicates that she is now safe.

95
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,300
Besides you, there is still someone protecting her with his life.

96
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,380
Your Imperial Highness.

97
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,860
Your Imperial Highness, does this gown fit me well?

98
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,190
It's pretty.

99
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,290
Crown Prince, please put the hairpin on Related Lady of Excellence.

100
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
Xiaofeng.

101
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,130
Hairpin?

102
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,500
It's an old tradition for the husband to put a hairpin on his wife during the Spring Lantern Festival.

103
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,290
Implying that the couple will be loving forever.

104
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,610
I will put it on you.

105
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,770
It's too odd for me to wear this while I am in man's clothes.

106
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,950
I will keep it instead.

107
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,400
I heard that the emperor and noble consort have gone up the city tower.

108
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,640
This noble consort is acting on behalf of the empress position. She might be crowned as the empress soon!

109
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,540
Be careful of what you say.

110
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:43,750
His Imperial Majesty is up the city tower!

111
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,430
It's really the emperor!

112
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,290
Your Imperial Majesty and Noble Consort!

113
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,400
This is indeed bestowing bountiful blessings on us.

114
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,600
It's so beautiful to look at!

115
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,390
In the twenty-sixth year of Tiantong, the country is in prosperity, its fortune abundant,

116
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,000
laws are strictly implemented, families and tribes are in harmony,

117
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,900
there is an honest and cultured atmosphere, efficient governance and peaceful people,

118
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,960
there is just and dutiful officials, and good relationships with foreign states. At this Shangyuan Festival,

119
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,370
we celebrate with all the people in the world.

120
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:33,400
We pay respect to the gods and ancestors above, and pray for blessings of our citizens.

121
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,240
Let me go, Li Chengyin! Let me go!

122
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,900
Fireworks...

123
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,970
This is the first time that I find these fireworks pretty to look at.

124
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,800
I used to think it was too noisy and extravagant. For a momentary sparkle,

125
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,680
too many efforts have to be spent. I thought it was very wasteful. But now, I suddenly feel that

126
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,430
people really need a short moment of luxury.

127
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,860
Looking at a sky with full blooming flowers, we can temporarily forget our pains.

128
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,700
Allow the heart's innermost happiness, no matter how little it is, to be unleashed.

129
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,430
Xiaofeng!

130
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,390
Release the arrows!

131
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:19,500
Listen to me! Assassin, if you let her go now, I'll let you leave safely.

132
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,620
If you hurt my wife at all, I will flay you into a thousand pieces so that you'll die in pain.

133
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,600
I'll do as promised, just like this arrow!

134
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,860
I'm sorry.

135
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,900
Why are you saying sorry?

136
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
I've finally realized...

137
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,800
that here in Shangjing, I've been living within a scam.

138
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,300
In this scam, I have been

139
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,500
in love with a liar.

140
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,580
Xiaowu, I'm sorry.

141
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,100
I shouldn't be hesitating up until now, and not bearing to part with this place.

142
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,020
Then, let me ask you again.

143
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,040
Are you willing to return to Xi State with me now?

144
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:29,220
Take me away quickly. I don't want to stay here anymore.

145
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,890
All right.

146
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,200
Golden money during a time of peace! The emperor's graces are so vast!

147
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,780
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

148
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,200
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

149
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,900
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

150
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,480
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

151
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,400
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

152
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,260
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

153
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,100
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

154
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,900
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

155
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,050
Long live His Imperial Majesty!

156
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,680
Imperial Father! Imperial Father! I've discovered the crown princess consort.

157
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,730
I plead that you close the gates and capture the assassin.

158
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,100
Today is the Spring Lantern Festival. Doing that will cause panic among the people.

159
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,700
Imperial Father, if we don't shut the gates now, the assassin will run away with the crown princess consort.

160
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,690
Trying to capture them after that is like looking for a needle in the sea.

161
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,080
Long live Your Imperial Majesty!

162
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,200
Long live Your Imperial Majesty!

163
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,420
Long live Your Imperial Majesty!

164
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,690
Imperial Father!

165
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,910
- Imperial Father! Hurry!
- Your Imperial Highness.

166
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,350
Hurry, Imperial Father, return to the palace with Noble Consort Gao now!

167
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,620
Hurry!

168
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,900
Your Imperial Highness, go back to the palace with me!

169
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,760
Let me go!

170
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,750
Don't go there.

171
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,540
Your Imperial Highness!

172
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,640
- My Lady!

173
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,390
Your Imperial Highness!

174
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,370
You few, come with me!

175
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,920
- Yes!
- Your Imperial Highness!

176
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,390
Xiaowu!

177
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,370
Xiaowu!

178
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,650
Xiaowu!

179
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,560
Let me go!

180
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,270
Xiaofeng!

181
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,320
Xiaofeng!

182
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,340
Go back with me.

183
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,950
Xiaofeng!

184
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,570
Who are you?

185
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,510
I am Gu Xiaowu.

186
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,880
Gu Xiaowu. Gu Xiaowu.

187
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,170
Gu Xiaowu.

188
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,900
Xiaowu!

189
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,630
Grandpa!

190
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,690
I will kill you!

191
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:43,080
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

192
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,280
Who are you?

193
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,420
It's me who should be asking who you are.

194
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:57,700
I am the fifth prince of Li Empire, Li Chengyin.

195
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,560
Crown Princess Consort, you are awake.

196
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:13,200
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

197
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,460
Crown Princess Consort? Crown Princess Consort!

198
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,610
Xiaofeng!

199
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,980
Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng?

200
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,720
Xiaofeng, what's the matter?

201
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,230
It's me.

202
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,910
I am Chengyin.

203
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:53,400
Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng, I am Chengyin.

204
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,450
I am Chengyin, Xiaofeng.

205
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,120
I am Chengyin.

206
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,440
- Go away.
- You... What's the matter?

207
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,410
I am Chengyin.

208
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,600
Xiaofeng, it's me! I am Chengyin!

209
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,360
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

210
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,540
Xiaofeng... Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng...

211
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,590
- Quick, get the imperial physician! Hurry!
- Yes.

212
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,220
Qu Xiaofeng, why did you come back?

213
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,330
Why? Why?!

214
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,360
Imperial Father.

215
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,070
No need for bows.

216
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,920
Thank you, Imperial Father.

217
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,380
Xiaofeng, the imperial physician said you've been traumatized.

218
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,500
The wound on your head is just mild. It's not a big problem. Don't worry.

219
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,590
Thank you, Imperial Father.

220
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,740
Xiaofeng, why did you suddenly appear at the Vermillion Bird Gate?

221
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,890
The assassin took me there.

222
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,250
Why did he take you there?

223
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,930
Do you remember what he looks like?

224
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,100
You spent a few days with him. You don't recall his face?

225
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:41,150
He wore a mask all the time and wouldn't talk to me.

226
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:50,970
Where did you hide these past days?

227
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,300
I am not sure.

228
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:02,990
Sometimes in the woods. Other times in a rundown temple.

229
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,570
I don't know those places.

230
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:14,450
That assassin took you to hide in so many places,

231
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,820
but didn't hurt you.

232
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,590
What did he really want?

233
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,970
Xiaofeng, you frequently go to Singing Jade Brothel.

234
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,740
Have you heard about a man named Sun Er?

235
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,630
Sun Er?

236
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,220
No, I haven't.

237
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,750
All right. You've had a hard time. Rest well first.

238
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,370
If you remember anything, especially if it's about the assassin,

239
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,220
tell me immediately.

240
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,120
Thank you, Imperial Father. I understand.

241
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,080
Why are you still obsessed?

242
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,360
I'm not obsessed. I've already thought it through clearly.

243
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,030
If you are really clear about it, then you should know

244
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,750
the crown princess consort doesn't belong to you!

245
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,630
It's true she doesn't belong to me, but she doesn't belong to anyone, either.

246
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,550
She should return to Xi State and live her original life.

247
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,570
What else really belongs to me in this world?

248
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,250
I don't even belong to myself.

249
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,670
Godfather,

250
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:32,360
I've completed what I was supposed to do. Please let me go.

251
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,890
What did you say?

252
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,350
Please release me and let me go.

253
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:54,530
Crown Prince, what do you think about what the crown princess consort said.

254
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,430
She's been traumatized and her head was injured.

255
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,660
It's normal that she can't explain things in detail.

256
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,390
Besides, she doesn't have to defend an assassin.

257
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,610
During the Shangyuan Festival, everyone knows that

258
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,720
the security at the Vermilion Bird Gate is the strictest.

259
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,180
Why didn't the assassin choose another gate

260
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,610
and insisted to take such a great risk?

261
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,310
For that assassin daring to break into the Singing Jade Brothel to assassinate someone,

262
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,500
I already thought it was particularly inexplicable.

263
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,690
And now, he dared to charge through the Vermilion Bird Gate.

264
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:36,170
He must have thought he was invincible in martial arts and couldn't be stopped by regular guards.

265
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,050
It's truly suspicious.

266
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,510
If Gao Yuming really wanted to assassinate Mingyue,

267
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,750
there were actually hundreds and thousands of opportunities.

268
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,460
Why pick the time when I was there?

269
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,060
If his target was me,

270
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,370
why did he

271
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:04,210
then give up this extraordinary opportunity?

272
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,850
What are your deductions then, Imperial Father?

273
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,800
I am very confounded, too.

274
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:18,650
At any rate, that assassin must not get away.

275
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,260
We also must find the plotter behind him.

276
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,680
Yes.

277
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,760
Do you know what you are saying?

278
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,140
When I was young, I thought that all these things were just my own problems.

279
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:42,220
No matter how painful it was, how suffocating it was, it was what I deserved to endure.

280
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,670
Until you involved Xiaofeng. She had to bear the loss of all of her family,

281
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,390
the loss of her memories, and the pain of losing the people she loves. Is that fair to her?

282
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,460
Is this what you mean by great justice?

283
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,300
Jian'er, this is fate.

284
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,960
Even if we didn't involve her, Danchi would have perished anyway.

285
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,270
Xiaofeng would have still been stuck in the palace struggle. Isn't that fate?

286
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,040
Then the Gu family being completely annihilated, was that the will of Heaven, too? Was it also fate?!

287
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,610
I...

288
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,680
Godfather, I used to believe

289
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,760
that I was Xiaofeng's hero.

290
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,290
But later, I discovered that

291
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,550
I had already become

292
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,390
a liar who spouted lies.

293
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,070
I became a killer whose hands were full of blood.

294
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,350
I don't want to live that kind of life anymore.

295
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,220
[Bearing Graces Hall]

296
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,520
Crown Princess Consort, have a sip of porridge.

297
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,820
I followed a recipe and took the time to make it.

298
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,600
Crown Princess Consort, for my sake, please take a sip.

299
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:24,190
Crown Princess Consort, do you want the sweet lotus porridge first or the salty roasted meat porridge?

300
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,300
I don't want any.

301
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,990
Crown Princess Consort.

302
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,300
Leave.

303
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,790
Yes.

304
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,280
I've remembered everything.

305
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,870
Everything.

306
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,950
I've remembered all of it.

307
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,490
A'Du, you knew about it. Right?

308
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,590
Whistle arrow, Teacher, white-eyed wolf king,

309
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:43,190
the battle at Danchi, Dad's tears, Grandpa's fresh blood,

310
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,040
and the bone-chilling water of the River of Oblivion.

311
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,450
Everything, everyone,

312
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,190
you clearly know all about it. Right?

313
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,960
Yes, Princess.

314
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,600
A'Du, you can talk.

315
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,350
Didn't your larynx get injured? You...

316
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,670
You've been pretending.

317
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,100
Because I made a terrible pledge to the gods.

318
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,930
Then, why didn't you tell me?!

319
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:56,210
Why did you hide the truth from me?! Why must you be like everyone else

320
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,220
hiding things and lying to me?!

321
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:02,490
Why did you treat me this way?! I've only thought of you as my closest family!

322
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,780
Princess, I couldn't mention even a single word to you.

323
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:16,090
It's because this was the only way that I could stay by your side to protect you!

324
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,550
The past is too cruel.

325
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,470
I didn't want you to recall any of that painful past!

326
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:24,990
Then, am I not in pain now?!

327
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,390
I feel even more guilty now!

328
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,160
I have to live next to my nemesis every day.

329
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,420
Every day, I have to see my feelings toward him sinking more and more, unable to extricate myself!

330
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,600
Am I now not in pain?

331
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,760
Can you bear to see me like this now?

332
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:51,300
Why did I forget and then have to remember them?!

333
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,230
Why did even the River of Oblivion have to lie to me, too?

334
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:24,150
Do you remember me teaching you swordplay when you were young?

335
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:27,300
Your arm must be stable. Your eyes must be sharp.

336
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,060
When you stab, you must be fast and ruthless.

337
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,640
You wanted to compete with me in swords, but you always lost. But you said,

338
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,990
you would defeat me one day.

339
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,740
I remember.

340
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,460
If you win, you can sleep two extra hours.

341
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,100
If you win, you can leave.

342
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,200
Godfather, I'm sorry.

343
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,010
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

344
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,250
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

345
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:32,700
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

346
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,130
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

347
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:39,030
♫ A long dream ♫

348
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,780
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

349
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:50,990
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

350
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:59,490
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

351
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:06,580
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

352
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,000
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

353
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,870
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

354
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:21,010
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

355
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,760
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫♫

356
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,580
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

357
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,510
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

358
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,100
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

359
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:39,970
♫ Time reverses ♫

360
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:43,140
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

361
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,150
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

362
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,830
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

363
00:44:56,830 --> 00:45:03,950
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

364
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:16,120
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

365
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,350
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

366
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,750
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

367
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:26,010
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

368
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,020
