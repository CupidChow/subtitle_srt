00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,260
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,630
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,390
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,680
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,970
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,560
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,990
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,130
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,150
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,890
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,650
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,830
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:39,230
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:46,030
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,650
[Episode 31]

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,530
Sir, Miss Mingyue has already left the palace.

18
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,230
Good.

19
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,840
The Shenwu Army has found me.

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,610
If I continue to stay in the capital,

21
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm afraid I'll bring harm to you guys.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,580
Godfather, I think so, too.

23
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,850
You should leave the empire and hide for a little bit.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,100
While I'm not here,

25
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:39,620
Jian'er, you should go see Mingyue often.

26
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,590
I only have you two children.

27
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,100
You both have to stay safe.

28
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,960
Okay.

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,120
I'm going into hiding for a little bit.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
Before I come back,

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,340
all the Submerged Dragon Envoys hiding everywhere are under the control of Gu Jian.

32
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,190
From today on, he will be your young master.

33
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,880
Young Master!

34
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,520
To ensure convenience in communication, the unilateral method is being abolished.

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,680
This will be the secret signal used for communication.

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,470
While I'm gone,

37
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,660
everyone has to listen to the young master's orders. Don't act on your own.

38
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,310
Furthermore, you can't lower your guard and reveal your identity.

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,790
Yes!

40
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,450
Godfather has left the empire.

41
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,670
The person who took you away today was the commander of the Shenwu Army.

42
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,220
His name is Ceng Xian.

43
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,610
Then, the person who interrogated me wasn't the governor of the capital,

44
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,890
but the current emperor.

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,310
You saw the emperor?

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,880
I was blindfolded and could only hear his voice.

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Did you tell him anything?

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,530
What do you mean by that? You're scared that I would betray your godfather.

49
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,250
No. I'm scared that if the emperor

50
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,680
finds out about your background, you will get into trouble.

51
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,930
I didn't say anything and he didn't ask further either.

52
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,530
He probably thinks a courtesan like me doesn't need to be investigated.

53
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,630
Crown Princess Consort, since you have free time today, why don't you go visit Related Lady of Excellence Zhao?

54
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,960
Concubine Zhao? Why should I go and visit her?

55
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,350
You and her both live in the Eastern Palace.

56
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,170
Last time, she was grounded for half a month.

57
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,570
If you don't express anything, people will gossip behind your back.

58
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,040
Moreover, the crown prince misunderstood you last time.

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,530
You can take this chance to reconcile your relationship. Wouldn't that be good?

60
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,160
I'm not going. He can believe whatever he wants.

61
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,220
Crown Princess Consort!

62
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,510
Yongniang, I know you want what's good for me,

63
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,340
but I only want to live happily for myself.

64
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,590
There's no need for me to please him nor the person he likes.

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,180
Crown Princess Consort, I know that you feel wronged.

66
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,880
I'm just concerned about you.

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,180
I wish for you and the crown prince to push aside your past feuds soon

68
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,570
and for everyone within the Eastern Palace to get along.

69
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,570
But unfortunately... unfortunately, I am useless.

70
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,700
I've let the teachings of Grand Empress Dowager down.

71
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,460
- May Your Highness bestow death upon me!
- Jeez!

72
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,070
Yongniang, don't be like this. Hurry and get up.

73
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll go!

74
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,940
What gift should we prepare for her?

75
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,560
Gift?

76
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,410
My Lady, the crown princess consort is here.

77
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,580
Quickly escort her in.

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,210
Greetings, Crown Princess Consort.

79
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,750
Ever since you married into the Eastern Palace, I haven't seen you yet,

80
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,670
so I decided to drop by today.

81
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,730
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

82
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,400
A'Du.

83
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,410
This is?

84
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,410
Where did you get that rotten stuff from?

85
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,260
Aren't you embarrassed to give it as a gift?

86
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,170
Sese, this a grape wine fermented for several years from the Xi State's royal city.

87
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,520
It's the best!

88
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,390
It looks this way because

89
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,280
it has to be covered in mud to trap the essence of the wine.

90
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,010
I especially took it from my dowry to give to you.

91
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,170
What kind of good things would that barbaric place of yours have?

92
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,490
I think you're just bluffing.

93
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,580
What do you mean bluffing? Why don't you try it?

94
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,870
Who knows what kind of weird stuff you put in there? Who dares to drink it?

95
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,200
What do you mean? Why would I put weird stuff in there?

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,590
Let me tell you. The first time you saw Sese, she fell into the pond.

97
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,160
The second time you caused her to be grounded.

98
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,020
It's not more than once or twice that you tried harming her.

99
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,440
I won't be surprised if you would try harming her again.

100
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,950
I don't want to get bothered by you!

101
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,880
Sese, this is for you.

102
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,550
Who wants this trash? Take it back!

103
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,580
I'm giving it to her! It's none of your business!

104
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,830
If I don't allow it, then she can't take it! Just in case you bring her harm again!

105
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,630
Who is harming anyone? I harm others but you even killed people!

106
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,860
Me killing people on the battlefield and you harming someone, can they be the same?! Petty woman.

107
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,200
Your Imperial Highness, the crown princess consort doesn't mean any harm.

108
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,040
- Be quiet!
- Be quiet!

109
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,810
Let me tell you. If you don't want to drink it, I'll drink it myself!

110
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,870
Let go!

111
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,010
My Lady! My Lady!

112
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,220
My Lady, are you all right?

113
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,750
My Lady!

114
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,730
Sese, you... Are you all right?

115
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,860
Are you all right?

116
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,430
What are you trying to do now?!

117
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,120
She's bleeding! You need to stop it!

118
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,110
Leave! If it weren't for you, she wouldn't get hurt!

119
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,940
- I...
- Starting today, you are not allowed into Qingluan Hall!

120
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,510
I...

121
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,990
- Sese.
- Go! Get out!

122
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,770
- What are you doing? Let go!
- Get out! Get out!

123
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,390
Let go!

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,360
Sese.

125
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,670
- Hurry! Hurry and call the doctor!
- Yes! Yes!

126
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,130
Sese.

127
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Does it hurt?

128
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,520
Your Highness, aren't you going to check on the crown princess consort?

129
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,510
Why would I go see her?

130
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,750
She caused this injury and you still want me to care for her?

131
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,490
I think you really don't dislike her.

132
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,870
What do you mean?

133
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,190
I mean, even if you dote on me,

134
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,360
you shouldn't be so obvious.

135
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,340
You are indeed the gentler and more sensible one.

136
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,940
It's fine now.

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,390
You should rest. I'll leave now.

138
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,550
Will you come back here tonight?

139
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,550
Grand Mentor wants me to learn court governance; hence, I won't come over anymore.

140
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,620
To prevent Imperial Mother from saying that I am ignoring court affairs and vent her anger at you.

141
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,730
Right.

142
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:01,170
If the love between two people is destined to last long, then why would they need to spend days and nights together?

143
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,460
For you to be diligent in court affairs is a blessing for the citizens.

144
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,140
Your Highness and I have a lot of time together in the future.

145
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,380
You're right. I'll leave then.

146
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,700
Fifth Brother, your water skills are great.

147
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,760
It's a good thing, you saved the ninth princess in time.

148
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
General Pei!

149
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,950
How about it? Do you want another gourd of the wine you drank last time?

150
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,670
As a female, don't you know you should act more reserved?

151
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,560
Then, why didn't you catch me?

152
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,810
People coming here for drinks are all looking for happiness.

153
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,200
What is being reserved? Is that worth money?

154
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,160
I'm looking for Gu Jian.

155
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,180
It's actually quite weird. Young Lord Gu hasn't had a drop of liquor lately.

156
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,830
- Where is he?
- In the kitchen.

157
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,050
He owes me too much money, so he's cleaning dishes to repay it.

158
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,420
I can't believe you can stoop down and do this type of work.

159
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,690
With this type of work, I don't need to use my brain and I can even workout.

160
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,800
Compared to the matters Godfather assigned me, it's way easier.

161
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,390
Sir Chai has left the empire. I'll find a way for him to come back.

162
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,940
You should refrain from going to the palace for now.

163
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,970
Did something happen again?

164
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,110
The crown prince and the crown princess consort's relationship isn't good these days.

165
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,640
But don't worry. Crown Prince is just pretending for the eyes around him.

166
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,460
He still cares a lot for her.

167
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,240
Caring is one thing, knowing how to care is another.

168
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,150
Don't think of her, but hurt her at the same time.

169
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,430
Stop thinking about the past.

170
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,830
They've already forgotten it. Everything is starting fresh.

171
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,630
No matter what, they are husband and wife.

172
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,220
We, as outsiders, cannot interfere.

173
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,860
Every time you talk about the crown princess consort, you end up talking much more than usual.

174
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,400
Not only did you wrong her, but I also did.

175
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,380
I want her to be well.

176
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,870
Greetings to Imperial Mother.

177
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,820
Rise.

178
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,600
Crown Princess Consort, your complexion looks much better.

179
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,910
Your health must have improved greatly.

180
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,380
Thank you for worrying, Imperial Mother. I am all right now.

181
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:53,460
Crown Prince, she has just recovered from an illness. You should show her more care.

182
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,780
I don't think she was even sick. She was just exaggerating it.

183
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,730
I'm not sick, but you are.

184
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,820
Barbaric girl with no manners.

185
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,530
You have manners?

186
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,120
You broke my gift for Related Lady of Excellence Zhao and even kicked me out of Qingluan Hall.

187
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,610
You're really good at being unreasonable.

188
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,350
His Imperial Majesty has arrived!

189
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,840
Greetings to Imperial Father.

190
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,030
Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty.

191
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,730
Rise. Rise. Everyone may rise.

192
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,130
We are all a family.

193
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,530
It's not good to be so formal.

194
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,290
How come Your Imperial Majesty was able to visit the Clean and Peaceful Palace today?

195
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,520
In a couple of days, it will be the Bathing the Buddha Festival.
(T/N: commemorating the birthday of Buddha)

196
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,870
This year is different from the past,

197
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,420
because we now have a crown prince and crown princess consort.

198
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,650
The world also knows about this.

199
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,890
Hence, I would like to take this chance

200
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,570
to let Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort represent the royal family

201
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,710
and welcome the envoys from the different states.

202
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:15,020
This way you'll be able to gain some experience.

203
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,950
Empress, what do you think?

204
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,790
I think that's a great idea.

205
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:27,530
Oh right. You told me before that you were worried that the crown prince

206
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,560
and crown princess consort's outfits might not be complete due to the lack of time, right?

207
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,110
How's the preparation going now?

208
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,660
What a coincidence!

209
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,520
Your Imperial Majesty, take a look.

210
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,290
The casual attire and the dress for the offering ceremony have just been delivered.

211
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:46,320
I was preparing to let Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort try them on.

212
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,730
Do you want to take a look, Your Imperial Majesty?

213
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,590
Crown Princess Consort.

214
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,210
You go and see if it fits.

215
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,350
The work of the Palace Weaving Service is really different.

216
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,790
It's so detailed.

217
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,810
Crown Princess Consort.

218
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,490
You take care of this outfit well.

219
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,320
It was specifically made for the Bathing Buddha Festival.

220
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,760
According to the palace rules, you can't wear this during normal days.

221
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,080
Thank you, Imperial Mother. I understand.

222
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,890
Yongniang, it's just an outfit. You don't have to take care of it like that.

223
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,650
I think this outfit is very delicate and complicated.

224
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,650
It would be bad if I tear even a string from it.

225
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,880
This outfit was indeed made so exquisitely.

226
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,420
I remember when I was younger, I saw Consort Mingyuan had one, too.

227
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,100
I accidentally ruined one of the gold silk strings on it.

228
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,740
When Your Imperial Highness wears it, you have to be extra careful then.

229
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,670
Don't touch it recklessly! You are so clumsy. If you touch it, all the silk threads might fall off!

230
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,630
Greetings, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

231
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,650
What are you doing here?

232
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,350
Your Highness, do you want to eat dinner here?

233
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,100
He won't eat here!

234
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,980
Never mind. You can leave now.

235
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,860
Don't prepare anything. I'm just going to sit for a while.

236
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,530
Yes.

237
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,090
What did you come here for?

238
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:59,650
Imperial Mother wanted me to teach you the rites during the Bathing Buddha Festival.

239
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,200
Do you know its origin?

240
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,220
Bathing Buddha Festival is a day to remember the birth of Buddha.

241
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,460
That morning we will go to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas to pay respect to Buddha and provide meals for the monks.

242
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,550
We will perform the Bathing Buddha ritual of sprinkling water onto the Buddha statues to clean them.

243
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,150
Then, we will start to splash water on each other, start the fireworks, race with dragon boats,

244
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,190
- and rush to display—
- All right. All right. Stop pretending like you care.

245
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,210
You killed so many people, but you have to pretend to be merciful in front of Buddha?

246
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,950
That's ridiculous!

247
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,850
You're the crown princess consort now. Can you think before you speak?

248
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,890
You can say that in front of me, but once you leave this room, don't say it anymore.

249
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,300
I'm scared you'll embarrass me!

250
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,980
Don't raise your voice at me.

251
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,530
Just because I haven't stabbed you with a knife doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

252
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,720
Let me tell you.

253
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,220
I'm just being a little more polite towards you because you built a memorial temple for my grandfather.

254
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,300
What's the connection between the memorial temple and you?!

255
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,200
I built it because I want to honor Khan Tömür as a hero! You can do whatever you want!

256
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,480
But you better assess yourself first if you can really do it!

257
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,440
Get out! I don't want to go to the Bathing Buddha Festival with you!

258
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,090
When I think about having to go there with a cold-blooded killer like you, I feel disgusted!

259
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,750
You feel disgusted about going to the festival with me? I don't even want to take you!

260
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,220
Do you know how many people want to go to the festival with me and don't even have the chance?!

261
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,980
You're talking about Sese, right?

262
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,210
You came today so that I would give the outfit for the Bathing Buddha Festival to your Zhao Sese to wear, is that right?!

263
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,730
I'll give it to you! I don't care anyway! I won't go anymore!

264
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,810
Who said I—

265
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,620
You're really smart! You won't go and want Sese to go,

266
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,150
so that you can go snitch to my mother and let Sese be punished again! Am I right?!

267
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,560
Don't worry! I'll just say I'm sick! I won't get your Sese into trouble!

268
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,910
I...

269
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,880
Then, you better act well!

270
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,700
Crown Prince!

271
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,900
Crown Princess Consort! Why did His Imperial Highness take the outfit with him?

272
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,320
Let him take it! I don't care anyway!

273
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,720
[Bearing Graces Hall]

274
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,870
I didn't come here to fight with her.

275
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,330
What am I doing?

276
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,860
[Bearing Graces Hall]

277
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,910
Your Imperial Highness! What's that?

278
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,110
The crown princess consort caused your hand injury. This is the apology gift.

279
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:14,830
But that was made to be worn by the crown princess consort.

280
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,090
It would be against the rules if I wore it.

281
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,620
If the empress finds out,

282
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,020
she will scold me again for not understanding my status and rules.

283
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,700
It won't happen. You won't be blamed this time.

284
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,020
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,010
Crown Princess Consort, are you really letting Related Lady of Excellence Zhao go to the Bathing the Buddha Festival on your behalf?

286
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,490
Of course, girls from Xi State never go back on our words.

287
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,620
Moreover, Concubine Zhao's hand did get hurt because of me.

288
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,790
If she's happy from receiving the outfit, Li Chengyin will also be happy.

289
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,900
He then won't come to my place and wreak havoc, I'll also get some peace and quiet.

290
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,540
But if you don't attend the Bathing Buddha Festival,

291
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,820
aren't you afraid of angering His Imperial Majesty and Empress?

292
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,760
I've been sick for such a long time, so getting sick once in a while from the cold should be normal.

293
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,610
Either way, His Imperial Majesty and the empress only need someone on display.

294
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,610
They don't really mind whether it's me that's going.

295
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,590
But Crown Princess Consort...

296
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,060
Yongniang, I don't want to go while she wants to.

297
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,750
Isn't this the best way? Stop making a fuss about it.

298
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,450
Yes.

299
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,580
Where is the crown princess consort? She didn't come?

300
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,450
The crown princess consort caught a cold two days ago, so she asked to take a day off.

301
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,360
It's against traditions if the crown prince has no one by his side,

302
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,690
so I ordered Related Lady of Excellence Zhao to be the substitute

303
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,190
for we must ensure that the ritual agenda is done.

304
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,950
Wasn't she fine a couple of days ago?

305
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,840
Is it because her illness has not fully recovered yet?

306
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,660
The crown princess consort is no longer your usual imperial consort.

307
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,190
As the empress, you should take care of her.

308
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,640
I understand.

309
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,420
Don't worry. It will be fine.

310
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,090
Depart for the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas!

311
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,930
A'Du,

312
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,800
I've been seeing really weird memories these days.

313
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,130
The imperial doctor told me these were just dreams, but they were so realistic.

314
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,260
On the other hand, the stories told to me by the empress

315
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,710
of encountering desert bandits, I don't have any recollection of that.

316
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,290
I feel like I've lost a really important memory.

317
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,510
I want to find it.

318
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,910
Teacher, what are you doing here?

319
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,340
Isn't today the Bathing Buddha Festival?

320
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,940
All the imperial relatives will be visiting the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas to pray.

321
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,090
I was waiting outside the temple to see you,

322
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,950
but you never came, so I came here.

323
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm sick so I can't go.

324
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,820
Sick?

325
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,260
Why are you sick?

326
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,710
I'm not really sick.

327
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,500
I just told the empress that I was sick.

328
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,480
Why did you do that?

329
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,710
To fulfill the wishes of Li Chengyin and his Zhao Sese.

330
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,920
Either way, imperial ceremonies are cumbersome and complicated.

331
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,050
You're better off not going.

332
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,060
But the most interesting part of the Bathing Buddha Festival is the temple fair.

333
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,140
It's a waste if you don't go see it.

334
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,960
A fair?

335
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,740
What is fun at the fair?

336
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,470
The fair has a lot of fun things.

337
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,910
They have dancing lions, fire acrobats,

338
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,910
catching goldfish, and performances from the Western Border.

339
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,160
I heard that the Persian sorceresses are better than our fortune tellers.

340
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,410
They can see your past and present life with just a look.

341
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,630
Persian sorceresses?

342
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,170
They can see the past and present life?

343
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,510
I want to go see.

344
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,640
Good! Great! Good!

345
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,240
Good! Good!

346
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,060
Good! Good!

347
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,620
Shopkeeper, can I have two sugared figures?

348
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,230
Here you go.

349
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,260
Don't cry. What are you crying about?

350
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,860
Thank you for coming.

351
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,770
Wait for me.

352
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,160
Are you the Persian sorceress? Can you look at my fortune?

353
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,880
I'll take a look.

354
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,010
Gu Jian, this is the Persian sorceress you told me about.

355
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,210
You should let her look at your fortune, too. Come.

356
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:18,230
You two... have an affinity of two lives,

357
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,800
but they both will not end well.

358
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,770
You two should separate now.

359
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,340
What do you mean affinity of two lives and born to be against each other?

360
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,820
This is my teacher!

361
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,890
I really thought you could see my past and present life,

362
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,780
but apparently, you are a scam.

363
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,720
You're not accurate at all!

364
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,600
Let's go.

365
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,650
Xiaofeng, go to the wishing pond in front with A'Du first.

366
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,290
I'll find you guys later.

367
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,440
I want to see what else this scammer has to say.

368
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,880
Hurry then.

369
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,650
Accessories!

370
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:08,830
Take a look!

371
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,980
Keep talking.

372
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,480
You are living to repent your sins.

373
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:30,230
You are holding onto this sin as you cling onto life.

374
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,260
When you are done repenting,

375
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,210
and your heart's soul has been released from the guilt,

376
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,500
by that time,

377
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,810
you body will suffer from

378
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,510
the pain of a thousand arrows piercing through your heart.

379
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,010
Is it worth it?

380
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,720
She is right. You aren't accurate.

381
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,650
Even though I am feeling like there are a thousand arrows piercing my heart,

382
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,690
I'm not planning to die yet.

383
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,860
I am planning to live on for a long time and suffer.

384
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,490
Buy a turtle!

385
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,410
Buy a turtle and set it free,

386
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,640
so you can lengthen your life span!

387
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,750
Buy a turtle and set it free!

388
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,230
A'Du, we ran into more swindlers.

389
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,950
Would you believe that the turtles we just released will come back very soon?

390
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,600
Let's go. Come with me.

391
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,050
Every year, I'm able to accompany Your Imperial Majesty

392
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,470
here on top of Vermilion Bird Tower to celebrate the holiday with the citizens.

393
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,750
I am very happy.

394
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,150
This year looks more lively than the past.

395
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:16,950
Every Bathing Buddha Festival, I would pray for Buddha to look over the Li Empire,

396
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:20,790
for the wind and rains to come on time, for peace and prosperity,

397
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,300
and for my citizens to make a good living.

398
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:30,830
Today, I can see all of it.

399
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,160
I feel happy and assured.

400
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,580
Your Imperial Majesty is virtuous, cares for the citizens, and manages the country well.

401
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,520
Your contributions are a blessing for the people.

402
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,000
Your Imperial Majesty is wise!

403
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,420
You all have also contributed to the peace and prosperity of this land.

404
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,870
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty!

405
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,260
Minister Gao, ever since you became the Minister of Revenue,

406
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,420
the economy has been rising, and there's a balance in income and expenditures.

407
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,270
The military rations are also abundant.

408
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:07,530
Because of people like you who are willing to exhaust themselves for the sake of others,

409
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:12,350
our citizens are able to live a life of peace.

410
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,830
Minister Gao, I must reward you accordingly!

411
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:22,400
Your Imperial Majesty, you are overly praising me. I am just fulfilling my duties.

412
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,690
Your Majesty has been changing the tax system every year to lessen the amounts of tax paid by the citizens.

413
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,020
Every time there is a disaster, you open the grain warehouse.

414
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,480
Every citizen of Li Empire has a house to live in,

415
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,520
the farmers have land to farm, and the merchants are able to do their businesses.

416
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,640
You care about the citizen's ideas and feelings.

417
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,510
Everyone is thanking you for your excellent rule.

418
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:44,420
All right. All right.

419
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,040
Only one more is left? Are there still any?

420
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,900
- There's no more?
- No rush! There are more!

421
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,810
Here they are!

422
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,580
I'll take one! Give me one!

423
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,640
Stop pushing!

424
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,620
Don't fight! Why did she cut the line!

425
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,420
Get in line! Get in line!

426
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,620
Little turtle, we see each other again.

427
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,790
Miss, you like this one?

428
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,820
It's not that I like this one, I just found it again.

429
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,070
Miss, what do you mean?

430
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,390
What I mean is...

431
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:33,350
you are using the excuse of releasing living creatures to make a scam.

432
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,610
- Miss, you are spouting such nonsense.
- Don't talk nonsense!

433
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,500
I'm not. I saw it with my own eyes.

434
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,310
First, you sell turtles here.

435
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,060
Then, after everyone releases their turtles, you catch and sell them again.

436
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,970
With a cycle like that, of course, you can't run out of turtles to sell the whole night.

437
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:54,260
- That's too much!
- What are you all being loud about?

438
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,390
Miss, you shouldn't say things like that.

439
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,820
What evidence do you have to say that this turtle

440
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,390
was caught and resold by us?

441
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,000
Tell us. Where's your evidence?

442
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,770
Everyone, look at this.

443
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,450
This turtle is the one I just bought from him earlier.

444
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,420
I released it.

445
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,730
If you didn't lie, then why is it here again?

446
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,310
Right! She's right.

447
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,750
The turtles in the world look the same.

448
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,230
Just because you claim that turtle is yours,

449
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:32,240
does that make it really yours?

450
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,020
Right. He's right.

451
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,130
Everyone look! I personally tied this white cloth on it.

452
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,040
You see it? See it?

453
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,760
- Do you see it? You can see it, right?
- Indeed!

454
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,920
- See?
- It is true indeed.

455
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,470
- You guys are so wicked.
- See?

456
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,110
- You can see it, right?
- Right!

457
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,860
It really is there. So wicked of them.

458
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,970
- Refund our money!
- Refund!

459
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,360
Men!

460
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,810
Step away!

461
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,560
You're trying to bully by outnumbering us?

462
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,640
Today, I will show you what more bullying the less means.

463
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,690
That's right. Let's go that way.

464
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,310
I'll stay here for a bit.

465
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,790
I like places that aren't crowded.

466
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,530
Xiaofeng!

467
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,780
A'Du, hit him!

468
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,310
Chase them! Chase them!

469
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,120
Don't run! Stop right there!

470
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,410
Stop right there! Don't let them run!

471
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,680
Halt!

472
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,570
What are you doing?

473
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,030
Don't run!

474
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,960
Don't run! Stop! Don't run!

475
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,050
Over there!

476
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,250
Stop! Don't run!

477
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,450
Move out of the way!

478
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,710
Over there! Hurry and chase!

479
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,900
If you have the guts, don't run!

480
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,610
Halt! Don't run! Stop!

481
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,180
Halt! Don't run! Stop!

482
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,450
Stop!

483
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,450
Where are they?

484
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,390
- I'll beat you!
- Good!

485
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,650
Good!

486
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,460
Everyone, take a good look at them! Don't fall for their cons!

487
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,860
- I'll beat you!
- Good!

488
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,490
Zhao, go see what the situation is.

489
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll reprimand you on behalf of everyone!

490
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm going to beat you!

491
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,530
Good! Good!

492
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,420
Don't move! Get up!

493
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,080
Don't move!

494
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,600
Crown Princess Consort, are you okay?

495
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,230
General Pei Zhao, why are you here?

496
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:58,390
Look! This girl must be a good person.

497
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:03,500
She was able to hit those dirty swine like that.

498
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,100
They obviously outnumbered her.

499
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,070
They were bullying her just because they outnumbered her. That's not right.

500
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,270
- Is that the emperor up on that tower?
- That lady has good martial arts.

501
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,020
- Who does things like that?
- Who is that man?

502
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,140
Is that the emperor up on that tower?

503
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,680
What's going on?

504
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,120
Go back to the palace and properly figure out what just happened.

505
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,860
Do not let the ministers see this as a joke.

506
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,290
I will obey your commands.

507
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,730
Prepare the carriage and return to the palace!

508
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,560
His Imperial Majesty is returning to the palace!

509
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,560
Crown Prince, bring Crown Princess Consort and Related Lady of Excellence Zhao back to Clean and Peaceful Palace with me.

510
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,410
Yes, let us return to the palace.

511
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,790
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

512
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,000
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

513
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,490
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

514
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,790
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

515
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,730
♫ A long dream ♫

516
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:03,520
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

517
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:11,960
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

518
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,380
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

519
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:27,290
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

520
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:29,750
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

521
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:33,590
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

522
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:41,890
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

523
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,570
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

524
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:50,270
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

525
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,200
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

526
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,820
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

527
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,690
♫ Time reverses ♫

528
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,920
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

529
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,880
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

530
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,570
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

531
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:25,020
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

532
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,780
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

533
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,040
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

534
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,430
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

535
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,760

536
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,820
