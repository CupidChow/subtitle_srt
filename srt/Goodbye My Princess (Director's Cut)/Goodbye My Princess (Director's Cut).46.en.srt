00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:25,140
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,650
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:43,960
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,970
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,640
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,040
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,120
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,260
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:17,990
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,700
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,850
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:39,230
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:45,890
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

15
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:51,790
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:56,570
[Episode 46]

17
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,600
Noble Consort Gao arrives!

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,340
Greetings and respect to Your Imperial Majesty.

19
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,530
You may rise.

20
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,500
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,100
Greetings to My Lady Noble Consort.

22
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,450
Please forgive me for being bold

23
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,830
as I did not know that you were here.

24
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,150
Why are you here?

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,710
I remember with gratitude that sister sacrificed herself to ensure the safety of Your Imperial Majesty.

26
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,850
I worry that since sister is seriously injured and has not fully recovered,

27
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,650
Your Imperial Majesty would surely be troubled by it.

28
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,080
So, I ordered my people to search for this effective prescription for nourishing the blood and maintaining good health.

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,520
I cooked and especially delivered it here for Sister.

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,700
You are very considerate.

31
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,600
Sister, how do you feel today? Is there anywhere that is still hurting?

32
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,340
Are you used to the food you eat and the things you use here?

33
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,410
If the servants are not taking care of you well, please come and tell me. I will flay them!

34
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,890
Enough.

35
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,960
Mingyue needs to rest.

36
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,230
Then, I will take my leave.

37
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,000
When Sister has fully recovered,

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,590
I will come and visit her again.

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,610
The weather is changing now. Please also take care of your health.

40
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:44,090
Yes. Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

41
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,230
I will take my leave now.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,550
Mingyue, in the future, other than the food that was arranged

43
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,960
by me and by the imperial physicians,

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,020
you must not eat anything that other people send you. Do you understand?

45
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,860
I think for a sincere-looking person like Noble Consort, she would not harm me.

46
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,040
Whatever it is, just be on good terms with her in the future.

47
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,500
Move, move! Watch out!

48
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,260
A street ruffian?

49
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,340
Yes. The movement of this Sun Er is highly suspicious.

50
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,420
He has gone to Singing Jade Brothel more than once to inquire about news of Miss Mingyue.

51
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,120
And all these started only after Imperial Father became acquainted with Miss Mingyue.

52
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,700
This thug actually knew about my whereabouts?

53
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,130
Although he is just a pawn, there must be someone in the background behind him playing a chess game.

54
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,390
Have you found out who this Sun Er is related to?

55
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,620
Imperial Father, I did manage to find some clues.

56
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,360
But I dare not make any conclusion yet.

57
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,980
It's fine. Speak directly.

58
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,520
Sun Er is a distant nephew of a butler from Prime Minister Gao's manor.

59
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,970
Prime Minister Gao?

60
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,700
Imperial Father, I repeatedly thought about it but still cannot comprehend

61
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,280
why Prime Minister Gao wanted to investigate Miss Mingyue.

62
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Even if it's because of Noble Consort Gao, there's no need to do so.

63
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,770
Perhaps, this matter does not have anything to do with Prime Minister Gao. It is merely a coincidence.

64
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,300
Look for Sun Er first, and ask him about it.

65
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes.

66
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,300
Is there any news about Crown Princess Consort?

67
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,110
None.

68
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,040
Although we still do not know how Sun Er is related to the assassin,

69
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,720
I am sure that this is not an ordinary assassin.

70
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,060
Since he has the courage to assassinate me, it means that he was prepared to die.

71
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,490
How could he have been swayed by a few words from the crown princess consort?

72
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,090
I believe there's something strange about it,

73
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:21,820
or the crown princess consort is in some way related to the assassin.

74
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,110
Imperial Father, the crown princess consort has pure and simple thoughts. Why would she be related to the assassin in anyway at all?

75
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:34,250
I'm still unable to understand this matter.

76
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:41,020
Whatever it is, search the entire city. He must be captured alive.

77
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,220
Yes.

78
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,240
Xiaofeng!

79
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,350
Are you calling me?

80
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,830
Who are you?

81
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,380
I'm Gu Xiaowu.

82
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,360
Gu Xiaowu?

83
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,840
I think I heard of your name before.

84
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,990
Do we know each other?

85
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,370
Yes, you do. I'm your Gu Xiaowu.

86
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,980
My Gu Xiaowu?

87
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,820
Gu Xiaowu? Be careful, Gu Xiaowu!

88
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,160
Run quickly, Gu Xiaowu!

89
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,700
Xiaofeng, who were you calling just now?

90
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,400
None of your business.

91
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,960
You said Gu Xiaowu.

92
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,580
You know him?

93
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,000
Did I know him before?

94
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,000
Come, drink your medicine.

95
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm not drinking.

96
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,060
Drink this. Your fever will only be reduced if you drink the medicine.

97
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,550
I said already, I won't drink it!

98
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,780
You are winning!

99
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,740
Let's play again! Let's play again!

100
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,930
- How is the game?
- I've won a few rounds already.

101
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,310
Come, place your bets.

102
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,530
Hurry up. On the small.

103
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,210
- Small. Definitely on the small. 
- Small! Small!

104
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,030
Is that big or small? Open up, come.

105
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:45,490
- I won again.
- Look at your luck.

106
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,830
- Again. Let's continue. Keep going.
 - I refuse to believe it.

107
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,300
Wait a second. I need to go out for a bit.

108
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,050
- You are not allowed to leave.
- I'll be back very quickly. I just need to convenience myself.

109
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,630
I need to use the bathroom. Play first for me.

110
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,310
You better be quick! Quick!

111
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,350
This group of paupers...

112
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,430
Who is—

113
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,240
Look, Xiaofeng.

114
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,890
Fireflies.

115
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,350
I remember that you like fireflies the most.

116
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,080
When we were in Xi State, the king and queen didn't allow you to go out at night.

117
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,440
One time, you sneaked out at night.

118
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,690
When they finally found you,

119
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,610
you had a firefly in your palm.

120
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,030
You told me that you got lost. It was that shiny little guy who kept you company.

121
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,660
How do you know this?

122
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,780
It's not odd that I know this. We used to be together very often.

123
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,970
Xiaofeng,

124
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:57,340
I've never considered night time as scary

125
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,270
until I finally encountered real dark forces.

126
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,370
I don't want you to be alone in the dark night.

127
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,600
I believe that you are my friend. When I recover from my illness,

128
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,260
can you take me home, please?

129
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,560
Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty and Crown Prince.

130
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,670
How is it?

131
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,930
In reply to Your Majesty, that Sun Er confessed easily after a few threats.

132
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,110
It was indeed Prime Minister Gao who instructed him to check on Miss Mingyue's background.

133
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,920
The things that he got from the brothel keeper are now in Prime Minister Gao's hands.

134
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,500
What exactly did Prime Minister Gao get from the brothel keeper?

135
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,630
Sun Er said it was old clothes from Miss Mingyue's youth.

136
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,500
There was a poem written in blood hidden inside it.

137
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,860
Prime Minister Gao was very surprised upon seeing the poem.

138
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,860
He said that he didn't expect that Miss Mingyue was Chen Zheng's daughter.

139
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,490
Chen Zheng?

140
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,170
Yes, Chen Zheng.

141
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:37,130
Ruhui, I want to be like my imperial father,

142
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,090
and expand the Li Empire's territory.

143
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,240
Ruhui will also dedicate all my efforts

144
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,930
to lay my life down for this country with Your Highness.

145
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,380
Your Highness, Cheng Zheng will also follow you

146
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,290
and devote entirely to the Li Empire.

147
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,750
Okay!

148
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,140
Imperial Father, who is this Chen Zheng?

149
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,350
Chen Zheng is the only son of Chen Shiqian,

150
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,010
the former emperor's Shenwu Army Commander.

151
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,780
Chen Shiqian died on the battlefield.

152
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,360
So, since very young, Chen Zheng

153
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,020
was sent to the Gu family who was a close family friend of theirs.

154
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,540
He is like a brother to Gu Ruhui.

155
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,250
He is highly skilled in martial arts and a very loyal person.

156
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,130
He was often by my side and also Gu Ruhui's side.

157
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:52,960
Until when the Gu family rebelled. He was implicated by it as well.

158
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,390
He died over twenty years ago.

159
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:02,330
In that case, Prime Minister Gao

160
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,990
is trying to get rid of Chen Zheng's daughter.

161
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,800
Could there be secrets in the Gu family case?

162
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,240
You are saying that

163
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,880
Prime Minister Gao wanted to kill Mingyue,

164
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,300
but didn't expect that I would be there, too.

165
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,640
That was why an assassination attempt like that happened?

166
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,610
All right, I am tired already.

167
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,390
You take care of Sun Er.

168
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,080
Yes. What about Prime Minister Gao?

169
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Keep investigating.

170
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,180
Yes.

171
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,700
I will take my leave now.

172
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,620
I will take my leave.

173
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,070
Crown Prince.

174
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,720
I am here.

175
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,700
You were present during the assassination, too.

176
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,730
Do you think the assassin was targeting Mingyue...

177
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,130
or me?

178
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,310
My Lord, we are still unable to locate Sun Er.

179
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,130
Someone saw him at the gambling hall last night. Maybe, he has fled because of gambling debts.

180
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,210
Kun'er, are there any updates with the crown prince?

181
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,360
I dare not slack off where the crown prince is concerned.

182
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,460
I have sent men to keep an eye on him all this while, but there are no movements.

183
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,320
Crown Prince should still be in a baffled state of searching for the assassin and the crown princess consort.

184
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,510
He absolutely would not have thought of us.

185
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,210
It's so weird. Sun Er...

186
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
Search again. When you find him, kill him immediately. We can't let him live.

187
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,620
Yes!

188
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,900
Do you have any clues about the assassin?

189
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,570
Nothing yet.

190
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,550
Do it quickly. Don't leave any evidence.

191
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,130
Yes.

192
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,430
Officer! You captured—

193
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,990
Officer! You... You captured the wrong person. Let me live.

194
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,850
Spare my life, Officer...

195
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
- Let's go!
- All right!

196
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,060
Go!

197
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,410
Father, they have gotten rid of Sun Er and we are in control of the crown prince.

198
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,900
Why are you still worried?

199
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,570
I just don't understand. Everything seems so strange.

200
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:40,990
Mingyue is the daughter of Chen Zheng; yet, she is unaware of her past history.

201
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,710
Furthermore, up to now, she has not revealed anything to the emperor.

202
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,520
An assassin appeared out of thin air and disappeared the same way.

203
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,740
There's also no movements from the crown prince.

204
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,960
Father, aren't you thinking too much?

205
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,880
What is frightening is not when there is a wind sweeping through the building heralding a rising storm in the mountains,

206
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,690
it is when there is a rising storm without any heralding wind.

207
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,150
Master, the crown prince is here.

208
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,560
Uncle.

209
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,960
Greetings to Your Imperial Highness.

210
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,560
Uncle, there is no need to be so polite.

211
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,560
How long has it been since you last visited my manor?

212
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,620
Have you been well recently, Uncle?

213
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,820
I feel the same as usual.

214
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,970
Your Imperial Highness has been busy recently, though.

215
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,240
Yes. Imperial Father told me to investigate the assassin.

216
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,540
But I've investigated for a few days and still don't have any clues.

217
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,730
I also don't have any news about the crown princess consort.

218
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,970
Today, I came to ask you about this matter.

219
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,370
There's no hurry. Let's sit down and talk.

220
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,330
All right.

221
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,440
Tell the kitchen to prepare some intricate dishes. Add a ginger abalone soup.

222
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,510
Okay.

223
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:11,770
Chengyin, stay here and have a meal with me tonight.

224
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,180
All right.

225
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,230
Do you know that because of the matter concerning the assassin,

226
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,220
I was so tired for so many days that I didn't even get a decent meal?

227
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,440
It's my fault that I'm so young.

228
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,080
If I still can't find any clues soon, Imperial Father will blame me.

229
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,020
After much thought, I can only come and look for you.

230
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,670
Honestly, I'm also baffled by this matter.

231
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,760
However, when you mentioned the crown princess consort just now, it reminded me of something.

232
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,790
Uncle, please speak.

233
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,580
Perhaps, this assassin did not intend to abduct the crown princess consort at all.

234
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,140
What if he wanted to take the crown princess consort away with him?

235
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,840
Do you mean...

236
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,050
Think about it. Who in this world has so much hatred towards the Central Plains

237
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,400
that he would dare to assassinate His Imperial Majesty and take the crown princess consort away?

238
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,610
Are you saying that this assassin might be from Xi State or Danchi?

239
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,530
I dare not make this claim, either.

240
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,390
But if you would investigate along this line of thinking, perhaps you might have some gains.

241
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,870
Uncle is really wise. I have benefited from your advice.

242
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,130
His Imperial Majesty entrusted such an important matter to you.

243
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,800
It speaks of the fact that he already relies heavily on you.

244
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,960
I still need to rely on Uncle's help.

245
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,980
We are one family. There's no need to speak so courteously.

246
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,830
Walnut cookies. Do you still remember them?

247
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,100
When you were little, every time you would visit my manor,

248
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,800
the food you loved to eat best were these walnut cookies.

249
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,940
Come.

250
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,240
Okay.

251
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,280
At that time, you sat on my lap to eat this snack.

252
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,310
Do you still remember?

253
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,820
I remember.

254
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,990
The taste... is the same as when I was young. It has not changed at all.

255
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,780
It indeed has not changed at all.

256
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,040
Love live the Emperor!

257
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,690
Your Imperial Majesty, Mistress Mingyue is resting inside. I'll go in to inform her.

258
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,360
It's not necessary.

259
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,830
Let me look at you.

260
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,100
Mingyue, since the first time I met you,

261
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,640
I thought you looked different from other women in brothels.

262
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,060
You keep saying you're from a lowly background.

263
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,670
But somehow I feel that before you entered the brothel,

264
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,190
you were probably born in an exceptional family.

265
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,350
You entered the brothel at a very young age.

266
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,580
What happened before that?

267
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,490
I dare not lie to you, Your Imperial Majesty.

268
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,300
Before that, my family indeed suffered a calamity.

269
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,100
My parents died because of it.

270
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:14,030
Tell me about it. I can seek justice for you.

271
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,230
I was still very young then.

272
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,360
I only remember a group of men armed with swords suddenly appearing in our home.

273
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,420
I hid under a cabinet and witnessed my parents killed by the blades.

274
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,570
Before she died, my mother told me

275
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,090
that my father was killed by his enemy.

276
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,550
But these grievances and acts of revenge are complex and endlessly intertwined.

277
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:43,860
I want to forget those shadows of blades, and drop the wish for revenge.

278
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,800
Thereafter, I never mentioned this past with anyone.

279
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,600
I only want to live a simple life.

280
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,550
Let me ask you then.

281
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,770
Between the Mingyue in the Singing Jade Brothel and the Mingyue in the palace,

282
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,720
is there a difference?

283
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,050
I don't really know. What do you think?

284
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,640
Mingyue, I hope you'll always stay

285
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,400
the same way as you were the first time I met you.

286
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,170
Xiaofeng. I bought new clothes for you.

287
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,320
You can change into them when you get up.

288
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,700
Xiaofeng!

289
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,290
Your fever is down?

290
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,700
Yes, it's gone down.

291
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,340
I bought you your favorite soup and roasted mandarin ducks. Come eat some.

292
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,010
Come.

293
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,550
This is salty roasted pork soup.

294
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,600
This is a sweet lotus soup.

295
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,400
This is the roasted mandarin ducks.

296
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,310
Come.

297
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,150
Gu Jian, after we eat, take me back.

298
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,070
What's the matter?

299
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,230
Eat while the food is hot.

300
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,530
Didn't we agree?

301
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,180
Once I've recovered, you'd take me back.

302
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,310
I never said that.

303
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,080
Gu Jian?

304
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,030
You don't want the salty one? Then have the sweet one first.

305
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,300
I'm not eating. I'm talking to you!

306
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,760
You don't want the soup?

307
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,360
Eat the roasted mandarin ducks first. This is your favorite.

308
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,170
I told you that I'm not eating! Roasted mandarin ducks should be shared with the person you love.

309
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,860
Why would I want to eat it with you?

310
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,390
I don't know what happened between us in the past, but it's all in the past.

311
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,610
Please don't force it anymore.

312
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,160
No.

313
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,830
I don't remember anything anymore. Can you not just let me live well in the present?

314
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,130
No.

315
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,080
Why not?

316
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,920
I said no, so you can't.

317
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,710
Why can't I do so just because you said so?

318
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,020
Gu Jian, I'm not attempting to run away but I am hoping that you will take me back.

319
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,340
I actually see you as a friend and trust you. This is how you treat a friend?

320
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,460
You are not running away? It's because you now have suspicions about Li Chengyin

321
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,630
and are disappointed in him. Isn't that so?

322
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,480
No, I've never doubted Li Chengyin.

323
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,340
Not even when you learned that Li Chengyin commanded the army

324
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,800
to slaughter your grandfather's entire tribe?

325
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,750
- No.
- You don't want to run away anymore

326
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,670
because you don't want to go back and face him. Right?

327
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:12,450
No! Stop saying it! I don't understand what you're talking about at all!

328
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,430
It's because you have so much pent up matters in your heart. You have doubts, you have fears.

329
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,570
But as the crown princess consort, you have to lie to yourself.

330
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,730
You told yourself that it doesn't matter and that you should stay with Li Chengyin.

331
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,890
But now that I've brought you out and given you a new chance, you are wavering. Am I right?

332
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,700
No! No!

333
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,370
Do you think I'd let you go back and see you endure that hellish pain?

334
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,180
You asked me before where I was taking you.

335
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,000
Let me tell you. I want to take you to Xi State.

336
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,740
- To Xi State?
- That's right.

337
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,570
The Eastern Palace is not a place for you.

338
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,370
Li Chengyin is not someone you should love.

339
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,630
I don't want to believe you! I don't want to leave with you!

340
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,980
Then go now! You go now!

341
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,430
Xiaofeng.

342
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,020
I beg you to let me go, all right?

343
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,360
Can't you let me just be foolish?

344
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,000
Why force me to remember things that I don't want to remember?

345
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,590
Why won't you leave me alone?

346
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,790
I'm just pulling you out of it.

347
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,100
Don't touch me!

348
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,570
Leave! Go away!

349
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,850
Crown Princess Consort, when will you return?

350
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,300
You are not running away? It's because you now have suspicions about Li Chengyin

351
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,660
and are disappointed in him. Isn't that so?

352
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,530
You don't want to run away anymore

353
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,050
because you don't want to go back and face him. Right?

354
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,640
Search thoroughly! Don't let even an inch of space go!

355
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,290
Yes!

356
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,800
Yulin Palace Guards?

357
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,160
You are not running away? It's because you now have suspicions about Li Chengyin

358
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,090
- and are disappointed in him. Isn't that so?
- No.

359
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:31,150
You don't want to run away anymore because you don't want to go back and face him. Right?

360
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,550
Go search!

361
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,140
Yes!

362
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,600
It's the crown princess consort! Greetings to Your Highness.

363
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,160
Watch out for the assassin might just be nearby. Spread out to search!

364
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,600
Yes!

365
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,940
Your Highness, please go back to the palace with me.

366
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,810
You always carried it when you were in Xi State.

367
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,770
Whenever you encountered danger, you would shoot the whistling arrow into the sky.

368
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,990
I would come to protect you.

369
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,430
It's the assassin! Protect Crown Princess Consort!

370
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,320
Protect Crown Princess Consort!

371
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,560
Fight!

372
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,250
Let's go!

373
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,480
- Chase after them!
- Yes!

374
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,730
Hurry!

375
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,550
After I've killed the white-eyed wolf king, I'll marry you.

376
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,240
Gu Xiaowu.

377
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,160
Are you Gu Xiaowu?

378
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,140
I asked you, are you Gu Xiaowu?

379
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,060
I know that you are.

380
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,960
Why are you hiding it from me? Why didn't you tell me?

381
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,320
Have I forgotten a lot?

382
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,970
What really happened with us in the past?

383
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,730
In the Danchi battle, many people died. We got separated.

384
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,170
You also got severely injured.

385
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,940
When I found you again, you had already become Crown Princess Consort of the Li Empire.

386
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,170
That's why in Shangjing, you said we were old lovers.

387
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,040
So, we really were a couple once.

388
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,620
I wholeheartedly wanted to keep you.

389
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,830
I didn't care about my position in your heart.

390
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:13,230
But oftentimes, I actually ended up pushing you further away.

391
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,890
Have I forgotten a lot?

392
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,430
A lot that belonged to the two of us?

393
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,270
Just forget what's forgotten. It's not that important.

394
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,510
But I don't want to forget.

395
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,920
I don't think I should forget these things. I shouldn't have forgotten that you were Gu Xiaowu.

396
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,790
The Battle of Danchi hurt you too much.

397
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,330
I couldn't appear to protect you at the moment that you needed me the most.

398
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,530
I didn't fulfill my promise. So these bad memories,

399
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,050
it's not bad to forget them.

400
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,250
Danchi is destroyed. Grandfather is dead.

401
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,740
So many lives are lost, but I don't remember anything.

402
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,790
I even forgot my most beloved person and married someone else.

403
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,970
Do you blame me?

404
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,310
I blame myself.

405
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,270
I should have held onto you tightly,

406
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,110
but instead was the one who lost you.

407
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,540
I will never forget you again.

408
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,430
You've only remembered Gu Xiaowu?

409
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:53,470
Yes. I've remembered my beloved Gu Xiaowu.

410
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,400
Gu Xiaowu loved me, too.

411
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,000
Reporting to Your Highness the Crown Prince, I was not capable.

412
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,290
The assassin took the crown princess consort and escaped again.

413
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,160
Escaped? He has escaped again?

414
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm tired of hearing those words.

415
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,740
I deserve to die! But...

416
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,570
But what?

417
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,340
Today, for some reason, it seemed that Crown Princess Consort didn't want to go back with us.

418
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,650
Maybe, I scared her.

419
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,990
If she resists again, even if you have to tie her up, bring her back to me.

420
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,560
Yes!

421
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,800
Xiaofeng.

422
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,210
- Thank you.
- Eat that first.

423
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,730
You never used to say thanks to me.

424
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,190
Then, how were we like in the past?

425
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,250
In Xi State, you always liked to prank me.

426
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,870
You had your little red horse, but you wouldn't ride him.

427
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:06,940
You just liked to ride on my back. I ran around with you on my back. We were never idle.

428
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:13,720
I also can't stand being idle now. Don't I always find a way to sneak out of the palace?

429
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,700
Didn't we once accidentally meet each other in Shangjing?

430
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,360
That wasn't an accidental meeting. I was waiting for you.

431
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,970
I wonder if this time next year,

432
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,330
will I still be with you?

433
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,980
You are my Gu Xiaowu. Of course, you should be by my side.

434
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,750
Your Imperial Highness, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao has looked for you at your sleeping quarters several times.

435
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,210
She kept missing you. Would you like to visit her at Qingluan Hall?

436
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,790
My Lady! My Lady!

437
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,890
My Lady, Crown Prince is walking toward Qingluan Hall right now.

438
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,510
Really?

439
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,510
Hurry, bring out my newly-bought dress and help me change.

440
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:09,300
My Lady, are you confused? Aren't you wearing the new dress now?

441
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,950
Yes, yes.

442
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,460
Then, prepare some walnut cakes favored by the crown prince. Hurry.

443
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,020
Yes!
