[Episode 28]

17
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,090
At the end of spring in the 24th year of Tientong,

18
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,510
Emperor Ze conferred Li Chengyin the title of Crown Prince.

19
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,470
Awarded him the crown and seals of the crown prince, and let him move into the Eastern Palace.

20
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,840
Li Shiqing was decreed to be the crown prince's Junior Preceptor, Zhao Jingyu as the crown prince's Junior Guardian,

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,070
and Fang Shiqing as the crown prince's Junior Mentor.

22
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,240
The Chief Commandant of Prince Yi Manor became the Supervisor of the Household Administration

23
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,490
and managed the whole of Crown Prince Manor.

24
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,880
Pei Zhao became the Commander-in-Chief of the Crown Prince's Palace Guards.

25
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,960
He was also designated as a rectifier of the crown prince,

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,750
along with numerous officials that made up the crown prince's Right and Left Rectifier Groups.

27
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,240
There were also numerous officials assigned to be part of the crown prince's Ceremonials Office

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,830
and several eunuchs as stewards for Domestic Services.

29
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,180
Hurry up and leave!

30
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,340
Eldest Brother!

[Eastern Palace]

32
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,200
Gu Jian, why are you here?

33
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,120
I know something big happened to you today.

34
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,880
I wanted to come and see you.

35
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,490
Me? What thing?

36
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,390
You are getting married.

37
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,370
Are you willing to marry him?

38
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,420
If you don't want to, I will escort you back to the Xi State. We'll leave tonight.

39
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,450
If you want to stay, then I will stay with you.

40
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,620
Where did you want to take her?

41
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,780
To a place where there won't be any hurting.

42
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,250
The palace is too dangerous,

43
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,460
Li Chengyin is too dangerous.

44
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,460
But you are also someone she forgot.

45
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,650
You're right. I am also someone she shouldn't get close to.

46
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,240
I thought I could protect her.

47
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,620
But what if, because of me, she remembers everything?

48
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,940
Then, I will be a sinner once again.

49
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,320
As long as she forgets what happened before,

50
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,090
as long as she can happily start over, anywhere is fine.

51
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,300
I will protect her.

52
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,190
Have you eaten?

53
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,700
I haven't congratulated you yet, for becoming the crown prince.

54
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,080
Thank you.

55
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:02,250
Didn't I tell you that I don't like these kinds of things?

56
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,680
That day, you were drunk. You said you wanted to go back to Xi State.

57
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,590
You said that there was no one here that really cared for you.

58
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,190
You don't like the complicated things here. You can't deal with them.

59
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,010
So, it wasn't General Pei that escorted me back that day, it was you.

60
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,430
From now on, all the complicated matters, I will take care of them.

61
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,920
Are you asking me to stay?

62
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,530
Yes.

Badge?

66
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,830
I am the ninth princess of Xi State. I would like to see our ambassador.

67
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,620
Without a badge, no one can enter the Court of State Ceremonials.

68
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,340
You can go ask your minister to come and see me. He surely knows me.

69
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,990
Our Lord is not here.

70
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,940
Let her in. She is the ninth princess of Xi State.

71
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,120
- General Pei.
- Ninth Princess.

72
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,220
What are you doing here?

73
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm in charge of patrolling the vicinity of the Court of State Ceremonials today.

74
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,860
If Your Highness wants to see the ambassador of Xi State, you can just let me know.

75
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,730
This way please, Your Highness.

76
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,070
I, Lahemeng, pay respect to Ninth Princess.

77
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,890
You may rise.

78
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,610
Are you the ambassadors that father sent?

79
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,190
I've never seen you before. Didn't it use to be Qiliken?

80
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,380
Qiliken has an illness and has retired.

81
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,600
I am here on our king's command to attend your wedding ceremony.

82
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,670
Congratulations, Princess, on your marriage.

83
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,500
Are Father and Mother well?

84
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,010
Our king and queen are both well. No need for Your Highness to worry.

85
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,980
That's good. That's good.

86
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,310
I haven't been back for such a long time. I miss home.

87
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
Did you bring the grape wine from our homeland?

88
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I brought our finest wines as a tribute.

89
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,170
You guys know me too well.

90
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,700
Why do I not see anyone from Danchi?

91
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,040
Where are grandfather's people?

92
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,660
Grandfather didn't send Heshi here?

93
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,850
I... haven't seen them.

94
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,330
Maybe they arrived earlier or the route here is too far, so they haven't reached the capital yet.

95
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,910
I am not sure.

96
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,490
How can you not be sure?

97
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,880
In the past, you guys would come together.

98
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Lehemeng, why do you keep stumbling over your words?

99
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,650
Is Grandfather all right?

100
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,860
Is everything in Danchi all right?

101
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,910
Your Highness, don't ask me about this.

102
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,010
Ninth Princess, I don't know.

103
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,990
I will take my leave now.

104
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,150
Uncle, you're finally here.

105
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,190
Back then, I was afraid of His Majesty getting suspicious, so I dared not invite you to have tea with me.

106
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,270
But now, it's fine.

107
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,290
I can openly invite you to come and celebrate with me

108
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,290
the joyous event of my son moving into the Eastern Palace.

109
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,990
His Highness has been conferred as the crown prince.

110
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,330
He seems calmer than before. Am I right?

111
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:07,020
Imperial Mother. Uncle.

112
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:11,680
It was not an easy journey to receive the Eastern Palace seal and become the crown prince.

113
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,830
So, today, I especially asked Uncle to visit Imperial Mother with me,

114
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,830
because I want to thank you two

115
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,080
for all the support and help these past years.

116
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,050
My silly child, you are my only son.

117
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,650
Who else would I dote on but you?

118
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,720
Mother, I still have one more thing.

119
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,430
I asked Uncle to be my witness while I ask for a reward from my mother.

120
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,120
Are you going to mention that Zhao Sese again?

121
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,050
Mother, please allow me to marry Sese.

122
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,050
I don't know what kind of bewitching medicine that Zhao Sese gives you.

123
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,530
Imperial Mother, I was merely just a prince with nothing before,

124
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,050
but only Sese treated me wholeheartedly.

125
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,140
How many times have I told you

126
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,730
that the marriage with the ninth princess of Xi State is the right thing to do?

127
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,250
It's an official matter. You are obliged to do it,

128
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,820
and not focus on some simple romantic follies.

129
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,330
Even if you insist on doing so, your imperial father will not approve of it.

130
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,020
I earnestly ask Imperial Mother to consider our mother-son relationship

131
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,880
and beg for leniency from Father on my behalf.

132
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,020
- Get up.
- Imperial Mother!

133
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,910
I only have one wish and yet you won't agree to it?

134
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Get up!

135
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,760
I have an idea.

136
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,680
Would Your Highness be willing to hear me out?

137
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,130
Uncle, please speak.

138
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,950
If this matter is brought upon His Majesty and angers him,

139
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:12,590
he would just randomly find any man for that Lady Zhao to... marry.

140
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,760
What can you do about it then?

141
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,520
This... I never thought of.

142
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,800
So, I urge you to temporarily take a step back.

143
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,530
How do I do that?

144
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,510
Marry both of them.

145
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,290
- This...
- The ninth princess of Xi State as your crown princess consort,

146
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,270
Lady Zhao as a secondary consort (technically a concubine).

147
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,860
No. No. That is unjust for Sese.

148
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,290
If she is not willing to be a concubine,

149
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,820
then I am happy to find a rich good-for-nothing young lord for her to be his first wife.

150
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Imperial Mother, you cannot do that!

151
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,610
Imperial Mother, does this mean you've agreed to grant Sese to me as my concubine?

152
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,740
After you get married, if you treat your concubine better than your wife,

153
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,320
what can people do about it?

154
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,830
Thank you, Imperial Mother! Thank you, Uncle!

155
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,610

156
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,660
Lahemeng, you are very smart.

157
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,130
You know how to watch your mouth.

158
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,990
But you must remember, in the capital and even later in Xi State,

159
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,900
there are some things that you should not talk about.

160
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,890
Whether for you, the ninth princess or for Xi State, this would be a good thing.

161
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,480
Yes. Thank you for reminding me, General.

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,890
The items on the cart were from North Subduing Marquis, as coursed through the relay station.

174
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,280
Would General Zhao take a look and accept them?

175
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,940
Men! Take the items indoors!

176
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,910
Yes.

177
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,190
Officer, it has been hard on you. Later, you can come inside for some tea.

178
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,190
I would like to speak to your marquis!

179
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,220
Who are you? Our marquis isn't someone that you can just meet.

180
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,580
Just let him know that I am Ninth Princess of Xi State.

181
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,560
This miss, our marquis is currently guarding Danchi. He's not home.

182
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,670
Guarding Danchi? How can that be?

183
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,350
My grandfather has always been clear with the dividing line between them and the Li Empire.

184
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,410
How could a Li Empire army be sent to guard Danchi?

185
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,200
Ninth Princess!

186
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,780
My Lady.

187
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,970
Lady Zhao!

188
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,490
Hurry up! Come. Come.

189
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,850
What are you doing here?

190
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,330
This is my home. Of course, I would be here.

191
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,070
- The North Subduing Marquis Manor is your home?
- Yes.

192
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,360
Then, the North Subduing Marquis is...?

193
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,910
He is my father.

194
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,840
Why would your father be in-charge of guarding Danchi?

195
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,090
Danchi was eliminated.

196
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,300
My father was conferred as North Subduing Marquis

197
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,390
and appointed by His Imperial Majesty to be in-charge of governing Danchi.

198
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,380
North Subduing Marquis is like the past khan of Danchi.

199
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,480
Of course, he must personally lead his troops to take charge of his land.

200
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,250
What did you just say?

201
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,900
Danchi was eliminated?

202
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,750
Did you not know about this?

203
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,150
Half a year ago, His Highness the Crown Prince and Li Chengye attacked Danchi.

204
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,030
Now, Danchi belongs to the Li Empire.

205
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,070
How about the khan of Danchi?

206
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,170
Khan of Danchi?

207
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,140
I don't know about that.

208
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,820
Maybe, he died in battle.

209
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,100
Ninth Princess!

210
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,770
My Lady, I heard from people in the palace

211
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,770
that the fact that the crown prince eliminated Danchi must never be mentioned to the ninth princess.

212
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,780
How can that be?

213
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,480
She is the princess of Xi State, and she's here for a marriage alliance.

214
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,180
How could she not know about this?

215
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,320
I don't know anymore.

216
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,840
I heard that she was related to Danchi by blood.

217
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,650
I heard that the wedding ceremonies in the Western Border don't have that many traditions.

218
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,910
Who cares. We aren't from the palace, either, so we don't have to follow those rules.

219
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,750
Either way, I was telling the truth.

220
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,490
My Lady, you are right.

221
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,440
[Eastern Palace]

222
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,060
What are you doing?!

223
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,540
Is it true?

224
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,150
What is true? Are you crazy?

225
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,840
Danchi was annihilated by the Li Empire. Is it true?

226
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,700
I'm asking you whether it is, or not?!

227
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,890
It is true.

228
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,020
You led the troops there.

229
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,180
Yes.

230
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,900
My grandfather died?

231
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,300
You killed him?

232
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,880
- I will kill you!
- Xiaofeng!

233
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,400
What did Danchi ever do to you?

234
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,520
What kind of grudges did my grandfather have with you? Why would you do such a thing?!

235
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,180
There were no grudges!

236
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,160
Khan Tömür is your grandfather, but he was also the khan of Danchi who was the enemy of our Li Empire.

237
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,530
The war between two countries isn't as simple as you think!

238
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,090
Don't think that I don't know.

239
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:21,060
You want to step on the bones of the Danchi people to get into your position here in the Eastern Palace.

240
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,260
You used that as a chance to get rid of Li Chengye

241
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,190
and fulfill your long-sought wish of becoming the crown prince.

242
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,110
Li Chengyin, you're despicable and shameless!

243
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,090
What are you saying?!

244
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,850
You can think whatever you want! I just fulfilled my duties while on the battlefield!

245
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,660
I will go back to Xi State now and ask my dad to cancel this marriage.

246
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,920
I don't want to marry my enemy.

247
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,240
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

248
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,160
Your royal father...

249
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,020
If your royal father had agreed to cancel the marriage alliance, why would he send you thousand of miles to here?

250
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,890
Have you thought about that?!

251
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,280
Do you think that like you, your father just knew about the elimination of Danchi now?

252
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,790
I don't care.

253
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,880
- I don't care. I don't want to marry you!
- Xiaofeng!

254
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,230
I don't want to marry you!

255
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,450
Listen carefully.

256
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,320
Xi State agreed to a marriage alliance with the Li Empire because it wants its protection.

257
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,610
With Xi State's current power, it's able to balance other countries in the Western Border,

258
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,080
able to maintain peace and stability, all because of its relationship with the Li Empire!

259
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,990
Do you think that on this marriage contract, it's our names that's written on it?

260
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,640
You're wrong. The ones written are Xi State and Li Empire!

261
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,150
Think clearly about it!

262
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,110
Think about it.

263
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,560
Do you know about the annihilation of the Danchi clan?

264
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,920
Did you know?

265
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,530
You knew.

266
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,500
You and dad both knew about it, yet I was still sent here to Li Empire

267
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,370
to marry the man that killed my grandfather.

268
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:36,120
No wonder dad wouldn't reply to my letters.

269
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,220
Ever since he sent me here for this political marriage,

270
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,480
I am no longer his daughter.

271
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,920
I am just a tribute to the Li Empire!

272
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,880
Isn't that so?

273
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,070
Then, what about you?

274
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,850
I was miserably deceived by you.

275
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,860
A'Du, I trusted you.

276
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,620
I trusted you. Why did you lie to me for this long?

277
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,060
You want me to marry him and regret it for the rest of my life?!

278
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,680
Leave!

279
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,980
I don't want to see you!

280
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,050
Leave, A'Du!

281
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,620
Leave!

282
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,290
What are you doing here?!

283
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,590
I'm sorry, A'Du. I'm sorry.

284
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,470
It's my fault. It's my fault, A'Du.

285
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

286
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,870
I know that it's hard on you, too.

287
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,200
You must be like me, you also didn't know.

288
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,630
How can I not believe you?

289
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm sorry, A'Du.

290
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,950
I asked you to accompany me to this place.

291
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,710
You can't go home.

292
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,700
And you can't even speak about it.

293
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,110
Your heart must be in more pain than mine.

294
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:02,420
Your heart must be in more pain than mine. How could I be so selfish to blame you?

295
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,080
I'm sorry, A'Du.

296
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,710
It's my fault. My fault.

297
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,210
I just don't want to marry Li Chengyin.

298
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,600
I don't want to marry him!

299
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,290
Zhao, when did Sese meet the ninth princess

300
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,280
and tell her about what happened with Danchi?

301
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,440
It's a neglect in my duties. That day, the ninth princess suddenly went to the Court of State Ceremonials.

302
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,750
I was careless. I didn't escort her back to the palace immediately.

303
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,340
Looking at the situation now,

304
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,780
the ninth princess must have heard about the khan of Danchi from somewhere,

305
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,890
so she followed the clues and ran into Lady Zhao.

306
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,010
You're right.

307
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,750
No one told Sese to not tell the ninth princess about Danchi.

308
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,950
But I am getting married to Xiaofeng in a few days.

309
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,730
Now that she knows about this, how can I face her in the future?

310
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,480
Xiaofeng knows?

311
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,460
Ninth Princess cannot marry the man that killed the khan of Danchi.

312
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,980
She trusts me so much and yet I've been lying to her.

313
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,240
I am pushing her into the fire and ruining her life.

314
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,120
Now that things are like this, do I still have a choice?

315
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,970
The political marriage concerns the whole Xi State.

316
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,650
It's not something that can be easily put off.

317
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,780
I know you will stand on the same side as our king.

318
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,000
But you and the king would not want her to face her enemy

319
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,610
and spend the rest of her life in pain.

320
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,820
You helped her escape marriage once.

321
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,550
If she wasn't caught and brought back,

322
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,520
she wouldn't be suffering like this now.

323
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,870
Gu Jian.

324
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,420
I am sure that, like me,

325
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,480
you care about her happiness the most.

326
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,120
So, I am here to ask you a favor.

327
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,860
What favor?

328
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,950
Help Xiaofeng run away from her marriage again?

329
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,230
Yes.

330
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,370
It's not as easy as you think.

331
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,070
What kind of disasters would arise if she runs away?

332
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,980
What consequences will it bring to Xi State? Have you thought of it?

333
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,460
It doesn't matter if she can go back to Xi State, she must escape this marriage.

334
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
With the princess' personality,

335
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,860
on the night of the wedding, she will not share the same bed with her enemy.

336
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,970
Are you willing to send her to her death?

337
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,280
Gu Jian, I will ask you one more time.

338
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,630
In your heart, are you willing to let her marry that person?

339
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,710
What is this?

340
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:57,760
[On the day of your wedding, I will...]

341
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,590
You went to ask Gu Jian for help?

342
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,970
With the wedding approaching, if anything happens that ruins the reputation of the imperial family,

343
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,760
then I would really deserve death.

344
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,280
In fear of bringing trouble to the crown prince, I do not dare inform His Imperial Majesty.

345
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,360
It is not good if the ninth princess gets punished.

346
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,630
The ninth princess listens to you the most,

347
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,570
thus I came to let you know.

348
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,120
Yongniang, you handled this very well.

349
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
You have to attend her well,

350
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,760
to the point of never leaving her side in any circumstance.

351
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,150
I will follow Grand Empress Dowager's commands.

352
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,190
I will take my leave.

353
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,230
Great! Good!

354
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,220
Good! Good!

355
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,080
Hurry!

356
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,830
Let's go.

357
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,590
Hurry, let's go!

358
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,170
Xiaofeng?

359
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,650
May Grand Empress Dowager forgive me.

360
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,200
What are you doing?

361
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,940
Imperial Great-Grandmother!

362
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,820
I beg you to please let me go!

363
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:06,070
Great-Grandmother, I cannot marry Li Chengyin.

364
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,220
Why?

365
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,340
I cannot marry him!

366
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,610
Why?!

367
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:19,250
I hate him.

368
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,200
I hate him!

369
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,420
Because he eliminated Danchi.

370
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,430
You hate him for killing your grandfather.

371
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:55,750
Xiaofeng, come. Come with me.

372
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,750
Come.

373
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:06,920
Look, Xiaofeng.

374
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,900
Do you know whose memorial tablets these are?

375
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,850
They are Li Empire's heroes.

376
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,280
Correct.

377
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,640
Do you still remember Princess Mingyuan?

378
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,430
Consort Mingyuan?

379
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,290
She treated you well.

380
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,770
She took care of me like her own daughter.

381
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,560
Look at this person again.

382
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:54,150
This was a general who had much experience in battles.

383
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,070
The memorial tablet of Li Renmu.

384
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,210
Do you know who he is?

385
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:08,870
He is... Princess Mingyuan's great-grandfather.

386
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,250
The person who killed him

387
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,210
was no one else

388
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,460
but your great-grandfather.

389
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:38,130
Princess Mingyuan was my most beloved granddaughter.

390
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:44,020
That year, she was about your age now.

391
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:49,430
But I never thought that her imperial father, the late emperor,

392
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,880
would marry her off to far away Xi State for a political alliance.

393
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:06,140
All the blood and wounds from battles

394
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,190
were all left in these memorial tablets,

395
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,720
but they could not be left in her heart.

396
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,410
Then Consort Mingyuan...

397
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,190
never bore any hate?

398
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,970
Of course, she did.

399
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,740
But she couldn't hate.

400
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,080
She needed to let go.

401
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:38,000
Only by letting go could she obtain more important things.

402
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:42,330
Do you know why she did it?

403
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,320
For great righteousness.

404
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,400
But you? You only thought about yourself.

405
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,910
You have forgotten your own mission.

406
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,520
You've let down your royal father's expectations.

407
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:17,050
Also, put in vain the sincere kindness and sacrifice

408
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,170
that Princess Mingyuan gave to Xi State.

409
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,330
Look.

410
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,260
These rows of white candles

411
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,620
will burn here forever

412
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:55,170
to remember those valiant heroes.

413
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,780
Like an altar lamp that burns day and night,

414
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,840
they will continue burning forever.

415
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,560
Do you know why?

416
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,920
For peace and stability.

417
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,050
You understand now?

418
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,960
I understand.

419
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,730
My poor child...

420
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,980
Do not hate the crown prince anymore.

421
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:35,610
If you are going to hate, hate the emperor of Li Empire.

422
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,880
He is the one who ordered the crown prince to launch an attack on Danchi.

423
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,750
If Xi State and Danchi want to reprimand anyone,

424
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,540
then reprimand me.

425
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,130
- Great-Grandmother...
- Because...

426
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:00,800
I am the emperor's grandmother.

427
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,880
I am the crown prince's great-grandmother.

428
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,840
The Grand Empress Dowager of Li Empire.

429
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,610
Great-Grandmother...

430
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:20,780
I miss my home.

431
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,030
I miss my home!

432
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,170
My poor child...

433
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:35,060
This is your home.

434
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:44,690
This is your home.

435
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,000

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,160
