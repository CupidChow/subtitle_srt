00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,150
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,150
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,500
Ninth Princess.

4
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,410
Princess, His Majesty placed a lot of guards outside.

5
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,100
It doesn't seem like we have a way out.

6
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,940
No, no, no.

7
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,700
I'll believe you one more time.

8
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,510
Yuyao, I didn't keep my promise. I told Chengyin everything.

9
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,870
Please don't blame me.

10
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,850
The situation is dangerous.

11
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,590
I don't want him being lied to and used.

12
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,500
That would be the end of everything.

13
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,300
I'll never believe you again.

14
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,800
[Protectorate General Office]

15
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,000
Second Brother.

16
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

17
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,190
Fifth Brother.

18
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,230
Imperial Father's decree already arrived a few days ago. We've been waiting for you.

19
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,580
I was traveling day and night trying to get here faster.

20
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,630
To see you.

21
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,270
And our older brother.

22
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,360
Reporting to Your Highness.

23
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,170
I have already sent guards to escort the crown prince's coffin to the capital.

24
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,270
We sincerely hope that the crown prince will be buried in eternal peace as soon as possible.

25
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,910
Fifth Brother, how is your injury?

26
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm fully recovered. Thank you for asking, Second Brother.

27
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,670
Your Highness, please go inside.

28
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,130
His Imperial Majesty has ordered me to investigate the crown prince's assassination.

29
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,810
Fifth Brother, you fought with the assassins.

30
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,290
Tell me what happened that day. Don't spare on the details.

31
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,910
Okay.

32
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,770
Those assassins were wearing Danchi clothing.

33
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,540
They carried scimitars and huge axes.

34
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,530
They were all highly skilled in fighting.

35
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,740
Judging from what happened,

36
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,320
they were very organized, trained assassins.

37
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,870
We've examined the remaining weapons at the scene.

38
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,000
They really were the kind used by the Danchi army.

39
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,880
The fatal wound on the crown prince was exactly the same as that of the weapons.

40
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,850
This evidence is enough to prove that the assassins

41
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,200
are from Danchi.

42
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,010
Your Highness, may I say something?

43
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,600
General Gao, you guarded the northwest for many years and have dealt with Danchi.

44
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,550
Please speak your mind.

45
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,660
Crown Prince's assassination is filled with questions.

46
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,160
To identify Danchi based on clothes and weapons alone

47
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,130
may not be enough. I have been stationed here for decades

48
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,970
and know something of Danchi's people.

49
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,370
Danchi's people are good at fighting on horse

50
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,280
and not so much with close combat.

51
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,730
But according to field evidence,

52
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,520
the crown prince's assassins seemed to be

53
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,810
better at close combat.

54
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,850
That doesn't mean the assassins

55
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,960
were not Danchi people.

56
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,730
Heir Apparent, we didn't find the bodies of the assassins,

57
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,560
but we found Danchi's weapons.

58
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,300
If Danchi really wanted to kill the crown prince,

59
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,020
why did they leave evidence for people to find?

60
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,310
Maybe...

61
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,630
they didn't have time to take the weapons with them.

62
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,710
No way. If they have the time to get rid of the bodies,

63
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,380
how could they not have time to take the weapons?

64
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,430
You're being presumptuous.

65
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,370
Your Highness, although Danchi's people are unruly,

66
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,440
they usually conduct themselves openly and aboveboard.

67
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,780
Moreover, the Danchi khan is usually content to stay in safety.

68
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,690
Assassinating the crown prince gives them no advantage at all.

69
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,430
General Gao, right?

70
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,950
Yes.

71
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,630
You say Danchi has no reason to assassinate the crown prince.

72
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,520
Have you forgotten the Danchi just recently looted Haizhou City?

73
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,840
You even say Danchi's people act with honor.

74
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,330
May I ask General Gao then

75
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,210
if burning, killing, and looting are acts of honor?

76
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,820
General Gao, killing a crown prince is punishable by death.

77
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,200
Shielding killers is doubly guilty.

78
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,860
You misunderstand me.

79
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,360
Your Highness, I was just stating my reasonable doubts.

80
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,400
I am not defending them.

81
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,990
I have noted what General Gao said.

82
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,500
This assassination is a highly serious case.

83
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,890
I will not carelessly jump to conclusions.

84
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,570
I will definitely track down even minor traces to carry on the investigation.

85
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,650
However, you should not forget that the main reason why His Imperial Majesty sent me here.

86
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,370
I did not come here to investigate alone.

87
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,160
Right behind me are 100,000 soldiers.

88
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,470
According to intel, Danchi and Suobo are gathering people.

89
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,210
General Gao must know that, right?

90
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,030
I did receive the report.

91
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,480
So, I have sent people to watch their movement day and night.

92
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,380
His Majesty is very concerned about the northwestern border's security.

93
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,330
We rely on everyone here

94
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,810
to jointly safeguard it.

95
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,970
Your Highness is right.

96
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,700
Come and look.

97
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,610
Be careful these days.

98
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,650
Take a look at these to quality furs.

99
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,790
Don't go.

100
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,000
Check it out.

101
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,780
- Azhao, did you see those Danchi people?
- I did.

102
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,420
Do they all have tattoos?

103
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,850
As far as I know Danchi people's customs include facial tattoos.

104
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,800
Especially grown men. The braver and better they are at fighting,

105
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,530
the more facial tattoos they have.

106
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,500
Come in.

107
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,570
What brings General Gao here?

108
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Your Highness, I spoke inappropriately.

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,110
I hope you can forgive me.

110
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,210
General Gao, there is nothing to forgive.

111
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,820
We all want to catch the perpetrator and give the emperor an account.

112
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,710
So we can avenge our eldest brother.

113
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,600
Of course.

114
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,300
I have diligently tried to grasp what you, Your Highness, said today.

115
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,400
The emperor has great vision for the northwest frontier.

116
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,850
It's not something the likes of me could achieve.

117
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,690
In recent years, the Danchi have repeatedly disturbed our borders,

118
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,430
causing people's lives to be miserable.

119
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,900
They are a great threat to our country's stability.

120
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,120
General Gao, when I first arrived here, I heard people say on the street,

121
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,870
"As long as the banner of An of the western border waves,

122
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,780
the Danchi people will immediately hide away. But the moment the army leaves,

123
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,190
the Danchi people return again."

124
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:16,830
Is that true, General Gao?

125
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,250
Your Highness, I am ashamed.

126
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,140
It's really a shortage of troops

127
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,250
that forces me to run here and there

128
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,660
to stop the Danchi from being too brazen.

129
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,600
It's good now since Second Prince has brought a huge army to the northwestern border.

130
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,740
If we can confirm the crown prince's assassination

131
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,120
was definitely done by the Danchi people,

132
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,230
we can attack and destroy Danchi with proper justification.

133
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,900
We can surely eliminate His Imperial Majesty's big trouble and establish huge military merit.

134
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,810
Your Highness, I am willing to pledge to fight for you

135
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,730
and help you return to court with military merit.

136
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,510
[Wine]

137
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,700
Next time, there will be two new bottles of wine. Come again. Take care.

138
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,360
Pei. General Pei!

139
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,120
I'm not here to drink wine.

140
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,230
If not wine, you can come in for tea. Let's go.

141
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,420
I'm just passing by.

142
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,910
You can't just pass by my place. Come on in and have tea.

143
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,530
Come.

144
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,870
Come.

145
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,040
Let go.

146
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,680
- General Gao.
- Yes, Your Highness.

147
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,470
Your father is the empress's biological uncle.

148
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,970
- So that makes you her cousin.
- Yes.

149
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,940
Then, why are you helping me?

150
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,010
Your Highness, by helping you with merit:

151
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,170
For one, it's for peace along the border. Even more so, peace for Li Empire.

152
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,430
Once the world is at peace,

153
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,630
I can safely stay at the border for the rest of my days.

154
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,110
Okay, then tell me.

155
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,870
Do you have any ideas on how to help me achieve this merit?

156
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:18,090
Your Highness, Danchi is situated in the far north,

157
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,130
where the land is treacherously difficult.

158
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,980
It's hard to destroy them in one strike.

159
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,920
- However...
- Say it.

160
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,000
Your Highness,

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,290
Danchi's most important spot is Khan Tömür's tent.

162
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,420
It's situated in its core.

163
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,460
All the important Danchi leaders are inside.

164
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,710
Even though Khan Tömür's tent frequently changes location,

165
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,370
the changes are very unpredictable such that regular people aren't able to find it easily.

166
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:49,180
But once we find it,

167
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,930
we can definitely take Danchi in one strike.

168
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,940
Good.

169
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,170
As long as you help me find it,

170
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,340
I will remember to treat you well.

171
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,230
Thank you, Prince Xuande.

172
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,680
Your Highness, I'll take my leave.

173
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,600
This is from my private wine collection.

174
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,040
It has a strong after-effect.

175
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,020
I have seen this gentleman around. You are?

176
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,480
I'm in the tea business.

177
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,890
People call me Mr. Five.

178
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,850
Mr. Five? So you are the fifth child in your family?

179
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:41,270
You asked too many questions. Talk less and pour the wine.

180
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,960
All right.

181
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,220
Okay, enjoy your wine.

182
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,030
- Gentlemen, do you have enough wine?
- Another bottle.

183
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,550
There are all kinds of people here.

184
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,730
Because this is a border town, it has all walks of life.

185
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,580
They just work for different masters for different gains.

186
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,410
- What else can I get you?
- Another bottle of wine.

187
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,070
Your Highness, do you believe him?

188
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,760
It doesn't matter if I believe him or not.

189
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,140
If he can be used, I'll use him. If he can't be used,

190
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,830
then I'll kill him.

191
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,340
Gao Xian is not an issue.

192
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,000
Li Chengyin is the problem.

193
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,890
We need to get rid of him to avoid future trouble.

194
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,390
Pei Zhao is always by his side.

195
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,580
To get rid of him...

196
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,030
will not be easy.

197
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,520
I have a suggestion that can kill two birds with one stone.

198
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,830
Didn't we talk about finding Khan Tömür's tent?

199
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,540
Let Li Chengyin do it. It'll be great military merit if he can accomplish it.

200
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,420
You have reached the marriageable age. Sooner or later, you'll marry.

201
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,090
If you marry the Li Empire's crown prince and become the crown princess consort,

202
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,040
that'll be the highest honor.

203
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,830
I don't want it.

204
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,530
I don't want any of that honor.

205
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,540
I've already met the fifth prince.

206
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,610
He is a little skinny, but his looks and bearing are top-notch.

207
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm sure that the crown prince is an outstanding elite among mankind.

208
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,810
You will be taken good care of.

209
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:56,260
Dad, I've already said I don't care about that.

210
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,170
I'd rather marry a shepherd, so I can frequently come home to visit you and mom.

211
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,970
A royal princess should take herself with high regard!

212
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,180
Two years ago, didn't someone else come ask for your hand?

213
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,010
You also cried and rejected the offer.

214
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,290
If you had married at that time, you wouldn't have to marry for the kingdom now.

215
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,430
Do you mean...

216
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,920
if I get engaged with someone else, I wouldn't have to marry the crown prince of the Li Empire?

217
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,770
Let me make it clear to you.

218
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,890
Don't get some wild ideas.

219
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,770
Just wait for your marriage date.

220
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,960
Fifth Prince,

221
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,880
if we can successfully find Khan Tömür's tent,

222
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,330
it will indeed be a great achievement.

223
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,880
His Imperial Majesty will definitely be pleased.

224
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,860
But it will be a dangerous journey.

225
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:05,240
It's important to win a battle, but your safety, Fifth Prince, is even more important.

226
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,120
I recommend that

227
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,830
you should think it over, Fifth Prince.

228
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,620
General Gao, have you changed your mind, too?

229
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,460
You're now sure that the Danchi people killed my elder brother?

230
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,370
I'm just guessing.

231
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,510
It doesn't count without solid evidence.

232
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,520
But the Danchi have been bothering our border,

233
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,390
I think His Imperial Majesty probably wants to take this chance to crush them anyway.

234
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,250
This way, we can pacify the border in one go.

235
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,030
All right, I will go look for Khan Tömür's tent.

236
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,950
Fifth Prince,

237
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,660
you must be very careful then.

238
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,000
Yuan Tong.

239
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,030
Yes.

240
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,590
Immediately...

241
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,760
block all news.

242
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,920
We will closely check for spies within the city.

243
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
And kill them on the spot.

244
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,700
[Zhi Bei An Min]

245
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,770
Follow them.

246
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,850
- Mi Luo.
- Grandpa, come in.

247
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,070
Let me.

248
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,010
- What's going on?
- Mi Luo, hurry.

249
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,110
- Leave now.
- What happened?

250
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,490
How did you get hurt so badly?

251
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,330
There is no time for explanation.

252
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,840
Leave now.

253
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,730
You leave now.

254
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,680
Open the door.

255
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,450
- No.
- Go!

256
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,570
Go now or you'll die here.

257
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,680
After her.

258
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,150
Don't move, or I'll kill you.

259
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,820
General Pei, we followed a female spy here.

260
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,530
Have you seen her?

261
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,340
Female spy? I was patrolling right here.

262
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:12,700
I haven't seen one.

263
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,650
It's almost day time. You guys can go back and rest.

264
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,700
Remember. Don't disturb the citizens.

265
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,340
Understood.

266
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,780
You can go.

267
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,960
Grandpa is dead.

268
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,040
I have no other family.

269
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,790
I don't know where else to go.

270
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,900
If you don't have a place to go,

271
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,810
then go to the Shangjing.

272
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,130
Thank you.

273
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,270
Hey!

274
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,060
Princess wants you two to go in for a bit.

275
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,380
Your Highness.

276
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,740
There seems to be a strange odor in my room.

277
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,940
It's so smelly.

278
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,400
Quickly check it.

279
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,490
Your Highness,

280
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,410
I only smell fragrant perfume. I don't smell any stink.

281
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,380
I don't smell anything bad, either.

282
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,830
No way! You should smell again.

283
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,330
It's pretty strong. Check every place.

284
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,170
Smell it.

285
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,690
I think it's this one.

286
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,630
Hurry and come. Take a look at this.

287
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,040
Is it this odor?

288
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,130
Wake up.

289
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,420
It's all your lousy idea.

290
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,930
Lying to the princess that that regular incense

291
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,320
is Central Plain's sleeping smoke.

292
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,030
Now, every time we have to pretend to be unconscious.

293
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,070
Would you prefer to get knocked in the head or to pretend to have fainted?

294
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,060
Since we can't stop Ninth Princess from running away,

295
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,140
we might as well get some sleep in the mean time.

296
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,740
But His Majesty sent us here to guard the princess.

297
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,250
Are we disobeying his order?

298
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,340
You've seen how the king was just now.

299
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,300
Ninth Princess is his favorite.

300
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,200
Those bans are just bluffs.

301
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,780
He never follows through.

302
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,870
It's better we don't piss off Ninth Princess,

303
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,740
or we will be the ones in trouble.

304
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,380
You are so right.

305
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,870
The Danchi are nomadic people. They never live permanently in one place.

306
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,460
They actually choose a remote, difficult-to-reach location.

307
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,830
Hence, no one really knows where Khan Tömür's tent is.

308
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,400
For Li Chengye to give such a mission to Chengyin...

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,340
He probably has an ulterior motive.

310
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,550
Second Prince doesn't look like

311
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,680
a simple, honest person.

312
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,550
Jian'er,

313
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,160
for this mission of Chengyin to find the tent of Khan Tömür,

314
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,220
you must protect him.

315
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,910
If you can help him succeed, he will be closer to the crown prince position.

316
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,870
I will certainly help him with my full force.

317
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,120
But with just our help,

318
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,920
it is probably still insufficient.

319
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,940
There is one person who can probably help.

320
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,540
Who?

321
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:28,000
Khan Tömür's granddaughter,

322
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,070
the Xi State's ninth princess.

323
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,870
Xiaofeng?

324
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,230
If Xiaofeng can ally with the fifth prince,

325
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,070
that would be a great team.

326
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,100
No, Godfather!

327
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,130
If we find Khan Tömür's tent,

328
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,930
the Central Plains will definitely attack Danchi.

329
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,130
How will Xiaofeng place herself?

330
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,260
I cannot use her like this! I can't—

331
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,770
Gu Jian!

332
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,920
Have you forgotten what I told you?

333
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,990
Fine.

334
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,400
I'll tell them to you again.

335
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:11,140
We are all given our own fate.

336
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,730
You carry a huge grudge of your family's slaughter.

337
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:19,450
You are the only remaining heir of the Gu clan!

338
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,110
No matter how heavy and hard the burden is,

339
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,640
you have to shoulder it!

340
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,800
For that, you have to forget your sentiments.

341
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,290
Are you really willing to betray all the innocent and aggrieving souls

342
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,460
of the Gu family just for a woman?

343
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,330
Willing to betray your clan?

344
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,700
You are Xiaofeng's teacher.

345
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,700
She trusts you the most.

346
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,590
Take her to meet the fifth prince.

347
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,560
Once she trusts him,

348
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,460
think of a way to make her...

349
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,060
take him to find Khan Tömür's tent.

350
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,590
[General's Manor]

351
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,040
Your Highness, why are you still searching for him?

352
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,910
This is my last try.

353
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
He didn't come the last time you did it.

354
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,820
Teacher!

355
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,550
Teacher, you are finally here!

356
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,200
Of course, I will come.

357
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,760
What's the matter? Did something happen?

358
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,450
I have thought of an idea about the marriage alliance.

359
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,440
What's your idea?

360
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,340
See, if I am already engaged to someone else, then I can't be sent away for the marriage alliance.

361
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,270
And I won't have to worry about that Li Empire crown prince anymore.

362
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,770
So?

363
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,260
So...

364
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,450
So...

365
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,210
I was thinking...

366
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,810
I want you and I to be engaged to be married! This way, I won't be forced to marry into the Li Empire!

367
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,670
Don't misunderstand.

368
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:58,000
I don't mean to marry for real.

369
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,940
As long as we put on a show to fool my father, that's enough.

370
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,810
Do you agree?

371
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,310
No.

372
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,330
Why?

373
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,840
Do you think I'm not a good match for you?

374
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,610
That it's embarrassing to even play an act with me?

375
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,550
It's not that.

376
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,440
Then why?

377
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,400
Didn't you say you'd agree to anything I ask?

378
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,900
I trusted you so much.

379
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,240
But you?

380
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,940
You are on Father's side.

381
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:12,800
Xiaofeng, it's I who is not worthy of you.

382
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,310
I'm a person carrying a revenge mission.

383
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,230
I do not deserve someone innocent and happy like you.

384
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,860
I cannot turn you into someone like me

385
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:28,300
and get entangled into these blood debts and hatred.

I have actually

391
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,890
found you the most perfect man in the world.

392
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,020
The most perfect man in the world?

393
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,980

Teacher, I think it's better that I don't go.

404
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,570
Go on!

405
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,800
- It's you?
- It's you?

406
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,550
That person that my Teacher said to be the

407
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,360
most something, something, is you?

408
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,660
Have you recovered from your injury?

409
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,900
Yes.

410
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,140
Why did you previously leave without saying anything?

411
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,090
Didn't I leave a letter for you?

412
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,180
You even have the nerve to say that?

413
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,240
I don't know how to read the words from the Central Plains.

414
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,460
What was written on that cloth?

415
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,900
What are you doing here?

416
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,960
I'm not telling you.

417
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,570
Hey, you haven't told me your name!

418
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,710
You don't know who I am?

419
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,340
I'm the ninth princess of Xi State.

420
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,250
My father is the king of Xi State.

421
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,050
My mother is the daughter of the khan of Danchi.

422
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,470
My grandfather is Danchi's most powerful Khan Tömür.

423
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,680
Oh, Khan Tömür...

424
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,290
I heard that when the bald eagles of the desert

425
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,280
hear his name, they won't even dare to fly down.

426
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,710
It's good that you know. Let me tell you.

427
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:04,300
If you dare to be impolite to me, my royal father will tie you behind the horse and drag you to death.

428
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,860
How could a nice girl like you just scare people left and right?

429
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,250
Do you know who I am?

430
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,750
I am Gu Xiaowu from the Central Plains. My father is an owner of a tea plantation.
("xiaowu" means little fifth)

431
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,250
My mother is the wife of the plantation owner.

432
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:23,740
My grandfather is an ordinary tea trader.

433
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,620
Although I don't have much backing, if you tie me to the back of the horse and drag me to death,

434
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,960
your Xi State wouldn't have any more nice tea leaves for drinking.

435
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,970
I didn't expect...

436
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,210
that the best woman in this world that Gu Jian wanted to introduce to me

437
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,620
was even the ninth princess of Xi State.

438
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,980
