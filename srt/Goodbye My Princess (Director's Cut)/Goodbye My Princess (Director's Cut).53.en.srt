♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,650
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

[Episode 53]

17
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,750
Xiaofeng, I've come back.

18
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,450
Xiaofeng, everything is over.

19
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,090
I finally don't have to pretend anymore.

20
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,430
Xiaofeng, I love you.

21
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,950
I truly love you.

22
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,310
I will forget what happened between you and Gu Xiaowu.
I really will forget it.

23
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,430
Promise me that you will forget him, too?

24
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,350
We will begin again...

25
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,230
Why?

26
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,820
Why do you hate me so much?

27
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,250
Why?

28
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,170
I only want you to forget Gu Xiaowu.

29
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,500
Is it that difficult?

30
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,240
You want me to forget him?

31
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,790
Gu Xiaowu?

32
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,850
I hate myself for not being able to forget him!

33
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,300
I really hate myself for not forgetting him!

34
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,260
Then just kill me!

35
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,320
Come.

36
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,370
Come!

37
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,170
Kill me!

38
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,120
Kill me!

39
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,930
Princess!

40
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,350
A'Du.

41
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,780
A'Du, where did you go just now?

42
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,280
I can't forget him.

43
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,860
Quick! Hurry up!

44
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,870
- ...don't...
- Your Imperial Highness, what are you saying?

45
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,190
Xiaofeng, don't leave me!

46
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,360
Xiaofeng, don't leave me!

47
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,860
Xiaofeng... Xiaofeng... Xiaofeng...

48
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,610
Xiaofeng, don't leave me!

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,740
Xiaofeng...

50
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,620
Hurry! Hurry!

51
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,590
Hurry!

52
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,610
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

53
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,190
Hurry!

54
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,520
- Related Lady of Excellence, the physicians are here!
- Your Imperial Highness!

55
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,220
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

56
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,790
A'Du,

57
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,940
don't you think I'm really useless?

58
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,940
No.

59
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,520
I knew he was that person,

60
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,080
but I still couldn't do it.

61
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,590
If it's like this,

62
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,450
can we really escape from the Eastern Palace

63
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,070
to return to the Xi State?

64
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,890
Of course. If you want to run away, I can help you.

65
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,960
I mean it. I can help you run away from here.

66
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,120
The guards at the Eastern Palace

67
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,670
can't be guarding against me, either.

68
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,700
Why?

69
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,660
Why?

70
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,180
Don't you understand?

71
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,220
I love Chengyin.

72
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,710
I've loved him from the first moment that I saw him.

73
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,650
With my Zhao family's prestige, I am qualified to marry the crown prince.

74
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,260
But I didn't really care about the title of the crown princess consort.

75
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,590
I only wanted to be with that usually lonely fifth prince.

76
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,260
I only wanted to stay by the side of

77
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,150
that fifth prince who always seemed to be worried about something.

78
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,240
I wanted to hear his sorrow, make him happy.

79
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,510
He actually talked to me about everything then.

80
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,560
He trusted me and I trusted him.

81
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:53,080
He said that he would only love me.

82
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,780
But ever since he's had you, he's changed.

83
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,180
He doesn't love me anymore.

84
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,070
It's all because of you... It's all because of you!

85
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,560
He is so nice to you.

86
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,620
Nicer than when he was the nicest to me.

87
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,550
But you? You hurt him with a knife,

88
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,420
yet he is still calling your name in his dream.

89
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,890
But...

90
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,060
do you love him as much as I do?

91
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,920
Do you love him?

92
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,860
No.

93
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,690
I have never loved him.

94
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,860
That's why you must leave him.

95
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,640
Every scar that you've left on him,

96
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,520
is doubly carved onto my heart.

97
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,950
All right.

98
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,860
Tomorrow, at the East Corner Gate, I will have a horse-drawn carriage ready for you there.

[Supreme Ultimate Hall]

101
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,430
So, who died this time?

102
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,500
(No.)

103
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,710
No...

104
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,270
Not possible!

105
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,300
The bells are tolling for a noble consort.

106
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,550
Noble Consort Gao had excessive bleeding after a miscarriage.

107
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,290
She has died.

108
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,610
After all, I watched you grow up from infancy.

109
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,500
That's why I'm here to send you on your last journey, Grand Uncle.

110
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,600
Walnut cake.

111
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,270
Yes.

112
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,080
I remember when I was young, the first time you held me in your lap,

113
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,470
the dessert you fed me was this walnut cake.

114
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,000
It's nice that you still remember.

115
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,820
You asked me then, "Is it tasty?"

116
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,870
I said it was, and you gave me some more.

117
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,090
From then on, whenever I was obedient, you would reward me with walnut cake.

118
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,730
- Because you liked it
- It was you who liked it.

119
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,240
Because you liked me to be obedient.

120
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,860
Even though this walnut cake tasted like chewing wax,

121
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,890
I would still swallow it smiling,

122
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,020
so that I would be able to get rewards from you and the empress.

123
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,420
You're too scary.

124
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,790
You were so small, yet you knew you had to hide you desires.

125
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,750
I am inferior to you.

126
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,560
I only knew after getting old,

127
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,110
to plead illness to hide myself.

128
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,610
You're stronger than me.

129
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm here to bid you goodbye on your last journey.

130
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,050
I thought for a long time what I should send you off with.

131
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,010
After much thought, this tray of walnut cakes

132
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,850
is the most suitable. Don't you think so?

133
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,290
Yes.

134
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,510
Grand Uncle,

135
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,640
before you leave, please tell me something.

136
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,110
You had no grievances with the Gu family,

137
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,270
why did you have to kill them?

138
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,840
That year, when Gu Ruhui was in prison and I was sending him off,

139
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,630
he also asked the same question.

140
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:07,560
I only laughed a bit but didn't say anything.

141
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,390
Why?

142
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,100
Why did you have to kill them and also kill my mother?

143
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,120
Just because of the greediness of a villainous person like you,

144
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,890
just to be able to control all and hold power over the court?

145
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:30,700
Seems like to you, I can also only just offer a laugh.

146
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,830
You... You have the Li family's blood flowing in you,

147
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,890
but you are still a puppet.

148
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm a puppet? That's true.

149
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,710
Didn't the empress and you only want a puppet?

150
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:57,410
But it's this puppet that is taking away your life.

151
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,030
Tell me clearly.

152
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,090
You are smart for a time.
 (T/N: extended meaning: but not smart all the time.)

153
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,780
Why don't you think about it? With the Gao family's strength at that time,

154
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,520
how could we have knocked down the powerful Gu family?

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:18,660
- Bring them over.
- Yes.

Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty.

161
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:04,510
Should I call you Chai Mu or Chen Zheng?

162
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,680
I should not have lied to you.

163
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,790
I only wanted to exonerate the Gu and Chen families,

164
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,450
and to eliminate obstacles and schemers that are near you.

165
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:18,630
I couldn't help but use this last resort. Please forgive me, Your Imperial Majesty.

166
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,950
Your dedication for so many years has resulted in Gao Yuming's downfall.

167
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,020
To the overall court, one must agree that it's a good thing.

168
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,790
You may rise.

It's been twenty years since we last met.

I've thought of you.

So now, you should be able to restore Chen Zheng's identity.

180
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,650
Twenty years ago, Chen Zheng had died.

181
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,550
The current Chai Mu will also soon disappear forever.

182
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,140
Good.

183
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,500
To Chai Mu who will soon disappear forever, a full cup.

184
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,550
All right.

185
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,610
Have you ever regretted what you'd done, Your Imperial Majesty?

186
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,760
I've only done what an emperor has to do.

187
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,850
There's not much to regret about.

188
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,880
Even if this leads to losing everyone you love,

189
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,110
you still don't have a single thought of regret?

190
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,310
Mingyue,

191
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,690
it's not fearful to lose someone you love the most.

192
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,150
What's fearful is

193
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,990
to let the person you love

194
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,090
to be used by others

195
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,850
to become your threat.

196
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,370
The most fearful is when you are schemed against

197
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,350
by the person you love.

198
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:00,860
Without the seed sown in the past, then there wouldn't be a fruit that grew after.

199
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,230
When you lose one, you will lose a second one.

200
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,630
To protect yourself, you will keep losing everyone until they are all gone.

201
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,570
Maybe that's when you can sleep soundly.

202
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,220
But you won't have someone close to your heart anymore sharing your pillow.

203
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,510
If I can keep one, that's enough.

204
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:28,040
You can manipulate someone who schemes, but you cannot manipulate someone who doesn't care.

205
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,560
Mingyue,

206
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,240
the way you look and when you smile,

207
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,760
are truly very similar to Pure Consort Shu.

208
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,440
I really loved Pure Consort Shu.

209
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,590
But now, I also truly love you.

210
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,030
Your Imperial Majesty, will you let my father go?

211
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,150
Yes, I will.

212
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,250
I grew up in the Singing Moon Brothel.

213
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,860
When a man tells me something,

214
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,610
I can tell truth from lies in one look.

215
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,940
Then, have you ever loved me?

216
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,550
You lie. I can tell in one look.

217
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,920
You truly love me. Don't you?

218
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,970
Don't you understand yet?

219
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,870
We cannot return to the past anymore.

220
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,870
I am the emperor. If I say we can, then we can!

221
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,470
For everything that's happened, I can look past them.

222
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,120
Mingyue, let's forget all the unhappiness.

223
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,690
From now on, you are my wife.

224
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,170
I am your husband. There is also our child.

225
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,030
This baby is a blessing from Heaven

226
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,380
to let us forget about the past

227
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,610
and have a new beginning.

228
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,050
Yuyao.

229
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,120
- Why are you crying?
- I hate you!

230
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,600
Yuyao...

231
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,290
Mingyue.

232
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,320
Mingyue! Mingyue!

233
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,130
Imperial Physician!

234
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,350
Hurry!

235
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,530
Hurry!

236
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,550
Your Imperial Highness, the emperor has suffered a stroke.

237
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,380
His four limbs are unresponsive and he cannot speak.

238
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,500
These are the usual symptoms.

239
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,280
Besides taking medications, he needs constant and quiet rest.

240
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,790
He cannot suffer any stimulation again.

241
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,570
You've worked hard.

242
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,680
Yes.

243
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,500
[Longevity and Benevolence Palace]

244
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:05,710
Grand Empress Dowager, let's slow down. Nothing must happen to you, too.

245
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,750
Let's go back.

246
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,090
We're not going there anymore.

247
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,460
You don't want to see the emperor?

248
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:20,540
His current illness is not like those in the past.

249
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,950
You should go and see him.

250
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,410
So what if I go?

251
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,780
My son,

252
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,700
grandson,

253
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,520
great-grandson,

254
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,990
they stand up and then fall.

255
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,170
After they fall,

256
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,120
they stand up again.

257
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,690
That dragon throne

258
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,180
ultimately

259
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,580
will be occupied

260
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,430
by a

261
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,460
new emperor.

262
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,660
Let's go back.

263
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,640
Help me up.

264
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,440
Go back!

265
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,450
You've been the father who I looked up to since my childhood,

266
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,620
but you've never given me fatherly love.

267
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,990
You were always cold and uncaring to me.

268
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,400
Later, I realized that

269
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,320
you were concerned about the Gao family's power.

270
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,860
You were afraid that the son raised by the empress would become the outstanding one among the princes.

271
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,770
When you were dealing against opponents here and there, you began to forget

272
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,760
that I was your child.

273
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,090
You are now lying in front of me,

274
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,530
so fragile, so helpless,

275
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,470
just like a regular old person.

276
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,890
But I've suddenly felt

277
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,260
that you now

278
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,820
look more like a father.

279
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,200
You reigned supreme for your whole life.

280
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,860
You probably never dreamed that the person who ultimately defeated you

281
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,850
was not the capable enemy that you feared every day,

282
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,270
but a delicate woman who was insignificant to the world

283
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,210
and an unborn child.

284
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:48,680
Father, you ultimately couldn't get past the trial of love.

285
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,520
But right now, all those who loved you

286
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,470
and those you've loved,

287
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,960
are all gone.

288
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,400
I understand that

289
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,460
to secure your throne, you had to be cold and ruthless.

290
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,480
How I am now

291
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,060
is also learned from you.

292
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,850
Rest assured, I will definitely become a good emperor.

293
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,940
Father, you should rest.

294
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,500
Stop!

295
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,080
General Pei, it's me.

296
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,810
My Lady.

297
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,030
Imperial Father is ill. I am going to the Jade Spring Temple to pray for him.

298
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,320
Please let me through.

299
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,890
My Lady, there can be trouble outside of the palace. Please take extra caution.

300
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,170
Thank you, General Pei, for your reminder.

301
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,590
- Let them through.
- Let them through.

302
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,440
Thank you for helping us escape. I'll remember it.

303
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,880
Once you leave, just forget all of us.

304
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,520
I don't want, nor do I hope, that you'll remember me.

305
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,370
Helping you leave is not for your sake,

306
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,470
but for my own sake.

307
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,080
We've arrived.

308
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,280
Then we part now. Maybe fate will let us meet again.

309
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,470
Don't say we'll meet again.

310
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,690
We will never meet again.

311
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,710
I can't believe we got out this easily.

312
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,960
Princess, don't be sad.

313
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,180
Leaving here is good for us.

314
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,450
I'm not sad.

315
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,200
I am suddenly envious of Lady Zhao a little.

316
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,000
I envy her that

317
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,520
she can love someone without any concern.

318
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,650
Now that I'm gone,

319
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,420
there won't be any barrier between her and Li Chengyin.

320
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,170
You are not a barrier. It's because you saw through him clearly.

321
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,490
You don't want him anymore.

322
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,810
Let's go. We'll go back home.

323
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,810
- Return to Xi State.
- Okay.

324
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,470
Stop the carriage for inspection.

325
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,020
Louxi?

326
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,790
General Pei, how come you don't recognize your own manor's carriage, too.

327
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:15,300
I knew it. Louxi, why did you enter the palace?

328
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,300
This Eastern Palace is where my fifth brother resides, how couldn't I come?

329
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,100
Oh, so you're here to visit the crown prince. I'll escort you there.

330
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,830
I especially came to see you.

331
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,280
Luoxi, I'm currently on duty.

332
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,630
Why are you so serious?

333
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,960
I'm not here to see you.

334
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,650
Today, I went to the temple to pray for Imperial Father

335
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,660
and happened to pass by here, so I visited you in passing.

336
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,060
I see, so you are being a good daughter.

337
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,850
Luoxi, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao also went to the temple to pray. Did you see her?

338
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,740
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao? I didn't see her.

339
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,330
The Jade Spring Temple has organized a sutra chanting for Imperial Father today. When I left the temple, the gates were already closed.

340
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,890
I'm leaving now then.

341
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,680
Go now.

342
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,500
Imperial Father is ill. I am going to the Jade Spring Temple to pray for him.

343
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,790
Please let us through.

344
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,590
Oh no! Quick! Bring me my horse!

345
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,710
It is you

346
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,340
who took them away.

347
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,520
Yes.

348
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,730
You are not even trying to deny it.

349
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:17,520
I don't need to deny it.

350
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,220
I did this

351
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,110
in order to unburden you of your worries.

352
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,450
Unburden my worries?

353
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,360
I am indeed unburdening you of your worries.

354
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,860
Is this called unburdening my worries?!

355
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,940
Don't think that I don't know what you are scheming!

356
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,780
Your Imperial Highness, I did it

357
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,350
because I understand that she does not deserve your affections.

358
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:48,860
It is not up to you to decide if she is deserving or not.

359
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,170
Do you know that what you did is punishable by death?!

360
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,870
Your Imperial Highness, are you really going to give me the death penalty?

361
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,910
It was I who begged her to take me out of the palace. This has nothing to do with her.

362
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,820
If you want to punish someone, then punish me.

363
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Be quiet! Of course, I will punish you!

364
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,910
You have been in the palace for so long. Why have you not made any progress?

365
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,080
You believe anyone's words.

366
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,680
The days I have spent in the palace

367
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,870
was to discern a person's character all over again.

368
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,680
The time I have spent is indeed too long.

369
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,600
What are you saying?

370
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,410
Your Imperial Highness, she has never liked you.

371
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,690
Do you really not understand this?

372
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:38,500
She personally told me that she does not like you! That she does not care about you!

373
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,820
She has not even an ounce of affection for you.

374
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,670
In this palace, she would rather choose me to take her away from here,

375
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:49,030
than to be forced to stay by your side.

376
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:59,100
Even if her heart does not have me in it,

377
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,600
my heart only has her in it.

378
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,340
Then, what about me?

379
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,610
What am I to you?!

380
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,510
Exploitation! From the beginning to the end, I have always been exploiting you! Are you satisfied now?!

381
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,550
So it was just exploitation.

382
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,550
I thought that I loved you and you also loved me.

383
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,160
But in the end, this was all just exploitation?!

384
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,760
I, Zhao Sese, since the first time I saw you,

385
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,940
had already fallen in love with you.

386
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,900
From that moment, I lost myself.

387
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,240
My entire life revolved around you.

388
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,840
Everything that I have done was also for you.

389
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:11,120
I saw you marry someone else with my own eyes,

390
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,590
but I stupidly told myself

391
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,950
that as long as your heart still had me in it, then I still had not lost.

392
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,030
But now,

393
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,900
you are telling me...

394
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,260
that these past years have been my own wishful thinking?!

395
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,750
I do not blame you.

396
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,870
I do not blame you.

397
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,340
It was I who wanted to like you.

398
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,920
But this time,

399
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,640
I must admit that I have lost.

400
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,890
I did not lose to her,

401
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,480
but lost instead to

402
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,110
the love for you, what I gambled everything on.

403
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,580
You just lost

404
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,230
the person who loved you the most in this world.

405
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,780
I grieve for you.

406
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:36,540
