00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,300
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,340
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,210
How about this? Why don't we change the competition type?

4
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,230
Okay. What does Brother Gu want to compete in?

5
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,140
Why don't we choose archery?

6
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,960
Archery?

7
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,930
What? You want to compete in archery with my brother?

8
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,810
Xiaowu, in the grasslands, no one can win against Heshi in archery. Don't blindly take challenges.

9
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,970
Believe in me.

10
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,700
What do you think Brother Heshi?

11
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,220
Okay. Heshi is a famous warrior of Danchi.

12
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,520
Gu Xiaowu is the warrior that killed the white-eyed wolf king.

13
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,410
A hero versus a hero. This competition will be once in a lifetime.

14
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,490
Spread my order. Have the High Priest prepare the sacrificial ceremony.

15
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,030
Yes!

16
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,830
Bring them out!

17
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,360
Move!

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,270
Hurry up and get out!

19
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,510
Quickly, catch up. Hurry up!

20
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,720
Where is the target?

21
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,490
These are the targets.

22
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,250
These targets can move.

23
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,830
You, keep up!

24
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,560
Wait!

25
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,090
Elder Cousin, slaves are people, too. How can we kill them like some toys?

26
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,580
Slaves from the Li Empire are just toys.

27
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,540
No!

28
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,640
How about this?

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,540
I've heard there are a lot of bats up the glacier.

30
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,820
By dusk, Heshi and I

31
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,570
will each have 100 arrows,

32
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,830
and we'll see who can shoot down the most number of bats in the fastest time. How about it?

33
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,640
Sounds good.

34
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,500
That means I won't be able to use these slaves.

35
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,500
Take them back!

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,900
Go back!

37
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,750
Hurry up! Quickly move!

38
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,640
Faster!

39
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,650
Brother Gu, you can use my bow.

40
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,060
What? Does Danchi not even have a spare bow?

41
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,320
This bow is heavier than your average one.

42
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,190
With Gu Xiaowu's weak scholar-like frame,

43
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,580
he probably won't even be able to pull the string.

44
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,980
Grandfather is purposely making things harder for Xiaowu.

45
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,690
I'll talk to him.

46
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,160
Don't go over there yet. If you go now, Our Khan's reputation will be affected,

47
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,870
and Gu Xiaowu won't have it easy.

48
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,530
My Khan.

49
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,940
Just let Brother Gu use my bow instead.

50
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,550
You can give the iron bow to me.

51
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:16,050
If a man can't even pick up a bow, how can he marry my granddaughter?

52
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,380
Scholar from the Central Plains, look at how refined and sophisticated you are.

53
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,350
That isn't your people's zither. It's a weapon that can kill enemies.

54
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,300
Look at this fine skinny scholar.

55
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,540
Be careful not to let the bow hurt you!

56
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,050
All right. Begin.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Brother Gu, are you ready?

58
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,850
Good!

59
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,160
Great skills!

60
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,280
Xiaowu! Arrows are meant to be shot one by one.

61
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,200
Great!

62
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,610
Awesome!

63
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,980
Great!

64
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,050
Okay!

65
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,180
Report! They each shot 100 bats!

66
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,230
I lost.

67
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,300
Brother Heshi, I was able to shoot multiple arrows due to the strong bow.

68
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,410
If I used yours, I definitely would have been slower.

69
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,460
Besides, if you were to say I beat you,

70
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,860
then that's actually an unfair battle.

71
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,170
That's right! No one lost!

72
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,420
Heshi is still Danchi's greatest warrior!

73
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,650
So straightforward! Man from the Central Plains, what do you want as a reward?

74
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,500
My Khan, what in this world

75
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,770
is more precious than our little princess.

76
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,820
Come with me.

77
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Little Princess, be patient!

78
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,840
Let Our Khan speak privately with Brother Gu!

79
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,040
My Khan, what did you want to talk about?

80
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,660
What is Grandfather doing?

81
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,410
- Xiaowu!
- Little Princess!

82
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,320
Elder cousin, let me inside!

83
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,890
Little Princess! You can't go in. Wait for a while.

84
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,750
Grandfather has his own plans.

85
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,400
Maybe he just wants to test out Brother Gu's martial art skills.

86
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,510
Don't be anxious.

87
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,070
- Grandfather!
- You can't go inside!

88
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,620
- Let me inside!
- You can't go in!

89
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,490
Xiaowu!

90
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,320
- Elder Cousin!
- Don't worry!

91
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,910
My Khan, you should let me know what's going on before killing me,

92
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,420
so that I can die a clear death!

93
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,750
I have fought hand-to-hand with the Gu family for many years.

94
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,310
I know the Five Beads Continuous Arrows technique better than anyone!

95
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,060
What is Gu Ruhui to you?

96
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,230
Identifying me as a part of the Gu family because of a technique,

97
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,260
isn't that being too arbitrary?

98
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,960
Five Beads Continuous Arrows is the Gu family's mastery technique

99
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,470
that will not be passed to outsiders.

100
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,380
Fine. Since you claim you aren't a part of the Gu family,

101
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,010
then I will eliminate a technique thief like you on behalf of the Gu family!

102
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,270
I am from the Gu family!

103
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,530
The Gu family has been upright and righteous.

104
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,670
How can they have a descendant that refuses to acknowledge his ancestors?

105
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,170
Looks like the Gu family is not far from annihilation.

106
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,220
My Khan, there's something you don't know.

107
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,860
Twenty years ago, the Gu family had been framed by an evil subject.

108
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,230
The whole clan has been exterminated.

109
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,340
I was sent out of the capital under the protection of a subordinate.

110
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,690
Other than my family surname,

111
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,940
my identity has been hidden.

112
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,050
I am now a tea merchant in the Western Border.

113
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:37,160
My Khan, you know my true identity.

114
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,030
I am a descendant of the Gu family.

115
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,430
I fear that Danchi will get implicated if the Li Empire knows about it.

116
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,020
My Khan, I will leave Danchi today.

117
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,390
You think I am afraid of the Li Empire?

118
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,380
Gu Xiaowu, you killed the white-eyed wolf king.

119
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,930
I've already made a statement.

120
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,360
You cannot refuse to be my grandson-in-law.

121
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,470
Thank you, My Khan. I will surely hide my identity well

122
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,080
and not bring any trouble to Danchi and Xiaofeng.

123
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,210
Hide your identity? Do you not want to take revenge for your family?

124
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,070
Of cour—

125
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:52,040
Gu Ruhui and I were sworn enemies, but also friends that faced life and death together.

126
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,910
Gu Xiaowu, since you are descendant of the Gu family and can't return to the Central Plains,

127
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,710
just stay in Danchi and fight battles with me.

128
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,520
The stupid emperor and evil officials of Li Empire all deserve to die.

129
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,030
One day, Danchi will help you take revenge.

130
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,880
I am under your commands, My Khan.

131
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,940
What did you call me?

132
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,230
Grandfather!

133
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,480
Grandfather! What were you guys doing earlier?

134
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,990
Xiaofeng, come here.

135
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,850
I, Khan Tömür, officially announces that,

136
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,080
starting today, hero Gu Xiaowu

137
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,090
is my grandson-in-law!

138
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,870
Grandfather.

139
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,130
Brother Gu, here!

140
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,450
Here.

141
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,510
Cheers!

142
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,430
Stop drinking!

143
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,400
Your leg is still injured.

144
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,300
Little Sister, I told you already.

145
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,830
You haven't married him yet.

146
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,520
Why are you already worrying about him

147
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,090
and are even controlling him, too?

148
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,980
You two!

149
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,340
Don't think I don't know that you like to keep making others drink whenever you get so happy!

150
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,170
Is Xiaowu the same as you guys?

151
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,410
His leg is still injured.

152
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,970
I... I forgot.

153
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,060
Come back with me and get some rest.

154
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,750
I'm leaving now.

155
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,820
- Look at you.
- We didn't have enough to drink yet.

156
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,620
Look at you!

157
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,260
I'm leaving now.

158
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,790
Let's go!

159
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:30,280
Men from the Central Plains are afraid of their wives. No good.

160
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,330
- We can drink.
- Here, cheers!

161
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:36,200
Cheers!

162
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,120
Xiaowu.

163
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,110
We haven't gotten married yet.

164
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,540
Come with me.

165
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,180
Where?

166
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,590
Let's go!

167
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,940
Hurry.

168
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,110
Here, this way.

169
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,910
What are the wedding traditions like in Danchi?

170
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,720
Danchi weddings are quite simple.

171
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,470
The ceremony is completed when the wedded couple trade waistbands under the Great God's watch.

172
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,100
Who is the Great God?

173
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,220
The god in the sky.

174
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,240
He will watch us from the sky.

175
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,250
Let's trade waistbands now.

176
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,490
No! I haven't picked a nice one yet.

177
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay.

178
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,730
The weddings in Central Plains don't require the exchanging of waistbands.

179
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,850
What are they like?

180
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,360
I'll teach you. Your right hand should be on top,

181
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,910
like this.
(Ancient traditions: men with left hand on top, women with right.)

182
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,490
First kowtow to Heaven and Earth.

183
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,880
Second to the high altar.

184
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,910
What is that?

185
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,120
It means parents.

186
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,400
Your parents are in Xi State, mine in Li Empire.

187
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,220
We can bow towards the southeastern direction.

188
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,800
Come. Second bow to the high altar.

189
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,920
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

190
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,120
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

191
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,560
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

192
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,080
May the husband and wife exchange bows.

193
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,990
♫ A long dream ♫

194
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,600
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

195
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,860
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

196
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,330
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

197
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,630
♫ Can't forget  ♫

198
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,090
The ceremony is deemed complete this way.

199
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,550
After the wedded couple finish the ceremony, the way they address each other will change.

200
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,240
I will call you my wife

201
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,660
and you will call me husband.

202
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,990
Husband?

203
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,660
Yes, my wife.

204
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,730
It's really nice here.

205
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,100
Aside from major offering ceremonies,

206
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,340
people rarely come here.

207
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,640
It's nice and quiet.

208
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,050
Why don't we just hide here?

209
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,340
Never letting anyone else find us.

210
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,870
This way we won't have to worry about anything.

211
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,080
Gu Xiaowu,

212
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,830
what are you worrying about?

213
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,770
I am worried about my tea business going bad, and I won't be able to take care of my wife.

214
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,570
What's hard about that? As long as you're with the person that you like, anything will become good.

215
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,950
Xiaofeng, let me ask you a question.

216
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,810
Is it really okay to go anywhere as long as you're with me?

217
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,700
Where do you want to go?

218
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,260
Since we are already husband and wife,

219
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,380
you don't have to worry about your father forcing you into that political marriage.

220
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,120
Why don't we go travel along the Western Border?

221
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,450
Over there, it's the transition between summer and fall right now. The scenery is very beautiful.

222
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,400
If we get tired of that, we can go to Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) of the Li Empire.

223
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,090
There, every season is like spring. There are little bridges everywhere,

224
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,340
and flowing waters. It's really relaxing.

225
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,150
Okay.

226
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,130
I'll go with you. In the future, I'll go wherever you go. All right?

227
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,950
We can go say goodbye to Grandfather tomorrow.

228
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,520
Okay.

229
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,310
This is for you.

230
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,390
Why did you give it back to me?

231
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,130
This amulet that you gave me

232
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,820
saved my life when I was killing the wolf king. Now, I'm giving it to you,

233
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,630
hoping it can continue to protect you.

234
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,360
Then, does that mean you won't be protecting me in the future?

235
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,690
How could I dare not to?

236
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,570
I hope I can treat my little princess like a precious jewel every day.

237
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,070
You are starting to sound like Grandfather now.

238
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:25,370
Grandfather and you are the people that treat me the best in the world.

239
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,020
In the future, I will treat you even better than your grandfather.

240
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,450
Then, you can't betray me.

241
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,740
How could I?

242
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,560
If I do, you can punish me however you want.

243
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,300
If you betray me,

244
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,850
I will go drink the water of the River of Oblivion and forget you forever.

245
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,990
Silly girl, why would the world have a place like that?

246
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,720
Of course, there is. I've seen it myself.

247
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,450
All right,

248
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,610
we don't have to worry. We won't go there.

249
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,800
Great!

250
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,560
This won't do.

251
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,790
I've already sent invitations to other countries.

252
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,120
Telling them that you two will be getting married in seven days.

253
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,000
In no time, all the countries in the Western Border will know of your wedding with Gu Xiaowu.

254
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,170
You can go and play around,

255
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,160
but wait until after the wedding.

256
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,090
Little Sister, you aren't in a big rush anyway.

257
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,390
Grandfather will surely organize a grand wedding for you.

258
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,890
By then, your father won't be able to deny it.

259
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,590
Seven days isn't too long, right?

260
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,590
Of course, I didn't think about it thoroughly.

261
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,960
Thank you, Grandfather, for hosting our wedding.

262
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,860
- Princess.
- A'Du.

263
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,190
Gu JIan, your teacher, is outside the main camp waiting for you.

264
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,050
- He's here?
- Yes.

265
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,630
Teacher!

266
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,090
Teacher! What are you doing here?

267
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,730
Come back to Xi State with me.

268
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,210
I'm getting married. I'm not going back.

269
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,650
You've known him for how many days and you want to get married?

270
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,730
I am your teacher. I can't allow you to be so reckless.

271
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,110
I can't go!

272
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,510
What are you doing?

273
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,370
Let go of me, Teacher!

274
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,410
Brother Heshi... have you seen Xiaofeng?

275
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,900
Brother Gu, you don't know yet?

276
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,590
Her teacher is here,

277
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,440
which is also your cousin.

278
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,710
She went to find him.

279
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,050
Thank you, Brother Heshi.

280
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,780
Stop!

281
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,400
I can't go!

282
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,870
Stop it! Stop it!

283
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,520
Xiaowu!

284
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,290
Let me go!

285
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,200
Xiaowu! Xiaowu!

286
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,670
It's okay. I'm here.

287
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,590
Cousin, what were you doing?

288
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,270
Gu Xiaowu, I want to talk to you.

289
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,830
It's all right. I'll be right back.

290
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,750
Wait for me here.

291
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,140
Why isn't Your Highness taking Xiaofeng away yet?

292
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,860
If you can't, I will.

293
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,470
I have my own plans. No need for you to worry about it.

294
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,440
Our mission was to find the Danchi royal tent.

295
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,840
We have completed our mission. Why must you still bother Xiaofeng?

296
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:30,560
The longer you stay in Danchi, the greater the pain Xiaofeng will suffer.

297
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,570
Only by marrying her

298
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,720
can I officially take her away.

299
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,900
But have you thought about it? If you marry her now, how will you face her in the future?

300
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,400
I sincerely want to marry her.

301
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,480
I don't want her to live this type of runaway life anymore.

302
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,530
Back then, it was me who took Xiaofeng out.

303
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,980
Now, I will bring her back.

304
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,300
She isn't an item. You can't bring and take her as you please!

305
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,800
She is my wife.

306
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,650
Nobody can take her away.

307
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,780
Xiaofeng, I was too reckless earlier.

308
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,540
Sorry.

309
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,810
Then, Xiaowu and you...

310
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,600
We're fine.

311
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,260
Remember that I am always your teacher.

312
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,660
If one day, you want to leave

313
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:16,700
and you need me, just speak up and I'll be there.

314
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,420
Your Majesty.

315
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,640
Xiaofeng is getting married in Danchi?

316
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,540
Yes. Our Khan has invited Your Majesty and Her Majesty to attend the ceremony.

317
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,980
My daughter is getting married,

318
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,080
and yet I am the last one to find out!

319
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,340
And you even give me this?

320
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,450
Khan Tömür is bullying me intolerably!

321
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,240
My Khan's message and invitation have been delivered.

322
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,600
I'm hoping that Your Majesty will set off the next day

323
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,880
in order to not miss the little princess' wedding.

324
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:30,510
Your Majesty! I am here under the imperial command of the Li Empire to seek for a political marriage.
[Duke An of the State, Li Empire Envoy]

325
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,620
I've waited for months and all I get is the wedding news of the princess in Danchi?

326
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,730
Not only did you lie to me,

327
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:41,090
you lied to the emperor of the Li Empire!

328
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:44,860
Duke An of the State, my little girl is naughty and stubborn.

329
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,450
I received the news of her running away towards Danchi after it had already happened.

330
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,890
Your Majesty, this marriage concerns the alliance between our two countries.

331
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,090
It's not as simple as your Xi State marrying off a daughter.

332
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,990
Even if you can bear the crime of deceiving the emperor,

333
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,140
but can your citizens bear it?

334
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,790
Princess Mingyuan,

335
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,240
I never thought that your recent death,

336
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,050
your lifetime of painstaking effort is destroyed in an instant.

337
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,150
Duke An of the State! Duke An!

338
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,500
Duke An, please wait!

339
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:32,600
Duke An of the State, I still have two princesses at the age of marriage.

340
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,480
They can also head to the Central Plains for marriage.

341
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,970
I hope you can go back and put in some good words.

342
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,620
What His Imperial Majesty asks for is a direct line princess (daughter of the main wife).

343
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:51,310
An emperor's words are to be taken seriously. I will immediately send someone to inform His Majesty about the situation and ask for punishment.

344
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,390
I will also report whatever you just said.

345
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,790
May Your Majesty just wait for the decree.

346
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,790
How did we get to this point?

347
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,490
How did we get to this point?

348
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,090
Are you angry?

349
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,060
Your teacher treats you very well. Why didn't you leave with him?

350
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,720
I don't know...

351
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,740
why either.

352
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,610
Are you jealous?

353
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm not. He's my cousin. How could I be jealous?

354
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,220
I will tell you a joke.

355
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,150
They say that there was once a military general who went into battle

356
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,920
and almost lost to the enemy.

357
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,110
Suddenly, Heaven sent down its mythical army

358
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,540
and helped him defeat all of his enemies.

359
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,630
Then, feeling greatly indebted, the military general said, "Deity! Deity!

360
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,910
Where are you from? What's your name?"

361
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:01,930
The immortal said, "I am a haystack

362
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,440
and I am here to repay a kindness."

363
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,410
The military general was very bewildered.

364
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,800
He said, "When did I bestow you kindness?"

365
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,530
Do you know what the answer was?

366
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,110
I don't know.

367
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,520
Don't know? If you don't, make a guess.

368
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,760
Gu Xiaowu!

369
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,160
My teacher is my teacher. I respect him.

370
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,990
If he looks for me again, I will not hide it from you.

371
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:42,940
I only have you in my heart now.

372
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,440
So, why did that haystack save the general?

373
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,190
That haystack said, "Of course, you have bestowed kindness towards me.

374
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,710
When you were usually on the training ground, your arrows never shot me."

375
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,540
Isn't it funny?

376
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,800
It's very funny.

377
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,610
Gu Xiaowu! Gu Xiaowu!

378
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,630
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me, okay?

379
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:39,930
Don't touch me. Have you gone stupid from telling a joke like that?

380
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,160
Uncle! I heard that Li Yan brought the decree of His Imperial Majesty permitting the start of a war

381
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,040
back to the Protectorate General Office!

382
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,210
That was already several days ago.

383
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,410
Counting the days, I am afraid that he has already arrived there.

384
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,440
For such an important matter, why didn't you come into the palace to tell me?

385
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:05,440
I fear that His Imperial Majesty won't be too happy if you know too much.

386
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,500
Moreover, it's only some military matters and not something major.

387
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,890
How could it not be major? Li Yan is Li Chengye's person.

388
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,870
He will definitely take sides with his master.

389
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:18,240
If this war begins, Li Chengye will take control of the entire situation

390
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,530
and earn military merit for himself. What about my Chengyin?

391
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,670
There is actually one major situation. Gao Xian urgently reported that

392
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,190
the fifth prince was not at the Western Border Protectorate General Office these past days.

393
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,680
What? He's not there?

394
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,490
Where did he go?

395
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,990
Empress, don't get so anxious.

396
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,120
Although we don't know the fifth prince's whereabouts, Xian'er clearly said

397
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,650
that the second prince wasn't behind this.

398
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,840
This child, Chengyin, is too much.

399
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,360
It's fine that he was normally lazy and indolent back here in the palace.

400
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,100
Why isn't he fighting at this crucial moment?

401
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,390
If he allows Li Chengye to take military merit this time,

402
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,320
then chances of winning the crown prince position in the future would be slimmer!

403
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,060
Fifth Prince just doesn't want to fight, but he's not incapable.

404
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,490
On second thought, even if Fifth Prince missed this opportunity of gaining merit,

405
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:25,600
for the matter of appointing the crown prince, His Imperial Majesty can't make the decision right away.

406
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,580
Uncle, don't forget

407
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:47,430
to tell cousin to support Chengyin more while he is there.

408
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,000
This tea is too hot. Leave it for a while.

Prince, I'm back.

413
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,540
Take a seat first.

414
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,100
- Prince.
- Have your tea first.

415
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,650
I just brewed it.

416
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,590
Prince, I came back this time to bring back a decree from His Imperial Majesty.

417
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,130
There should not be any delay on the way.

418
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,910
His Imperial Majesty has already issued a decree for war. We can deploy the army to suppress Danchi at any time.

419
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,990
This is too good. I was planning on deploying the army at an earlier date.

420
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:38,820
This decree came at the right time.

421
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:41,430
Why do we have to deploy the army earlier?

422
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:43,640
A hero from the grasslands killed the white-eyed wolf king.

423
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,310
Danchi's Khan Tömür is really letting him marry his granddaughter.

424
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,090
The wedding is in two days.

425
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,410
On the day of the wedding, all the people of Danchi will be at the location.

426
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,210
They will be unable to defend themselves.

427
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,960
That is exactly my intent.

428
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:04,580
I have already discussed it with Gao Xian that we will dispatch our soldiers on that day.
