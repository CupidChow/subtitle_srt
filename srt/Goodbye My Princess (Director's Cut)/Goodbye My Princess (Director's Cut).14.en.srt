[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,040
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,130
King of Xi State, since the princess has come back,

4
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,400
the marriage alliance must still be completed.

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,130
You don't have any more excuses to delay it, right?

6
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,620
My child, escape now!

7
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,780
Dad! Dad!

8
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,260
Princess!

9
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,710
Dad!

10
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,420
King of Xi State, are you revolting?

11
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,220
Dad...

12
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,520
It's so unnecessary.

13
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,990
I shouldn't have ran way. It's all my fault.

14
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,000
Princess, you should try convincing His Majesty

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,640
to not hurt himself and not hurt the two nation's accord.

16
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,830
Ever since his queen died, King of Xi State

17
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,350
has frequently acted crazy.

18
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:11,620
As long you agree to the marriage alliance, I will report to His Imperial Majesty

19
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,400
that the king broke down and accidentally hurt the envoys of Central Plains.

20
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,950
This way, he is still the king of Xi State.

21
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,990
Your state will even receive honor and gifts from the emperor.

22
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,290
It's you...

23
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,120
who forced my mom to die.

24
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,240
I didn't want that, either.

25
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,660
Princess, rest well tonight.

26
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,870
Go with me to the capital first thing tomorrow morning.

27
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,830
His Majesty will be taken care of.

28
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,360
- Guards!
- Yes!

29
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,770
- Escort the princess to her palace to rest well.
- Yes!

30
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Your Highness Princess, please have dinner.

31
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,800
Why haven't I seen you before?

32
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,660
Informing Your Highness, I am a new servant, especially assigned to serve you.

33
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:58,490
You probably know... the queen...

34
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,510
After the queen died, we didn't know when you would return.

35
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,470
The officials from the Central Plains were afraid that it would hurt your dignity if it was delayed for too long,

36
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,800
so they had her buried in the royal tomb according to the king's wishes.

37
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,730
When did my father

38
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,240
become like this?

39
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,800
His Majesty has been like this ever since the queen was buried. He is sometimes clearheaded but dazed at other times.

40
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,080
When he is clearheaded, he shouts that he wants to kill.

41
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,330
When he is clearheaded, he shouts that he wants to kill.

42
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,660
Dazed?

43
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,000
I'd rather he were dazed.

44
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,980
It's better to be dazed.

45
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,930
I'll take my leave.

46
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,210
Princess, eat something.

47
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,110
You haven't eaten anything for a long time.

48
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,260
Just a little bit.

49
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,010
Get out! Does the princess have to be guarded like a prisoner when she eats?!

50
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,540
Princess, I recognize that palace maid. She used to serve the queen.

51
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,990
She secretly left me this earlier.

52
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,320
It's my dad's handwriting.

53
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,650
Gao Xian is not the marriage alliance envoy sent by the Li Empire. His plan is unknown.

54
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,180
He tells us not to end up in Gao Xian's hands.

55
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,010
And he tells us to look for the envoy, Duke An of the State.

56
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,880
Tell him that I want to marry the Li Empire's crown prince.

57
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,180
That's the only way to stay safe.

58
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,780
That's a good idea from His Majesty. We can pretend to agree to marry and then escape.

59
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,700
I will do my best to help us escape and look for that Central Plains envoy.

60
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,180
Wait, A'Du! Let me think it over again.

61
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,330
Let me think it over again.

62
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,340
A'Du.

63
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,760
Princess.

64
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,000
I've decided. We'll immediately leave to find Duke An of the State.

65
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,330
We'll tell him that I'm willing to marry the crown prince.

66
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,240
All right! I will go prepare right now.

67
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,900
Princess, we need to prepare some items for the escape.

68
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,800
It's not an escape.

69
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,000
I am really going to marry into the Li Empire.

70
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,660
But Princess, the people of the Central Plains are our enemy!

71
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,020
Where else can we escape to?

72
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,790
No matter where we run to, Li Chengyin will find me.

73
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,110
He'll threaten me with the lives of my father and brother.

74
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,860
Elder Brother has not returned, and I have other siblings here.

75
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,900
They are my father's children and this clan's bloodline.

76
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,830
I cannot lose them, too.

77
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,380
A'Du, I must marry into the Li Empire, now.

78
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,140
It looks like when Li Chengyin allied with Shuobo to destroy Danchi,

79
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,890
he must have agreed to give Shuobo rewards.

80
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,200
The only thing I can do to protect the Xi State is to marry over.

81
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,060
I originally didn't understand why

82
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,770
Consort Mingyuan didn't just return home

83
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,120
when she missed her home that much.

84
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,560
She would rather die in a foreign land.

85
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,600
I finally understand now.

86
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,040
I understand.

87
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,550
That Gao Xian is too arrogant to think he can cover everything up!

88
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,980
The ninth princess has returned to the palace many days ago.

89
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,880
He actually forbade me to see the king of Xi State!

90
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,900
Duke An of the State, the news I got from the royal palace of Xi State is that

91
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,290
after Gao Xian provoked the queen into killing herself,

92
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,400
- the king went crazy.
- What?!

93
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,870
Gao Xian... What is he planning to do with the ninth princess?

94
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,080
He locked her up inside the palace!

95
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,590
Who is there?

96
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,690
I'm servant A'Du, under the princess's orders, to request a meeting with Duke An of the State.

97
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,390
The ninth princess?

98
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,160
I already told you that Her Highness doesn't like the orchid scented one, she likes gardenia.

99
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,740
How come you just couldn't remember it?!

100
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,310
A'Du, they don't know what I like. Just go out and bring me some.

101
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,170
What are you looking at? You want to die? You have the audacity to look at the princess taking a bath?!

102
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,060
Who gave you the guts?!

103
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,680
Take care, Your Highness.

104
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,730
Sorry to make things hard on you three.

105
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,760
Your Highness, let's go.

106
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,980
- There aren't any noticeable flaws in this plan, right?
- There aren't.

107
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,910
The guard shifting will happen in an hour. The new guards know that you are resting inside.

108
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,390
I already told Dimo to leave once the lights go out.

109
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,940
When the guards see that it's just a maid, they won't make it hard on her.

110
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,910
Greetings to Duke An of the State.

111
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,950
Let them pass!

112
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:41,340
Did you not eat yet? Hurry up! Hurry!

113
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,930
Hurry!

114
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,200
Duke! Duke!

115
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,490
What happened?

116
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,390
- There are soldiers chasing us!
- Ignore them.

117
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,190
- Let's hurry and go!
-Yes, My Lord!

118
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,160
- Speed up and keep moving forward!
- Hurry!

119
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,890
Halt! Halt!

120
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:41,610
Who dares to stop the carriage of an envoy from the empire?

121
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,990
Please forgive our intrusion. Yesterday, the palace lost a horse slave.

122
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,510
The king of Xi State ordered a thorough search of the city.

123
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,390
Especially of those caravans leaving the city today.

124
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,870
You want to lay a knife at my head?

125
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,670
Who gave you the permission?

126
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,530
Duke of the State, please calm down! Duke, please calm down!

127
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,730
Duke, please calm down.

128
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,480
My Lord, the king of Xi State wants to use the excuse of a robbery in the palace

129
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,200
to frame us people from the Central Plains for embezzlement.

130
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,190
I am under desperate circumstances.

131
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,720
In order to clear our name from the robbery to asking you to cooperate by letting us check your baggage.

132
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,000
In order to clear our name from the robbery to asking you to cooperate by letting us check your baggage.

133
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,360
How dare you!

134
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,520
My Lord, our country's reputation is on the line.

135
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,320
I am afraid it is not up to you.

136
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,200
- Yuan Tong.
- Yes.

137
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,270
- Search it.
- Understood.

138
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,920
You!

139
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,490
Gao Xian, every item on this cart is bride price from His Imperial Majesty.

140
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:05,100
If you damage any of them,

141
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,770
there will not be enough of you to repay it.

142
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,170
Of course, Sir.

143
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,920
How audacious of you!

144
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,260
General, there's nothing.

145
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:27,030
Gao Xian, I will not let this matter go.

146
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,510
Just wait for my complaint to the emperor!

147
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,050
Let's go.

148
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,640
Go.

149
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,800
Wait!

150
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,420
Gao Xian! You'd better stop now!

151
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,140
Duke of the State! What is the most precious treasure of the Xi State?

152
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,720
I am in no mood to play guessing games with you!

153
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,360
The Xi State's most precious treasure...

154
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,370
is their ninth princess.

155
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,220
Your Highness.

156
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,560
I have already agreed to marry the crown prince.

157
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,390
Duke An of the State, please take me to go see His Imperial Majesty right away.

158
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,890
I am here by the order of His Imperial Majesty.

159
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm here to propose marriage to Ninth Princess on behalf of Crown Prince.

160
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:05,030
Now, Ninth Princess is willing to go to the capital with me for the marriage ceremony.

161
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,450
Gao Xian, how can you stop us like this?

162
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,630
Aren't you afraid of being punished for disobeying an imperial order?

163
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,470
My Lord, for the princess's political marriage, the ceremonial journey should be well-prepared.

164
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,410
She should be leaving in a grand and magnificent way.

165
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,080
The way you are escorting the princess seems as if it is some illegal business.

166
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,460
It hurts the reputation of both countries.

167
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,800
You should let the princess come back with me first. She can leave once the ceremonial caravan is prepared.

168
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,500
If I don't agree, what can you do to me?

169
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,770
Duke of An, I urge you to reconsider.

170
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:49,420
Gao Xian, unless you kill me today,

171
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,070
don't even think about taking Her Highness away!

172
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,530
- Yuan Tong.
- I'm here, Sir!

173
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,770
Immediately write a report to the capital,

174
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,540
stating that the troupe of our empire's marriage envoy ran onto thieves while on their way back to the capital.

175
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,800
Everyone including Duke An of the State was brutally murdered. None survived!

176
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,350
You!

177
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,100
Your Highness.

178
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,620
I heard that Duke An of the State suddenly set out to return to the capital today.

179
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,760
He is most likely bringing the ninth princess of Xi State back to our empire.

180
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,230
The Xi State is currently facing difficulties.

181
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,100
Their king offering the ninth princess with both hands

182
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,720
to a political marriage is nothing abnormal.

183
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,430
Since Duke An of the State is around, what is Gao Xian doing in Xi State?

184
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,140
Your Highness!

185
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,680
His Imperial Majesty's decree has arrived. He is calling Your Highness to return to the capital immediately.

186
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,930
Officer Gao is already waiting for you in the military camp, ready to escort you back to the capital.

187
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,940
- You may leave.
- Yes!

188
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,990
[Decree: Prince Chengyin is ordered to return to the capital immediately. Seeing this decree is like seeing me. Immediately fulfill it upon receiving.]

189
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,770
- Greetings, Fifth Prince.
- General Gao.

190
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,080
The weather is cold these days. You don't need to escort me personally.

191
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,970
Your Highness, before you return to the capital,

192
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,400
I prepared a big present for you.

193
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,290
You'll know once you step inside.

194
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,690
General Gao, what is the meaning of this?

195
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,240
What I'm doing is for your good.

196
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,920
My father and the empress especially instructed through their letter

197
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,190
that I am to facilitate the marriage between you and the ninth princess. This will improve your chances of winning

198
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,840
when you start to fight for the crown prince position.

199
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,050
General Gao, I thank you for your hard work.

200
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,600
Then, I will not disturb the refined mood of Your Highness anymore.

201
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,990
I would like to take my leave.

202
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,280
Despicable.

203
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,860
Do you really want me to marry you that much?

204
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,520
You killed my grandfather,

205
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,110
you forced my mom to death,

206
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,470
and you made my dad go crazy.

207
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,520
And now you have brought me here.

208
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,650
Li Chengyin,

209
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,740
are you not finished with your vile deeds?

210
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,200
That's right! I just want you to marry me!

211
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,300
Since you have already agreed to a marriage alliance, then it doesn't matter who you marry!

212
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,830
I can marry anyone but you!

213
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,900
As long as they can help me kill you,

214
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,150
I'm willing to marry even the lowest kind of slave.

215
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,480
If you dare to say one more word, I will...

216
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,540
You will kill me?

217
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,660
It is best if you make your move now.

218
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:25,080
If you wait until I marry into the Li Empire and become the crown prince's consort,

219
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,640
I will absolutely not let you off.

220
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,290
I will make you pay one thousand fold, ten thousand fold, for Danchi's blood debt.

221
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,090
Xiaofeng!

222
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,630
The crown prince has already died.

223
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,890
All that we did was to help him

224
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,010
seize the crown prince's title.

225
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,170
If you go through with the marriage alliance,

226
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,570
then you will probably become his consort.

227
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,220
There is no hope

228
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,640
for your so-called revenge.

229
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,760
So, both of you knew from the start

230
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,930
and plotted from then on?

231
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,690
And I am to be like a joke.

232
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,880
I'm just a circus clown.

233
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,920
Are you happy tormenting me like this?

234
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,640
Xiaofeng...

235
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,240
Xiaofeng, I know that you hate me,

236
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,540
but I just want you to continue hating me while alive.

237
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,290
You can torment me or retaliate against me. Just never leave me!

238
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:18,000
Xiaofeng, just believe me once more. I will take you away and not let you step a foot into the Li Empire again.

239
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,890
Why should I believe you?!

240
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,540
You personally pushed me into his hands and invited Danchi's demise.

241
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,600
What other traps do you have waiting for me?!

242
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,600
All I have left behind me is Xi State.

243
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,230
Do you two want to completely destroy it, too?!

244
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,290
Gu Xiawu, you once promised me three things. Does that still stand?

245
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,300
Yes, it does! It will stand forever!

246
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,990
Good.

247
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,670
I want you to kill Gu Jian.

248
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,310
So, you hate me this much already.

249
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,420
I have no complaints if you want to kill me.

250
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,090
I know that you are Li Empire's prince. No one can kill you.

251
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,360
But I want you to kill him.

252
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,100
I want you to bear the guilt of killing a loved one while you live forever.

253
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,250
Just like me.

254
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,530
Xiaofeng,

255
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,360
you know that I cannot do it.

256
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:37,830
It's all my fault. Gu Jian's goal was to make sure that you were protected.

257
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,120
This was all caused by me. If you want to blame someone then blame me.

258
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,100
So your loved ones are dear, but mine are not?!

259
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,690
What a good cousin you are.

260
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,400
Go away.

261
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,030
Go away!

262
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,530
Cousin,

263
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,640
did we...

264
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,060
really do wrong?

265
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,850
If we went back,

266
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,860
which step could we redo

267
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,430
so that we wouldn't have been this wrong?

268
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,970
Princess!

269
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,880
A'Du!

270
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:36,940
Princess, leave with me. Let's go.

271
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,810
The ninth princess has escaped! Hurry! After her!

272
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,690
Hurry! Hurry! The ninth princess has ran away!

273
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,470
- What's going on?
- General! The ninth princess has run away.

274
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,190
- Hurry up and chase her!
- Yes!
- Wait!

275
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,720
You have to bring her back even if she's dead.

276
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,050
Understood! Hurry! Chase them!

277
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,830
Yes!

278
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,850
- Search carefully!
- Yes!

279
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
What's the situation?

280
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,680
They only had one horse. Their tracks weren't covered completely by the snow. They must've just left.

281
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,600
Gao Xian's men won't hold back from killing. You take a team to catch up.

282
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,400
Don't forget! You can't harm Xiaofeng!

283
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
Yes!

284
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,070
Hold onto me!

285
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,750
Let's run!

286
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,770
Xiaofeng.

287
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:07,430
Princess, leave quickly. You have me here.

288
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,960
Gu Jian, you traitor!

289
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,560
You are also to answer for the bloody grudge of Danchi!

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,300
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

345
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:35,560
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

346
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:42,120
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

347
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:50,000
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
