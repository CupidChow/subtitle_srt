00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,950
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,630
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,410
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,900
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,580
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,130
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,100
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,990
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,670
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,800
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,000
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,670
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,650
[Episode 41]

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,210
Have you recovered?

18
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,090
Yes, Imperial Father.

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,700
How is your studying?

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,830
Minister Li is very well learned. His teaching is informative and interesting. I have benefited a lot.

21
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,900
Yes, you should surround yourself

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,380
with these men who are both learned and virtuous.

23
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,560
Such as Wang Shu of the Court of Judicial Review.

24
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,500
Also, Lu Yong. They are all usable talents.

25
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,110
You can also use Pei Zhao.

26
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,910
Don't you have a good relationship with him?

27
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,050
Yes.

28
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,220
Is he married?

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,820
Not yet.

30
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:50,050
But I know that Luoxi has liked him since she was young.

31
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,490
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort are here to congratulate the Grand Empress Dowager on her birthday!

32
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,170
Greetings to Grand Empress Dowager! May you enjoy

33
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,080
a fortune that's large like the East Sea and longevity that's as long as the tall Nan Mountain.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,600
Very good, very good. Xiaofeng,

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,670
I haven't seen you for a few days. You seem to have lost weight.

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,130
Has Crown Prince been mean to you?

37
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:33,200
Imperial Great-Grandmother, I was the one who was sick.

38
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,610
I didn't torment you to get sick.

39
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,700
Crown Prince, where is your concubine?

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,220
Related Lady of Excellent Zhao misbehaved against palace rules. She has been demoted to a commoner.

41
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:53,600
Look at this, look at this. I was on a Buddhist retreat for only 49 days,

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,590
but so much has happened in the palace.

43
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,780
Empress, they are just youngsters who just entered the palace.

44
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,000
Who wouldn't make mistakes? Just a simple warning is enough.

45
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,510
Yes, I know to keep it in balance. Rest assured, Grand Empress Dowager.

46
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,800
That's good then. You can sit down.

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes.

48
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,240
Four generations in one room! A birthday feast for me!

49
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,260
I am delighted!

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,470
Where are you going?

51
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,690
I will sit with Yongning and Luoxi. You don't like me anyway. I'm going to stay far from you.

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,250
You are, after all, the crown princess consort.

53
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,550
How can you ditch my brother all by himself to sit with us?

54
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,030
I don't want to sit with him.

55
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,600
His Imperial Majesty has arrived!

56
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,930
Greetings to Grand Empress Dowager.

57
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,390
Imperial Grandmother, I've brought Lady of Handsome Fairness Gao

58
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,700
to wish you on your birthday. Sorry for being late.

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,030
Not late. If you're not here,

60
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,070
we can't start the feast. Go sit.

61
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,130
Start the banquet!

62
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,900
Today is a celebratory day. I want to borrow this birthday banquet of Imperial Grandmother to announce one more celebratory news.

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,920
What is it?

64
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,080
I have found Eighth Princess a good marital match.

65
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,170
That indeed sounds like a celebratory matter. Who is the groom?

66
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,610
Luoxi. Pei Zhao. Come up here.

67
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,610
Luoxi. Luoxi, hurry and go up.

68
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,900
Imperial Grandmother, don't they look well-suited?

69
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,650
Very suited. Truly very well-suited.

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,750
Look at them. One is a precious young lady.

71
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,540
The other is a valiant son from a general's family.

72
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,910
Imperial Grandmother, you are right that they are a good match.

73
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,060
Why don't you thank your Imperial Father's blessing?

74
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,880
- Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty, for bestowing this marriage.
- Thank you, Imperial Father, for bestowing this marriage.

75
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,570
When will you ever take off your mask?

76
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,410
What? Now that you are marrying a princess, you are becoming snobbish?

77
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,480
Do you not want to be the emperor's son-in-law?

78
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,390
Your Highness, I don't mean that.

79
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,770
I think you were not at all pleasantly surprised.

80
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,890
Even though I'm not a prince, my mother is the elder princess of Pingnan.

81
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,880
Although the emperor's marriage decree today seems sudden, it's not totally unexpected.

82
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,750
I am guessing you already knew Luoxi's feelings for you.

83
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:39,400
My younger sister has been kind and virtuous since she was little. Marrying her does not bring you any disgrace.

84
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,170
It doesn't matter who she is. Once the emperor decrees the marriage,

85
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,090
I will treat her with respect and get along well with her.

86
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,130
Your Imperial Highness, please rest assured.

87
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:00,970
Are you implying that although my marriage was bestowed by His Imperial Majesty, I am not treating the crown princess consort well?

88
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,690
I dare not.

89
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,190
Previously, arguing with the crown princess consort was all an act for the empress. From now on...

90
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,030
Well, as for the future,

91
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,010
we will never be like respectable guests to each other.

92
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,490
I want us to have a deep and long-lasting affection. For us to be romantic and in love.

93
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,760
Customer, please go inside. There are seats inside.

94
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,090
General Pei, aren't you on duty today? How come you have the time for a drink?

95
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,720
General Pei, you're here. What wine would you like to drink today?

96
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
Fall in Half a Jug.

97
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,130
Okay. I'll get it for you.

98
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,650
- Owner, serve the wine!
- Yes.

99
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,980
You came... to drink with me...

100
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,860
or is there something you wish to say?

101
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,440
I am getting married.

102
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,540
His Imperial Majesty bestowed my marriage. He wants me to marry Princess Luoxi.

103
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,500
Cheers.

104
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
Gu Jian, you help serve the customers.

105
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,410
You come with me.

106
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,510
Where are we going?

107
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,550
You'll know once we are there.

108
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,650
Where are you taking me?

109
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,280
Where's the highest point in the capital?

110
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,140
Vermilion Bird Tower.

111
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,400
I want to take a look.

112
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,820
Let's go.

113
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,620
Where's the palace?

114
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,450
Over there.

115
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,900
What do you see when you are standing here looking at the palace?

116
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:11,080
A magnificent, richly decorated jade palace. All you see is prosperity.

117
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,200
But all I can see

118
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,930
are blocks of walls.

119
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:25,140
And behind those walls are crowds of helpless people.

120
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,330
When I was in Xi State, I thought Shangjing was a place of great joy.

121
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,520
After listening to your advice and coming here,

122
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,630
I realized that it wasn't as I thought.

123
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,760
No vast sky and extensive earth. No immense space and freedom.

124
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,700
Behind all the prosperity,

125
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,680
hidden is extreme sadness and helplessness.

126
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,160
I finally understand why Xiaofeng wants to leave so badly.

127
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,230
Now I have to see you

128
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,600
behind those walls without any freedom.

129
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,780
It is snowing. Time flies.

130
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,700
That's right. This year passed by very fast.

131
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,370
Our Luoxi is going to marry someone soon.

132
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,350
Here, Luoxi. Congratulations!

133
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,190
When you marry into the Fuma Residence, Xiaofeng and I will come visit you frequently.
(T/N: "fuma" is the term given to the son-in-law of an emperor)

134
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,400
Luoxi, have you asked Pei Zhao

135
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,900
if he sincerely likes you? Sincerely wishes to marry you?

136
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,270
Xiaofeng, Luoxi will marry Pei Zhao very soon.

137
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,460
How can you ask her that? Do you not know how much Luoxi loves Pei Zhao?

138
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,030
It is exactly because I know how much Luoxi loves Pei Zhao,

139
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,220
that's why I want her to clearly know Pei Zhao's sincere feelings towards her.

140
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,050
Luoxi, do you know how agonizing it is to marry someone who doesn't love you?

141
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,200
An imperial decree must not be violated. My wedding with General Pei was decreed by Imperial Father.

142
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,020
I do not have the power to question it, nor does he have the power to reject it.

143
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,200
No, what I am speaking of is not the imperial decree.

144
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,060
I am speaking of you two. You two are the ones becoming husband and wife. Do you wish to...

145
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,700
ignorantly marry a person, not knowing his sincere thoughts?

146
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,460
Xiaofeng, don't talk anymore. Do not think that because you and Fifth Brother argue every day,

147
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,480
it means that Luoxi and General Pei will not be blissful.

148
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,000
- Pei Zhao and Fifth Brother are different.
- That is right.

149
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,760
It is exactly because Pei Zhao and Li Chengyin are different. If Li Chengyin does not like me, he will tell me directly.

150
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,200
He will not allow me to have any illusions or expectations, but Pei Zhao is different.

151
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,880
Pei Zhao is someone who puts everything in his heart. Putting it nicely,

152
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,200
you will be living a quiet life with him. But the truth is,

153
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,350
you will probably be tricked by his silence for a lifetime. I do not wish for you to live the rest of your life

154
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,050
in illusions and deceptions.

155
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,700
Enough! What right do you have to say that Luoxi is fooling herself and others? What's wrong with Luoxi?

156
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,860
Even if they do not have very deep couple affections now, that does not represent that they will not be happy in the future.

157
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,240
Love is something that needs to be cultivated little by little.

158
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,050
You two stop arguing!

159
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,880
At the bottom of it all, you two do not believe that Pei Zhao will like me.

160
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,820
- Luoxi!
- Luoxi.

161
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,100
Luoxi!

162
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,170
It's snowing.

163
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,650
Go home.

164
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,200
I drank the alcohol. Why are you the drunk one?

165
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,420
Your thoughts are too clear tonight.

166
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,960
Let me be the drunk one for you.

167
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,510
Don't forget your status. You're a married woman now.

168
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,230
Oh right! I suddenly forgot. You women from Xi State are open-natured.

169
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,600
You don't care about these things.

170
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,080
But you're the crown princess consort.

171
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,100
If you still want to keep the reputation of Xi State intact, then don't sneak out and hangout with Pei Zhao all the time.

172
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,410
Li Chengyin! How could you say that about me? General Pei and I are innocent.

173
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,820
Of course! Even if Pei Zhao had ten thousand guts, he would not dare do something with you.

174
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,100
But it's you... You're the one clinging to him, right?

175
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,850
Li Chengyin, you had Zhao Sese here and Xuniang there, I never said a word.

176
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,070
I only went out to drink with General Pei a few times. What right do you have to say that about me?

177
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,900
Xi State women... What's wrong with Xi State women?

178
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,430
If it wasn't for your imperial father forcing this arranged marriage on my dad, would my dad be willing to marry me off to such a faraway place?

179
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,600
If you didn't force us with your mighty power, why would I marry you?

180
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm telling you! Every one of the men in Xi State are stronger than you.

181
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,850
Do you think I care about marrying you? Do you think I care a lot about being a crown princess consort?

182
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,800
The person I like is better than you a thousand, ten thousand times. You can't even compare to a strand of his hair.

183
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,400
Don't worry. I'll never come here again!

184
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,300
Just enjoy thinking about the person who is stronger than me by a thousand, even ten thousand times!

185
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,250
- Your Imperial Highness!
- Your Imperial Highness!

186
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,910
At least wear your shoes, Your Imperial Highness!

187
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,180
Crown Princess Consort, what's the matter with you?

188
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,170
Yongniang, take away Li Chengyin's clothes and shoes.

189
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,550
Yes.

190
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,260
[Longevity and Benevolence Palace]

191
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,000
What are you thinking of? Look.

192
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,960
This is a nourishing porridge that I especially asked them to make for you.

193
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,090
Try a spoonful. It tastes very good.

194
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,290
How is it? Taste good? Eat some more.

195
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,150
What's wrong?

196
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,040
Get the spitting basin!

197
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,780
Here, Crown Princess Consort.

198
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,190
Call the Imperial Physician!

199
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,640
Yes.

200
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,370
She is most likely pregnant.

201
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,600
You do not have to be shy.

202
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,390
Being pregnant is a natural occurrence.

203
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:01,400
There is nothing to be ashamed of. You are just continuing the family line.

204
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,750
Thinking of it... Your child, what will we name him?

205
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:17,060
Responding to Grand Empress Dowager. Crown Princess Consort's stomach was just exposed to cold

206
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,580
and then she drank thick deer porridge, thus she felt nauseous.

207
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,430
She is not pregnant?

208
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,720
No, she is not pregnant.

209
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,800
You are dismissed. Dismissed. The crown prince? Call him here!

210
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,550
Responding to Grand Empress Dowager. Today is the First Celestial Bodies Grand Ceremony. His Highness the Crown Prince has entered the Fasting Palace today.

211
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,100
Enter what Fasting Palace?

212
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,830
There are three ways to be unfilial, the worst is having no children. Does he not understand this?

213
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:54,500
When His Imperial Father was his age, he already had two sons.

214
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,710
- But him? He is twenty already.
- Yes.

215
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,290
Wasn't Related Lady of Excellence Zhao always with him before?

216
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:06,100
How come they didn't get to have a son or a daughter?

217
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,320
That Lady of Precious Bevy Xu finally got pregnant,

218
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,530
but then the child was suddenly gone just like that.

219
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,300
What should we do? When will I...

220
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,100
be able to hold my great-great-grandchild?

221
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,200
- I have no more hope.
- Imperial Great-Grandmother, calm your anger down.

222
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,820
I am so anxious. Prepare the carriage for the Eastern Palace.

223
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,620
Greetings to Imperial Great-Grandmother.

224
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,220
You bathed and scented yourself already?

225
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,650
Yes.

226
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,500
Then that is good.

227
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,210
Someone come. Bring Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort

228
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,800
now to the main bedchamber and lock them there.

229
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,960
Without my orders, no one is allowed to

230
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,520
let them out.

231
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,600
Imperial Great-Grandmother!

232
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,180
Why? Imperial Great-Grandmother, why?

233
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,380
- Go. Go.
 - Imperial Great-Grandmother!

234
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:20,560
You are... Yongniang! Imperial Great-Grandmother!

235
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,500
- Imperial Great-Grandmother!
- Go!

236
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,230
Imperial Great-Grandmother! Imperial Great-Grandmother!

237
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,170
- Imperial Great-Grandmother!
- Imperial Great-Grandmother!

238
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,690
- Let us out!
- Imperial Great-Grandmother!

239
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,420
Is there anyone there?

240
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,660
Despicable.

241
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,130
Who are you calling despicable? What right do you have to curse me?

242
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,230
If it was not for you reporting me to Imperial Great-Grandmother, would she lock the two of us together?

243
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,800
Greetings, Empress.

244
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,430
Greetings to Imperial Grandmother.

245
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,960
I heard that you locked up the crown prince and the crown princess consort.

246
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,460
What wrong did the two of them commit?

247
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,700
They did not commit any wrong.

248
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,400
I just want to hold a great-great-grandchild soon.

249
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,390
Empress, do you not want to hold a grandchild?

250
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,680
Of course, I want one. But the First Celestial Bodies Grand Ceremony will start soon.

251
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,900
If Crown Prince does not attend, it would seem as if he does not want to follow the customs passed down from our ancestors.

252
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,260
Then is the First Celestial Bodies Grand Ceremony important or an heir more important?

253
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,150
If you ask me, have this year's First Celestial Bodies Grand Ceremony

254
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,200
go forward with just the emperor.

255
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,250
But—

256
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,630
But what? Is what I said wrong?

257
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,110
Of course, you are the imperial harem's master.

258
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,720
With me doing this, it seems like...

259
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,380
seems like I have overstepped my powers, right?

260
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,400
Then fine. I will personally go and open the doors for them

261
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,670
and let them out. Come.

262
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,500
Okay, okay already! No need for you to go.

263
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,670
Grand Empress Dowager, what I have said is wrong then. Okay?

264
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,860
What you have said is right. A descendant is more important.

265
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,670
You can lock them away for however long you wish. As long as you are happy.

266
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,030
I will handle the matters with His Imperial Majesty.

267
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,200
That's more like it.

268
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,740
Letting us go now? Hey! How come you left again?!

269
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,780
Don't go! Yongniang!

270
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,280
Yongniang! A'Du! Are you two out there?

271
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,800
Let us see what delicious food there is to eat.

272
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,810
Fragrant.

273
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,260
Tastes good.

274
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,000
Are you not cold sitting there?

275
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,750
I'm not. Don't come over here. Don't come.

276
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,010
Why are you sweating so much? Are you sick?

277
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,000
Do not touch me.

278
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,700
The porridge has medicine. There is medicine.

279
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,400
There is medicine in the porridge?

280
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,410
What medicine?

281
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,930
Xiaofeng.

282
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,620
Think of your Sese! The one you like is Related Lady Excellence Zhao!

283
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,800
You must restrain yourself for her. You cannot betray her and do her wrong!

284
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,000
You are my wife. This doesn't count as wronging her.

285
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,450
It has already been the two incense stick's time.

286
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,970
There is no rush.

287
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,400
I am going to get the Grand Empress Dowager.

288
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,560
How do I untie this? Why can't I untie it?

289
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,180
It is not what you think, Imperial Great-Grandmother!

290
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,980
This is more like it.

291
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,450
It's not what you think!

292
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,200
Imperial Great Grandmother has not seen anything. We did not see anything at all.

293
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,770
That's more like it.

294
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,830
No, Imperial Great-Grandmother! It is not what you think! Imperial Great-Grandmother!

295
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,400
- Open the door!
- Imperial Great-Grandmother!

296
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,110
Imperial Great-Grandmother, I am begging you! Open the door, Imperial Great-Grandmother!

297
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,190
Imperial Great-Grandmother! You are going to stifle me to death!

298
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,620
How come you wore such light clothing? There is no live fire in this room either. Do you want to die from freezing?

299
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:53,620
I am not going there.

300
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,520
Do not worry. I will not do anything to you.

301
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,430
Open the door! Open the door!

302
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,280
Open the door! Open the door!

303
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,830
Do not leave!

304
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,050
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

305
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,520
Imperial Great-Grandmother!

306
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,380
Grand Empress Dowager, it is cold and freezing outside.

307
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,320
How about we give Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort a furnace?

308
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,700
It cannot be a good thing if they freeze.

309
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,740
Send what furnace? Won't they be warm from each other's body heat?

310
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,560
Is there any use for a furnace? Throw out a card.

311
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,570
My Lady.

312
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,800
Today, I heard that the Grand Empress Dowager wants a great-grandchild,

313
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,680
so she locked the crown prince and the crown princess consort together,

314
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,250
and is not allowing anyone to let them out.

315
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,800
I also heard that they put that kind of medicine in their porridge.

316
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,880
I am guessing that the crown prince will have a very hard time restraining himself.

317
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,820
My Lady, say, if this time

318
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,220
the crown prince and the crown princess consort really do have a son, then My Lady...

319
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,460
Jin'er,

320
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:52,460
I originally thought that as long as His Highness the Crown Prince had only me in his heart,

321
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,790
I wouldn't need to worry about my position in the Eastern Palace.

322
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,860
But now, I realized that in their eyes,

323
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,320
I was just a concubine.

324
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,620
Even if I bear a prince for the crown prince, he would only be a concubine's son.

325
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,880
Only once I have become the real mistress of the Eastern Palace

326
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,750
will I be able to not worry about protecting my position.

327
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,000
My Lady, eat slower.

328
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,200
My Lady, eat slower.

329
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,200
Let me ask you. Your two best friends are going to get married soon.

330
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,680
Should you not be happy for them?

331
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,800
But judging by your expression when Imperial Father bestowed their wedding,

332
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,770
you had not an ounce of happiness on your face. Do you have some sort of other thoughts?

333
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,620
If the two of them were a normal man and woman having an affinity towards each other,

334
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,730
then, of course, I would be happy for them. But just because of a royal decree,

335
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,980
they have to be together.

336
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,980
If one person does not even have the power to choose their own marriage,

337
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,200
then they will have remorse in the future.

338
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,730
How do you know they will not be happy in the future? A forcefully gotten melon doesn't mean it won't be sweet.

339
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:38,220
For example, you and I. You obviously have someone else in your heart, but you're locked up with me. Can your heart be joyful?

340
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,100
- We are different from them.
- That is right.

341
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,450
We are different from them. We are even more pitiful than them.

342
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:49,800
I came to Li Empire for a marriage alliance, so I know that even though you hate me,

343
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,030
I still must be your crown princess consort. I must still appear together with you and be an example for everyone in Li Empire.

344
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,890
Actually, I...

345
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,410
Act... Actually, I... I...

346
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,360
I...

347
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,540
What do you want to do? You're not at it again, right?

348
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,770
Empress, do you find the action of Grand Empress Dowager

349
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,070
forcing His Highness the Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort to have a child as inappropriate?

350
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,990
An old child, an old child. Grand Empress Dowager's attitude lately has become more and more like a child's.

351
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,900
Even His Imperial Majesty must follow her wishes.

352
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,100
We can't disobey her wishes.

353
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:01,000
- It is just a pity for my Chengyin.
- Actually, this is a good thing, too.

354
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,410
If Empress becomes an imperial grandmother, you can tempt your grandchild with candy and add some fun to your life.

355
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,700
Plus, when the child is born, the position of the crown prince

356
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,300
in the palace will be more stable.

357
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,600
You're right. If he really had a child,

358
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,320
he wouldn't be bewitched by that Zhao Sese. Secondly,

359
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,630
after becoming a father, he might slowly mature. He won't randomly fight with me.

360
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,170
Although Chengyin was quite mischievous when he was little, he was still respectful towards me.

361
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,010
But the more respectful he is,

362
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,220
the more I think he doesn't see me as his real mother.

363
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,710
Now that I think about it, I was too strict on him when he was young.

364
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,970
After all, he was just a child.

365
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,110
Even if I let him fool around a little or be a little mischievous,

366
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,460
what's wrong with that?

367
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:07,630
Empress, you seem to be having a lot of insights tonight.

368
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,800
Everyone says that once you get old,

369
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,620
you can remember more things in the past.

370
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,140
I might really be getting old now.

371
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,180
Maybe, it's because I really want Chengyin to stay by my side.

372
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,090
I also don't know what's wrong lately. I keep on thinking about when Chengyin was young.

373
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,600
Rongshuang, accompany me to the Eastern Palace.

374
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,090
Yes.

375
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,640
Do you know that Grand Empress Dowager went to see a fortune teller yesterday?

376
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,430
She already picked out names for the little prince.

377
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,300
What if it's a little princess though?

378
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,620
It's still better to prepare for it. The future is long.

379
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,340
Empress.

380
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,740
Why are Crown Prince's clothes out here?

381
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,350
Replying to Empress. Grand Empress Dowager won't let him wear them.

382
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,700
Nonsense. Open the door.

383
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:21,950
Replying to Empress. Grand Empress Dowager ordered that no one can open the door without her decree.

384
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,480
Empress, forget it. His Highness the Crown Prince is probably asleep already. We should go back.

385
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,920
The crown prince has always liked things to be clean. I'll order people to take these clothes back with me first.

386
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,650
They will be cleaned and ironed.

387
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,390
After the crown prince comes out, tell him to come to my palace to get them.

388
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,950
