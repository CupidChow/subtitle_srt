00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,200
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,640
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,300
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:44,450
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,920
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,530
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,990
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,170
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:11,130
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,850
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,680
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,850
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:39,080
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:45,900
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,630
[Episode 37]

17
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,980
Pass.

18
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,810
You have quite lucky hands today, Related Lady of Excellence!

19
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,810
Sister is being lenient on me.

20
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,360
I don't know what is wrong with me today. I can't seem to have the right cards.

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,890
How weird...

22
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,290
Pass.

23
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,620
Sister's boots are really pretty.

24
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,740
Our Central Plains don't have such fine leather.

25
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,210
You are right. These types of boots can only be found in Xi State.

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,350
Do you like them?

27
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,730
If you like them, I will have my dad send some good boots next time his men come.

28
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,030
That would be great. I'll thank you in advance then.

29
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,310
These boots are warm. Why don't you give His Imperial Highness a pair?

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,690
Li Chengyin? I would never do that.

31
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,720
Didn't His Imperial Highness stay at Bearing Graces Hall last night?

32
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,560
So, you came today because last night Li Chengyin spent the night here?

33
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,930
No, no! That's not what I meant.

34
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,000
For you and the crown prince to be harmonious is a good blessing for the Eastern Palace.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
I don't have any other thoughts.

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,570
I don't either. The Eastern Palace is his.

37
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,020
Everyone in this palace are also his.

38
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,000
It is not easy for both you and me.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,580
Let's get along well in the future.

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,550
Continue playing!

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,220
Then, when will sister fetch Xuniang in?

42
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,930
Xuniang? Why must I fetch her?

43
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,770
You are the crown princess consort.

44
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,740
Xuniang just got pregnant recently.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,290
Logically, she should stay here for better care.

46
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,970
You should go and ask Li Chengyin about that. How would I know?

47
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,970
Replying to Related Lady of Excellence. As of now, Xuniang is staying at the empress' Clean and Peaceful Palace.

48
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,620
Without the empress' summons,

49
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,330
it's also inconvenient for Crown Princess Consort to fetch her into the Eastern Palace.

50
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,200
Is that so?

51
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,380
Young Lord.

52
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,800
Why aren't we meeting at Mi Luo Drinking House?

53
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,740
In the past, they tried to capture Godfather at Mi Luo Drinking House.

54
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,080
I doubt that there will be spies and it's not safe, so I changed the venue.

55
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,930
What order do you have?

56
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,340
Is Tao Jian ready?

57
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,240
According to your order, we have arranged for him to enter the gambling house of the Gao family.

58
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,290
Bet quickly! If you've decided, leave the money on the table!

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,470
Good. Come. One more time.

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,650
One more time.

61
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,840
Continue! Come! Bet! Bet!

62
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,930
Yongniang, what's wrong?

63
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,070
I have won so many gold pumpkin seeds today. Why aren't you happy?

64
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,960
Crown Princess Consort, I fear that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao isn't one with you.

65
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,060
You should guard against her more.

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,950
You also found her strange?

67
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,050
Me too.

68
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,790
Say, Xuniang is doing well in the palace

69
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,650
and the empress especially had someone take care of her,

70
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,040
so why must I fetch her here?

71
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,380
Moreover, doesn't that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao hate Xuniang?

72
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,780
Crown Princess Consort is right.

73
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,940
Because of Xuniang, Concubine Zhao had a fierce quarrel with the crown prince before and cried for days.

74
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,890
She surely doesn't like Xuniang.

75
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,900
Then, why must she deliberately mention it to me today and pretend to be generous?

76
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,060
That, I don't know about.

77
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,400
No wonder Li Chengyin said that the games here in the Eastern Palace may look easy; but in reality, are very complicated.

78
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,230
There are open attacks and underhanded tactics everywhere.

79
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,880
Sese went to the crown princess consort's palace?

80
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,860
I have purposefully asked Yongniang about it.

81
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,240
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao did go to Bearing Graces Hall and stayed for half a day.

82
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,380
She played leaf cards with Crown Princess Consort.

83
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,450
What else did Yongniang say?

84
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,290
Yongniang also said...

85
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,550
Concubine Zhao asked the crown princess consort when she planned to fetch Xuniang into the Eastern Palace.

86
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,370
Don't tell Yongniang that I interrogated you. You may leave.

87
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,010
Yes.

88
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,360
On that day, the person who was secretly listening outside the chamber

89
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,670
was a palace lady-in-waiting called Ying'er.

90
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,650
This servant has close connections with the Clean and Peaceful Palace.

91
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,050
She was bribed by them; hence, she works for them.

92
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,860
But she is not agile enough.

93
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,530
My people found her eavesdropping twice already.

94
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,890
Since she works for the empress, then let her be, so as not to alert the enemy.

95
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,010
Your Imperial Highness has been covertly taking care of the crown princess consort lately.

96
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,660
Did the empress discover something?

97
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,660
Regardless of what she found out, we have to pretend that we do not know.

98
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,620
Let everything seem normal.

99
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,160
Yes.

100
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,230
Also, what's going on with Mingyue?

101
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,630
His Imperial Majesty has been visiting Miss Mingyue very often lately.

102
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,550
Normally, he arrives around 11:00 p.m. and will leave by
1:00 a.m.

103
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,910
But recently, he doesn't leave until daybreak.

104
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,590
Sister Mingyue!

105
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,830
I know what you're going to say.

106
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,550
We've finally made it this far.

107
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,000
Everyone has prepared for so long.

108
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,470
I've already made up my mind. You can't convince me otherwise.

109
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,150
Do you have any problem managing Submerged Dragon?

110
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,010
Everything is going well.

111
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,610
Where is he now? Is he safe?

112
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,940
Godfather is out of this country.

113
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,410
He is safe for now.

114
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,270
Mingyue,

115
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,200
being alive is more important than anything.

116
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,940
As long as we are alive, we have a chance to make amends.

117
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,170
Follow my advice.

118
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,030
Don't wait until it's too late,

119
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,310
then you can only regret.

120
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:08,430
In my heart, my family had died in the massacre

121
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,610
sixteen years ago.

122
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:21,060
It was not your lifetime of regret.

123
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,320
It was Godfather's regret.

124
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,430
All these years, Godfather has been prepping to overturn the indictment.

125
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,310
He is doing it not only for justice but also for his family.

126
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,300
I don't care if you believe it or not.

127
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,660
If he could do it over,

128
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,210
he would save you first.

129
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,510
At the time, he wasn't sure if you were alive or not.

130
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,540
Sister Mingyue!

131
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,850
Sister Mingyue!

132
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,250
Sister Mingyue!

133
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,640
Sister Mingyue, I came to visit you.

134
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,040
How do you have time to come visit today?

135
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,450
Don't you usually go to Mi Luo Drinking House instead?

136
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,950
Mi Luo said you have not been there for a long time.

137
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,490
I'm worried, so I came over to see how you were doing.

138
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,190
Are you sick?

139
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,580
Or do you have something unhappy on your mind?

140
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,340
I actually met a customer.

141
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,640
He is really good to me.

142
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,900
So, you are lovesick!

143
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,790
Then tell me quickly, what kind of man is he?

144
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:44,820
He... is a... godlike person.

145
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,170
Godlike person?

146
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,390
I'll introduce him to you if given the chance.

147
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,250
Sure. Sure.

148
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,190
I have to see if this godlike person

149
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,450
is really compatible with you.

150
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,480
Come! Take your hands off when the bet is laid!

151
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,320
That's too little money for a bet.

152
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,980
Open! Big!

153
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,730
Why are you gambling when you don't have money? Look at where you are first.

154
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,510
If you don't have money, go to a smaller gambling house.

155
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Hurry, start your bet!

156
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,730
Bet quickly!

157
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,420
Come. Come. Come. Continue. Continue.

158
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,380
Here. Here!

159
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,830
Open it! Hurry!

160
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,090
Open! Open!

161
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,320
Hurry. Open it.

162
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,610
Young Lord.

163
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,830
That guy, Zhang Can, how much money has he lost so far?

164
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,030
At the very least, it's already 10,000 taels.

165
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,250
You are really clever.

166
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,160
Let's give him a taste of success first, so he'll become addicted.

167
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,290
I want to see how long he can handle this with his salary as a Yulin Palace Guard.

168
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,820
You're right, Young Lord.

169
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,320
If we want to catch a big fish, we shouldn't rush.

170
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,390
You are smarter than those fools.

171
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,670
You have not been here long but you are able to run this place smoothly.

172
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,410
Work hard for me.

173
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,190
I'll make sure you are well compensated.

174
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,790
Thank you, Young Lord.

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,650
Open!

176
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,100
Open what? Your gambling house...

177
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,230
Are you cheating me?

178
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,060
Cheating who? Who's cheating who?

179
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,070
Young Lord, it's better you don't show your face.

180
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,150
Let me.

181
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,660
Get lost.

182
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,900
I lose every time I'm here. You must've been cheating.

183
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,730
You say that every time.

184
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,380
Mr. Zhang, it seems you are unlucky today.

185
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,360
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

186
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,800
Come what back? I don't believe I'm unlucky.

187
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,330
I will win this game. Lend me some more money.

188
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,920
Okay.

189
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:00,750
You go retrieve some more money for Mr. Zhang.

190
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,530
We will keep playing!

191
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,050
Nobody is leaving this table.

192
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,320
- I'll be back.
- Mr. Zhang, this way.

193
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,050
Place your bet. Come! Come!

194
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,620
Take your hands off when the bet is laid!

195
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,290
Here is the bet!

196
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,610
Open! Open!

197
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,410
Young Master, this is a list of the people that have come into the gambling house for the past few months.

198
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,130
What's the background of Zhang Can?

199
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,230
He is part of the Yulin Palace Guards. I've checked his background.

200
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,890
He is a cousin of the empress.

201
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,320
Empress' cousin?

202
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,840
Is he a spy the empress placed inside the Gao family?

203
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,150
I don't think so.

204
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,420
He is rash and stupid. Loses all the time at gambling,

205
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,300
and refuses to pay up when he loses.

206
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,910
Very poor character.

207
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,930
I don't think the empress would send someone like him to spy on the Gao.

208
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,330
Does Gao Zhen know that Zhang Can is the empress' cousin?

209
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,410
According to his attitude towards Zhang Can, I'm 99% sure that he doesn't know.

210
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,690
Greetings, Sister.

211
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,300
Did you come to play cards again?

212
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,540
The weather is great today.

213
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,740
I then thought of coming to your place and having a chat with you.

214
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,340
Sister... you're going out of the palace?

215
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,990
No! I just wanted to try on this outfit.

216
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Sister, you look valiant and heroic in those clothes.

217
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,580
You won't lose compared to other men. I envy you.

218
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,300
You also like it? Then, let Li Chengyin gift you one, too.

219
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,100
- His Imperial Highness gifted that to you?
- Yes.

220
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,780
This is a scented pouch that I personally sewed.

221
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,730
A token of my respect for you.

222
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,350
New clothes always smell like the manufacturing workshop.

223
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,420
If you take some fragrance to perfume the clothes, it will be better.

224
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,900
It smells great! What's this?

225
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,140
I've used this scent since I was young.

226
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,200
The crown prince likes this smell, too!

227
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,060
A'Du doesn't have manners. Please forgive her Related Lady of Excellence.

228
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,210
The people of Bearing Graces Hall don't have any manners indeed.

229
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,810
Greetings, Your Imperial Highness.

230
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,640
Sese, I went to visit you in Qingluan Hall.

231
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,490
Your servants said you were here. Why did you come here all of a sudden?

232
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,890
Did she make you do anything against your will?

233
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,010
- No—
- Hey, what do you mean by that?!

234
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,570
Why would I make things hard for her?

235
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,820
Your Imperial Highness, Sister treats me very well.

236
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,110
She didn't make things hard on me.

237
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,830
Since this bag has the scent that I like, it should be gifted to me.

238
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,990
She doesn't know how to appreciate this. Don't give it to her anymore.

239
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,990
Let's go, Sese.

240
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,400
Sister, please don't be angry. I'll come to see you another day.

241
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,520
Why would you come here? She's a savage.

242
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,750
Don't be bullied. Let's go.

243
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,800
Li Chengyin!

244
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,950
You can't set one foot in my Bearing Graces Hall from now on!

245
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,820
Crown Princess Consort, don't get too angry.

246
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,150
I won't be angry with him!

247
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,730
If he wants to take the scented pouch, that's fine! I don't like that scent anyway!

248
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,900
Li Chengyin's whole body is covered with that scent.

249
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,390
So, it's all because of that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

250
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,470
I initially thought that we could use your good relationship with Related Lady of Excellence Zhao

251
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,350
to better your relationship with the crown prince.

252
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,280
I didn't think that...

253
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,890
Your Imperial Highness.

254
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,180
Your Imperial Highness.

255
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,070
Are you not angry at me anymore, Your Imperial Highness?

256
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,780
Not anymore.

257
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,500
Then, Your Highness, how about sending me back to Qingluan Hall?

258
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,970
Tonight, I have important matters to attend to.

259
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,090
Do not worry. Tomorrow night, I will definitely go to your hall.

260
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,260
I will await Your Imperial Highness.

261
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,140
Shi'en, go and check to see if this fragrance pouch has any problems.

262
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,510
Your Highness, you are too nervous.

263
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,450
This is just a normal flower scented pouch.

264
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,610
Yes.

265
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,660
Related Lady Zhao of Excellence is so warm and pretty.

266
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,800
Li Chengyin truly likes her.

267
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,710
How great would it be if the two of them were together?

268
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,470
But because he is the crown prince, he had to marry me.

269
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:14,480
I then became the most hateful person stuck in between them.

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,910
No wonder he is constantly afraid that I will harm her.

271
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,350
I really admire her.

272
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,260
I am not jealous.

273
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,580
I just admire her. I admire the fact that there is someone who treats her so well.

274
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,230
A'Du,

275
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,800
do you miss our home?

276
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,740
I really miss Xi State.

277
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,380
Every night, when I see that tree,

278
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,760
I will think about Xi State's vast desert and grasslands.

279
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,310
I will think about riding horses at night with my brothers,

280
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,090
galloping into the depths of the wide desert.

281
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,040
The wind blew across the splendid achnatherum, making a sandy sound.

282
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,830
The starry sky is so low.

283
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,470
So clear. So smooth.

284
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,550
Like frozen grapes, sweet and sour.

285
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,510
But the more I think of Xi State,

286
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,660
the more I hate the cold and quiet Eastern Palace.

287
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,850
Cousin, how is it?

288
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,330
I got the intel. The child in Xuniang's stomach is indeed Zhang Can's.

289
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,040
This Zhang Can is the empress' distant cousin.

290
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,420
He was arranged to be a part of the Yuilin Palace Guards, but he didn't publicize his relations with the empress.

291
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,290
He uses his palace guard position to commit crimes outside of the palace and is very addicted to gambling.

292
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,720
He was also involved in several murder cases.

293
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,560
Xuniang originally didn't like him.

294
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,750
He forced himself on her. That's how she got pregnant.

295
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,170
This empress really knows how to use people.

296
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,830
I met with all the Submerged Dragon Envoys and thought of a plan.

297
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,790
Use Zhang Can to sow discord between Prime Minister Gao and the empress.

298
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,520
Cousin, please tell me more.

299
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,400
We've planted Tao Jian near Gao Zhen.

300
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,630
He has gained his trust already and is by his side almost every day.

301
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,750
He knows everything about the gambling house.

302
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,010
Hurry! Open!

303
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,720
Young Lord Gao.

304
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,440
A few days ago, Tao Jian reported

305
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,320
he saw Zhang Can in Gao Zhen's gambling house.

306
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,960
Zhang Can owes quite a bit of gambling debt.

307
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,240
You people let-let go of me! Let-Let go of me!

308
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,710
You people... What are you guys doing?!

309
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,880
What are you guys doing?! Why won't you let me win back what I've lost?

310
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,500
Don't come inside to gamble if you don't have the money!

311
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,250
If you don't pay back your debt, I'll break your bones.

312
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,900
Just you wait. Just you wait!

313
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,760
- What you looking at!
- Hu Xiao has made contact with Zhang Can.

314
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,180
Once Zhang Can gets in trouble and is unable to dig himself out,

315
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,710
Hu Xiao will think of a way to help him out of it.

316
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,850
- Brother Xiao.
- What is it?

317
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,880
I don't know how to tell you this.

318
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,180
People from Gao Zhen's gambling house are chasing me for the gambling debts I owe them.

319
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,420
What should I do?

320
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,360
Gao Zhen's gambling house isn't legal in the first place.

321
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,470
It is secretly hidden inside a tea house.

322
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,940
They don't pay taxes and are not registered with the government.

323
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,260
If we were to stir this up

324
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,050
and let the gambling house get investigated, then all the money you lost there would no longer be valid.

325
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,260
Brother Xiao, you mean...

326
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,440
Gao Zhen sees this gambling house as his money tree.

327
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,650
He won't allow anyone to touch it.

328
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,850
If Zhang Can reports it to the local authorities,

329
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,490
Gao Zhen would definitely be angered and go after him.

330
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,900
Sir, it's only an ordinary tea house inside.

331
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
- Withdraw.
- Yes

332
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,230
What bastard dares to touch my territory?

333
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:09,640
Thank goodness we have inside people to give us the heads up.

334
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:14,050
Young Lord, let me investigate this matter.

335
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,180
I'll dig out the snitch.

336
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,570
With Tao Jian's help, Gao Zhen will know

337
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,750
what we want him to know.

338
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,620
Brother Tao, is there anything going on?

339
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,780
Among those who would intrude into my territory

340
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,280
in the whole capital, you are the only person.

341
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,460
Be a man and confess,

342
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,430
and let me know how dense your bones are.

343
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,130
You owe me money

344
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,640
and even want to ruin my place?! You should have asked around who Gao Zhen was!

345
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,570
Go, go, go. Is he still alive?

346
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,210
Go check him out.

347
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:30,030
But Zhang Can is the empress' mole.

348
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:34,150
Unless someone exposes the matter in front of Imperial Father and Mother,

349
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,520
even if something did happen, the empress will not take up the issue.

350
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,900
We will rile up the Zhang family to harass the empress.

351
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,090
Then the empress has to deal with it.

352
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,270
Young Lord, don't panic. He's just a lousy gambler.

353
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,040
We can throw him in the river and no one will know.

354
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,050
Go. Hurry!

355
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,040
Throw him in the river. Hurry!

356
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,860
You have people inside the local authority.

357
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,890
We can bribe them

358
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,970
and have them close the case as an accidental death due to intoxication.

359
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,330
It will never be linked back to you.

360
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,500
There is a critical part of this plan where no mistakes must occur.

361
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,760
If the empress finds out that Zhang Can got into trouble at Gao Zhen's gambling house,

362
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,760
she will immediately notify the Gao family.

363
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,830
You're right. So, Gao Zhen cannot show himself.

364
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,490
It's best if he leaves the capital immediately.

365
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,920
Not even his father Gao Yuming should know about it.

366
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,750
Young Lord, you should not stay here.

367
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,860
It's best to leave the city now.

368
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,220
We will tell people that you went hunting.

369
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,310
You were never in town.

370
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,450
Even if the authority did link it back to the gambling house, it would just be a homicide between gamblers.

371
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,460
It won't be connected to you.

372
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,090
Tao Jian, get on it.

373
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,060
There will be a big reward for you.

374
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,640
Big reward.

375
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,930
Greetings, Your Imperial Majesty.

376
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,880
- Your Majesty.
- Rise.

377
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,450
Your son greets Imperial Mother.

378
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,680
Why does Your Majesty suddenly come today?

379
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,590
I went to see Grand Empress Dowager and ran into the crown prince.

380
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,160
The crown prince says your tea is the most fragrant.

381
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,850
So I am here to try some.

382
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:39,840
We haven't been together for quite some time either.

383
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,800
- I will order my servants to prepare the tea and snacks right now.
- All right.

384
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,310
- Your Majesty--
- Empress!

385
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,600
Em... Greetings Your Imperial Majesty.

386
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,260
What could be so important that you rushed recklessly in?

387
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,090
How dare you lose manners in front of His Imperial Majesty?

388
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,030
Explain yourself.

389
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,220
Your Imperial Majesty, it's Lady of Pei State requesting for an audience with the empress.
(T/N: Some women who has contributed greatly to the empire or if her husband was a great hero are given titles usually named after a place)

390
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,660
I don't know why Mother is here, either.

391
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,360
Since she is already here, just let her come in.

392
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,010
Yes.

393
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,260
I beg Emperor and Empress to give me justice!

394
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,660
Madam Zhang, how can you lose etiquette in front of the emperor?

395
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,330
Just say what you need to say.

396
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,810
Lady of Pei State, who is she?

397
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,090
Replying to Your Imperial Majesty.

398
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,010
Madam Zhang is my husband's relative.

399
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,440
The wife of my late husband's uncle.

400
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,820
Her son had died suddenly.

401
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:55,060
When he was picked up from the river, his body was full of wounds.

402
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,200
He was clearly beaten to death,

403
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,380
yet he was deemed to have gotten drunk, fell into the water, and drowned.

404
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,180
Madam Zhang doesn't know where to go to voice her grievances.

405
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,480
She finally begged me to come to see Empress.

406
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,300
Emperor, my son was murdered!

407
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,150
Someone saw people from a gambling house throwing his body into the river.

408
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,870
Yet, the local authority quickly closed out his case.

409
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,730
The local authority refused to properly investigate.

410
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,730
Commoners can't fight the government officials.

411
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:33,910
The person who killed my son must've been rich and powerful. They can cover up anything.

412
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,820
I have no choice!

413
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,520
I have to come here to ask the empress' help!

414
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,270
Since it is a wrongful death, the law will handle it.

415
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,410
You should not be wailing in front of the emperor.

416
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,630
Empress!

417
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,680
My son, Zhang Can, worked for you. You shouldn't fail him!

418
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,080
You—

419
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,250
This matter probably should be handled by the Court of Judicial Review.

420
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,720
Imperial Father, based on Madam Zhang's words,

421
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,240
if this matter is related to people of prestige and power, their subordinates will cover it up.

422
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,790
Isn't it better to choose a more suitable candidate?

423
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,440
Who do you think it should be?

424
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,100
Imperial Father, let me handle this case. I'll definitely uncover the truth.

425
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,250
- You?
- Yes.

426
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,110
As a court official, I should work to help our empire, to help relieve your workload.

427
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,030
As a son, I should also help relieve Imperial Mother's worries.

428
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,760
Imperial Father, let me handle this case. I'll definitely uncover the truth.

429
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,210
All right. I'll hand it over to you.

430
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,210
Yes, Imperial Father.

431
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,290
Thank you, Emperor.

432
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,260
Thank you, Empress.

433
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,570
[Clean and Peaceful Palace]

434
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,280
Raise the carriage!

435
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,590
Mother, how come you brought that person into the palace on your own accord? You didn't even warn me first.

436
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,290
I remember you telling me before that

437
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,490
you placed Zhang Can in the Yulin Palace Guards to monitor the crown prince.

438
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,780
Even your uncle doesn't know about it.

439
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,520
But who knew that this would happen to Zhang Can?

440
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,300
Your aunt came to our house and cried all night.

441
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,960
I also brought her here because I had no other way.

442
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,090
Such an unlucky coincidence that the emperor showed up.

443
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,540
What are you worrying about?

444
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:01,140
Didn't the emperor already ask the crown prince to investigate this case?

445
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,130
I have this feeling that this matter isn't that simple.

446
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,910
Mother, pay attention to this case outside the palace.

447
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,260
Once there's any news, you must let me know immediately.

448
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,450
I know. You can rest assured.

449
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,750
- Cao Ji.
- Yes.

450
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,820
What are your thoughts on what happened today?

451
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,550
This...

452
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,270
Go ahead and say it.

453
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,080
I just think today was too coincidental.

454
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,720
If you hadn't listened to Grand Empress Dowager

455
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,450
and decided to visit the empress in her palace,

456
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,680
you wouldn't have run into this incident.

457
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,640
You're saying today's coincidence is not actually a coincidence, right?

458
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,050
I sure would like to see

459
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,560
who had set up a good show for me to watch.

460
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:18,950
This is a big matter. Why isn't Zhen'er in the capital?

461
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,940
The gambling house said Brother went hunting three days ago.

462
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,520
So, it's not his fault that he isn't aware of this matter.

463
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,810
Father, should I smooth this out?

464
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,220
Zhen'er's gambling house is not directly connected to you.

465
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,270
That's good. No matter how they investigate, it won't have anything to do with you.

466
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,670
I heard the deceased is named Zhang Can. I checked into him.

467
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,260
He was definitely empress'

468
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,850
distant cousin. Son of a concubine.

469
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,380
His mother was only a maid.

470
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,070
She has no standing in the Zhang family.

471
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,080
Zhang Can was an arrogant troublemaker.

472
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,970
The empress is concerned that he will create trouble for her,

473
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,750
so she forbade him from publicizing he was related to her.

474
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,160
It's only because Aunt brought his mother to the empress,

475
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,140
the empress has no choice but to ask the emperor for an investigation.

476
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,210
If that was the case, we definitely should not interfere.

477
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:10,160
Tell Zhen'er not to come back until the case is settled.

478
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,880
Father, there is one more odd thing.

479
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,950
You had told me to look into Xuniang

480
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,730
and I found out she and Zhang Can had a relationship.

481
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,660
Don't you think that is suspicious?

482
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,690
It is.

483
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,150
We should continue the investigation.

484
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,310
But don't give yourself away.

485
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,530
Don't let it be connected back to us.

486
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,040
Understood.

[Qingluan Hall]

488
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,290
Your Imperial Highness is in a bad mood today?

489
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,950
It's because of that Zhang Can's murder case.

490
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,760
Your Highness is in charge of investigating this case?

491
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,470
That's correct. This case involves my imperial mother's cousin.

492
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,350
I originally wanted to get justice for Zhang Can

493
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,270
to ameliorate the relationship with my mother.

494
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,190
But it is my first case, therefore...

495
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,420
In addition, those high court officials are afraid of getting in trouble.

496
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,900
Up to now, I can't find a suitable candidate.

497
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,800
Your Highness, I have someone to refer to you.

498
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,280
Who?

499
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,610
My elder brother.

00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:48,820
Zhao Shixuan?

501
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,860
That's true. Zhao Shixuan is from your family.

502
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,850
To ask him to assist me would be logical.

503
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,530
My brother will definitely do his utmost for Your Imperial Highness.

504
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,080
Good.

- Is that true?
- Answering back to My Lord. Yes, I've confirmed this.

510
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,570
Gao Zhen left the capital quietly the night after the incident occurred,

511
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:39,120
but he told everyone that he arrived in Ling Province the day before.

512
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,820
It smells fishy for Gao Zhen to act like this.

513
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,390
He may just be connected to Zhang Can's death.

00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,980
Yes.

516
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,450
Come back!

517
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,980
If you find any witnesses or proof, you must hide them and guard them well.

518
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,760
Do not let the Gao family know, nor the crown prince.

519
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,510
Don't let the crown prince know?

520
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,840
What is the relationship between Prime Minister Gao and the crown prince?

521
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,220
If the crown prince knows about it,

522
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,660
then that bastard Gao Zhen will use the opportunity to downplay the incident,

523
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,480
and turn it into nothing.

524
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,660
I understand.

525
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,350
If you get the proof before the Court of Judicial Review finds out,

526
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,630
then we can hide it from the crown prince.

527
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:33,480
Once we have all the evidence, we will directly present it to the Court of Judicial Review.

528
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,670
Because this matter is of urgency, we don't have time to report it to the crown prince.

529
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:43,390
No one will blame the crown prince since he doesn't know.

530
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,180
By then, I want to see

531
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,250
how the Gao family will try to defend Gao Zhen with everybody watching.

532
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,000
Related Lady of Excellence, you have been embroidering so diligently day and night.

533
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,640
Aren't you afraid of harming your eyes?

534
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,840
It'll be the Qixi Festival soon.
('T/N: "qixi" - literally night of the seventh, occurs every 7th day of the 7th lunar month, also considered the Chinese Valentine's Day)

535
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,250
I want to personally make a fragrance pouch for His Imperial Highness.

536
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,490
Your embroidery skill is even unmatched by the top embroidery lady of the Silk Embroidery Service.

537
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,060
I don't know if he will like this design.

538
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:21,310
I think he will like whatever you embroider.

539
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,760
Nowadays, the crown prince favors you and relies heavily on the Zhao family.

540
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,590
I've heard that he has been visiting the Zhao manor every day.

541
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,680
Unable to stay far from the young master.

542
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,220
Of course, my brother will help me.

543
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,500
As long as His Imperial Highness is able to understand my sincere feelings.

544
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,710
What are you doing here?

545
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,070
Today is the Qixi Festival.

546
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,820
It is so lively outside, so I just knew that you would not be able to sit still and would go outside.

547
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,620
Hence, I came here to catch you.

548
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,370
Catch me?

549
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,610
You're not planning to report me to the grand empress dowager and the empress, right?

550
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,600
To report or not depends on your behavior.

551
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,150
If you go outside with me, then I will not report you.

552
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,780
Why are you looking at her? She is not allowed to come with us.

553
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,610
Why not?

554
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,650
Consider carefully.

555
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,090
If you are not willing, then I will tell Imperial Mother.

556
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,940
At that point, the two of us will not be able to go out.

557
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,720
Who knows? We might even be forbidden to go out for a few months.

558
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,310
No need for that. I will protect her.

559
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,910
Let's go.

560
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,360
A'Du...

561
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,550
Are you still able to carry us on your boat, Mr. Boatman?

562
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,800
Customer, it is very late already.

563
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,700
I have stopped working for today. It is best if the two of you just come back tomorrow.

564
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,420
Boatman, rent the boat to us. We will row ourselves.

565
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,700
Then, the two of you must be careful.

566
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,290
Thank you.

567
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,710
Why are we rowing a boat in the middle of the night? It would be better to just have a drink in town.

568
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:32,270
Woman, you only know to drink and fight all day. You really do not know how to be romantic.

569
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,480
As if you know how to be romantic.

570
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,210
The two of you must be careful.

571
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,810
Thank you.

572
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,820
Before, when you were shooting wooden ducks and fell into the water,

573
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,310
did you not say that you had never seen a boat before?

574
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,490
Today is Qixi.

575
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,480
What wish have you made to the Weaving Goddess?
(T/N: Qixi Festival celebrates the love story between Weaving Girl and Cowherd)

576
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,000
Weaving Goddess, please let this person stay far away from me.

577
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,690
Do not let him come bother me. He is so annoying.

578
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,260
Do you think I am willing?

579
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,970
Isn't it because you are both stubborn and dumb, that I just could not take it anymore?

580
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,590
Then, you can go find your warm, beautiful, kind, generous, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

581
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,840
Why did you come over here to row a boat for me?

582
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,250
You are my official and legal wife.

583
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,040
If I want to do something with you, then I will do it with you.

584
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,610
Sing a song for me.

585
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,240
If you want me to sing, then I will sing?

586
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,450
I am rowing a boat for you. What is the big deal with singing a song for me?

587
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,780
I will not sing.

588
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:34,230
♪ A fox sitting on top of the sand dune ♪

589
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:40,150
♪ Sitting on top of the sand dune, looking at the moon ♪

590
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:48,900
♪ But actually, it's not watching the moon ♪

591
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:55,210
♪ It's waiting for the shepherd girl to come back ♪

592
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,220
It sounds horrible. Change the song.

593
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,900
Change the song.

594
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,420
I only know how to sing this one song.

595
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,970
You come here, I will row the boat.

596
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,610
You?

597
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,160
- Be careful.
- Here.
