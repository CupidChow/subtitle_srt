00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,190
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,600
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,340
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:52,000
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,640
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,010
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,190
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,200
♫  so what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,940
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:24,680
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,900
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:39,040
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,800
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,710
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,640
[Episode 34]

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,930
General Pei, thank you.

18
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,170
Crown Princess Consort, I'll take my leave then.

19
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,580
Crown Princess Consort, I deserve to be killed.

20
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,170
I waited here for you for four hours.

21
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,500
It's quite late. Where did you go?

22
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,660
I...

23
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,190
Yongniang, you all leave first.

24
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,700
Yes.

25
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,270
What are you looking at?

26
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,600
I fell into the water and General Pei gave me some clothes to change in. That's all.

27
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:20,000
That's all? Every time you leave the palace, you cause chaos outside.

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,720
General Pei has governmental responsibilities. He is in charge of protecting the whole Eastern Palace.

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,340
He's not here to follow you around all day, protect you, and fix the issues you've caused.

30
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,450
You were the one who told him to follow me around and prevented him from doing his duties. How could you blame me?

31
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,100
If you didn't sneak out every day, would I have someone follow you?!

32
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,420
Did you come to Bearing Graces Hall this late just to fight with me?

33
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,710
No.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,370
Last time, you asked me about the wolf tooth. I thought about it and thought I should give you an answer.

35
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,000
I found that wolf tooth on my journey back from the Western Border.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,810
It was found in front of my tent. I didn't know who it belonged to so I brought it back.

37
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,470
At that time, Sese liked it so I gifted it to her.

38
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:12,340
Since it is yours, I will find an appropriate time to get it and return it to you.

39
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,840
You should have returned it to me earlier.

40
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,530
Your Imperial Majesty, the other day, the Protectorate General Office in the Western Border reported

41
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,500
that the remnant army of Danchi escaped towards the southwest of Shuobo State. They are hiding in the western valley of Yanzhi Mountain.

42
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,030
They frequently attack the soldiers, harass the citizens, and create major disturbances in the Western Border. Far Subduing Generalissimo Gao Xian

43
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,000
is requesting for a western expedition in order to decimate the rebels and spare us from future trouble. He asks for twenty-five million kilograms of food supplies

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,550
and one million taels of silver for military payroll.

45
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,470
May Your Imperial Majesty approve of it.

46
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,750
Minister Gao, my father is the North Subduing Marquis of Danchi.

47
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,910
Therefore, the responsibility to capture the Danchi remnants belongs to our Zhao family.

48
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,190
The military provisions and payroll should be distributed to the North Subduing Marquis.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,110
Your Imperial Highness, the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border

50
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,940
has guarded the border and maintained its stability throughout the years.

51
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,200
Therefore, General Gao should be the one in-charge of capturing the Danchi remnants.

52
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,920
Your Imperial Majesty ordered General Zhao to take charge of Danchi

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,220
for the purpose of pacifying the Danchi people. It doesn't make sense to give

54
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,000
the military payroll and forage to the North Subduing Marquis.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Twenty-five million kilograms of forage? One million taels of silver for wages? These are not small sums.

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,180
Why does capturing a small group of remaining Danchi fighters require so much forage and silver?

57
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,790
Besides, it's not up to you to decide who will lead the expedition.

58
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,600
You don't want to distribute the payroll to the North Subduing Marquis, maybe because this a plot between you Gao brothers

59
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,770
of embezzling the treasury funds under the guise of military justification! Am I right?

60
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,670
Official Zhao, how can you bring up personal disputes

61
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,940
to the royal court and make up stories?

62
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,500
Your Imperial Majesty, I've been the Minister of Revenue for many years.

63
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,760
Every transaction is recorded in the journal.

64
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,020
I have never coveted it in private.

65
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,390
- While you've kept mentioning the military payroll. What do you really want?
- You...

66
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,020
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

67
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,280
This affair involves national security. Please make a decision, Imperial Father.

68
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,510
Prime Minister Gao, what is your opinion?

69
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,680
When it comes to the border, even a small matter is critical.

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,220
Ministers, generals, Gao family, and Zhao family, we all work for His Imperial Majesty.

71
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,400
We just have different roles and must consider based on different perspectives.

72
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,710
General Gao uses an iron hand to capture the remnants.

73
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,210
General Zhao uses gentle policies to pacify the people.

74
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,160
The dual-use of strength and kindness

75
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,200
is the way to keep the Danchi people willingly obedient

76
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,490
and secure the peace in that area.

77
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,770
Zhao Kun.

78
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,950
I'm here.

79
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,200
Can the Ministry of Revenue afford to spend what Gao Xian requested?

80
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,990
Your Imperial Majesty, in the past, it's quite a stretch to come up with this sum.

81
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:46,000
However, we've had a good harvest this year. The weather has been good since late spring. Our granaries are full.

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
- Your Imperial Majesty!
- If the empire is going to war,

83
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,550
- the soldiers naturally must eat well.
- Right. Right.

84
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,750
- We definitely cannot be lacking in rations. Zhao Kun!
- That's right.

85
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,040
I am here.

86
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,200
Write up a clear and accurate memorial for me.

87
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,900
You mustn't aggrieve the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border,

88
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,850
nor will you leave our State Treasury empty.

89
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,520
Your Imperial Majesty is wise.

90
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,030
Your Imperial Highness, the Gao family was colluding in court today. Just for their own pockets, they disregarded the people's needs.

91
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,150
How can you keep tolerating them?

92
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,000
What do you think happened today?

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,610
Your Highness, the Danchi State has been eliminated. It's only the feeble, old, women, and children that have escaped to the west.

94
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,800
It isn't necessary to send a 100,000-men army to go after them.

95
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,100
Gao Xian is definitely eyeing the money by using the expedition as an excuse.

96
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,040
Or he may be taking this opportunity to gather his own army.

97
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,520
You have to be cautious of his dark plans.

98
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,810
You saw it, too.

99
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,200
In the past, there were still allies of Elder Prince Zhong arguing with the Gao family in court.

100
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,760
But in the court now, even you have to listen to the Gao family.

101
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,050
So, Your Highness will just let it go?

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,070
Unless you have evidence to prove

103
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,940
that Prime Minister Gao has an ulterior motive.

104
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,400
If you just say one word, I will dedicate myself to the investigation.

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,150
I will not be afraid or avoid trouble.

106
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,550
I will take my leave now.

107
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,490
Greetings to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince. I am Chen Yan.

108
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,600
Miss Mingyue, please have a seat.

109
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,100
What would you like to talk to me about?

110
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,300
I am willing to assist Your Imperial Highness to topple the Gao family, and redress both the Gu and Chen families.

111
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,630
Mingyue!

112
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,780
I was fortunate enough to see His Imperial Majesty twice. His Imperial Majesty has started to trust me a little.

113
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,900
If I can get him to give us some help, the redress of our case might happen sooner.

114
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,480
My imperial father has seen you? Does he know about your background?

115
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,500
Your Imperial Highness, this shouldn't be done under any circumstances.

116
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,780
Mingyue is only a lady and she doesn't know any martial arts. It's already super dangerous for her to see the emperor.

117
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,800
If we still involve her in this, Prime Minister Gao will definitely not let her go easily.

118
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,820
That's exactly what I want.

119
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,140
He killed my mother and eliminated my clan.

120
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,870
This matter must be settled.

121
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,520
It seems that you have made up your mind.

122
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,400
If I don't agree today and reject your kind offer,

123
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,990
you would still

124
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,020
use your relationship with my father to follow through with this plan. Right?

125
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,750
Yes.

126
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,200
Mingyue, if anything were to happen to you,

127
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,730
even If I die ten thousand times, I still cannot answer properly to Godfather.

128
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll explain it to him myself.

129
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,960
I respect your tremendous wisdom and courage.

130
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,830
But Prime Minister Gao's shrewdness and viciousness are way beyond what you can imagine.

131
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:42,500
Since Sir Chai is not here, if harm really comes to you, I will not be able to rest easy.

132
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,520
Your Highness, what Prime Minister has done

133
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,300
is not only the massacre of the Chen and Gu families years ago.

134
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,090
Think about it. The imperial court today is under Prime Minister Gao's influence and threat.

135
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,490
Also, the previous case of the imperial examination. They are all the results of the Gao family's immense power.

136
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,110
If we continue to allow the Gao family to endanger the society of our Li Empire, it would be the citizens who will suffer the consequences.

137
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,980
Your Highness, if we must make sacrifices, it is enough that I am the one.

138
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I will use this tea to toast you.

139
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,220
Cousin, I know you are perplexed as to why I agreed to Mingyue's plan.

140
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,550
I also know how you think of me. You think that I am very selfish.

141
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,300
You think that for my goals, I would use all the innocent people around me. Am I right?

142
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,580
But have you considered that if I don't agree with her request,

143
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,900
she would act on her own? She might face even more danger.

144
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,680
If she discusses everything with me and with my protection, she might be safer.

145
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,740
Excuses.

146
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,200
Gu Jian.

147
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,500
All right, I will admit that I do have personal reasons.

148
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,930
I also want to topple Prime Minister Gao as soon as possible; hence, I agreed to her request.

149
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,030
Do we have other methods?

150
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,150
Cousin, we all cannot wait any longer. Prime Minister Gao has already started to suspect me.

151
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,600
He was able to find out about Sir Chai. Then, uncovering his true identity will be inevitable.

152
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,760
All of us will be in danger then. Do you understand?

153
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,780
Related Lady of Excellence, what is the matter with you?

154
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,870
My eyesight got blurry because I knelt for too long.

155
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,400
A while back, you were put on house arrest. Now, you're being punished to kneel here and read Buddhist scriptures.

156
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,320
The empress is so biased. Even the crown prince believes that crown princess consort sabotaged you,

157
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,700
and she still punished you.

158
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,860
It doesn't matter how the empress treats me,

159
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,970
as long as His Imperial Highness believes me, that's enough.

160
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,770
Fortunately, the crown prince's heart only has you.

161
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,150
Every morning and evening, he comes to Qingluan Hall to find you.

162
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,700
Too bad the empress prohibited the crown prince from entering here.

163
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,030
Even though I occasionally receive items sent from my hometown,

164
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,250
I've already been married for a year and have only received one letter from dad.

165
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,800
Mom has never sent a letter to me.

166
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,270
I don't even know when Older Brother will come and visit me.

167
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,450
One day, when I get the opportunity,

168
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,770
I will try to ask for a royal decree to visit the Xi State once.

169
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,750
Dad and Mom, I miss you a lot.

170
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,330
Crown Princess Consort, Princess Yongning and Princess Luoxi are here.

171
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,340
Yongning! Luoxi! Why are you here?

172
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,220
- Xiaofeng.
- Sit.

173
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,400
We just received news that the empress will host a royal family banquet in the palace tonight.

174
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Banquet? We're not admiring flowers again, right?

175
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,700
They say it's to allow royal ladies and ladies from important families to interact more.

176
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,360
But it's actually to find husbands for princesses that are of age to marry. Luoxi is included in it.

177
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,900
Why just me? Aren't you of age to marry, too?

178
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,360
I'm not willing to marry far or marry below me so I'd rather not marry. You're different, though.

179
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,090
You have a crush. It doesn't matter if you marry far or marry below you,

180
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,160
wherever he goes, you will have to go, too.

181
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,400
If we marry or not, it will be Imperial Father's decision. You don't have a say it.

182
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,230
Xiaofeng.

183
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,470
- Xiaofeng!
- What's wrong with you?

184
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,600
Will everyone go tonight?

185
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,800
Imperial Father and Mother will both be there. So, you and the crown prince will have to be there as well.

186
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,780
Won't I be seeing Li Chengyin again?

187
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,160
My fifth brother bullied you again?

188
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:01,200
Yongning, are you even my friend? When you hear that Li Chengyin is bullying me, you look forward to it happening.

189
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,250
No. No. I think that my fifth brother cares about you a lot.

190
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,300
Yes. You and my fifth brother are a quarrelsome but loving couple.

191
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,300
You always say that he's bullying you. But I think that ever since he got married to you,

192
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,410
he's become a different person. He's more human-like now.

193
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,930
That's because he married Lady Zhao. It has nothing to do with me.

194
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,340
Luoxi. Luoxi!

195
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,030
Isn't General Pei Zhao such a block of wood?

196
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:21,770
There's a beautiful lady right in front of him, and yet his gaze doesn't even wander towards here.

197
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,330
Who said so?

198
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,090
General Pei is a gentleman.

199
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,830
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

200
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,380
Whatever he does is good.

201
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,610
"Red beans grow in the southern state.

202
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,460
When spring comes, they grow a few branches.
(T/N: From the poem "Yearning" by Wang Wei)

203
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,040
I wish for you to pick more. These are what one yearns for the most."

204
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,770
What are you saying?

205
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,480
Nothing.

206
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,030
Last time, during your birthday,

207
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,900
Xiaofeng said that someone's inner poet came out,

208
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,780
and started to recite love poems to some other person.

209
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,210
Yongning, I'm going to hit you.

210
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,870
Don't! Don't!

211
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,420
Look at the dance.

212
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,750
Where are you going?

213
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,650
I'm going to drink with Yongning.

214
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,660
As the crown princess consort, you cannot wander around during these events. Did you not know?

215
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,300
Sit now, and eat your food.

216
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,890
How can I eat if you keep holding onto me?

217
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,990
Yongniang?

218
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,340
What is this big bug?

219
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,380
Can I eat it?

220
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,570
Crown Princess, it's a crab.

221
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,290
You don't have to eat it if you don't want to.

222
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,360
"Crab pincers are like a magical drug, a pill of immortality.

223
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,990
Brewed wines are like the immortal mountain Penglai."
(T/N: From the poem "Drinking Alone under the Moon" by Li Bai)

224
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,500
Elder Sister, do you not like crab?

225
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,460
How does a barbaric girl like her know what crab is?

226
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,950
She's probably never seen one.

227
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,380
I indeed have never seen this big bug before,

228
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,850
but you probably have never seen the red deer and antelope from our Western Border, either.

229
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,090
Each country has its own specialties. What's so surprising about that?

230
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,170
Here, Sese.

231
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,160
I forgot. Last time, you ate the longevity noodles and got sick.

232
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,210
Crabmeat is considered a cold food. You cannot eat today.

233
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,790
It's one thing that I forgot about it, but how can you forget, too?

234
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:15,800
Why don't you know how to take care of yourself?

235
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,710
The crab meat gets cold if left out. It's a waste to throw it.

236
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,580
Shi'en.

237
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,450
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

238
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,760
Give it to the crown princess consort.

239
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,520
Yes, Your Imperial Highness.

240
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,320
It's tasty!

241
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,910
Who is this girl?

242
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,430
Your Imperial Majesty, this is Prime Minister Gao's only daughter. Her name is Gao Ruyi.

243
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,770
I, Ruyi, greet Your Imperial Majesty.

244
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,260
Good! Good!

245
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,510
"When you think of the clouds, you think of her clothes; when you think of flowers, you think of her face.
(T/N: From the poem "Song of Purity and Peace, 1 of 3" by Li Bai)

246
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,990
The spring wind caresses the railing; the dew moistens her clothes to a darker yellow."

247
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,310
You danced really well to

248
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:18,430
the tune of "Raiment of Rainbows and Feathers."
(T/N: a Tang Dynasty Song)

249
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,580
I really can't believe that

250
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,250
Prime Minister Gao has a daughter like you.

251
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,520
You not only possess beauty,

252
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,440
you also dance with such lightness and poise.

253
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,540
Good.

254
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,940
May I ask if Ruyi's dance is to Your Imperial Majesty's liking?

255
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,320
Empress, you are always so considerate.

256
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,460
You surely know what I like.

257
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:51,820
Since Your Imperial Majesty likes it, is there any reward?

258
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:56,330
I will definitely give a reward.

259
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,810
A'Du! Yongniang, close the door.

260
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,480
Come.

261
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,450
I brought something for you two.

262
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,420
This crab is really tasty!

263
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,640
Have a taste, Yongniang.

264
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,080
Crown Princess Consort, please punish me with death!

265
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,100
This is food from the royal banquet.

266
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,720
My status is too low. How could I eat it?

267
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,960
May... Crown Princess Consort punish me—

268
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:46,970
Don't spit it out. This is food from the royal banquet.

269
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,960
It would be a huge disrespect if you don't eat it.

270
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,590
Not only would you die, but I would also be punished for stealing the crab as well.

271
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,870
You just eat it.

272
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,970
Try it.

273
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,930
Does it taste good?

274
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,650
Crown Princess Consort, if it weren't for the crown prince's help today,

275
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,870
you wouldn't have learned how to eat a crab and would've been laughed at by others, too.

276
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,350
It shows that the crown prince still cares for you.

277
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,630
During usual days, you should also treat the crown prince with a better attitude.

278
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,160
- Was he trying to help me?
- Yes.

279
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,670
Why would he help me?

280
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:33,070
Doesn't he hate me?

281
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,580
Empress, my elder brother searched the whole Western Border

282
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,080
and eventually located a skilled craftsman to work more than half a year

283
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,880
to make this Bodhisattva holding a baby statue.

284
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,790
He also asked a highly respected monk to bless it for eighty-one days.

285
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,810
It should be able to grant wishes.

286
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,450
Elder Cousin is being too courteous.

287
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,840
Empress, my big brother...

288
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,700
is anxious for Ruyi.

289
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,310
Ruyi has entered the palace for some days now.

290
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,150
We hope that Empress can help

291
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,180
arrange for Ruyi to serve in His Imperial Majesty's chambers.

292
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,130
Ruyi's "Raiment of Rainbows and Feathers" dance that day

293
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,410
has been complemented by the emperor.

294
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,130
With her outstanding appearance and intelligence, obtaining the heart of the emperor will happen sooner or later.

295
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,650
My help is unnecessary.

296
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,420
Empress is too kind in compliments.

297
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,890
There are so many beauties in the inner palace.

298
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,820
It's not easy to catch the emperor's heart.

299
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,970
Father hopes Empress will give special care to my sister.

300
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,530
If Ruyi receives the emperor's favor,

301
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,640
the Gao family will never forget your kindness.

302
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,910
I understand what uncle wants.

303
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,470
Please go home and tell Uncle

304
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,440
that I will definitely give it my all to arrange it.

305
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,980
Thank you, Empress.

306
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,200
Empress, please stay calm. Don't get upset with the Bodhisattva.

307
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,690
They weren't giving me a gift.

308
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,280
They were here to collect a debt.

309
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,740
You don't need to worry much. Gao Ruyi looks skinny and weak.

310
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,190
Even if you arrange for her to attend to the emperor and be graced to sleep with him,

311
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,320
it's still doubtful that she'll get pregnant.

312
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,450
You know about the tricks in the inner palace.

313
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:08,620
If she obtains the emperor's favor, she can become pregnant even if she isn't pregnant.

314
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:13,410
Once she is pregnant, even a princess can become a prince.

315
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,850
What worries me the most now

316
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,820
is that the crown prince is becoming estranged from me.

317
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:23,850
Everything I say, he only gives lip service.

318
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,830
If Ruyi really bears a son,

319
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,170
Prime Minister Gao will definitely support her child.

320
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,210
When that time comes, I may even lose my empress title.

321
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,180
Empress, if that's true, you need to make a plan before it's too late.

322
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,230
This statue of Bodhisattva with a baby came just at the right time.

323
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,190
I indeed need an obedient prince.

324
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,570
Does Zhang Can know Xuniang is pregnant with his child?

325
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,900
I have warned Xu Niang, so Zhang Can doesn't know about it.

326
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,800
Do you actually plan to...

327
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,440
I need to carefully make use of this dangerous move.

328
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,270
Your Imperial Highness, Empress sent someone here earlier to relay a message

329
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,140
inviting you to dinner at Clean and Peaceful Palace later.

330
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,420
I got it. After my lessons, I will go there.

331
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,790
Yes. I will answer them immediately.

332
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,720
Wait!

333
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,230
Shi'en.

334
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:09,000
What do you think women like the most?

335
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,250
Women?

336
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:17,660
I asked the wrong person. How would you know?

337
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,500
You can leave.

338
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,140
Your Highness, you asked the right person!

339
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,380
I know what women like the most.

340
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,280
Tell me.

341
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,540
I won't hide it from you.

342
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,150
The palace's female servants all have a good relationship with me.

343
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,650
When they have any problems they willingly share them with me,

344
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,570
and often tell me about their love concerns.

345
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,500
Hurry up and say it. What ways are there to make a woman happy?

346
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,870
I understand now. Your Highness wants to make Related Lady of Excellence Zhao happy.

347
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:06,840
Perhaps, it's to make Crown Princess Consort happy?

348
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,370
You... Why do you spout so much nonsense? Just tell me.

349
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,480
Yes.

350
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,760
Your Highness, pretty clothes, unique accessories, and rouge

351
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,210
will definitely make women very happy.

352
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,410
Women, all like to be beautiful.

353
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:24,090
All day, they think about how they should dress.

354
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,910
As they say, "A woman dolls herself up for self-pleasure."

355
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,490
Wow, you are a little bit useful.

356
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,580
But unique clothes and accessories—

357
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,860
Your Highness, if we're talking about unique clothes and accessories

358
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:49,680
then it must be from the capital's most famous shop Weipin Pavilion.

359
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,720
Weipin Pavilion?

360
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,550
Come! Take a look! Everyone come look!

361
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,900
Pretty accessories! Sugarcoated hawthorns!

362
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,040
Sugarcoated hawthorns! Sugarcoated hawthorns!

363
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,900
Pretty accessories!

364
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,940
Come look! Buy it all!

365
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,590
Pretty accessories!

366
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,860
Take a look!

367
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,080
Take a look, customer!

368
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,460
Selling noodles!

369
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,340
A'Du, wait for me at Mi Luo Drinking House.

370
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,860
- Give me a bowl of wontons! 
-  Customer, have a bowl!

371
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,000
Pretty accessories!

372
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,240
Sugarcoated hawthorns!

373
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,140
Why are you following me?

374
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:04,420
I heard that Crown Princess Consort enjoys walking around the streets and causing trouble.

375
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,330
I heard that the last time, she even ended up in the Wannian County Court.

376
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,200
Was there such a thing?

377
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,320
So, today I came to see what kind of chaos you could cause.

378
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,220
What do you mean by causing trouble and chaos?

379
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,420
I was clearly eliminating the corrupt and evil for the people, okay?

380
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:22,520
- You? Getting rid of the corrupt and evil?
- Right!

381
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,550
Let me tell you. A'Du and I recently have caught about t-three liars.

382
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,000
Hit two evil young lads.

383
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,100
Chased after four or five thieves.

384
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,610
I think that's all.

385
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,560
That's all?

386
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,860
Then, why don't you announce your status as Crown Princess Consort instead of being bullied by those people.

387
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,520
I'm doing that for your reputation.

388
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,940
Think about it.

389
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,520
If others knew that the crown princess consort of the Eastern Palace fought with people on the streets,

390
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,990
then your reputation as the crown prince would be nonexistent.

391
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,320
If you say it like that, then I should thank you for saving my reputation.

392
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,930
Let's go. Come with me to a place.

393
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,810
Where are we going?

394
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,880
Customer, take a look. 
[Weipin Pavilion]

395
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,910
Why aren't you walking anymore?

396
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,400
What is this place?

397
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,720
This the capital's famous Weipin Pavilion.

398
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,080
All outfits for government officials, honorary ladies, and princes are made here.

399
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,250
Not only do they have Li Empire items, they also have the prettiest clothes, accessories,

400
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:34,250
and rouge from the Xi State and Shuobo.

401
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,410
You know that much?

402
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,390
I'm the ninth princess of the Xi State. Of course, I would know!

403
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,880
Then, let's go look inside?

404
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,560
You want to buy clothes for your Lady Zhao?

405
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,010
Then, just ask the people inside to go directly to the palace so you don't have to go in.

406
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,420
Leave carefully, customers!

407

[Weipin Pavilion]

408
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,490
Welcome! Young Lords, my name is Xiaowei.

409
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,960
How may I help you?

410
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,210
We're just looking around.

411
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,780
All right.

412
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,120
Xiaowei, come here.

413
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,300
I want to make...

414
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:28,580
- Do you understand?
- We can definitely fulfill your request.

415
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,200
- But you should know—
- I know.

416
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,140
This will take some time and processing.

417
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,820
How about this?

418
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,890
I'll give you half a month. Make sure to use your shop's best craftsman to make it.

419
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,650
This is the down payment.

420
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,270
All right, Young Lord! I'll make sure our best craftsman makes the outfit.

421
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,430
Do you need any other clothes?

422
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,510
What else do I want?

423
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,270
I want this. Make a silk dress with flower embroideries with it.

424
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:02,730
All right, Young Lord! What are the measurements for the dress?

425
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,950
Measurements?
