00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,150
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:45,950
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,630
Teacher!

4
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,190
Hey!

5
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,340
Wake up!

6
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,820
Who are you?

7
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,340
Who sent you to kill me?

8
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,090
Kill you?

9
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,100
I saved you, okay?

10
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,570
I even treated your wound.

11
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,250
Saved me?

12
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,760
Who are you?

13
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,050
I also want to know who you are.

14
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,970
How did you get injured? Why are you here alone?

15
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,920
Wake up!

16
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,320
Hey!

17
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,660
Burn it!

18
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,540
Charge!

19
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,910
Pass on my order. Send a dispatch to the capital.

20
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,100
General, I already had it done.

21
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,200
I also sent people to search within 100 li for the fifth prince.

22
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,660
Good job, General Pei!

23
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,280
It's my duty.

24
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,770
By the way, General... Guard.

25
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,510
General.

26
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,800
We discovered a weapon used by the Danchi people at the scene.

27
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,210
Danchi?

28
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,640
Earlier Yimoyan led the Danchi troop to raid the border of Haizhou City.

29
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,620
I've sent people to start the investigation

30
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,770
to see if it's related to the Danchi people.

31
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,760
General Pei, you've been working hard.

32
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,180
Pass on my order.

33
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,920
From now on, the entire city is under martial law and all news is sealed off.

34
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,220
Any lawbreaker will be executed.

35
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,580
Yes.

36
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,050
Wait.

37
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,020
By all means, you have to find Fifth Prince.

38
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,020
Yes.

39
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,870
Looks like there's a change in weather (political change).

40
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,570
You have to find Chengyin.

41
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,780
I've sent people to look for him. They will report back at any time.

42
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,480
People from the Protectorate General Office are also searching for him.

43
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,850
Don't worry. Fifth Prince will be fine.

44
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,040
May god bless

45
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,870
Chengyin and keep him safe.

46
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,450
Your health...

47
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,400
Brother Mu, you know that

48
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,230
I can't sustain myself much longer.

49
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,890
I thought before I died,

50
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,060
I could see Xiaofeng and the crown prince getting married.

51
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,500
But I didn't expect that Chengji...

52
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,980
so young and...

53
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,050
Xiaofeng!

54
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,380
Xiaofeng!

55
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,590
This is a horse from the Central Plains.

56
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,520
Xiaofeng...

57
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,110
You are awake.

58
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,590
You can drink water,

59
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,100
but you must tell me who you are first.

60
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,620
Where are you from? Why are you injured?

61
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,940
What kind of attitude is that?

62
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,610
I'm your savior.

63
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,320
Forget it if you don't want to drink.

64
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
This feels good.

65
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,710
Extremely good.

66
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,510
Release me first and I will tell you.

67
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,260
Release you?

68
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,990
Do you think I'm stupid?

69
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,000
If I release you, you will escape.

70
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,930
You saved me.

71
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,350
It can't be because you want to bind me here, right?

72
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,840
Since it's not so, release me then.

73
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,190
I can release you.

74
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,040
But since I saved your life, you must repay me. Let's do this.

75
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,170
Promise me three things and I will release you.

76
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,500
Fine. What are they?

77
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,910
Let me think.

78
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,780
[Blacksmith]

79
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,760
Boss, make me an Azure Dragon machete.

80
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,660
Crown Prince of Li Empire didn't arrive as expected.

81
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,130
Perhaps something unforeseen has happened. Report to Khan Tömür immediately.

82
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,730
Boss.

83
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,890
- Bring us wine.
- Okay.

84
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,800
Do you still feel like drinking?

85
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,920
I don't want to drink anymore.

86
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,950
You are promoted to the second rank general. We need to drink and celebrate.

87
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,790
There's nothing to celebrate.

88
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,890
What is a second rank general? A second rank general is just a human shield.

89
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,710
You'll be at the front to charge the enemy lines. And you'll be the first to die.

90
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,010
There's nothing to fear in fighting the war with Danchi. It's not the first time we have fought them.

91
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,890
Didn't they come every three months?

92
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,830
- In the past, all those fights with Danchi were like acting.
- Acting?

93
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,600
But the real thing is coming soon.

94
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,150
The Danchi people got into big trouble.

95
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,200
The emperor definitely can't swallow such an insult.

96
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,480
In a few days, troops will be dispatched on a punitive expedition.

97
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,690
No fear, just fight.

98
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,820
Are you stupid? If that really happens,

99
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,650
- let me tell you, with that cavalry alone, we both won't be able to handle it.
- That awful?

100
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,620
Gentlemen, here's the wine.

101
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,850
Elder Brother, the Danchi people really have some nerve.

102
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,560
They even dared to kill the crown—

103
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,270
Shut up!

104
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,160
We don't want the wine. Take it away.

105
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,130
Don't... Such good wine,

106
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,980
at least drink one cup.

107
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,950
My elder brother says take it away, and that's it.

108
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,060
Okay, I'll take it away.

109
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,850
Bring tea to the gentlemen.

110
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,650
All right.

111
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,890
What were you thinking?

112
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,020
You just talked without thinking. Do you want to die?

113
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,600
No, no, no!

114
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,810
Sir, we couldn't find the fifth prince.

115
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,610
Any news from the Protectorate General Office?

116
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,130
General Pei is leading a group of people to go search for the fifth prince.

117
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,670
They are headed towards the northwest and into the desert.

118
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,490
Go and keep an eye on the Protectorate General Office.

119
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,430
I'll go catch up with Pei Zhao. We'll meet here for any news.

120
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,890
Yes.

121
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,500
Hey!

122
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,780
Have you figured it out yet?

123
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,380
Don't rush. I am still thinking.

124
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,990
You've already mulled for an entire night.

125
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:49,360
I have important matters to attend to. You should let me go first.

126
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,990
After you've made up your mind, you can just tell me.

127
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,760
The important matter you mentioned,

128
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,330
is it this?

129
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,690
Return it to me! Give it to me!

130
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,220
What is this exactly?

131
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,070
Give it to me!

132
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,920
(upside down)

133
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,670
I can return this to you,

134
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,130
but you have to tell me who you are exactly first?

135
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:42,660
I am a merchant from the Li Empire, going to your Xi State for business.

136
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,020
Unexpectedly, I was ambushed by robbers on the way.

137
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,340
They stole all my goods and I got separated from my caravan.

138
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,270
That one in your hand is my entry pass.

139
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,030
Without it, I will not be able to conduct my business.

140
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,910
You should've told me earlier.

141
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,030
If you had, I wouldn't have bound you.

142
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,320
Hey... Look.

143
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,940
But you were fortunate to have met me.

144
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,330
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

145
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,480
I will help you get revenge and find all your stolen goods.

146
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,230
For sure?

147
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,920
Even if I can't do it, my teacher can do it.

148
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,710
He is the most powerful person in this world.

149
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,740
I only need to blow my whistle and he will immediately appear in front of me.

150
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,860
You don't believe me? I will find him for you right now.

151
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,900
Where is my whistle?

152
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,660
My whistle is gone.

153
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,700
Rest in place.

154
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,270
Count the number of people.

155
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,490
Someone is coming.

156
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,900
Hey!

157
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,260
How is the yield?

158
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,340
We gained a lot.

159
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,030
Danchi people.

160
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,730
Elder brother!

161
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,650
A bunch of useless people. You've looked for many days already and still can't find her?!

162
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,960
Your Highness, please forgive my wrongdoing!

163
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,090
Your Highness,

164
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,750
Xiaofeng normally plays around too much. It's not the first or second time she ran away.

165
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,360
Too fond of playing? It was clearly you who is forcing her to be married for political reasons. That's why she ran away!

166
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,820
Queen, don't be too worried! Xiaofeng wouldn't run off too far away. We will definitely find her.

167
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,950
Easily said. She is not your daughter. You naturally don't worry.

168
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,980
Enough! Stop fighting!

169
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,300
Isn't Xiaofeng often with Gu Jian?

170
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,760
Where is Gu Jian?

171
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,700
I already asked people to look for him.

172
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,210
Sir Gu is also missing.

173
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,210
Really good. One forces my daughter to marry,

174
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,230
while another one secretly kidnapped my daughter!

175
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,870
You remember this. If anything happens to Xiaofeng, I will never forgive you!

176
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,960
Enough! Do you think it's not confusing enough here?

177
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,020
Send another 500 soldiers and find me the ninth princess!

178
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,740
Yes!

179
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,970
Cousin?

180
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:44,680
Help me! Save me, General Gao!

181
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,030
Help me! Save me, General Gao!

182
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,710
General Yi, you have a good harvest this time.

183
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,910
General Gao, what does that mean?

184
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,500
General Yi, I would like to ask you.

185
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,720
Did you do any trading beyond our deals?

186
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,560
We are in Haizhou City and didn't overstep the boundary.

187
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,300
General Gao, I want to remind you that

188
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,970
we had an agreement that Danchi can loot the border villages three times a year.

189
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,170
We will retreat once your Protectorate General Office shows up.

190
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,190
We indeed obtained some treasures and goods.

191
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,240
You also earned quite a lot of military salary and rewards.

192
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,190
Central Plains has this saying... How does it go again?

193
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,180
"Conduct oneself with dignity when raising bandits."

194
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,810
Did we not play the bandit properly?

195
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:55,460
Or have you changed your mind?

196
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,410
General Yi, you need only to tell me if you've done it or not.

197
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,980
Gao Xian, we Danchi people act in good faith.

198
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,300
Besides, why should we do things that aren't good for us?

199
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,970
Okay, I believe you.

200
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,370
Lately, the borders are not peaceful.

201
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,950
You better restrain your men more. Don't come near the border villages.

202
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,350
Our agreement is temporarily on hold.

203
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,890
Temporarily on hold? General Gao,

204
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:29,880
did something big happen to your Li Empire?

205
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,800
Yimoyan, some matters are better not known.

206
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,330
If something bad happens, don't blame me for not warning you.

207
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,580
Who? Who is hiding there?

208
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,530
- Capture them!
- Let's run! Last time you saved me. This time I will return it.

209
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,500
Don't need to run! Wait for me!

210
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,070
What are you doing? Come back!

211
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,150
Cousin, it's me.

212
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,890
Cousin, it's me.

213
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,660
- Xiaofeng?
- It's me.
- Why are you here?

214
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,360
Did you run away again?

215
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,370
Cousin, why are you here? And with so many men.

216
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,080
Were you sent by my mother to capture me?

217
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,610
Capture you? I don't have that kind of time.

218
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,030
We are here for serious matters. Are you alone?

219
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,550
Xiaofeng, the situation here has been messy nowadays.

220
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,040
It's not safe for you to be alone outside. I will send someone to take you back.

221
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,330
No need, my guards are in the back.

222
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,240
All right, I have something urgent to do. I won't accompany you anymore.

223
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,780
But you must guarantee to me that you will return to Xi State immediately.

224
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,990
I guarantee! Cousin, don't worry!

225
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,330
Stinky silly girl. I am going.

226
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,510
Bye, Cousin!

227
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,810
Bye! Go!

228
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,270
Hey!

229
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,260
They are gone!

230
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:49,030
See... you... in three days?

231
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,190
He left just like that?

232
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,790
How come it's three days again?

233
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020

234
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,240
Do you still remember me?

235

Sir Chai, how is it you?

237
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,440
Fifth Prince, you are hurt?

238
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,950
Superficial wounds, they're all right.

239
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,360
Sir Chai, after you taught me Five Beads Continuous Arrows, you disappeared. How did you get here?

240
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,290
I've always been in Xi State working for Consort Mingyuan.

241
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,910
Consort Mingyuan was very anxious after hearing about Fifth Prince's incident.

242
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,910
She is also very worried for your safety,

243
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,320
and asked me to look for you.

244
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,830
Please let Consort Mingyuan know

245
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,180
that I am well. Ask her not to worry.

246
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,010
Are you going to the Protectorate General Office?

247
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,280
Yes.

248
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,080
The Protectorate General Office has been looking for you, too.

249
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,040
It's just that a lot of confusing matters have been going on these past days.

250
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,280
It is not safe on the way. You should get changed.

251
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,140
I will escort you to the Protectorate General Office.

252
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,650

- Teacher!

I finally found you.

258
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:07,560
You said three days. How many days has it been already?

259
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,900
Sorry, it's my fault.

260
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,320
I will never believe you again.

261
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,300
I found your whistle in the sand dunes.

262
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,720
I thought something bad happened to you and was really worried. Good thing you are all right.

263
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,330
How have the past few days been?

264
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:33,320
What else? Wines are spilled, food is all gone, and the water is gone, too.

265
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,640
Hungry?

266
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,460
You've suffered.

Let's hurry and go then.

268
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,810
All right.

269
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,170
Ninth Princess, we finally found you. Please go back with us!

270
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,620
Teacher, I don't want to go back.

271
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,420
You should go back with us. The king and queen are very worried about you.

272
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,460
If you don't go back with us, the king will chop our heads off.

273
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,290
Noble Warrior Gu, today if you block us today, it's better off to just kill us.

274
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,730
Otherwise, we will also be killed when we go back to the king.

275
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,410

Today, they dared to assassinate the crown prince.

278
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,690
Tomorrow, they will come and assassinate me in the imperial court.

279
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,060

283
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,010
Why are you so angry?

284
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,380
Chengji...

285
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,820
was assassinated in Xi State.

What? How could that happen?

287
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,110
T-Then how is Chengji? Was he injured?

288
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:03,160

00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:26,870
Does Your Highness know who dares to do this?

291
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,860

Didn't I warn you not to leave anyone alive?

00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,190
Even if the fifth prince wishes to keep running, he won't have anywhere to go.

309
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,700
He will definitely go to the Protectorate General Office on the west border. Send someone to spy there.

00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,960
Your Majesty, this assassination,

357
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,580
definitely wasn't something that just casually came to their minds.

358
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,490
It should be at the time before the crown prince started the journey.

359
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,670
They had meticulously planned for it.

360
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,580
Evidently, the Danchi people wanted to rebel long ago.

361
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,510
Now, they must have gathered a great number of armed forces.

362
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,010
They are ready to declare war against Li Empire.

363
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,160
Emperor Father, I am willing to lead troops to drive the Danchi people back to Yanzhi Mountain.

364
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,450
And they will never come across the territory again.

365
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,930
This is also a revenge for my imperial brother.

366
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,530
Ah Zhao,

367
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,500
do you still remember?

368
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,400
When we were little,

369
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,160
imperial brother always liked to take us to play in the palace.

370
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,280
I remembered... back then, I was your study companion.

371
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,820
You were young and naughty, frequently skipping lessons and ran away from the Minister Academy.

372
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,940
It was the elder prince who always covered for us.

373
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,510
I remember he frequently helped us climb over the wall

374
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,830
to steal bird eggs,

375
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,900
to catch lizards. Looking back at those carefree days,

376
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,200
we were quite happy.

377
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,640
It was until the elder prince became the crown prince.

378
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,300
The time he spent with us became less and less.

379
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,380
I saw him...

380
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,420
become more and more quiet.

381
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,340
He smiled less and less.

382
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,700
After that, you and I had grown up.

383
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,590
We were far apart from each other.

384
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,730
The love between brothers

385
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,180
will never be cut apart.

386
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,270
Fraternal love

387
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,210
can't be cut apart.

388
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,200
Imperial Brother,

389
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,700
I swear...

390
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,370
I will take revenge for you.

391
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,550
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

392
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:29,860

403
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,340
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

404
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,940
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

405
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,010

00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,890
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

407
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,450

409
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,800
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

410
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,940
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

411
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,410

♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

417

♫  Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
