♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,670
[Episode 36]

17
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,620
Your Imperial Majesty.

18
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:31,890
How long has Prime Minister Gao's daughter been in the palace?

19
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,960
Cousin Ruyi has been in the palace for one month now.

20
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,660
Then, should I go see her soon?

21
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,490
Your Imperial Majesty, my cousin is still young.

22
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,290
She has had a cold body since she was young.

23
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,720
I want to nurse her back to health first.

24
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,090
Once she's healthy, she can serve you.

25
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,690
Your Imperial Majesty!

26
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,770
[Clean and Peaceful Palace]

27
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,330
Empress.

28
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,060
Is the emperor still taking care of governmental issues in the imperial library?

29
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,050
The emperor went to Splendor and Happiness Palace Hall tonight.

30
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,560
What?

31
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,550
The emperor went to the Beautiful Lady Gao's place.

32
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,790
Calm down, Empress.

33
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,220
The emperor is purposely doing this for me to see.

34
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,510
Empress, if Gao Ruyi receives the emperor's favor,

35
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,530
then what should we do about Prime Minister Gao later?

36
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,800
That Gao Ruyi is just a measly bitch, yet she dared to climb above me?

37
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,880
She's looking down upon me!

38
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,800
[Eastern Palace]

39
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,670
Bestowing ten agate plates,

40
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,540
ten large golden flower silver plates,

41
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,140
two jade waistbands, ten pieces of golden plated boxes,

42
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:57,060
and ten boxes of golden and silver pearls,

43
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,830
to celebrate Crown Prince's birthday!

44
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,630
Thank you, Imperial Father, for your graces.

45
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,550
Imperial Mother, even though today is not the actual date of my birthday,

46
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,320
I still troubled you and Imperial Father to put so much effort into sending me gifts.

47
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,770
I feel really bad.

48
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,600
I am taking the chance to come here because it's almost your birthday.

49
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm not tired.

50
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,280
Oh right. Where are the officials that came to greet you, too?

51
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,210
My eunuch-in-charge of imperial accouterments outside the palace is taking care of them. I'll go there later.

52
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,130
I want to know

53
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,830
what gifts Crown Princess Consort and Related Lady of Excellence Zhao

54
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,040
prepared to give you this year.

55
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,810
I personally embroidered the scenery of a hundred flowers to celebrate the birthday of Crown Prince.

56
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,850
May you have a day like this every year. May you be glorious and auspicious on your every birthday.

57
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,140
You are very thoughtful. I really like the embroidery that you made.

58
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,620
I congratulate the crown prince on his birthday.

59
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,710
You are gifting me that for my birthday?

60
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,740
Is this not a good present?

61
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,220
If I gave you a golden flask or gourd, then you'd have to melt it before trading it for money.

62
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,460
This is so convenient.

63
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,280
I think that Crown Princess Consort's gift is very unique.

64
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,460
Leave.

65
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,940
What are you going to reward this year?

66
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,520
Imperial Mother, I really don't know

67
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,240
what kind of gift I should give in return for her hundred gold ingots.

68
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,300
Should I just go to the stockroom and get a bundle of one hundred copper coins for her?

69
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
Bring it up.

70
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,390
That then. That would be the reward for Crown Princess Consort.

71
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,990
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

72
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,250
[Weipin Pavilion]

73
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,270
Crown Princess Consort, this was a custom made palace quality item from Weipin Pavilion.

74
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,370
Horseback riding clothes?

75
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,060
- What are you doing?!
- Your measurements are about the same as Sese's.

76
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,650
I'm using your measurementa to make her an outfit.

77
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,290
Did he specifically buy this for me?

78
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,560
Sese, all those are for you.

79
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,420
Thank you, Your Imperial Highness.

80
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,930
Crown Prince, I prepared a special gift for you, too.

81
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,740
Come in!

82
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,820
I really didn't think that my first imperial grandchild

83
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,890
would be born from the womb of a lady-in-waiting named Xuniang.

84
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,250
What? Crown Prince did you not tell the Crown Princess Consort?

85
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,690
I brought Xuniang over today so that we can have a discussion

86
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,010
about when you will let Xuniang enter the Eastern Palace.

87
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,170
Imperial Mother, I still have to discuss this matter with Crown Princess Consort.

88
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,740
Then, you should pick a lucky day quickly.

89
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,860
Even though Xuniang is of low status,

90
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,780
she still has to be promoted.

91
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,400
Conferring her as a Filial Lady of Excellence (Liangyuan) is too high for her.
(T/N: Liangyuan is a consort rank below Liangdi)

92
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,250
Promote her to Lady of Precious Bevy (Baolin) then. It suits her status.
 (T/N: Baolin is third to the last in terms of royal consort status)

93
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,290
Crown Princess Consort, what do you think?

94
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,450
What?

95
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,070
Imperial Mother, what's the rush?

96
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,050
We can wait until the child comes out. If it's a prince, then we can discuss her ranking.

97
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,830
What do you mean?

98
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,510
Imperial Mother, Crown Princess Consort and Related Lady of Excellence Zhao were not notified of this matter.

99
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,390
Even if Xuniang is to enter the Eastern Palace,

100
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,590
you should have let me know first so that I can notify them.

101
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:22,560
Are you blaming me for acting on my own accord?

102
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,690
No, I do not dare. However, today is my birthday.

103
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,870
This huge gift from you came too sudden; hence, I dare not accept it.

104
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,640
What are you crying about?! This is a happy event!

105
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,390
Why are you coming to grief?!

106
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,500
Empress, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao and I, we...

107
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,430
It's not that we aren't happy for His Imperial Highness,

108
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,680
it's just that we weren't mentally prepared.

109
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,170
Crown Princess Consort lives up to her name. You are quite magnanimous.

110
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,760
But on the other hand, this Concubine Zhao needs to be taught some manners!

111
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
The crown prince is the heir to the throne.

112
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,910
Propagating the imperial bloodline is his duty!

113
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,330
In the future, once he ascends the throne, there will be thousands of women in his harem.

114
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,750
As a woman of the imperial harem, you have to know what is generosity and propriety!

115
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,020
This is the way for a long-lasting relationship between husband and wife.

116
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,110
Related Lady of Excellence, stop crying.

117
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,280
Imperial Mother, why don't we just allow Related Lady of Excellence to go back and rest.

118
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,190
You may leave!

119
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,060
Empress, please forgive me for leaving first.

120
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,520
Empress, I will also be leaving first.

121
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,800
Stay here.

122
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,070
It's hard for Imperial Mother to come here all the time. It's not right for everyone to leave.

123
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,860
Imperial Mother, Xuniang's pregnancy is a good thing.

124
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,780
However, immediately promoting her and the child...

125
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,120
will cause quite a commotion within the Eastern Palace.

126
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,990
Because of that, I won't be able to take care of any official affairs.

127
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,300
I fear His Imperial Majesty will be unhappy about that.

128
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,110
Forget it then. Xuniang's pregnancy term has just begun.

129
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,060
If she lives in the Eastern Palace,

130
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,300
I am afraid your Concubine Zhao will not allow her to have a peaceful day.

131
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,680
She can stay in my Clean and Peaceful Palace for now.

132
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,130
I'll take care of her for you.

133
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,220
Thank you for being understanding, Imperial Mother.

134
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,810
Thank you for being understanding, Empress.

135
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,520
Related Lady of Excellence, don't be angry! Be careful for you might hurt yourself!

136
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,020
Related Lady of Excellence!

137
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,090
Related Lady of Excellence!

138
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,820
Wait for His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince to come and then ask him about it.

139
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,250
He said that he would only love me,

140
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,440
but now he has another woman behind my back.

141
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,770
They even have a child.

142
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,720
How does that make me look?

143
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,170
What happened?

144
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,680
The Crown Prince is here!

145
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,490
Greetings to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

146
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,250
- Where is Related Lady of Excellence?
- She locked herself inside the palace.

147
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,100
She won't let anyone inside, aside from Jin'er.

148
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,840
If His Imperial Highness sees you in this state, then--

149
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,830
- Sese! Sese!
 - It's His Highness.

150
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,410
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

151
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,580
Who spouted the nonsense

152
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,080
that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao isn't thinking straight and is planning to kill herself?

153
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,400
Your Imperial Highness, Related Lady of Excellence was heartbroken and cried.

154
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,460
It is possible that while gossiping, the servants started to distort the story.

155
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,930
- Get out!
- Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,120
Sese.

157
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,390
Sese.

158
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,290
Since you already know,

159
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,830
I won't keep it from you.

160
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,940
That day, I got drunk in Imperial Mother's palace.

161
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,940
Sese.

162
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,970
Sese, don't cry.

163
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,590
It was planned by Imperial Mother. What else could I do?

164
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,510
Are you really angry at me over this?

165
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,000
I do not dare to be angry at you, Your Imperial Highness.

166
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,510
I am just sad about my bitter life.

167
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,700
I cannot make the empress like me.

168
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,090
My status is not as revered as compared to the crown princess consort.

169
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,890
And now, a lady-in-waiting like Xuniang is pregnant with an imperial grandchild and will rise above me.

170
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,420
I...

171
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,880
I am not even as good as a maidservant anymore.

172
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,260
What kind of status and ranking they are,

173
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,240
even I, as the crown prince, cannot decide for it.

174
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,420
You know this.

175
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,810
Sese, what is the use of you throwing a tantrum now?

176
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,640
I never thought that you would forget your promise to me this fast.

177
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,250
My heart only has you, Your Highness.

178
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,150
But what about you?

179
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,920
Even though I am of lower status,

180
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,070
my love for you does not deserve to be trampled like this!

181
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,950
Since you cannot find reason in anything I say,

182
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,520
I will not further explain myself.

183
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,560
I will visit you on another day.

184
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,970
Related Lady of Excellence, what are you doing?

185
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,490
Even if you throw things, you should have not thrown that jade pendant!

186
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,740
That was a love token from His Imperial Highness.

187
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,950
Bastard! He is too much of a bastard!

188
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,510
How can he be like this?

189
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,190
I am talking about Li Chengyin!

190
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,520
I only knew that his love for Related Lady of Excellence was as deep as the sea,

191
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,080
but who knew that he would turn around and have a child with another woman?

192
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,110
Say, is he or is he not a bastard?!

193
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,700
- I'm so mad!
- Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort!

194
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,580
The empress sent a message asking you to go to her Clean and Peaceful Palace.

195
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,140
The empress?

196
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,100
Why is she looking for me?

197
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,580
The crown princess consort is the leader of all the consorts within the Eastern Palace.

198
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,340
You should be disciplining the other consorts on behalf of the crown prince.

199
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,780
How can you let a mere Related Lady of Excellence get jealous, throw tantrums, and act out of line?

200
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,100
This is totally preposterous!

201
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,120
Why are you not paying attention to the affairs within the Eastern Palace?

202
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,120
Even though Xuniang has the crown prince's child,

203
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,890
she is still of low status.

204
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:41,220
When the child is brought into this world, you will be his mother.

205
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,310
What? You want to give Xuniang's child to me?

206
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,090
That means he has to leave his mother at birth; that's so cruel.

207
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,650
Crown Princess Consort, the way you talk has to mirror your status.

208
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,100
This is a rule within the palace. How could you describe it as being cruel?

209
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,140
But...

210
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,110
Yongniang, you were from the palace of Grand Empress Dowager.

211
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,110
Since she has sent you to take care of Crown Princess Consort,

212
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,540
I am sure that you are quick-witted and sensible.

213
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,070
Who would've thought that after being with Crown Princess Consort for a year,

214
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,770
she still does not know the rules and traditions of the palace.

215
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,860
It's just right for Empress to lecture me. I admit my mistake.

216
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,170
You have to assist Crown Princess Consort.

217
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,180
If anything else happens, I will punish you then.

218
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,660
Xuniang can stay at my place for now.

219
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,710
As for Related Lady of Excellence Zhao, you have to appease her.

220
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,170
Don't let her trouble the crown prince.

221
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,850
I understand, Imperial Mother.

222
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,520
Who is Xuniang?

223
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,490
She's a lady-in-waiting from the empress' palace.

224
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,980
I heard that she is from an ordinary family and has no one of higher status behind her.

225
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,650
Why did the empress choose her to give to the crown prince?

226
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,840
The crown prince doesn't even spare a look at the crown princess consort.

227
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,790
Why would he lay an eye on an average looking maidservant?

228
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,180
It's very suspicious.

229
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,470
If this is what the empress wants, then we will have to further investigate.

230
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,350
What is going on? Hurry and tell us.

231
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,570
The two of them already knew each other from before.

232
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,680
- They already knew each other? 
- You did not know?

233
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,450
I did not know.

234
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,260
Also, there were even gifts given.

235
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,720
- Gifted what?
 - What item?

236
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,020
Now that, I cannot say.

237
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,430
Just tell us, come one. Tell us.

238
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,970
- Just say it. Say it! 
- I cannot!

239
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,540
- Just tell us.
- That's right.

240
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,890
What is the gift?

241
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,510
- Hurry and say it.
- I cannot tell.

242
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,710
What story climax are you selling? Hurry and tell us.

243
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,060
Hurry, hurry! Tell us.

244
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,870
I just cannot tell.

245
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,590
- Eunuch Shi'en.
- Eunuch Shi'en.

246
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:56,200
- What are you all talking about?
- Eunuch Shi'en, we heard that Crown Princess Consort—

247
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,680
Crown Princess Consort?

248
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,730
What is going on with Crown Princess Consort?

249
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,810
We are telling you this because we treat you as one of us.

250
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,900
We just want to ask you something, but you must not report us for this.

251
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,800
What do you all wish to ask?

252
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,030
Did Crown Princess Consort and General Pei already know each other in Xi State?

253
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,200
Yes, Eunuch, did they already know each other then?

254
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,310
Yes, they did. General Pei personally escorted Crown Princess Consort here for the marriage alliance.

255
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,590
No wonder.

256
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,220
- No wonder what?
- No wonder their relationship is so good.

257
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,840
Everyone in the Eastern Palace is saying

258
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,080
that the crown princess consort personally made a protection bracelet for General Pei.

259
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,750
Also, they will frequently meet and chat with each other at night.

260
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,290
Nonsense!

261
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,620
What are you all speaking nonsense about?

262
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,770
If you all dare to say those words again, be careful that your heads will be chopped off.

263
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,800
Your Imperial Highness.

264
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,280
I deserve to die.

265
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,240
Shi'en, why are you so absent-minded today?

266
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,240
Your Highness, people in the palace have been gossiping recently.

267
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,550
Why are you worried about others gossiping?

268
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,960
Your Highness, do you not know what they have said?

269
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
What do their words have to do with me?

270
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,740
Why do I have to know?

271
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,130
Because it does have to do with you.

272
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,160
They say that the crown princess consort is not good.

273
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,690
In what ways is she not good?

274
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,110
They...

275
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:11,980
They are saying that the crown princess consort and General Pei are very close.

276
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,890
Your Highness, please calm down!

277
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,630
Who did you hear this from?

278
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,330
No one! No one! It was I who was arbitrarily gossiping.

279
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,490
I was speaking nonsense.

280
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,860
I know now. You may leave.

281
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,490
Yes.

282
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,200
Your Highness, you will not be arguing with the crown princess consort, will you?

283
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,120
I'll take my leave.

284
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,090
Li Chengyin?

285
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
What are you doing here so late?

286
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,930
You are not here to argue with me again, are you?

287
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,400
I am not here to argue with you.

288
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,830
I am here to sleep with you.

289
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,890
This is none of your business. Go out.

290
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,480
What is improper about the crown prince sleeping in the crown princess consort's bedchamber?

291
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,370
You all hurry up.This is the first time that His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince is staying overnight at our Bearing Graces Hall.

292
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,490
- You must all serve him well.
 - Yes!

293
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,090
- Greetings, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!
- Greetings, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!

294
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,080
I did not know that Your Imperial Highness would be coming here tonight.

295
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,650
We didn't prepare anything. Please pardon our offense.

296
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,320
Then, hurry up and prepare.

297
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Yes.

298
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,420
You, infuse the tea. The water must be warm and the tea should not be too strong.
- Yes.

299
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,360
- And you, prepare the bedroom clothes.
- Yes.

300
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,870
And you all, assist Crown Princess Consort in bathing and changing her clothes.

301
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,740
Yes!

302
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,380
Go. Let's go!

303
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,120
- Crown Princess Consort, this way, please.
- Crown Princess Consort, this way, please.

304
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,990
Crown Prince, this way, please.

305
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,680
Crown Princess Consort, please take your bath.

306
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,520
Crown Princess Consort, this way, please.

307
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,310
What is your opinion on Xuniang's child?

308
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,110
The empress has already told me.

309
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,080
Told you what?

310
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,010
That, in the future, I will raise the child.

311
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,190
That I will be his mother.

312
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,830
And you agreed to do so?

313
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,320
How can you be this selfish?

314
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,000
Stealing someone's child, raising him as your own,

315
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,940
and have him call you "Mother" to protect your position in the future.

316
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,980
Is this what you want?

317
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,730
I know why you are so angry.

318
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,010
I heard from others that you are not the empress's biological son.

319
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,730
Your biological mother separated from you when you were really young.

320
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,650
Don't worry.

321
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,320
I will not let Xuniang's child be apart from her.

322
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,800
But you...

323
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,850
It was you who acted in confusion under the influence of alcohol, causing Xuniang to become pregnant.

324
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,870
Then you felt that her status was too low and are not accepting her into the Eastern Palace.

325
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,500
You committed the first wrong in this situation.

326
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,300
It is not what you think.

327
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,740
Then, let me ask you.

328
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,160
Did you have a child with Xuniang because you genuinely liked her?

329
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,450
Apart from this, do you not have any other words to say to me?

330
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,550
What words?

331
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,790
I am your husband.

332
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,390
Are you not angry that I now have a child with another woman?

333
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,270
Isn't it normal for men of the Central Plains to have three or four concubines?

334
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,380
Additionally, I have long heard the imperial harem consists of three thousand beauties.

335
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,930
And in Xi State, my father also has many wives. I have a lot of siblings as well.

336
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,890
Who you want to marry, who you want to have kids with, is not something I can control.

337
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,590
I do not like Xuniang.

338
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,940
I know! The one you like is Zhao Sese.

339
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,110
So, tonight, you should not have come here.

340
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,190
You should have gone to her, stayed with her, and coaxed her.

341
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,640
This is the Eastern Palace. I am the crown prince.

342
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,960
I will sleep wherever I wish to sleep. Tonight, I will sleep here!

343
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,870
Then you sleep. I am going to sleep with A'Du.

344
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,250
You are my crown princess consort. Tonight, you will sleep here with me.

345
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,490
On what grounds should I listen to you?

346
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,540
A'Du! A—

347
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,030
If A'Du comes in right now,

348
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,180
and Imperial Mother punishes her

349
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,120
or Grand Empress Dowager punishes her,

350
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,850
then I would really be unable to protect her.

351
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,150
Li Chengyin, you are despicable, shameless, and indecent!

352
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
If you still do not sleep,

353
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,050
then I really will become despicable.

354
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,650
You dare?

355
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,120
Move over a bit.

356
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,560
Your attitude is so good while sleeping?

357
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,210
What are you doing?

358
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,000
Why do you alone have to use two blankets?

359
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,400
You should be grateful that I came here.

360
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,660
You still want to fight over a blanket?

361
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,290
Who asked you to come here?

362
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,670
This is my bed, my blanket. Give it to me.

363
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,590
If Sese did not persuade me to come, I would not have come at all.

364
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,520
Zhao Sese let you come here?

365
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,700
If it was not for Sese,

366
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,690
would I come here to be maltreated by you?

367
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,490
You leave.

368
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,500
Do not worry. I will leave in the morning.

369
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,990
Why are you still not sleeping?

370
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,780
What were you looking at?

371
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,920
Nothing.

372
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,980
There was no blanket for me to use on the bed. I came outside to get some air.

373
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,140
I will return the blanket to you.

374
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,070
Quickly come back to sleep.

375
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,620
Do not worry.

376
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,130
I have sent them to a different place to patrol.

377
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,350
Tonight, there is just me and you.

378
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,020
Let us drink to our heart's content.

379
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,800
Thank you for your daily care.

380
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,290
How have I been taking care of you?

381
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,460
If it was not for you, the great commander of the Yulin Army, always assigning your troops properly,

382
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,940
I am afraid I would have to put on a show every day of playing "catch the burglar" with the government troops.

383
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,280
Good that you know it.

384
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,860
If I were you, I would let go of past events.

385
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,790
Why must you feel sad by yourself?

386
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:48,630
If you were able to let go,

387
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,620
would you be this guilty and caring towards Xiaofeng?

388
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,110
For me and you,

389
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,940
Xiaofeng is not just the crown princess consort.

390
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,360
As long as she is safe and sound, the rest is unimportant.

391
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,530
You are right.

392
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,880
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

393
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,780
[Bearing Graces Hall]

394
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,670
- A' Zhao.
- Your Imperial Highness.

395
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,740
Were you on duty last night?

396
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,300
No, last night I was not on duty.

397
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,730
Last night, someone was peeking around outside of her bedchamber.

398
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,110
From the sound of the footsteps, she's not skilled in martial arts. Likely a lady-in-waiting.

399
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,480
Make sure to properly investigate the servants of Bearing Graces Hall.

400
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,150
Yes.

401
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,580
Your complexion does not look good. Did you not sleep well last night?

402
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,870
No. It is probably because the wind was strong last night.

403
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:18,590
Really? Why did I not hear it?

404
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,090
Last night was the best sleep I have had in the past year that I returned to Shangjing.

405
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,970
Empress, last night, something strange happened in the Eastern Palace again.

406
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,110
If you want to say something just say it. Stop your fake manners.

407
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,210
His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince stayed in the Bearing Graces Hall for the first time.

408
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:23,810
He really stayed there all night?

409
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,210
Even though the crown prince and the crown princess consort still had an altercation,

410
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,590
His Imperial Highness only left Bearing Graces Hall at sunrise today.

411
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,950
Why has the crown prince changed his attitude?

412
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,780
Look at you! While you keep talking, I have made a liang move without your knowledge.

413
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,930
Empress, you're... cheating.

414
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,600
Tell Ying'er to keep a close eye on Bearing Graces Hall.

415
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,360
If there are any situations, she should report it.

416
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,340
Yes, Empress.

417
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,260
Whatever pawn it is, in playing backgammon,

418
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,210
what matters is the hand with which you roll the dice,

419
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,030
not the pawns themselves!

420
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,380
Related Lady of Excellence! Related Lady of Excellence!

421
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,090
- Related Lady of Excellence!
- What happened?

422
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,370
Why are you acting impudently?

423
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,740
Related Lady of Excellence,

424
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,270
last night, His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince stayed at Crown Princess Consort's Bearing Graces Hall.

425
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,520
Rela-Related Lady of Excellence,

426
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,660
perhaps, His Imperial Highness is just acting rashly because he feels wronged,

427
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,050
so he purposefully acted that way for you to see.

428
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,890
He is not.

429
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,620
He really is angry.

430
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,900
I broke the jade pendant he sent me.

431
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:58,390
He really is upset with me and is not willing to visit me.

432
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,840
Related Lady of Excellence, since the crown prince is not willing to come here,

433
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,390
how about we visit the crown princess consort?

434
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,770
This way, we can let the crown prince know that you are also a tolerant person.

435
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,440
Crown Princess Consort, be dignified and composed.

436
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,020
Older Sister!

437
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,740
- Sister, are you all right?
- Are you all right?

438
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,360
- Careful. Careful.
- Slowly.

439
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,270
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

440
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:47,720
- Come in and sit.
- All right.

441
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,390
I've always wanted to come and see you,

442
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,170
but I was scared to disrupt your peace, so I never got a chance to.

443
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:04,600
Today, the weather is nice and I heard you had no duties, so I made the decision to come over today.

444
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,990
I handpicked these gifts carefully.

445
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:21,850
Although they are petty, they speak from my heart.

446
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,680
You're a year older than me. Why do you call me "Older Sister?"

447
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,470
Even though you are younger, you are of higher status.

448
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,110
It's just appropriate that I address you this way.

449
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:35,650
No need! I feel awkward when I hear it. You can just call me, "Xiaofeng."

450
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:37,090
This...

451
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,820
Crown Princess Consort, by calling you "sister,"

452
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,280
it actually makes you and Related Lady of Excellence feel closer and harmonious.

453
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,210
I have long heard that there is a capable servant by your side.

454
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,050
Now that I see her, she indeed lives up to her name as your right-hand person.

455
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,130
In the Eastern Palace, Related Lady of Excellence is the right-hand person of Crown Princess Consort.

456
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,300
I hope Related Lady of Excellence won't feel estranged.

457
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,620
I understand the caring heart of Sister.

458
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,040
Crown Princess Consort doesn't know a lot of people in Shangjing.

459
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,380
In the Eastern Palace, she entered at the same time with Related Lady of Excellence;

460
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,320
hence, your relationship indeed is different from others.

461
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,670
I hope that Related Lady of Excellence will visit Bearing Graces Hall more often.

462
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:16,450
It is quite boring this afternoon. Why don't we go play something to have fun?

463
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:20,920
Great. Let's play leaf card!

464
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,560
Sure.
