[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,320
[Episode 13]

3
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,320
Gu Xiaowu, it was indeed you.

4
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,400
The Li Empire and Shuobo's three hundred thousand troops have surrounded you.

5
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,950
If you surrender, I'll make sure you all live.

6
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,810
I, Khan Tömür, am filled with pride. I would die before I surrender!

7
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,480
Do you really want your one hundred thousand Danchi citizens

8
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,550
to become sacrifices because of your pride?

9
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,830
Gu Xiaowu,

10
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:59,180
I want to exchange my life for my citizens' lives.

11
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,990
Is that all right?

12
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,070
I promise.

13
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,670
Gu Xiaowu, I will believe you one more time.

14
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,470
My Khan!

15
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,760
Go!

16
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,640
Grandfather!

17
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,530
Xiaofeng.

18
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,890
Xiaowu!

19
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,310
You're still alive!

20
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,950
I thought I wouldn't see you again!

21
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,570
Xiaowu,

22
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,760
you're still alive. You're still alive!

23
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,270
Grandfather!

24
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,090
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

25
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,350
Get out!

26
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,060
-Yes!
-Yes!

27
00:10:50,920 --> 00:11:00,100
♫ A fox ♫

28
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:10,200
♫ sitting on top of the sand dune ♫

29
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,280
♫ Sitting on top of the sand dune ♫

30
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,940
Xiaofeng!

31
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,230
Xiaofeng!

32
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,660
I...

33
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,620
Don't come over here! Don't come over here! Don't come over here!

34
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,620
Xiaofeng!

35
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,090
Gu Xiaowu...

36
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,070
It was you.

37
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,000
It was you.

38
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,830
The Li Empire and Danchi have piled up hatred between them.

39
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:12,690
They even kidnapped the Li Empire's citizens and killed our crown prince.

40
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,590
This war was unavoidable.

41
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,490
You lied to me.

42
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,490
I...

43
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,010
You killed my grandfather!

44
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,060
You ruined Danchi!

45
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,100
You ruined me.

46
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,870
Xiaofeng...

47
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,670
Xiaofeng... I... I did lie to you,

48
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,740
but my feelings for you are real. They're real.

49
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,040
- I'm not listening.
- They're real.

50
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,870
- They're real!
- I'm not listening! I'm not listening!

51
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,960
- Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!
- I'm not listening!

52
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,890
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

53
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,110
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

54
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,550
Xiaofeng!

55
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,690
Why?

56
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,240
I didn't want to...

57
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,800
- didn't want to hurt you!
- Why!

58
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,820
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

59
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,350
I didn't hurt you on purpose.

60
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,380
I want to kill you.

61
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,710
Xiaofeng.

62
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,920
Xiaofeng!

63
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,830
I'm going to kill you!

64
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,390
I'll kill you!

65
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,850
- Xiaofeng!
- I'm going to kill you!

66
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,540
- Xiaofeng!
- I'll kill you!

67
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,090
I'll kill you!

68
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,930
Xiaofeng!

69
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,010
I'm going to kill you...

70
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,660
I'm going to kill you...

71
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,520
- I'm going to kill you, Gu Xiaowu.
- Xiaofeng!

72
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,420
I've wronged you.

73
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,290
That was close.

74
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,810
If you were really stabbed deeply,

75
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,240
there would've been a grimmer outcome.

76
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,430
Sir Chai,

77
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,090
I really don't know how to face her anymore.

78
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,840
It's my fault. I let her see that scene.

79
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,150
Please punish me.

80
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,420
It has nothing to do with you.

81
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,790
It's all my fault.

82
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,030
I won't let anyone else know

83
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,480
about what happened here in Danchi.

84
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,780
But, Your Highness, you need to remember to not let your emotions run you.

85
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,090
At this stage, there's no way to turn back.

86
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,130
Fortunately, everyone who saw this

87
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,980
were Pei Zhao's men.

88
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:31,010
The ninth princess' maidservant was also captured and placed in the tent behind.

89
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,090
I will leave now.

90
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,230
Rest up, Your Highness.

91
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,760
Sir, we have put a sedative in Ninth Princess' tea drink as you ordered.

92
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,210
I've cleared all sharp objects from the room.

93
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,540
Good. Take care of Ninth Princess.

94
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,180
Ensure her safety and don't make any mistakes.

95
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,770
Yes!

96
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,890
Grandfather!

97
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,610
Xiaofeng.

98
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,770
Teacher...

99
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,910
I'll take you away from here.

100
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,490
A'Du, too. There's still A'Du.

101
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,230
I've already let A'Du out of the military base.

102
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,510
We agreed to meet in the mountains.

103
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,120
Hold on.

104
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,490
Stop him!

105
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,550
Stop him! Stop him!

106
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,040
Move aside.

107
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,340
Where are you taking her?

108
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,090
Away.

109
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,270
Things aren't over between her and me.

110
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,010
Nobody can take her away.

111
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,170
It's over.

112
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,440
You already got what you wanted.

113
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,360
And she doesn't want to stay here anymore.

114
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,370
You can't leave with her today.

115
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,860
You can try.

116
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,780
Gu Jian!

117
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,470
Put your sword down.

118
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,580
You won't even listen to me now?

119
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,720
Nobody can stop me, not even Godfather.

120
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,270
Get a reliable team to follow them.

121
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,660
Do not capture them. Protect them.

122
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

123
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,320
Gu Jian, why didn't they stop you at the camp?

124
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,680
They found us, but they don't try to capture us.

125
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,490
Because Ninth Princess is very important. Even though he let her leave,

126
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,140
he won't let her get away from his sight.

127
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,210
I never knew that Ninth Princess was so important.

128
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,080
The Western Border is large and full of small kingdoms.

129
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,030
The Li Empire controls them

130
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,760
by letting them balance each other out.

131
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,970
What does that have to do with Ninth Princess?

132
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,220
Xi State is the necessary gateway to the Central Plains.

133
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,290
Whoever marries the direct lineage princess will also get the controlling right.

134
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,240
Xiaofeng.

135
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,900
Come with me.

136
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,290
Gu Jian.

137
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,890
Tell me.

138
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,750
In all that has happened, were you also cheated by Gu Xiaowu

139
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,400
or did you know it all along?

140
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,920
Gu Xiaowu's last name isn't Gu. His name is Li Chengyin.

141
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,230
He is the fifth son of the emperor of Central Plains.

142
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,450
Why did he say his last name was Gu?

143
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,490
His mother's last name was Gu.

144
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,640
She was my biological aunt.

145
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:15,110
Therefore, attacking Danchi

146
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,690
was something you already knew about.

147
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:41,870
Therefore, you came to save me just to get a reward from the emperor. Am I right?

148
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,060
You know I wouldn't do that.

149
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,820
What else won't you do?

150
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:02,860
It was a scam from the first moment you appeared next to me.

151
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,320
All these years, you have lied and lied again to me.

152
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,350
How long were you going to keep on lying to me?

153
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,280
It's unbelievable that my father trusted you.

154
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,320
I even called you my teacher.

155
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,740
A'Du, let's go!

156
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,400
Xiaofeng!

157
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,900
From the first day since I met you,

158
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,570
I never lied to you until Li Chengyin appeared.

159
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,430
I have my own unspeakable reason and mission.

160
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,070
But I never wanted to hurt you.

161
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,010
In this world, there is no one who is

162
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,800
more willing to protect and guard you.

163
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,560
I beg you

164
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,190
not to leave me here.

165
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,500
Please let me stay on your side and accompany you.

166
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,950
Xiaofeng,

167
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,430
I am sorry.

168
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,310
The blood of a hundred thousand Danchi people is in between us.

169
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:34,530
You feel sorry to me. I feel even more sorry to them.

170
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,010
In the past,

171
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,900
whatever affections we had,

172
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,130
let's end them today.

173
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,360
Xiaofeng!

174
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,430
Why are you two here?

175
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,400
Look, I haven't finish cleaning up here. Sorry for the mess.

176
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,220
Come. Take it away.

177
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:58,090
Give Fifth Prince a drink.

178
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Fill it up.

179
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,850
Fifth Prince, shouldn't you give me a toast?

180
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,260
Prince Lidun, I heard newly opened grape wine

181
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,260
is best to wait a bit before drinking.

182
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,900
We in the Western Border

183
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,750
are impatient people.

184
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,230
I give you an army. You help me to the throne.

185
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,220
I gave you the army and won the war.

186
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,300
But to wait for you to help me to the throne

187
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,190
when you become the crown prince is too long.

188
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,850
I don't want to wait. So I took it upon myself.

189
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,970
Fifth Prince, it seems

190
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,090
you haven't satisfied your promise.

191
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,290
It's okay. I don't mind.

192
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,800
When you get back to Central Plains, tell your imperial father...

193
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,220
King of Shuobo

194
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,050
died in the battle against Danchi.

195
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,230
He died well. That's great.

196
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,720
A toast.

197
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,140
Cheers.

198
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,410
Your contribution was indeed invaluable in winning this battle so quickly.

199
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:51,100
But Fifth Brother, you should have stayed at the Western Border Protectorate General Office at that time.

200
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,550
Why did you end up fighting with Khan Tömür outside his tent?

201
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,370
Second Brother, that's what I want to tell you.

202
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:01,520
I was around Sky Span Mountain fighting my way.

203
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,830
I didn't know you started the battle early.

204
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,260
When I saw the Central Plains army attacking,

205
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,670
I immediately met up with General Pei and joined the army.

206
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:18,820
Pei Zhao, ambushing Khan Tömür is a major event. Why didn't you report it to me first?

207
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,030
It was my fault. Please punish me, Your Highness.

208
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,050
Second Brother, it was an urgent situation.

209
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,130
General Pei and his cavalry already made a breakthrough.

210
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,730
It was a mess at the time. We didn't have time to report to you.

211
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,420
So, we headed directly to Khan Tömür's tent.

212
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:42,220
But when I think about it, I am still worried.

213
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,390
What if you didn't defeat Khan Tömür that time

214
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:49,040
and couldn't conclude the battle? The troops that came up from behind could have hurt you two.

215
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,410
Yes. If it weren't for Second Brother

216
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,340
fighting with Danchi soldiers at the front,

217
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,810
exhausting their major forces, I couldn't have killed Khan Tömür.

218
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:01,030
This is all Second Brother's accomplishment. I just happened to do the easy job.

219
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,790
Fifth Brother, don't be humble.

220
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:09,680
I will return to the capital today and will definitely request the top merit for you and General Pei.

221
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,310
You two only need to stay here at the Western Border Protectorate General Office

222
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,390
to assist General Gao with organizing the aftermath.

223
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,130
Li Yan is severely wounded. There isn't a good doctor here,

224
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,090
so we need to return to the capital soon.

225
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,230
Li Yan, don't worry.

226
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,930
I won't let you get injured for no reason.

227
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,030
I'll make sure you get the credit you deserve.

228
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,190
General, is there good news?

229
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,850
There's no good news.

230
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:20,540
My father gave me a difficult problem to solve.

231
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:25,040
Difficult problem? What kind of difficult problem could you not solve?

232
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,060
Stop sweet-talking me.

233
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,920
My father told me that I should help

234
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,600
Li Chengyin with the marriage alliance.

235
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:51,100
Fifth Prince and Ninth Princess' marriage arrangement...

236
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,040
If we could make the first move,

237
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,250
then it would help him in the fight for the throne.

238
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,020
But in this type of matter, how am I suppose to help?

239
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,490
Whatever. Let's not think about it too much.

240
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:18,870
Since my father already placed the bet, we should just be cooperative.

241
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:50,580
Princess, I saw a rabbit by the edge of the forest, so I brought it back.

242
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,680
It's so cold in the mountains right now.

243
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,860
We haven't found a live animal in a while.

244
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,710
I also found some fruit near the forest.

245
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,220
It's just enough to snack on.

246
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,500
- You picked them up at the same place?
- Yes.

247
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,440
A'Du,

248
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,420
take these away.

249
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,610
Yes.

250
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,880
Hurry!

251
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,910
Princess, why didn't we see any guards on the way here?

252
00:40:54,650 --> 00:41:01,840
It's probably because I haven't been back in so long. All the guards here were sent elsewhere.

253
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,020
Let's go and change our clothes. I can't wait to see my mom.

254
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,600
Okay.

255
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,710
Dad.

256
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,780
Xiaofeng is back.

257
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,540
Dad.

258
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,230
Dad, where is Mom?

259
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:58,290
Child, quickly run. Hurry up and run.

260
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,680
King of Xi State, since the princess has come back,

261
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,790
the marriage alliance must still be completed.

262
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:24,390
You don't have any more excuses to delay it, right?

263
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,260
Dad, where is my mom?

264
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,510
Xiaofeng,

265
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,390
look at these people.

266
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,590
They are the ones that forced your mom to die.

267
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,340
They forced me to give them your mom.

268
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:54,070
Your mom couldn't bear to be humiliated

269
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:59,090
and killed herself with a blade.

270
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,800
She died right in front of me.

271
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:10,290
They even rammed into the palace to see your mom's body before they were satisfied.

272
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:19,990
They are all murderers. They are your mom's killers.

273
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:24,480
My child... escape now!

274
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,510
Dad!

275
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:05,510
