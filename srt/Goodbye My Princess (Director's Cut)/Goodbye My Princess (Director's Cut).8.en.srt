00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,110
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,410
[Episode 8]

3
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,230
Are you awake?

4
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,050
Gu Xiaowu?

5
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,490
Serves you right for running away without me.

6
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,860
Sorry. I shouldn't have ditched you in the town of Gongyue.

7
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,470
Xiaowu, I'm so happy to see you.

8
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,460
Xiaowu, we need to get out of here now.

9
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,780
- To where?
- To get back up.

10
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
To get back up?

11
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,390
You said Khan Tömür's tent is at least 150 kilometers away.

12
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,030
It's too far away to help. The Protectorate General Office is closer. Why don't you ask them for help?

13
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,180
You don't understand. The different states in the Western Border all adhere to the same taboo.

14
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,030
The Central Plains emperor does not get involved in the fights amongst ourselves.

15
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,150
All under the sky is the territory of the emperor and all men are his subjects. Everything that takes place here concerns the emperor.

16
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,450
Besides, the Protectorate General Office was established to ensure peace and stability in the region.

17
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,580
It's time to teach those disrespectful Shuobo a lesson!

18
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,080
Twenty-five kilometers toward the south is a border base camp.

19
00:05:53,080 --> 00:06:00,040
Colonel Pei of the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border has been patrolling in the borders lately. We are friends. Let's go there to ask for reinforcements first.

20
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,970
I hear you. It's more important to save Heshi.

21
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,490
Sir, why aren't you going with them?

22
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,040
Not anybody can enter Khan Tömür's tent.

23
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,740
Fifth Prince must gain Xiaofeng's trust to know where the tent is.

24
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm going to Colonel Pei's camp for a while. You tell my godfather that we've found the person.

25
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,150
- Take care, Young Master.
- Okay.

26
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,500
Xiaowu, where is this base camp?

27
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,380
We've walked for so long, but I haven't even seen a shadow of it.

28
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,450
We should be there soon. Keep on walking.

29
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,460
- I'm really hot.
- I'm hot, too.

30
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,780
I'm thirsty.

31
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,230
I'm thirsty, too.

32
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,660
Can we ride the horse?

33
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,370
No, it's more tired than you.

34
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,480
- Xiaowu, I...
- Don't talk.

35
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,100
Save some of your strength.

36
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,780
I, Gu Jian, greets Colonel Pei.

37
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,710
Brother Gu.

38
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,590
Brother Gu, aren't you supposed to be with Fifth Prince.

39
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,850
On the way to finding the camp of the Danchi's khan, we were attacked by Shuobo soldiers.

40
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,660
Danchi's Khan Tömür's troops led by Heshi to welcome Ninth Princess

41
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,060
are still fighting Shuobo's soldiers right now. Fifth Prince and Ninth Princess should be en route to the borders to seek help.

42
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,620
I hope Colonel Pei will lend a hand to help Heshi.

43
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,630
It's my duty to maintain peace among the kingdoms in the Western Border.

44
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,480
Also, when you meet Ninth Princess, please do not reveal Fifth Prince's true identity.

45
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,790
All right.

46
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,530
But does Fifth Prince know that the border camp has been moved here?

47
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,150
He doesn't. I only found out from my godfather how to reach you here.

48
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,950
Because of the rainy season, sands are soaked with water and the quicksands have expanded.

49
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,830
I have just recently moved the camp here. So I'm afraid that Fifth Prince won't be able to find us.

50
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,940
Quicksands?

51
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,490
Water is here, Xiaofeng!

52
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,330
Awesome!

53
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,680
Hurry up!

54
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,270
Xiaowu, don't move! It's quicksand!

55
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,870
Catch this, Xiaowu!

56
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,300
Hold on tight, Xiaowu!

57
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,650
Little red horse, move backward!

58
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,490
Xiaowu, hold it!

59
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,330
Xiaowu, hold tight!

60
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,680
Little red horse, pull hard!

61
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,010
Xiaofeng!

62
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,500
Xiaofeng, let go!

63
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,990
Don't let me drag you down!

64
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,250
I won't let go! We came together, so we must leave together!

65
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,280
Let go!

66
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,290
Xiaowu, hold on tight!

67
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,070
Xiaowu, hold tight!

68
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,760
Don't let go!

69
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,680
Xiaofeng!

70
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,080
No!

71
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,370
I'm sorry.

72
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,740
Xiaowu!

73
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,870
Xiaowu! Xiaowu!

74
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,560
Don't let go!

75
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,290
Hold on tight!

76
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,940
You are not allowed to let go!

77
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,610
Hold on!

78
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,180
I am Xi State's ninth princess.

79
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,230
My father is the king of Xi State.

80
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,240
My mother is the daughter of the khan of Danchi.

81
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,450
My grandfather is the fiercest Khan Tömür of Danchi.

82
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,820
Xiaofeng, sorry.

83
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,660
I've been using you right from the beginning.

84
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,850
No, hold on to it!

85
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,600
You are not allowed to leave me!

86
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,580
We are still going to look for reinforcements!

87
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,950
I can't swim!

88
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,470
I found it.

89
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,880
Gu Xiaowu!

90
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,330
Hold on to it!

91
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,640
Gu Xiaowu, you dummy!

92
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,330
Xiaofeng, you must live well.

93
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,660
You can't leave me alone!

94
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,340
Hold on to it!

95
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,080
Xiaowu!

96
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,370
Xiaowu!

97
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,120
Are you all right?

98
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,720
Xiaowu, wake up!

99
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,670
Xiaowu.

100
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,880
Xiaofeng, this place is too dangerous. Let's go to base camp.

101
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,910
Xiaowu, come.

102
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,300
Slowly.

103
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,280
- Let's go!
- Slowly.

104
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,660
Your Imperial Majesty! Prince Xuande has already handed Batuer,

105
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,590
the Danchi assassin who murdered the crown prince, to us.

106
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,670
This is Batuer's confession letter. General Gao Xian has investigated this matter himself.

107
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,280
Will Your Imperial Majesty please take a look?
[Cao Ji, Head Eunuch of the Li Empire]

108
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,360
Was all the content of this confession letter

109
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,900
found to be true?

110
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,940
Very much, Your Imperial Majesty!

111
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,340
Anything missing?

112
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,390
None.

113
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,350
Where is that criminal Batuer?

114
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,130
This humble servant has handed him to the Ministry of Justice

115
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,590
and is now just waiting for your judgment.

116
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,360
- Stand up!
- Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty!

117
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,750
Your Imperial Majesty, in my view, Tömür ordered the assassination of the crown prince

118
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,980
to hinder the marriage bond between the Central Plains and Xi State. This proves that he has fervent ambition.

119
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,450
He might've already had the idea of taking over Central Plains.

120
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,190
Should this troubling Danchi issue persist,

121
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,890
there will not be a safe day around our borders. Your humble servant boldly

122
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,680
asks Your Imperial Majesty to please send troops to annihilate Danchi,

123
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,790
so as to relieve the anxiety at the borders.

124
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,930
And to avenge the murder of the crown prince.

125
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,880
This matter is of great importance and does not allow for any mistakes.

126
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,690
Continuing to wage wars will render the people furious.

127
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,350
I think we should try fair means before resorting to force.

128
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,130
Send envoys to negotiate with Danchi first.

129
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,960
Then make the final decision after getting the truth. That would be the best solution.

130
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,550
Absurd! All the evidence is solid, what more is there to negotiate?

131
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,030
Our Li Empire is evidently a large nation.

132
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,450
Why would we be afraid of a tiny tribal state like Danchi?

133
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,540
Khan Tömür sent an assassin to murder the crown prince.

134
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,320
Obviously, he looks down on us.

135
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,570
If we could even tolerate the murder of our crown prince,

136
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,450
please tell me where the dignity of the Li Empire is?

137
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,290
If we can't justify doing this,

138
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,590
then what other good reason is there for waging a war?

139
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,380
Young Lord Wu.

140
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,620
Colonel Pei, how have you been doing?

141
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,580
Right, this person is—

142
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,730
I am Danchi General Heshi's little sister, A'Du.

143
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,860
My brother is now surrounded by the Shuobo Army below Sky Span Mountain.

144
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,220
I earnestly ask Colonel Pei to send your men to assist my brother.

145
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,290
I ask Colonel Pei to send your men to assist General Heshi.

146
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,890
If that's the case, I will tell my men to immediately prepare.

147
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,380
We will proceed in two hours.

148
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,990
Thank you very much, Colonel Pei!

149
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,470
Thank you for your work!

150
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,370
You are all welcome! I am just doing my job.

151
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,120
I will go get ready now.

152
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,190
Oh right, Xiaowu. Why were you apologizing to me earlier?

153
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,760
I was just...

154
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,460
I was just worried that the most beautiful ninth princess in this world,

155
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,800
would jump into the sand and die because of saving the life of a tea businessman from Central Plains.

156
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,970
Had that happened, your father and grandfather would surely go after me.

157
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,900
You just love mocking me.

158
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,700
We will be setting out soon. Let me treat your wound first and let Xiaowu rest.

159
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,050
Your Imperial Majesty, based on reports, Tömür has governed Danchi for more than ten years.

160
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,270
He is open and aboveboard, deeply loved by his citizens.

161
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,900
It might be possible that he doesn't know about the assassination of the crown prince.

162
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,590
The war affects citizens. Once we start the war, It will not only deplete our resources and our men,

163
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,900
it will displace our citizens along the borders. In addition, the areas bordering Danchi are difficult to navigate.

164
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,180
Even if we have a massive army, the long-distance travel

165
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,300
will not make the war 100% to our favor.

166
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,140
You are overestimating our enemy or underestimating ourselves.

167
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,000
We have well trained soldiers, well stocked food, as well as the expertise of the Protectorate General Office located in the Western Border.

168
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Not just Danchi, even the whole Western Border,

169
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,260
is ours to take.

170
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,600
Seeing how you are so protective of Tömür and reluctant to send troops,

171
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,190
do you possibly have any secret ties with Danchi?

172
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,580
Are you preparing to rebel?

173
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,300
At the royal court, we argue political matters.

174
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,760
We see things how they are. Why do you need to wrongfully blame others?

175
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,890
This issue involves our country; moreover, it also involves the people.

176
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,080
May Your Imperial Majesty decide.

177
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,520
Transfer Batuer to the Court of Judicial Review.

178
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,230
I myself will interrogate him.

179
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,470
You have suffered a lot this time.

180
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,430
I am fine. All thanks to Xiaowu.

181
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Teacher, you are right. Xiaowu is really nice.

182
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,460
I will never lie to you.

183
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,230
After this, I have come to understand many things.

184
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:14,550
I think that the feeling between men is sometimes like quicksand.

185
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,500
The more you struggle, the more you can't escape.

186
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Before, I kept pestering you for warmth and support.

187
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,630
Maybe for you, I am the quicksand that bounds you down.

188
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,890
Do you feel that these words shouldn't be coming out from my mouth?

189
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,950
Do you think that I have grown up?

190
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,230
I still like you a lot, but you don't have to feel burdened by it.

191
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,780
This feeling is like your liking for me.

192
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,780
You are forever my best teacher.

193
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,870
I will take my leave.

194
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,230
Fifth Prince.

195
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,650
Ah Zhao.

196
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,540
Fifth Prince, please have a seat.

197
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,500
Ah Zhao, I am now a normal tea businessman, not a prince.

198
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,730
Unbelievable. When the meticulous Colonel Pei starts acting,

199
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,380
there is not even room for a flaw.

200
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,840
Stop teasing me.

201
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,500
Right. How's the investigation on my brother's assassination?

202
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,620
Not long ago, I seized a Danchi assassin called Batuer.

203
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,050
He has confessed to Prince Xuande and confirmed that assassinating the crown prince

204
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,490
was an act from the Danchi people.

205
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,110
So it was really them.

206
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,200
I will make them pay a hundred and a thousand times back.

207
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,800
If the culprit has confessed,

208
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,900
why would His Imperial Majesty still want to personally interrogate?

209
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,050
Could he be doubtful of this case?

210
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,540
And that he suspects the assassin's real identity?

211
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,500
Actually, it does not make a difference if the assassin is real or not.

212
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,830
Uncle, what do you mean?

213
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,930
What is important is

214
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,600
whether His Imperial Majesty wants to clash with Danchi or not.

215
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,260
If not, then the assassin is fake.

216
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,390
If otherwise, the assassin is real.

217
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,040
In your opinion,

218
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,100
does His Imperial Majesty want to start a war or not start a war?

219
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,170
Have you arranged that assassin properly?

220
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,920
I have.

221
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,880
It's not easy to deceive the emperor.

222
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,230
Do not allow a single mistake!

223
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,500
Father, please set your heart at rest.

224
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,280
This man is Prince Xuande's suicide fighter. He is loyal until the end.

225
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,620
Heshi!

226
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,900
You better be all right.

227
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,620
Reporting!

228
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,190
General, we found the Shuobo Army around ten kilometers from here.

229
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,700
Lead the left flank to go around their back. Wait for my command.

230
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,520
Yes. Left flank, follow me!

231
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,900
Let's go!

232
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,040
Heshi, I respect that you're Danchi's number one warrior.

233
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,000
If you surrender, I might even spare your life.

234
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,060
If you want to fight, we'll fight. The people of Danchi

235
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,050
would rather die than surrender. Come on!

236
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,130
Okay, then don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

237
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,420
Brothers, don't let one person live! Kill!

238
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,760
Who are you?

239
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,550
General Pei Zhao of the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

240
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,950
Danchi General Heshi's sister came to my camp for help.

241
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,360
She said that you guys kidnapped General Heshi.

242
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,120
It's my responsibility to mediate and stop this.

243
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,990
So it's Colonel Pei.

244
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,600
This is a matter between Shuobo and Danchi.

245
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,750
It doesn't involve the Li Empire.

246
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,080
So, I suggest that Colonel Pei

247
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,210
- shouldn't get involved.
- All this land belongs to the emperor,

248
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,440
so everyone on this land is a citizen of his.

249
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,620
Sky Span Mountain is an area under the Protectorate General Office's control.

250
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,450
How can you say that this doesn't involve the Li Empire?

251
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:26,560
It's the responsibility of the Protectorate General Office to preserve peace among the kingdoms in the Western Border.

252
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,130
You disobeyed the law and recklessly killed people.

253
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,050
Are you declaring war on the Li Empire?

254
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,930
Colonel Pei, you're mistaken.

255
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,000
Shuobo has never had any contact with your Li Empire.

256
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,720
And today, I don't want to escalate this matter.

257
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,170
Or else, the harmonious relationship between us might be affected.

258
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,670
How about this? I'll give you respect today.

259
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,780
Let them go!

260
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,890
Let's go!

261
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,210
- Heshi!
- Little Princess!

262
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,990
Heshi!

263
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,830
You scared me.

264
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,790
I thought I would never see you again.

265
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,010
Little Princess, don't forget.

266
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:36,090
I am Danchi's number one hero.

267
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,250
How could I get injured?

268
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,300
As long as you're all right, then everything is fine.

269
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,020
Little Princess, why did you bring the Central Plains' army here?

270
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
I was scared that I couldn't find grandfather,

271
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,050
so I went to the Western Border Protectorate General Office to ask Colonel Pei for help.

272
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,670
I told them I was A'Du.

273
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,430
I'm Colonel Pei of the Du Cavalry.

274
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,500
Thank you, Colonel Pei.

275
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,700
It is my responsibility. You don't have to say thank you.

276
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,240
Heshi, this is my teacher Gu Jian.

277
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,660
Thanks to Brother Gu for taking care of my sister.

278
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,190
There's another person you have to thank.

279
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,820
Gu Xiaowu. He's my friend and my teacher's cousin.

280
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,860
Even though he's just a tea trader,

281
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,360
has okay looks,

282
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,320
and has a bad temperament,

283
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,410
he's really brave and smart.

284
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,620
He's the reason why I was able to find you.

285
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,930
This is the first time I've heard my sister compliment someone.

286
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,210
I want to thank everyone again for saving me.

287
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,760
General, no need to bow.

288
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,700
I don't think the Shuobo Army will quit that easily.

289
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,270
You and your fellow warriors have injuries.

290
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:09,760
Why don't we have General Pei escort you to Danchi's border?

291
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,080
Don't worry, Brother Gu.

292
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,020
I will surely ensure that everyone safely arrives home.

293
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,650
Not long ago, I seized a Danchi assassin

294
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,880
called Batuer. He has confessed to Prince Xuande

295
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,260
and confirmed that Danchi assassinated the crown prince.

296
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,660
General Pei!

297
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,130
General Pei, have you seen my teacher and Gu Xiaowu?

298
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,520
They must be tired from traveling so they went back to rest.

299
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,740
Oh right, General Pei, thank you for saving Heshi.

300
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,450
When I reach my grandfather's place in a few days, I'll have him thank you.

301
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:17,260
What reward do you want?

302
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,170
This is what I should be doing.

303
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,330
You actually know how to smile?

304
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,820
These couple of days together, you barely talked and only had one expression.

305
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,220
I thought your face was like the snow on Sky Span Mountain that never melts.

306
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,090
Your smile looks really good.

307
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,930
What kind of instrument is that?

308
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,560
This is a hichiriki from the Xi State. Does it sound good?

309
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,850
This makes me think of home.

310
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,270
If you like it, I'll teach you.

311
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,010
Wait for me.

312
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,350
Brother, give it to me.

313
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,970
Look it here.

314
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,120
You're a lady,

315
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,910
but you're so loose in front of men. Do you understand proper etiquette?

316
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:14,020
Everyone who grew up on the grasslands is like this.

317
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,540
Here, the sky and earth are given by Heaven.

318
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,570
We are all the sons and daughters of Heaven.

319
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:22,210
We aren't so particular like the ladies in the Central Plains.

320
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,560
That's it?

321
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,490
What are you doing?

322
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,460
There is a meteor star!

323
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,850
What's so special about it.

324
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:52,060
When you see the meteor, tie a knot on your clothes so that your wish will come true.

325
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,850
But I always forget to tie a knot or make a wish.

326
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,160
I'm always too late.

327
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,500
Sing me a song.

328
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,890
Why don't you sing? I want to hear you sing.

329
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,150
I don't know how.

330
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,340
Why would anybody not know how to sing?

331
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,960
Sing the song your mother taught when you were little.

332
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,360
I don't have a mother.

333
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,260
Then I'll sing you one.

334
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:40,390
♫ A fox sitting on top of the sand dune ♫

335
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:46,460
♫ Sitting on top of the sand dune, looking at the moon ♫

336
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:55,050
♫ But actually, it's not watching the moon ♫

337
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,680
♫ It's waiting for the shepherd girl to come back ♫

338
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,410
Enough already.

339
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,420
It's so bad. Can we change to another one?

340
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,350
I only know this one.

341
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,100
What is this song?

342
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,680
This is a famous Danchi war song.

343
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,210
It tells the story of a beautiful Danchi lady

344
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:38,020
whose lover went to war. He wasn't able to come back.

345
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,160
Only his horse came back.

346
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,490
So, she held onto the horse's leash,

347
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,980
looked at the arrows her lover didn't get to use,

348
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,530
and she sang this song.

349
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:57,090
"Pity their bones lying by the River Wuding,

350
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:01,390
while their wives still dream of them coming back by springtime."

351
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:05,470
This is a poem from the Central Plains. It has the same meaning as your song.

352
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,060
I heard from Consort Mingyuan

353
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,970
that many of your poems have stories inside them.

354
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,870
Tell me some?

355
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,120
- I forgot.
- Forgot?

356
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:24,990
But... I have another story. Do you want to hear it?

357
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,740
Long, long ago, there was the Zixu Kingdom.

358
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,730
In the Zixu Kingdom, there lived a small prince.

359
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,630
His mother...

360
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,500
passed away when he was young.

361
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,650
Te Zixu Kingdom's queen didn't have a child,

362
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:54,620
so she adopted the little prince.

363
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,060
She raised him and taught him.

364
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:05,370
The little prince treated the queen like his birth mother.

365
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,680
But he didn't know

366
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,160
that the one who killed his birth mother

367
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,540
was the queen.

368
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,830
When he grew up,

369
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:24,200
he found out the truth.

370
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,290
He decided to get justice for his mother.

371
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:34,550
Is that little prince planning to kill the queen?

372
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,760
The queen had too much power. The little prince wouldn't be able to put up a fight.

373
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,230
If he wanted to overthrow the queen, he had only one option.

374
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,430
What option?

375
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,550
He had to become the heir to the throne of the Zixu Kingdom.

376
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,820
The little prince disliked the fight for power the most.

377
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,130
Because in the Zixu Kingdom,

378
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,630
there were only a few heirs that could live past 30 years old.

379
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:15,100
Some were assassinated. Some were abolished by their father and imprisoned until death.

380
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,620
Some heirs

381
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,880
even tried to seize the opportunity and kill their father to claim the thrown.

382
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,250
The little prince's older brother once told him

383
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,220
that the Eastern Palace

384
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,560
was actually a blood-filled imperial palace.

385
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,640
Must the little prince be that way?

386
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,830
Can't he walk another path?

387
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:35,220
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

388
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:39,460

404
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,460

405
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,510
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

406
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,650
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

407
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,250

♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

413

♫  Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
