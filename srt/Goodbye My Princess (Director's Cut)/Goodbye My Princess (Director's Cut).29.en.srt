00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,670
According to the rules, we must visit the emperor and empress today.

177
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,580
Jin'er!

178
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,840
- My Lady.
When did the crown prince leave?

179
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,630
My Lady, Crown Prince left around 4:00 a.m.

180
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,980
At that hour,

181
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,540
he was probably accompanying the crown princess consort to pay their respect.

182
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,970
The wedding ceremony is complete. The red candles are extinguished.

183
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:18,500
The new bride comes to the lobby to meet the family.

184
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,300
Man gives dry plums. Woman gives meat floss.

185
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,120
Honor your elders and upheld your virtue.

186
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:00,560
Don't work too hard. Have a thank you wine.

187
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,630
Drink the thank you wine and happiness will be long.

188
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,970
Pour the tea for the mother-in-law and the aunts.

189
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,620
Crown Princess Consort! What is happening to her?

190
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,710
Your Imperial Highness, her forehead is very hot.

191
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,770
She may have a fever.

192
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,010
She was fine last night.

193
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,300
How does she become like this today?

194
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,790
It's my fault. Please forgive me, Your Imperial Highness.

195
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,220
Get the physicians.

196
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,080
Empress, the coldness has infiltrated the crown princess consort' body.

197
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,120
She was out in the cold for a long time, combined with mental stress,

198
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,200
so she fell ill.

199
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,280
She will need time to recuperate.

200
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,910
Long time in the cold?

201
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,180
Wasn't she with the crown prince yesterday?

202
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,510
Crown Prince, tell me what happened.

203
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,320
Last night, I went to Qingluan Hall.

204
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,480
I don't know how she caught a cold.

205
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,990
You and the crown princess consort's wedding was yesterday.

206
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,700
And you stayed the night at Qingluan Hall?

207
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,810
It's a breach in etiquette.

208
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,100
I go wherever I want to go, as long as it's not her place.

209
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,900
Nonsense!

210
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,930
- Wei Chen.
- I'm here.

211
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,490
Announce my edict.

212
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,370
Related Lady of Excellence for Zhao seduced His Highness and forgot her place.

213
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,360
She is to be locked in Qingluan Hall for half a month.

214
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,170
No one may visit her, including the crown prince.

215
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,690
Imperial Mother, this has nothing to do with Sese.

216
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,670
You think I am wrong to punish her?

217
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,580
It's fine that you discard the rules and traditions,

218
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:41,550
but Zhao Sese should know the palace rules.

219
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,560
She not only did not stop you, but she also allowed you to stay in her place.

220
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,220
She is confusing the lord.

221
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,450
If you think I'm wrong,

222
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,610
you can ask the Ancestral Court to give a judgment.

223
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,840
I...

224
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,550
If it comes to that,

225
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,370
it may be more than half a month of house arrest.

226
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,790
I am sorry, Imperial Mother. I was wrong.

227
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,890
Your Highness.

228
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,540
A'Du.

229
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,260
It's okay.

230
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,740
Did she wake up?

231
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,310
Your Highness,

232
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,700
she hasn't opened her eyes since coming back from Clean and Peaceful Palace.

233
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,360
Your Highness, I'll put in a request to the kitchen for some food.

234
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,880
A'Du, come with me.

235
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:05,040
Let's go.

236
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,090
Why is it so hot?

237
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,960
Don't come near me!

238
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,700
Get out!

239
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,420
What happened?

240
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,560
I knew you were pretending to be sick.

241
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,410
Sese will be locked up for half a month. Are you happy now?

242
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,410
Crown Princess must be delirious from her illness. Please don't be mad at her.

243
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,510
Tell the Palace Pharmaceutical Service not to treat the crown princess consort.

244
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:35,390
If I find out she was treated, I will punish whoever did it.

245
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,100
But, Your Highness...!

246
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,660
Your Highness!

247
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,430
Per Empress' oral edict,

248
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,210
Related Lady of Excellence for Zhao seduced the lord and forget her status.

249
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,780
She is to be locked in Qingluan Hall for half a month.

250
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,280
No one is allowed to visit her.

251
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,500
I shall obey.

252
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,860
It was the crown prince who came here himself,

253
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,130
why is our lady being punished?

254
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:30,510
Jin'er, you must never say such a thing.

255
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,060
The empress never liked me.

256
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,350
She always looked for opportunities to oppress me.

257
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,740
What she doesn't know is the more she oppresses me,

258
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,960
the more Crown Prince will feel for me.

259
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,940
In the Eastern Palace, as long as the crown prince cares about me,

260
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,980
I'm happy.

261
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,440
Your Highness.

262
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,760
How is her illness?

263
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,040
Crown Princess Consort is gravely ill this time.

264
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,100
She needs to recuperate for a few days.

265
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,050
Your Highness, are you really not going to let the Palace Pharmaceutical Service treat the crown princess consort?

266
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,180
Sese has been put on house arrest.

267
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,750
If I don't pretend to be angry,

268
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,320
she might become suspicious.

269
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,720
But the crown princess consort's illness can't be left untreated.

270
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,520
I know.

271
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,020
But every item in the Eastern Palace is recorded.

272
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:58,760
So, I would like you to bring some good medication from your home.

273
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,930
Oh right!

274
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,920
That Yongniang by her side is Imperial Great-Grandmother's servant. She's very trustworthy.

275
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,790
You go give her the medicine secretly.

276
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,750
Don't let anyone find out.

277
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,420
Also, take this chance to investigate

278
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,750
how many people in the Eastern Palace are spies for Prime Minister Gao and the empress.

279
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,300
Yes.

280
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,890
Take good care of the crown princess consort.

281
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,150
Thank you, General Pei, for your help.

282
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,760
If it weren't for your help, I wouldn't know what to do.

283
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,730
All right. Hurry up and brew the medication for her.

284
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,220
Yes.

285
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,250
Crown Prince knows that Prime Minister Gao wants him to be someone who doesn't care about the government

286
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:09,610
and only care about love.

287
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,180
This way, he will be able to control the government.

288
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,300
In the Eastern Palace now, there are many spies for Prime Minister Gao.

289
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,010
The crown prince wants to use this opportunity to

290
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,010
hide his talent, bide his time, and control the situation secretly.

291
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,900
Please tell the crown prince that I've asked Jian'er

292
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,420
to gather all the nearby Submerged Dragon Envoys to the capital.

293
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,260
We have spies in Gao Manor and Ye Manor.

294
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,490
I've replaced all the Eastern Palace guards with my people.

295
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,270
But to avoid any suspicions from Prime Minister Gao, we couldn't get rid of all the eunuchs and ladies-in-waiting.

296
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,010
You should leave some.

297
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,320
If you get rid of all of them, you are more like to give yourself away.

298
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,120
Oh right!

299
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,960
Among those three preceptors of His Highness, is that Fang Shiqing working for Prime Minister Gao?

300
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,600
The crown prince already knows about this.

301
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,710
He wants to use Fang Shiqing as a pawn in his performance.

302
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,480
Oh right, Sir Chai.

303
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,830
His Highness said that since he is living in the Eastern Palace now,

304
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,490
it's inconvenient for him to go out. He wanted me to tell you to take good care of yourself.

305
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,860
Oh right, General Pei.

306
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,850
You have to be more cautious.

307
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,400
I don't know why,

308
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,180
but I think the crown prince's attitude toward the ninth princess is different.

309
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,420
The crown prince has just secured his position.

310
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,150
He can't make any mistakes now.

311
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,990
You make sure to keep an eye on things.

312
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,470
If there are any abnormalities, contact me immediately.

313
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,050
Don't worry, Sir Chai.

314
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,000
A'Du, help the crown princess consort up.

315
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,030
Handkerchief.

316
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,710
Your Highness, it took a lot of effort to find this medication.

317
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,100
Make sure you drink it all.

318
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,600
Your Highness, have a bit of this.

319
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,820
Here, I'll feed you.

320
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,920
I don't want to eat.

321
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,770
The medicine won't help you as much as food. Just take one bite.

322
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,500
Just eat one bite. I'll feed you.

323
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm tired. You go rest, too.

324
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,860
Why are you here again?

325
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,880
Of course, I came to bring food for a foodie like you.

326
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,850
Lamb ribs!

327
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,650
Didn't you say that sick people can't eat lamb ribs?

328
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,190
You would only bring me some meat broth.

329
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,110
You already drank meat broth for a few days.

330
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,110
You are almost fully recovered,

331
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,220
but still don't have any strength.

332
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,470
I want to drink grape wine.

333
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,970
I knew it. I brought some for you.

334
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,420
I also want to eat chilled grapes with frost.

335
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,930
I'll have someone bring some to you in a few days.

336
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,000
Gu Jian, tell me.

337
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,590
When will my dad reply to my letters?

338
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,820
When will he come to see me?

339
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,340
From here to the Xi State, the travel time is three months. Wait a little longer.

340
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,910
But I miss home.

341
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:55,610
I miss my parents. I also miss Xi State.

342
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:06,950
[Eastern Palace]

343
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,950
Who's there?

344
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,310
Cousin?

345
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,840
No one saw you, right?

346
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,460
Why did you come to see me?

347
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,040
During your wedding with the crown princess consort,

348
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,240
did the Xi State envoys offer some tributes?

349
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,770
Yes.

350
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,550
Could you pick some out to gift to Xiaofeng?

351
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:42,400
Just say that her family sent them to her.

352
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,900
Also, tell her that this letter was written by her royal father.

353
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,790
Why?

354
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:03,810
She still doesn't know that her mother is dead.

355
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,270
She has been sending one letter after another home.

356
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,720
She's alone in the palace and there's no one to take care of her.

357
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,760
Now that she's your wife, the only person she can trust is you.

358
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,030
Treat her a little better.

359
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,610
You care a lot about her.

360
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,530
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

361
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,690
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

362
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,240
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

363
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,550
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

364
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,460
♫ A long dream ♫

365
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,230
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

366
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:49,510
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

367
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:57,980
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

368
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:05,050
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

369
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,490
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

370
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:11,320
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

371
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:19,420
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

372
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,190
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

373
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,920
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

374
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,920
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

375
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,550
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

376
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,450
♫ Time reverses ♫

377
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,610
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

378
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:48,700
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

379
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:55,320
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

380
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:02,660
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

381
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,560
