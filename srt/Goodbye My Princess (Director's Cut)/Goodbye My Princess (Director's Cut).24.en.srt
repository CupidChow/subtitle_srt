[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,590
[Episode 24]

17
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,450
When Li Yan mentioned the deceased crown prince case today,

18
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,590
my heart suddenly felt cold.

19
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,050
You have a good relationship with Li Yan.

20
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,150
What do you think about this?

21
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,490
You have already closed the case.

22
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,310
The deceased crown prince was killed by the Danchi people.

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,860
Li Yan is really insubordinate in saying what he did.

24
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,160
But since Imperial Father has already punished him,

25
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,670
he is surely repenting on his mistakes now.

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
Crown Prince, do you really think that this matter

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,530
has nothing to do with Prince Yi?

28
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,830
Imperial Father, I can't give you an answer to this question.

29
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,630
But I've thought about that if Imperial Brother Ji's soul in Heaven could hear us now,

30
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm sure he wouldn't want to see his brothers killing each other.

31
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,410
[Court of Judicial Review]

32
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,820
Your Imperial Majesty, we found out that Chan'er's family have already changed their names.

33
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,080
They are now living in a big house outside the city.

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,600
The people in the surrounding area said that they just moved in about two months ago.

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,240
Chan'er's family was not well off before.

36
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,200
Now that they are living in a big house, there must be a benefactor.

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,550
Do you know who that is?

38
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,210
He has hidden himself really well, so we haven't found out yet.

39
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,630
We also don't want to alarm him by arresting her family members for questioning.

40
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,480
They say that no lies

41
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,220
can endure three days of torture inside the Court of Judicial Review.

42
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,070
You are not a simple maidservant.

43
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,480
It took exactly three days, no more and no less.

44
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,230
Tell me. What has your master given you as a reward?

45
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,350
You have a father, a mother, an 80-year-old grandmother,

46
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,380
two teenager brothers,

47
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,260
and one four-year-old little sister. Am I right?

48
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,500
Too bad.

49
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,850
They have all been killed

50
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,610
and their bodies left in the wilderness.

51
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,480
The crown prince's promise to you wasn't fulfilled.

52
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,060
That's impossible! Impossible!

53
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,820
He promised me that he would keep them safe.

54
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,190
That's impossible! No!

55
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,610
No! That's impossible!

56
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,660
It's too hard on you to live alone.

57
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,740
I'll send you to see your family.

58
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,840
Chan'er has admitted her guilt.

59
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,960
Her confession was true.

60
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,050
Prince Yi tried to poison the crown prince.

61
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,060
Fortunately, it did not result in an unforgivable crime.

62
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,850
He can escape the death penalty but he is being banished to Qian Province

63
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,280
and to never to return to the capital again.

64
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,370
Your Imperial Majesty is wise!

65
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,390
Imperial Mother, you have tried your best. I am not filial.

66
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,200
My son, stand up.

67
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,610
You've suffered.

68
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,140
It is me who's worthless.

69
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,310
All I could do was worry. I couldn't even protect you.

70
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,610
Imperial Mother, you've tried your best. I'm the one who failed you.

71
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,220
I know you were framed.

72
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,110
It's still a dozen days before you depart for Qian Province.

73
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,900
Don't worry. I'll definitely find a solution fo you.

74
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,120
Imperial Mother...

75
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,320
Imperial Father obviously favors Second Brother more.

76
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,390
Nothing can be done anymore.

77
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,860
No! No!

78
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,230
My son, you have to remember this.

79
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,150
Don't give up until the last second.

80
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,760
Do you hear me?! Do you hear me?!

81
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,010
Uncle!

82
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,970
Empress, why are you here so late?

83
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,700
Of course, it's for Chengyin's situation.

84
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,160
Uncle, you know that

85
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,150
Chengyin would never do a despicable act of poisoning others.

86
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,050
I am limited in what I can do in the inner palace.

87
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,220
I can only completely rely on you, my uncle, to turn things around.

88
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,710
His Imperial Majesty is clearly biased towards the crown prince.

89
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:00,780
If Chengyin leaves the capital under such circumstances,

90
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,950
the crown prince will become even more powerful and fearless from now on.

91
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,390
It will not be good for our situation at that time.

92
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,820
- Uncle!
- We are a family. Of course, I'll help Prince Yi.

93
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,230
But it's inconvenient for me to enter the palace.

94
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:28,590
Please arrange for him to come here.

95
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,670
Okay. I'll make the arrangements now.

96
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,050
Please.

97
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,420
Father, why did you promise to help the empress?

98
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,270
If we get involved in this mess, won't the crown prince consider it an open war?

99
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,800
If we don't get involved, will the crown prince like us any better?

100
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,740
If we don't make a move now, it will only be more complicated later.

101
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,000
- Then the timing now...

102
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,630
Is the best time.

103
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,140
If we help Prince Yi now, he will be more obedient to us later on.

104
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,820
Father, what kind of brilliant scheme do you have?

105
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:27,220
Our assassination team did not succeed in killing the previous Crown Prince Li Chengji, but he still died.

106
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,330
Although it was reported to be done by the Danchi,

107
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,550
there were still many unresolved questions. In the end, the case was just closed hastily.

108
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:41,000
Today, Li Yan brought up Crown Prince Li Chengji's death again in the morning court.

109
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,050
Why do you think so?

110
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,610
I understand now.

111
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,940
Besides us, Li Chengye also wanted the previous crown prince to die.

112
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,890
Casting the suspicion onto Prince Yi

113
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,180
is like adding fuel to the fire; hence, angering His Imperial Majesty.

114
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,990
He can also use it to clear up any suspicion about himself, like a thief accusing another as a thief.

115
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,930
If they are really guilty,

116
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,220
then the first thing they'll do is to destroy the assassin Batuer's records.

117
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,840
Father, I will go to the Court of Judicial Review now to find the records.

118
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,980
Your Highness! Your Highness!

119
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,850
What's wrong?

120
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,250
I went to the Court of Judicial Review to retrieve Batuer's file,

121
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,960
but it's been taken by someone else.

122
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,330
- Who?
- Gao Kun.

123
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,590
Send people to closely watch the Gao Manor. Report immediately to me on any movements.

124
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,520
Greetings, Grand Uncle.

125
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,840
I am deeply appreciative of Grand Uncle's help even when I am already in this doomed state.

126
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,660
I was really reckless before.

127
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,660
I made so many decisions by myself, without consulting with Grand Uncle first.

128
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,910
That's why I committed such a huge blunder.

129
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,560
If it can still be overturned so that I can stay in the capital,

130
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,880
I will listen to Grand Uncle's every word and advice in the future.

131
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,160
Prince Yi, you said it too seriously.

132
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,090
I watched you grow up and know your nature.

133
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,950
Of course, I cannot watch you being framed.

134
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,080
Prince Yi, please stand up.

135
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,940
Thank you, Grand Uncle.

136
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,540
Grand Uncle, have you come up with any ideas?

137
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,280
This is...

138
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,820
Batuer's portrait?

139
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,750
Exactly.

140
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,460
When Li Yan and Li Chengye mentioned the case involving Batuer,

141
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:23,110
Father became suspicious and asked me to go to the Court of Judicial Review to retrieve that document.

142
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:29,360
In it, there was only this portrait and a brief write-up about the case.

143
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,010
So it means that when Imperial Father interrogated me

144
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,430
and he mentioned that I'm involved in my eldest brother's death,

145
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,820
it must have been triggered by something.

146
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,790
Imperial Father must have some doubts.

147
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,500
Even His Imperial Majesty is having doubts, then we can start from this angle.

148
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,530
About whether Danchi really killed the deceased crown prince, there was no definite evidence.

149
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,930
It was all based on Batuer's words.

150
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,190
But Batuer was actually escorted to the capital by Li Yan himself.

151
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,500
If they did some tricks, then there's something wrong about that Batuer.

152
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,370
Prince Yi, when you were at the Western Border Protectorate General Office,

153
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,310
did you ever meet Batuer?

154
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,750
No, but General Pei told me that he was the one who captured him.

155
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,760
And Batuer was definitely from Danchi.

156
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,310
I remember that Uncle Gao Xian also participated in the questioning.

157
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,490
Maybe, they have a more detailed record of it.

158
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,280
Could we ask for those documents to be delivered here?

159
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,720
Maybe, we would be able to find something odd about it.

160
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,920
Write to your brother.

161
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,320
Tell him to collect all files related to Batuer and send them to the capital.

162
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,870
- He must personally deliver them here.
- Yes.

163
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,680
Thank you, Grand Uncle.

164
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,450
[Bing Pass]

165
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,940
Remember. If you are stopped, you have to protect the scroll document to your death.

166
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,760
Yes!

167
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,010
Gao Xian has left the Western Border Protectorate General Office and is coming towards Shangjing?

168
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,430
The scout reported that they went in nine different directions.

169
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,020
All of them had masks on. We don't know which one is Gao Xian.

170
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,860
Don't panic, Your Highness.

171
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,470
I will order elite soldiers to guard the nine gates now.

172
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,860
No one can enter the capital.

173
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,480
Gao Xian is a high official commissioned to be stationed at the border.

174
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,460
Without a written decree from His Imperial Majesty, he is not allowed to come into the capital.

175
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,390
If he dares to come through the nine gates,

176
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,300
I'll kill him under the justification of treason.

177
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,840
That's our only best plan now.

178
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,630
Thanks for your hard work, Elder Prince Zhong.

179
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,920
I'll go make the arrangements.

180
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:55,020
Your Highness, it's only one Gao Xian. There's nothing to be scared about.

181
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,200
I'm scared that if we can't stop them,

182
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,080
there will only be one path left for us.

183
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,240
Your Highness, do we really have to do this?

184
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,880
We changed that mined copper into coins just to feed so many assassins.

185
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,250
Wasn't it all for this one day?

186
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,220
This matter is of great importance.

187
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,320
Prince Yi especially sent me to ask you about this. I hope you will help us in this matter.

188
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,910
A'Du!

189
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,860
You were not able to persuade her, right?

190
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,730
This matter is indeed hard for her.

191
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,720
But with the Gao family and Prince Yi's relations,

192
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,140
if this type of evidence is utilized, it will be hard for His Majesty to be completely convinced.

193
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,330
This evidence will only be believable

194
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,410
if someone neutral like A'Du gives a testimony.

195
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,820
Only you may have the ability to persuade her.

196
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,630
I forgot to tell you last time,

197
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,390
that you actually look good wearing those clothes.

198
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,370
I do not like it.

199
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,570
There are many things that are shackles.

200
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,790
If you put them down, you will be more relaxed.

201
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,260
You do not understand.

202
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,970
You are the one who does not understand.

203
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,220
If you do not save Li Chengyin, Xiaofeng will be married to Li Chengye.

204
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,420
How long do you think Li Chengye will keep Xiaofeng?

205
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,490
And how many lives does Xiaofeng have to block from the successive hidden attacks?

206
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,880
This time was poison. You know what will be next.

207
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,960
Gu Jian, if you continue to speak up for Li Chengyin,

208
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,540
I will not allow you to see the princess.

209
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,730
If the one who poisoned her was Li Chengyin,

210
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,540
and the one protecting her was Li Chengye,

211
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,210
I definitely would not come and sway you.

212
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,190
Withdraw!

213
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,710
Your Highness, this is a document from the courier.

214
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,950
Useless! Leave!

215
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,590
Yes!

216
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,990
Uncle Gao Xian, you have finally arrived.

217
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:33,410
Chengyin, I face the death penalty for delivering you these documents.

218
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,070
I will remember the kindness of the Gao family for as long as I live.

219
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,860
Good!

220
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,180
Remember what you said when you have become the crown prince.

221
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,340
Yes.

222
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,810
And the rest of the journey will be up to you.

223
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,730
Take care.

224
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,490
Thank you, Uncle.

225
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,420
You two leave first.

226
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,410
Let's go, Fifth Prince.

227
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
Lift your head!

228
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,120
Your Highness.

229
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,210
Your Highness, you are able to remain calm?

230
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,410
Not keeping calm would mean the final step.

231
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,130
Do you wish to take the final step?

232
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,730
So, we can only wait right now?

233
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,780
Yes, wait. But it's not waiting to be fish chunks on the cutting board.

234
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,610
Rather, we are waiting for an opportunity.

235
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,860
Too bad, the beautiful blooms in this yard will be all wasted.

236
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:54,300
A'Du, you only need to pick out Batuer among these ten portraits.

237
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:21,240
Miss A'Du, is that person Batuer?

238
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,540
Your Highness, must we do this?

239
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,980
If we take one careless step,

240
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,940
then the entire board will be lost.

241
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,410
Therefore...

242
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,110
Your Highness, I was the one who hauled in the fake Batuer.

243
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,560
I'll bear all of it.

244
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,980
I absolutely will not implicate you.

245
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,620
Blockhead, based on our relations,

246
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,880
even if you bear all the mistakes, I will still get implicated.

247
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,380
Your Highness!

248
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,970
Regardless, I can no longer hold on to this position of the crown prince.

249
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,900
But the throne...

250
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,330
Your Highness.

251
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,790
Open the door. I have an important matter to report to the emperor.

252
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,520
Please show His Imperial Majesty's hand-written decree, so I may open the palace door.

253
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,170
Open the door!

254
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,070
Your Highness!

Once their wings are fully formed,

257
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,080
up the courtyard's tree branch they were led.

258
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,190
Spreading its wings without looking back,

259
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,260
loosely flying about with the carefree wind.

260
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,900
Cries of the parent birds resonate in the sky,

261
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:52,520
exhausting their voices, yet unable to call them back.

262
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,750
Returning to an empty nest,

chirping sadly the entire night.

Yes!

266

00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,030

You are the one who taught me that the winner shall be the king!

You are the one who taught me to use all means necessary!

280
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,790
Since you gave me wild ambitions,

281
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,240
why are you impeding me?!
