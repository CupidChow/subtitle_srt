[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,460
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,520
We came to the capital...

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,480
to the capital... to stay with my uncle.

5
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,320
No matter what, I like you.

6
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,690
I feel that even though it's the first time we have seen each other, we already know one another.

7
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,330
So, even if there is nothing, please just come to visit me.

8
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,110
I'll treat you to drinks from my private collection.

9
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,480
Okay, okay, okay.

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,760
Oh yeah, you mentioned that the capital has three treasures.

11
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,930
What is this place called Singing Jade Brothel?

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,180
You guys don't know?

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,320
Singing Jade Brothel is the most famous locale in the capital.

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,190
Are their food and drink any good?

15
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,120
It's because their food and drink are terrible

16
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,620
so their customers will order food from my place to be delivered over there.

17
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,170
How come they are famous when their food and drink are no good?

18
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,440
Food and drink are not important over there.

19
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,220
What's important is the women over there are beautiful and talented.

20
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,850
That attracts men more than food and drink.

21
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,650
It's that kind of place?

22
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,770
Their ace is a woman named Mingyue. Money can't buy a night with her.

23
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,080
She only sells her talent and not her body. For regular folks to see her,

24
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,190
- they probably have to wait a couple of months for their turn.
- Really?

25
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,140
Then, we should take a look.

26
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,790
They only let men come in, not women.

27
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,840
Are we that obvious?

28
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,400
Ms. Mingyue has seen all kinds of people.

29
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,190
Nothing can go unnoticed by her.

30
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,660
The news may travel to Uncle's ear.

31
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,690
What uncle?

32
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,230
My uncle! Right, my uncle.

33
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,300
Right... Let's drink.

34
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,680
Let's drink.

35
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,420
Young Lord Gao.

36
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,860
Mi Luo, Mi Luo! Drinks, drinks!

37
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,580
Young Lord Gao.

38
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,010
Next time? Next time, if I still can't see Mingyue, I'll close down your Singing Jade Brothel.

39
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,500
Please calm down. Young Lord, calm down and drink some wine.

40
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,030
I don't want wine! I want Mingyue!

41
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,700
Young Lord Gao!

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,180
This...

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,030
This wine...

44
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,610
That Mingyue is too haughty.

45
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,480
Don't be angry. What should we do about the cost of the wine?

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,550
Put it on the tab.

47
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,970
Take care.

48
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,930
Why'd you come out?

49
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,020
What happened over there?

50
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,400
It's like this every day. When that Young Lord Gao can't see Miss Mingyue,

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,660
he takes his anger out on other people.

52
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,500
It's late. We need to go back home.

53
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,540
That's fine. It's time for me to close, too.

54
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,540
Make sure to come often.

55
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,650
The wine here is tasty and you're beautiful.

56
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,570
I'll make sure to come often.

57
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,790
Thank you for taking care of my business.

58
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,660
I'm leaving.

59
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,590
Mi Luo, my name is Xiaofeng.

60
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,680
Xiaofeng?

61
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,600
General Pei.

62
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,670
Are you still working for the king of Xi State?

63
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,620
Xi State and Li Empire are in a marriage alliance.

64
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,050
There is nothing for a little spy like me to do.

65
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,620
General, long time no see.

66
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,830
Would you like to come and have a drink and a chat with me?

67
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,590
This wooden guy...

68
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,190
is still so dense.

69
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,810
Buddy, take care of yourself.

70
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,550
Respectfully greeting, Your Majesty.

71
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,480
Rise.

72
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,380
The crown prince had only passed away a few months ago. Why are you in a hurry for me to designate another heir?

73
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,990
Do you all think that I'm old

74
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,530
and not healthy enough? Must we designate an heir now?

75
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,080
Your Majesty, that's not what I meant.

76
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,120
The tragedy of the crown prince has caused my colleagues and I

77
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,010
to be in deep grief.

78
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,830
But after our battle with Danchi, there has been unrest on the Western Border.

79
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,320
The marriage alliance with the Xi State has been established

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,920
and the ninth princess of Xi State has been in our empire for months.

81
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,990
But since we haven't designated a crown prince, the wedding day

82
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,970
has been pushed back multiple times.

83
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,870
I'm scared that if this continues,

84
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,210
the people of the Western Border kingdoms will become anxious.

85
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:24,160
Which of my sons do you think

86
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,170
can become the heir to the throne?

87
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,370
History has suggested legitimacy over seniority.

88
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,100
Seniority over juniority.

89
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,280
The empress has no son.

90
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,220
The second prince is the eldest of all the princes.

91
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,960
He also won victoriously in the war against Danchi.

92
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,670
His standing is well respected among all the princes.

93
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,690
The second prince is intelligent and brave; as well as, virtuous and with good morals.

94
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,300
I think whether you consider age or character,

95
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,060
the second prince is the best choice to be the crown prince.

96
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,210
I will take your suggestion into consideration.

97
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,170
You may leave!

98
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,470
I bid you farewell.

99
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,930
We haven't had a drink together at this place for a long while.

100
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,840
Here, a toast.

101
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,370
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

102
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Yuming, tell me.

103
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,180
What is your take on the heir issue?

104
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,960
We are at peace after a war with Danchi. The alliance with Xi State

105
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,860
is settled.

106
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,500
Your Imperial Majesty is at your prime and healthy.

107
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,740
We shouldn't rush on the heir issue.

108
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,700
I have thought about it.

109
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,260
What the officials said made sense.

110
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,900
The earlier I have an heir, designate a crown prince to

111
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,450
marry Ninth Princess, we can keep peace outside the border,

112
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,180
and settle the difference within the border. Two birds with one stone.

113
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,900
I asked you here today

114
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,330
to give my some ideas.

115
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,020
Which of my sons is worthy

116
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,950
to be my successor?

117
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,430
I think...

118
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,340
Prince Xuade is the best choice.

119
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,990
He is the eldest.

120
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,900
He is guided by Prince Zhong and other elderly officials.

121
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,440
It's everybody's choice to have Prince Xuande as the crown prince.

122
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,400
I feel that Chengyin is a good choice, too.

123
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,940
His putting down Danchi was a great merit.

124
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:31,300
The things he said during the hunt

125
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,390
showed that he was loving and loyal.

126
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,430
I see that he is better at handling things.

127
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,800
In the future, he could handle great responsibilities.

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,590
Prince Yi's glorious bravery in the war against Danchi

129
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,960
has impressed the entire court of ministers.

130
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,000
For selfish reasons,

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,700
I am indeed biased towards the fifth prince.

132
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,850
But to designate an heir is a major state affair.

133
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,580
Compared to Prince Xuande, Prince Yi

134
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,460
is still too young.

135
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:14,700
Throughout this government, you're the most loyal to me, Yu Ming.

136
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,230
Here's to you.

137
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,540
"Citizens, an emperor ruling the country

138
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,200
should designate an heir and secure the country.

139
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,540
My second son, Prince Xuande Chengye, is loyal, respectful, and filial,

140
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,870
compassionate and altruistic,

141
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,300
diligent and organized in studies, refined in speech, respectful in all his actions,

142
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,810
doesn't lose kindness in times of darkness.

143
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,440
I have long examined and deemed him worthy of the crown prince position.

144
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,200
Always fearing that the gods aren't pleased, that I'm lacking in governance.

145
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,390
To celebrate the time.

146
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,210
To supervise and to account for the prayer items.

147
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,700
To observe the rules of leader and to listen to advisors.

148
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,320
They are important matters to keep in mind.

149
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,000
With the power invested by the Bifeng and the officials present,

150
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,320
I now proclaim my second son as the crown prince

151
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,700
and he is to reside in the Eastern Palace. I order the decreed one to fulfill my order."

152
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,990
I accept the decree and thank your graces.

153
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,460
I order that all government offices to prepare

154
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,240
for the wedding between Crown Prince and Ninth Princess of Xi State happening one hundred days from now.

155
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,700
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

156
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,230
You may rise.

157
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,750
All hail to the crown prince.

158
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,300
There are four edifying behavioral characteristics for women. The first is womanly virtue,

159
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,900
the second is womanly speech, the third is womanly manner,

160
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,410
and the fourth is woman...

161
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,730
- Womanly merit.
- ...womanly merit!

162
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,070
The master states womanly virtue requires no special talent.

163
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,300
Womanly speech...

164
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,850
- Does not sharpen her language and speech!
- ...does not sharpen her language and speech!

165
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:56,300
Princess, you've been memorizing the "Lessons of a Woman" for a month, but you still can't remember it all.

166
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm incompetent. I'll go hand in my resignation to the Grand Empress Dowager.

167
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,610
Let's find another female official as your teacher. I will take my leave.

168
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,200
Please don't! Directress Fang!

169
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Please don't leave! Imperial Great Grandmother said that you are the top official of the ceremonial service.

170
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,750
If you quit, no one else would be willing to teach me.

171
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,880
It's my fault. I apologize to you. From now on, I'll work harder. Is that all right?

172
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,830
Don't be upset. It'll hurt your health.

173
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,390
Have some tea and calm down.

174
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,190
It's...

175
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,660
- What's wrong, Directress Fang?!
- It's vinegar!

176
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,990
It's...

177
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,770
How dare you, A'Du! You dare to prank me?! I'm going to hit you!

178
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,100
Calm down! Don't get upset and hurt your health!

179
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,290
Ninth Princess, please move aside! Let me punish this disrespectful servant!

180
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,790
Don't be angry, Directress Fang. Don't ruin your health!

181
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,010
Move aside!

182
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,400
Your Highness! Your Highness!

183
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,810
Princess, I deserve to die!

184
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll go get the imperial doctor, now!

185
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,840
Princess, the emperor has conferred Prince Xuande as the crown prince.

186
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,880
In a hundred days, Your Highness will be the crown princess consort of the Eastern Palace!

187
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,550
What?

188
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,800
Congratulations, Your Highness. Prince Xuande has been conferred the crown prince. The wedding will happen a hundred days later.

189
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,150
Congratulations, Your Highness. You will soon be married.

190
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,350
It's urgent for you to learn all the etiquette and rules of the palace.

191
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,080
That's right! No negligence must happen during the wedding!

192
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,020
[Eastern Palace]

193
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,000
Prince Yi.

194
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,720
You are here, too.

195
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:09,500
Prince Xuande is now the crown prince. As norm, all princes and officials must come here to congratulate him.

196
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,080
I'm here earlier to arrange protective detail.

197
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,360
Second Brother will be moving to the Eastern Palace tomorrow.

198
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,990
There will be a new owner here.

199
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,060
A Zhao,

200
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:35,560
ever since we came back from Xi State, I've wanted to talk to you.

201
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,340
But I didn't know

202
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,980
where I should start or what to say.

203
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,290
Your Highness do not need to trouble yourself.

204
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,720
I, Pei Zhao, have known since I was little

205
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,440
that I'll be loyal to one person. And that is you.

206
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,140
I understand what you're thinking, even if it contains private desires.

207
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,570
As long as your decision benefits the Li Empire, it will be enough for me.

208
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,840
Pei Zhao will always be by Your Highness' side.

209
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:23,880
Father, you are brilliant. You not only satisfied the emperor's wish by removing his concern,

210
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,030
you made Prince Xuande carry a target on is his back.

211
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,570
The early worm gets eaten by the bird.

212
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:37,230
If Prince Zhong is that eager to have Prince Xuande as the crown prince, then I'll let them have it.

213
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,260
You know the most eager ones are the princes.

214
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,970
They will do everything possible to get the dirt on Prince Xuande.

215
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,530
To confer or to abolish is the emperor's decision.

216
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,930
No one knows who will laugh to the end.

217
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:02,440
Father, Li Yan has been transferred to the Ministry of Revenue。

218
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,790
Keep an eye on him.

219
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,860
Tell me... Do I really have to marry Prince Xuande?

220
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,270
I've only seen him twice.

221
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,630
He actually seems nice and his actions are always appropriate,

222
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,720
but I just don't feel at ease whenever I'm with him.

223
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,510
It's like those strict and inflexible rules of this empire.

224
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,900
I am going to live with a person like that for the rest of my life...

225
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,780
I also miss home,

226
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,750
but I can't leave.

227
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:15,350
I have a mom and dad, brothers and sisters, as well as the millions of citizens of Xi State.

228
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:22,260
I'm here for a political marriage. Hence, I have to learn the rules that I don't like

229
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,410
and marry a person that I don't like.

230
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:31,360
I'm becoming more and more unlike myself.

231
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,080
A'Du, why are you crying again?

232
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,420
Okay. Okay. We won't talk about it anymore.

233
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,110
Let's go find Mi Luo and get drunk.

234
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,900
All the clothes are with you, right?

235
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,350
Let's go.

236
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,840
Ninth Princess.

237
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,810
Senior Lady-in-Waiting Ying, why are you here this late?

238
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:48,230
Grand Empress Dowager sent me here to deliver Your Highness some snacks.

239
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,460
Thank Imperial Great Grandmother for me then.

240
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,010
Yongniang.

241
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,200
I also wanted to remind Your Highness that

242
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,160
there have been thieves in the palace so everyone has to stick to curfew.

243
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,560
Don't casually go outside or let any strangers in.

244
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,170
Thieves?

245
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,060
Yes. Guards say that they saw a white shadow on the roof

246
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,610
but they didn't catch him. It's most likely thieves.

247
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,660
If it was an assassin, Your Highness needs to be more careful.

248
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,640
Thank you for your reminders.

249
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,960
I'll take my leave then.

250
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,140
Leave safely.

251
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,790
Your Highness, your wedding is happening soon. And it hasn't been peaceful in the palace lately.

252
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,790
You shouldn't run away anymore.

253
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,910
I understand, Yongniang.

254
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,180
Then don't exhaust yourself. Please rest early, Your Highness.

255
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,330
Okay. You too.

256
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,930
It looks like we can't go out anytime soon.

257
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,650
Thief!

258
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,290
Xiaofeng!

259
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,000
Xiaofeng, I know you're still angry with me.

260
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,230
You can hate me or yell at me,

261
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,470
but you shouldn't stay here.

262
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,030
You shouldn't give up your happiness and marry someone you don't love.

263
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,410
A'Du, hit him!

264
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,390
Guards, there is an assassin!

265
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:31,180
He's in there! Hurry up!

266
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,430
Over there!

267
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,680
He was here just now.

268
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,470
Where is he?

269
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,230
- Search the area!
- Yes!

270
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Where is he?

271
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,810
I was late to protect you. I've caused Your Highness the Ninth Princess to be traumatized.

272
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,960
General Pei!

273
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,130
Did you find him?

274
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,990
General, Ninth Princess said the assassin was inside her palace, so I ran in with my men.

275
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,470
But there was no one there. He must have jumped out from the window.

276
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,330
General Pei.

277
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,650
Did Ninth Princess see his face?

278
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,530
She said she didn't see clearly.

279
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,410
Search carefully!

280
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,710
Yes!

281
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,610
Yongniang, please show us the way.

282
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,420
Open the doors! We're searching for an assassin!

283
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,600
Quickly go out! We're searching for an assassin!

284
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,780
Get out! We need to search!

285
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,900
General Pei, this is the room of A'Du, the personal maid of Ninth Princess.

286
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,480
She cannot speak, but she came with Ninth Princess from Xi State. She can have a private room.

287
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,930
No need to search!

288
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,660
With so much noise, he's probably gone already.

289
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,990
- Go search elsewhere!
- Yes.

290
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,440
A'Du, it's fine now. You can sleep.

291
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,790
A'Du.

292
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,550
What's happened for these past few months? What's wrong with Xiaofeng?

293
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,630
Why doesn't she recognize me? And why are you here at Li Empire?

294
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,670
Why did she agree to the marriage alliance?

295
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,990
What happened exactly?

296
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,580
Your voice...

297
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,770
Who did this to you?

298
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,870
Minister Gao sure is a sly old fox.

299
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,600
He appeared to appease His Imperial Majesty,

300
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,750
but he actually pushed the crown prince to the heart of the struggle.

301
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,160
What do you mean?

302
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,880
To play chess well,

303
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,800
you can't just watch your own chess pieces. You also have to

304
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,580
observe the other side's every move. Only via this way

305
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,600
can you come up with a strategy from afar and control the entire game.

306
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,800
If you don't want to become someone else's pawn,

307
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,400
this is the time to start your offensive move.

308
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,200
You want me to get close to Prime Minister Gao?

309
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,700
Prime Minister Gao won't sit for long to see the crown prince grow his strength.

310
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,650
Right now, you are the most capable and useful chess piece in his hand.

311
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,400
And your power in the imperial court isn't that stable yet.

312
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,510
You also need his support in order to take back the crown prince's seat.

313
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,580
Sir.

314
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
- Sir, General Pei asks to see you.
- Ask him to come in.

315
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,280
Prince Yi.

316
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,770
Sir Chai.

317
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,020
Just now a stranger intruded into the palace and startled Grand Empress Dowager and His Imperial Majesty.

318
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,700
I think Gu Jian has probably returned.

319
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,030
My cousin? If it's really my cousin...

320
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,690
Why didn't he come here first to see Sir Chai but instead rashly went into the palace?

321
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,800
Maybe he doesn't know where Sir Chai is,

322
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,170
nor does he know that you have moved out of the palace and have been conferred a princely title. That's why, he recklessly went into the palace.

323
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:20,700
All right, find out where he is. Let me know immediately if you hear of anything.

324
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,000
Yes.

325
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,660
- Prince!
- Prince,

326
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,980
I need to return to the palace, so I won't escort you back to your manor.

327
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,380
Go ahead.

328
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,030
I came to you for one thing.

329
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,000
What has happened after I fell off the cliff?

330
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,680
Ninth Princess jumped into the River of Oblivion to escape from Prince Yi.

331
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,700
Prince Yi also jumped jin after her to save her.

332
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:33,560
Thereafter, all those past entanglements between them got completely forgotten.

333
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,120
As for A'Du, that was her own choice.

334
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,170
The River of Oblivion can erase all sentiments. No wonder she has forgotten me.

335
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:49,310
Now that you're back, why didn't you go in to see Sir Chai?

336
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,100
I don't feel like seeing anyone now. Don't tell others too that I've sought you.

337
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,740
Where are you living now?

338
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,130
Grand Uncle, how have you been doing?

339
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:18,200
Thank you for caring about me. I'm in pretty good health.

340
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,870
During the war against Danchi, you have established a great achievement.

341
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,700
You've won the hearts of the military and stunned the whole imperial court.

342
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,000
You made me see you in a brand new light.

343
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,550
It's all thanks to Uncle Gao Xian in advising me for the Danchi battle.

344
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,930
- He is the one who should be credited for the win.
- Don't say these humble words.

345
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,510
It's natural for your uncle to help you.

346
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,500
Grand Uncle, I hear that the remnant soldiers of Danchi are causing problems at our border.

347
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,920
Father wants to select a competent general to be conferred as the North Subduing Marquis who will lead an army to stand guard at Danchi.

348
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:58,160
Uncle Gao Xian has been stationed at the Western Border for a long time.

349
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,100
He should be able to quash all the Danchi remnants with his prestige in Western Border.

350
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:10,280
I will recommend Uncle tomorrow at court.

351
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,040
Actually, it doesn't matter who goes to Danchi. What matters is, you absolutely cannot go there.

352
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,010
Thank you for reminding me.

353
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,200
You are smart. Now that there is a crown prince,

354
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,100
the best measure is to keep a low profile

355
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,130
and bide your time.

356
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,200
Prince Yi, Li Yan recently requested some money from the treasury.

357
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,970
The reason given is to repair the bronze statues in the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

358
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,960
I think there is trickery involved.

359
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,360
Isn't the repair of religious statues...

360
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,860
under the jurisdiction of your Ministry of Revenue? Why is Li Yan getting involved?

361
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:01,870
Some time ago, Li Yan got transferred to our ministry through Elder Prince Zhong. Right after that,

362
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,910
Elder Prince Zhong became really friendly with me

363
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,680
and wanted me to assign the statue remodeling project to Li Yan.

364
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,550
There's such a thing?

365
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,300
Elder Prince Zhong is a royal and an elder. Since he personally came to me,

366
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,790
I... How could I refuse him?

367
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:28,400
Uncle, in your opinion, what could Li Yan be doing?

368
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,010
Even as the Minister of Revenue, I have my doubts,

369
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,810
it is still awkward to investigate someone among us.

370
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,940
Why don't you look into it?

371
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,800
Find out what Li Yan is planning to do.

372
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,780
After the war with Danchi, we executed Tömür.

373
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,720
But in the last few months, there is constantly conflicts between their nobility.

374
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,030
There are often refugees causing disturbance along the borders

375
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,320
of Li Empire, Shuobo, and Xi State.

376
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,820
I've decided to choose among my officials

377
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,230
someone who knows the topography of the Western Border well,

378
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,210
understands the local culture, as well as one who can lead an army.

379
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,650
He will be conferred the title North Subduing Marquis

380
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,210
to govern Danchi.

381
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,540
Does anyone have any suggestions?

382
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,120
Father, I recommend Far Subduing High General Gao Xian.
(Far Subduing General or Zhenyuan General is a 6-rank officer)

383
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,220
General Gao has defended the northwest for many years.

384
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,680
He is knowledgeable about the situation, military strength, and local populace of the northwest.

385
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,460
He is the best option if we want to govern Danchi for a long time.

386
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,160
Prince Yi is really not shy about nominating from his own relatives.

387
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,960
The Western Border Protectorate General Office of General Gao Xian has already been managing the whole Western Border.

388
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,060
If we let him take over Danchi, what's the different of that to just conferring him as king of a fiefdom?

389
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,610
Your language seems biased.

390
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,980
His Imperial Majesty puts the right people on the right positions.

391
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,380
In the past years, General Gao Xian had put down multiple conflicts around the Western Border.

392
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,310
And he garnered great achievements.

393
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:20,950
He is the best candidate to govern Danchi.

394
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,840
Your statement seems arbitrary.

395
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,590
Li Empire is a big country with many talented people.

396
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,850
To be skilled in governing and battling, there are at least

397
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:37,140
ten people on this court. The recommendation must be fair.

398
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,100
In terms of military governance, nothing can beat Elder Prince Zhong.

399
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,590
General Gao Xian contributed greatly during the war against Danchi.

400
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,190
He deserves to be assigned the job.

401
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,290
For that precise reason, asking General Gao to govern Danchi after he's one of the people who defeated them,

402
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,050
how could the Danchi people abide by his authority?

403
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,580
Stop arguing.

404
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,950
Speak one at a time!

405
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,680
Your Imperial Majesty, I recommend Prince Yi.

406
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,590
Prince Yi?

407
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,580
Prince Yi is skilled in warfare

408
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,510
leading to our complete victory over Danchi.

409
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,110
He is truly the best choice to govern Danchi.

410
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,100
Imperial Father, although I luckily won the battle,

411
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,080
it's all due to the protection of your might and the valiant army of our empire.

412
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,990
I know I cannot shoulder this important job.

413
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:54,550
On the other hand, when it comes to our unfamiliarity about the Western Border, I do have a suggestion.

414
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,450
After spending about half a year in the Western Border, I have acquired some knowledge about their local customs and habits.

415
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,050
I earnestly ask Imperial Father to let me write a book about the local history of the Western Border.

416
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,450
It will describe the situation of the different Western Border region in detail to facilitate our rule over them.

417
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,510
Through it, officials can understand the affairs of the Western Border.

418
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,800
In a few years, every court official will be familiar with the Western Border.

419
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:26,750
After going there to train yourself, you indeed have become more matured.

420
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,120
Your suggestion...

421
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,770
is approved.

422
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,410
Thank you, Imperial Father!

423
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,620
Please stand.

424
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,590
I'm a little tired.

425
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,180
We'll talk about who will be North Subduing Marquis next time.

426
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,930
Court dismissed.

427
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,650
Court dismissed!

428
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,460
Prime Minister Gao, my son is stupid. I hope he did not offend you with his words.

429
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,220
You are already old. Please do not get upset.

430
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,390
At my age,

431
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:17,590
how could I get upset with a few words from your son?

432
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:21,190
It's just that the argument today didn't yield a result.

433
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,720
His Imperial Majesty couldn't decide.

434
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:29,920
I wasn't able to unburden His Imperial Majesty.

435
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,660
I feel ashamed.

436
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:39,140
Actually, it doesn't matter who His Imperial Majest sends to Danchi. We are all court subjects and citizens of Li empire.

437
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,930
Farewell.

438
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,320
Father.

439
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,630
That Li Chengyin is not that great.

440
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,680
He won't accept such a high appointment.

441
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,910
He declines any military authority.

442
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:18,690
He has to stay in the capital for a woman and even wants to publish a book. He is like mud that can't be used to build a wall.

443
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,500
Fifth is not that simple as you think.

444
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:32,760
He is stepping back to prepare to move forward. Military authority can be rescinded anytime.

445
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,360
Once he leaves the capital, he'll never be able to come back.

446
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:42,480
If he had accepted the North Subduing Marquis appointment today, I would have felt settled.

447
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,450
But now that he has rejected it, I have to prepare against him.

448
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,560
How could Li Chengyin have such meticulous thinking?

449
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,490
He doesn't look too competitive to me.

450
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,090
Don't forget he won a lot of praise because of that battle at Danchi.

451
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,780
Order people to monitor his manor. Let's see what he is really planning.
