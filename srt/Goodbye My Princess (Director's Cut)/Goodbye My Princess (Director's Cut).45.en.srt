00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,030
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,570
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:45,270
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,950
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,550
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,070
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,200
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,110
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,910
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:24,720
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,920
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,210
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,800
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,670
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,050
[Episode 45]

17
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,930
Let go of me, Li Chengyin! Let go of me!

18
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,780
Fireworks.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,660
So beautiful.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,580
Put me down! Hurry!

21
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,220
Look over there! So beautiful!

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,250
So pretty.

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,880
In three days, it will be the Shangyuan Festival.
 (T/N: Or the Spring Lantern Festival, celebrated every 15th of the first lunar month)

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,210
Here in Shangjing, they will light fireworks beforehand. This is your first time seeing them, right?

25
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,020
You can't say that it's the first time. I experienced it before,

26
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,470
but I only heard the sound.

27
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,390
Yongniang told me that it was very pretty, but I didn't believe her.

28
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,870
So it seems, she was saying the truth.

29
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,830
Actually, it's my first time—

30
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,490
Impossible!

31
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,930
It's my first time watching fireworks with you.

32
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,960
It was always Miss Zhao by your side, right?

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,470
It's my first time finding these fireworks beautiful to look at.

34
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,920
Before, I found them too loud and lively.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,400
Just for these short moments of sparkle,

36
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,030
so much wealth was spent. So wasteful.

37
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,870
But right now, I truly suddenly feel

38
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,250
that a person does need a few moments of extravagance.

39
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,830
Watching this sky full of flowers blooming,

40
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,930
it seems possible that you can temporarily forget your pain.

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,170
Release that happiness in your heart, even if it's very minute.

42
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,890
Mingyue,

43
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,400
with you by my side, I am able to forget all worries. Not thinking about anything.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,540
Just like this, along with the blowing night wind,

45
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,740
enjoying the fireworks with you.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,370
Sometimes, I will think if you had cast a spell on me.

47
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,540
Turning an emperor like me who only knows to exert all effort in making my empire prosperous into

48
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,150
a person who only knows to covet for pleasure and happiness.

49
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,150
It was clearly Your Imperial Majesty who cast a spell on my little courtyard.

50
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,290
I've watched the fireworks here so many times.

51
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,330
But I never found them as pretty as they are today.

52
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,580
I will be casting another spell then. I'm going to

53
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,550
make you stay by my side forever.

54
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:46,590
I dare not ask for forever. Being able to guard by your side at this moment,

55
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,860
you don't know how grateful I am to the love that Heaven is showing me.

56
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,360
I am the son of Heaven. If I say there is a forever, then there will be.

57
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,310
I really hope that my parents

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,830
can also see such beautiful fireworks.

59
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,650
But the sky here is too far from Xi State.

60
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,840
They will never be able to see it.

61
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,190
You're missing home again?

62
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:34,280
I am. I think about it when I'm happy.

63
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,820
I think about it when I'm sad.

64
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,630
I think about how I can't share my happiness with them,

65
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,240
and how I can't lean on their shoulders

66
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,970
to cry when I'm sad.

67
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,150
Are you happy or sad now?

68
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,710
Happy.

69
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,290
What's wrong?

70
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,210
Your Imperial Majesty!

71
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,180
Mingyue.

72
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,760
Mingyue!

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,490
Sister Mingyue! Sister Mingyue...

74
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,320
Hurry! Hurry!

75
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,500
Mingyue—

76
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,340
Imperial Father!

77
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,200
Imperial Father!

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,600
Don't mind about me. Kill the assassin!

79
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,610
Li Chengyin, if I die today,

80
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,050
you will inherit my throne. I will never

81
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,530
surrender to a measly assassin.

82
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,830
Imperial Father...

83
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,390
- Shenwu Army!
- Here!

84
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,490
- Release the arrows!
- No!

85
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,240
You've also heard the words of His Imperial Majesty. In front of the might of the son of Heaven, no conditions of yours can be tolerated!

86
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,370
You also saw that the Shenwu Army has surrounded this place like a metal barrel.

87
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,030
If you still stubbornly resist,

88
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,300
thousands of arrows will pierce through your heart.

89
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,610
If you put down your sword now, I will spare your life.

90
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,570
If you are still worried, I can be your hostage.

91
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,920
Just release me once you're safe.

92
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,930
I'll do it! I'll be the hostage.

93
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,540
What are you doing?

94
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,730
Since you're an assassin, you surely know my importance.

95
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm not only the crown princess consort of this empire, but I'm also the ninth princess of Xi State.

96
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,270
I married over to maintain a good relationship between the two states.

97
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,970
Nonsense! Let go of my Imperial Father! I'll be your hostage!

98
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,860
Hence, if I die, Xi State will surely take up arms and rebel.

99
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,910
By then, the two states will be at war and the citizens plunged into misery.

100
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,310
His Imperial Majesty and His Imperial Highness will surely not allow that to happen.

101
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,500
Take me as a hostage and I guarantee that you can leave this place unscathed!

102
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,900
Shut up! Move back!

103
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,500
Think about it well. Aren't my words very reasonable?

104
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,430
Your Imperial Majesty!

105
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,540
Xiaofeng!

106
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,120
- Release the arrows~!
- Don't make rash moves!

107
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,720
You're dead now. Everything I said earlier is all a lie. I'm not that important.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,580
Release the arrows!

109
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,740
Assassin, you better listen! If you let her go now, I'll let you leave this place safely.

110
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,170
If you dare hurt my wife even a bit, I will surely slice you up into pieces!

111
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,460
I'll let you die in pain! I do as I say, just like this arrow!

112
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,020
Let her go!

113
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,710
Xiaofeng!

114
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,600
- Ceng Xian, listen to my command!
- I'm here!

115
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,530
Close the nine gates and search the whole city for the assassin and his accomplices!

116
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,020
- No negligence is allowable in this matter!
- Yes!

117
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,310
Return to the palace!

118
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,910
What's wrong? Why are you in a panic?

119
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,650
An assassination attempt happened to the emperor in Singing Jade Brothel.

120
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,790
Really? Come!

121
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,780
Old Master! Old Master! Something has happened! An urgent report!

122
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,900
What is it?

123
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,020
The emperor met an assassination attempt in Singing Jade Brothel.

124
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,720
Prepare the carriage. I must enter the palace immediately.

125
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,280
Yes.

126
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,160
Your Imperial Majesty...

127
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm here.

128
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,610
I was wrong.

129
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,090
I shouldn't have exposed you to danger.

130
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,030
You didn't do anything wrong. I'm the one at fault.

131
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm the one who approached you.

132
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,680
I fear that I will be breaking my promise.

133
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,230
The forever that you said... I won't be able to do it anymore.

134
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,060
Don't say such words. Nothing will happen to you.

135
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,500
Imperial physician.

136
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,420
Your Imperial Majesty, Miss Mingyue's wound is too deep and she lost a lot of blood.

137
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,040
What did you say?! If you all can't save her, just bring your head to me!

138
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,740
I will obey.

139
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,680
The emperor brought a woman from outside?

140
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,920
My Lady, please appease your anger. Your health is more important.

141
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,680
You better explain yourself clearly.

142
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,950
I heard that the woman was gravely injured.

143
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,400
All the imperial physicians have been called to go there.

144
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,490
All the imperial consorts are talking about this.

145
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,390
From returning to the palace until now, the emperor has been by that woman's side and hasn't gone anywhere.

146
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:45,930
My Lady, are you not going to check on that woman?

147
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,390
What's the rush? She has already entered the palace.

148
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,920
No need to worry that we will not have the time to play with her.

149
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,560
I failed in protecting you. May Imperial Father punish me.

150
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,750
Get up.

151
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,340
Thank you, Imperial Father.

152
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,160
No need to blame yourself. I know that you've done your best.

153
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,250
You also need not fret about Crown Princess Consort's situation.

154
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,820
Although what she said may not be all true,

155
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,730
it is enough to stun that assassin.

156
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,060
He will not make any rash moves for now.

157
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,010
Yes.

158
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,160
I have seen how filial Crown Princess Consort is.

159
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,250
I was also moved on how she loves you.

160
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:50,250
It is really rare to see a woman do such an act.

161
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,990
Having a woman like that by your side

162
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:58,300
is your great fortune. You must cherish it.

163
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,950
Imperial Father, Xiaofeng is reckless.

164
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,600
Yes, you are, too.

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,670
Earlier, you actually disobeyed my decree.

166
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,280
You wanted to be the hostage on my behalf?

167
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,750
Imperial Father, I admit my mistake. But the situation earlier was urgent—

168
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,770
I understand.

169
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,910
Actually, I can immediately see through

170
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,660
who is sincere towards me.

171
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,850
Yin'er, the human heart is the hardest thing to understand and the hardest thing to defend against.

172
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,500
But as people, the most important thing is

173
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,850
treating others sincerely.

174
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,020
I will deeply remember your teachings.

175
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,690
You must immediately find out the identity of that assassin.

176
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,930
The entire city of Shangjing is filled with murderous intent.

177
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,030
If you want to preserve yourself and obtain complete safety,

178
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,520
there's only one way.

179
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,320
That is to let your enemy

180
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,840
have not one bit of a chance.

181
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Your Imperial Majesty! Your Imperial Majesty!

182
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,690
I came late to protect you. Please forgive me.

183
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,530
Come. Come. Please rise.

184
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,300
Prime Minister Gao, thank you for your concerns.

185
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,570
When I heard that someone tried to assassinate you, I was so shocked that I lost half my soul.

186
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,900
Look, I am fine.

187
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,270
Your Imperial Majesty is greatly blessed. You would, of course, be all right.

188
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,300
I have already sent men to investigate the perpetrator.

189
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,200
Even if I have to turn Shangjing upside down, I will find him.

190
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,470
Okay. Prime Minister, thank you for your efforts.

191
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,780
There are still a lot of major state affairs that need your wisdom.

192
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,030
There is nothing more major than Your Imperial Majesty's safety.

193
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,640
How about this? Crown Prince, you take the lead in investigating the assassin.

194
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,440
Imperial Father...

195
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,590
What? You are not willing?

196
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,600
I will obey your command. I surely will not disappoint you.

197
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,860
I am also tired. You two go back first.

198
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,300
I will take my leave.

199
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,920
I... will take my leave.

200
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,050
Every place along the way that one can settle in must be carefully checked! Catch him alive!

201
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,280
Remember, do not let Crown Princess Consort get hurt.

202
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,270
Yes!

203
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,830
Set out!

204
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,820
Where is Gu Jian?

205
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,170
He has not yet returned.

206
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,540
Did you not promise me that it would be fail-proof? What is wrong with him?

207
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,290
Were there any mistakes?

208
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,960
We clearly agreed that he will take me as a hostage, yet he took Xiaofeng away instead!

209
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:06,180
Crown Prince, do not worry. Gu Jian will never hurt Xiaofeng. He has a sense of propriety.

210
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,010
He has a sense of propriety? I then want to ask him

211
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,200
if his sword was targeting Mingyue or my imperial father?

212
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,970
If he does things against command like this, how could I still trust him in the future?

213
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,480
He probably was muddled for a moment. I believe that he will be back as agreed.

214
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,170
Crown Prince, what is important now

215
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,090
is to let the emperor point the spearhead toward Gao Yuming.

216
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,540
My imperial father is already suspecting him. Everything is under our control.

217
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,970
Okay.

218
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,780
Crown Prince,

219
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,630
have you seen Mingyue? Is her injury bad?

220
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,170
The best imperial physicians in the palace are tending to her. Do not be too worried.

221
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,020
Okay.

222
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,440
I will give Gu Jian one more chance.

223
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,780
If he does not return Xiaofeng to me within 24 hours,

224
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,640
he is now my enemy.

225
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,110
What are you doing?

226
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,660
I'd rather starve to death than eat your food.

227
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,520
Before I starve to death I should eat a little, so I can be full when I die.

228
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,940
What are you sneering for?

229
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,730
Do you think I have terrible eating manners for a princess?

230
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,290
What does that have to do with you?

231
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:15,880
Let me tell you. You've got lousy luck for kidnapping me.

232
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,260
If my dad finds out, he will let the horses stomp you to a pulp.

233
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,770
Also, my imperial father, the current emperor. You know him, right?

234
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,530
Once the emperor gets mad, a thousand corpses will float and blood will flow like a river.

235
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,540
And the crown prince. Do you know what type of person the crown prince is? He will be the future emperor.

236
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,420
Let me tell you that he has a terrible temper.

237
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,790
He hates it the most when someone touches his people, especially his woman.

238
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:49,600
If you touch even a strand of my hair, you would be lucky if he just chopped you into eight pieces.

239
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,740
You have lousy luck. You have...

240
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,050
If you want to kill me, then go!

241
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,440
I'm telling you. Someone will definitely get revenge for me.

242
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,210
A'Du. A'Du will surely chop your head off.

243
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,280
She will use your skull to make my dad a wine bowl!

244
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,270
I also have an old lover. Peerless master.

245
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,080
His martial skills are amazing.

246
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,370
His sword skills are better than yours. Much faster. One move and you will be dead!

247
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,710
Wait a minute!!!

248
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:34,150
I have one more wish. Can you satisfy it?

249
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,800
Brother Assassin, you are a man of affection and faith.

250
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,740
I don't have much I'm reluctant to leave behind.

251
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,990
I'm just worried about my husband, Li Chengyin.

252
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,120
If I die,

253
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,000
he'll definitely marry a lot of other women

254
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,570
and easily forget about me.

255
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,980
But I like him so much, so how could I bear for him to forget me?

256
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,460
I have a personal belonging. Can you give it to him on my behalf?

257
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,790
I'm telling you. Give this item to him.

258
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,300
Tell him right before my death, I...

259
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,500
Since you're an assassin, you surely know my importance.

260
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,350
I'm not only the crown princess consort of this empire, I'm also the ninth princess of Xi State.

261
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,920
Take me as a hostage and I guarantee that you can leave this place unscathed!

262
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,260
Xiaofeng!

263
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,260
Release the arrows! You're dead now.

264
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,340
Everything I said earlier is all a lie.

265
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,650
I'm not that important.

266
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,200
Release the arrows!

267
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:37,600
Why are you so certain that I could bear to let you die?

268
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,190
A'Du, you cannot enter!

269
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,650
I will find her.

270
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,830
Because... I care about her the same way you do.

271
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,990
Wait.

272
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Do you know...

273
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,300
what the relationship is... between Xiaofeng and Gu Jian?

274
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,470
How is the investigation into the assassin going?

275
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,260
There's no progress yet.

276
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,370
That means you didn't check thoroughly.

277
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,790
Father, I have asked for information from the crown prince every day.

278
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,230
They don't have any clues either.

279
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,700
The crown prince wouldn't lie to me.

280
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,090
Why wouldn't he be lying to you?

281
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,180
He... Why would he lie to me?

282
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,650
Because our last name is Gao.

283
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:59,620
If you can't even think of this, then you are too simple-minded.

284
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,690
Son, let me remind you,

285
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,830
be cautious in everything you do.

286
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,240
You need to use your brain more and stop relying on me all the time.

287
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,540
I can't always be by your side.

288
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,950
Yes, I understand. You are saying this for my sake.

289
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,730
In your opinion, what is going on with the crown prince?

290
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,700
I think that the crown prince is still a bit too young.

291
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,160
Even though he wants to help the emperor,

292
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,230
he does not have enough experience.

293
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,190
Also, he should be happy that the crown princess consort is gone.

294
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,340
This way, he can be together with Zhao Sese.

295
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,930
The crown princess consort? The crown prince will surely try to save her.

296
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,700
This matter is linked to Xi State.

297
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,240
They shouldn't have let this situation deteriorate to this state because of their relationship issues.

298
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,190
The crown prince is surely very anxious right now.

299
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,330
No wonder he couldn't figure this out.

300
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,250
Even I find it odd

301
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,570
that someone went ahead of us to assassinate Mingyue

302
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,970
and even kidnapped the crown princess consort,

303
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,230
it looks suspicious.

304
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:10,180
Father, do you want to give some pointers to the crown prince?

305
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,030
That would be too inconsiderate of his pride. After all, he is the crown prince.

306
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,460
Let him do the investigation.

307
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,420
When he can't figure it out, he will eventually come to me.

308
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,160
But this time, His Imperial Majesty let the crown prince handle the investigation of this case.

309
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,150
It shows his trust in the crown prince.

310
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:36,390
I am worried that all the work Father has done these past few years might be wasted.

311
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,230
Once this crown prince's wings get stronger...

312
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,830
Wings are useless for a bird that is caged.

313
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,340
Is Mingyue awake?

314
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,430
Not yet.

315
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,740
Send a message to your sister. Tell her to watch the emperor and Mingyue closely.

316
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,040
Let us know immediately of any new development.

317
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,640
Yes.

318
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,600
You're back.

319
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,400
You're still awake at this time?

320
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,790
Is there any news about Xiaofeng?

321
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,420
Did Brother Chengyin blame you?

322
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,820
No, he didn't.

323
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,930
Are you blaming yourself?

324
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,320
Huh?

325
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,710
Xiaofeng will surely come back.

326
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,670
Brother Chengyin will definitely get her back.

327
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,760
Luoxi, I—

328
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,560
I made white fungus soup. It's still hot. I'll go get some for you.

329
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,350
Don't bother.

330
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,000
You're tired, too. Go and rest.

331
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,050
May the Moon Deity protect Crown Princess Consort from any harm and make her come back as soon as possible.

332
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,900
Even though the crown princess consort usually has an exaggerated opinion of her abilities,

333
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,480
has unacceptable etiquette, likes to eat and sleep, refuses to read books,

334
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,220
likes going out of the palace to play around, creates trouble here and there;

335
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,720
but she is kindhearted, treats people wholeheartedly, and has never had any thoughts of harming others.

336
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,480
At such a young age, she is thousands of miles away from home. She should have been a little carefree horse.

337
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,500
but instead, got trapped inside this palace. And now, she is brought into this dangerous situation.

338
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,790
Moon Deity, please have mercy and make sure she safely returns.

339
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,560
Related Lady of Excellence, please halt your steps.

340
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,030
Shi'en, why aren't you letting My Lady enter?

341
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,400
Replying to My Lady. His Imperial Highness gave orders that he is going to rest and will not see anyone.

342
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,650
Not even me?

343
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,030
His Imperial Highness said "no one."

344
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:24,400
Shi'en, are your eyes playing tricks on you? Look closely at who is standing in front of you.

345
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
Xiu'er!

346
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,270
But I just saw A'Du come out from there.

347
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,640
A'Du? Impossible, she didn't go inside. I stopped her.

348
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:44,200
Shi'en, I've never been stopped from entering the Magnificent Main Hall before.

349
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,060
Do you know what the consequences are if you stop me today?

350
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,210
My Lady, I am acting according to the orders of His Imperial Highness.

351
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,190
I will just put the lunch box inside and leave. I cannot even do that?

352
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,170
His Imperial Highness has already gone to bed.

353
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,900
Is there any news about the crown princess consort?

354
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,350
Replying to My Lady. His Imperial Highness instructed that

355
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,840
anything related to the crown princess consort is considered top secret. You should stop asking, My Lady.

356
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,440
Let's go!

357
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,450
Did you remember anything?

358
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:02,070
If I am really an assassin, is your last wish

359
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,430
really related to Li Chengyin?

360
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:18,800
Elder Cousin, the ninth princess and you are acquaintances?

361
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,770
We've known each other since she was still in Xi State.

362
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,640
You seem to care a lot about her.

363
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,200
Every one of our boys from Xi State are stronger than you! Do you think I care about marrying you

364
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,210
or being the crown prince consort? The person I like is

365
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,340
stronger than you by ten thousand times! You are not even as good as one strand of his hair!

366
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,500
If you let her go now, I'll let you leave this place safely. I do as I say, just like this arrow!

367
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:28,120
What is that? Ginger soup?

368
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,980
It's you?

369
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:12,190
You are the assassin? You are the assassin?!

370
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,790
I will not hurt you.

371
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,550
Then, why did you throw me into the river? Did you want me to drown?!

372
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,500
Do you remember anything?

373
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,850
What could I have remembered? Why did you hurt Sister Mingyue? Why did you hold the emperor hostage? Why did you bring me here?!

374
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,970
You got near me just because you wanted to assassinate the emperor...

375
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,900
All this is a big conspiracy, isn't it?

376
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,040
You lied to me! Gu Jian, you used me.

377
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,310
And I still treated you as my friend.

378
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,360
I must be blind!

379
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,590
Xiaofeng!

380
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,660
Let me go!

381
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,460
I didn't use you.

382
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,600
You didn't? Vow that you didn't!

383
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,610
Yes, I did make use of you before.

384
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,250
Gu Jian, I never expected that you were this kind of person.

385
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,450
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

386
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,010
Xiaofeng!

387
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,200
Let go of me!

388
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,930
I never expected that you would be drawn into this matter. I had never wanted to hurt you. Please believe me.

389
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,380
Believe you? How do you want me to believe you?

390
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,300
This matter is too complicated. There's no way I can explain everything to you.

391
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,030
From the very beginning to the end, all I wanted was to ensure your complete safety.

392
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,420
Good. Ensure my complete safety. Then, let me leave now. Send me home!

393
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,260
Go home? Return to the Eastern Palace?

394
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,030
Xiaofeng, don't go back. Leave that palace and that person.

395
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,480
I won't!

396
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,680
Believe me that this is for your own good. Don't be like me and get drawn into this trouble.

397
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,900
What "trouble?" What "for my good?"

398
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,790
What are you talking about? I don't understand anything at all.

399
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,490
Why would you rather trust someone who has hurt you and not me?!

400
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:17,480
Who did you say has hurt me? Are you talking about Li Chengyin?

401
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,190
Say it. Say it!

402
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,820
If you won't tell me, then you're lying to me!

403
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,060
Has Gu Jian been here?!

404
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,530
No.

405
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,490
What does he want?! Twenty-four hours have passed!

406
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,750
Your Imperial Highness, you are coming here so frequently. I'm afraid this is not suitable.

407
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,100
At a time like this, it is better to be cautious.

408
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,080
Cautious? How do you want me to be cautious? He took Xiaofeng away!

409
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,420
And he isn't contacting you or me. What secret is he harboring that can't be told?!

410
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,230
Tell me.

411
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:27,760
What is his relationship with Xiaofeng?

412
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,330
What are you concealing from me?

413
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,690
I did lie to you before.

414
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,240
But I have already paid the price for it.

415
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,890
But I'm not lying to you now and will never do so in the future.

416
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,800
Li Chengyin is not worthy for you to sacrifice your life for. He is not worthy of you to risk being a hostage.

417
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,740
If last night, I was a real assassin, would he just allow me to take you away just like that?

418
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,140
You are not a real assassin.

419
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,930
What is Li Chengyin's relation to this matter? Tell me.

420
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,370
There's no way I can explain it to you.

421
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,320
Whatever it is, Li Chengyin is not as simple as what you think.

422
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,890
He is the crown prince, the future emperor.

423
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,010
He is from a palace that is cold and filled with deception.

424
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,750
He is the future son of Heaven.

425
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,200
Because of the throne, the country, he can make use of anybody.

426
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,900
Your Imperial Highness, you are too anxious.

427
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,200
Where this matter is concerned, you are worrying too much.

428
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,550
No matter what happens,

429
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,520
Gu Jian is no longer worthy of our trust.

430
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,850
Are you saying he's using me?

431
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,280
It was I who told you to hold me hostage.

432
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,180
It was I who wanted to be under your sword.

433
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,750
How could he have known what I wanted to do?

434
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,400
Why can't you trust me?

435
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,360
To you, I am an assassin, a stranger, a villain.

436
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,030
Have you really forgotten everything about me?

437
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,580
Do you remember this?

438
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,760
Of course, I do.

439
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,600
No, not while here in Shangjing,

440
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,380
but in Xi State, when we were in Xi State.

441
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,180
In Xi State, you carried it with you all the time.

442
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,880
Whenever you were in danger, you'd shoot this whistling arrow towards the sky

443
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,570
and I'd appear to protect you.

444
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,520
Teacher!

445
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,190
Do you remember it?

446
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,470
You can remember it now?

447
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,130
I don't know.

448
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,550
- I can't remember who you are.
- You...

449
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,930
You can't remember who I am?

450
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,540
- I don't know who you are!
- Let me go!
- How could you not remember who I am?

451
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,970
- Don't you remember who I am?!
- Let me go!

452
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,420
- I don't know who you are!
- Think carefully!

453
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,040
- Let go of me!
- Think carefully about who I am!

454
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,380
- Let me go!
- Think!

455
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,320
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

456
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,220
Did I wake you up?

457
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,930
Bowing to Your Imperial Majesty. The five-grain porridge which Imperial Physician An ordered is ready.

458
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,370
Come, put it here.

459
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,820
Yes.

460
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,300
Come.

461
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,510
Here.

462
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,850
What happened? Does the wound hurt?

463
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,590
I am just feeling touched. It is said that it's difficult for the moon to be round,

464
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,570
and hard for beautiful matters in the world to be fulfilled.

465
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,420
Your Imperial Majesty, would you be afraid that

466
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,240
all these are not real, too?

467
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,190
I am the son of Heaven. Every word and action that I take

468
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:40,730
are witnessed by the tens of thousands of citizens under Heaven. How can it not be real?

469
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,800
Look. Am I not tangibly by your side now?

470
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,030
You saved me. You are also my most beloved woman.

471
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:54,700
Not only do I want you to come to the palace to convalesce,

472
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,050
I also want to officially marry you and make you my imperial consort.

473
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,530
No matter what happens, I am here. Do not be afraid.

474
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,900
Sun Er, think carefully about it again.

475
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,790
What did the madam of Singing Jade Brothel tell you at that time?

476
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,730
Replying to My Lord. I remember everything clearly.

477
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,980
After that madam collected the money, she passed the items to me.

478
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,200
I even asked her if she knew about Mingyue's background.

479
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,980
She said that when she bought her, she was only around four or five years old.

480
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,910
According to the rules, she was washed thoroughly and given a change of clothes.

481
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,860
She then kept aside the clothes that she initially wore. As to any other matters, she doesn't know about them.

482
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,510
Has no one touched that parcel all these years?

483
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,140
My Lord, the madam said that these things were kept until the girls became famous,

484
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,870
so they can use them to bargain for a good price with anyone who wants to redeem them.

485
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,620
They are normally kept in the storehouse. No one has gone to look at them.

486
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,280
- You can go now.
- Yes.

487
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,940
When Mingyue was bought by Singing Jade Brothel, she was only five to six years old.

488
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,880
I don't think she understands anything yet.

489
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,160
Also, that blood poem was deliberately placed in the inner garment and was difficult to detect.

490
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,260
I believe that brothel madam must have taken the items after she bought the child.

491
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,730
Since she is illiterate and saw that these things were not of any value,

492
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,490
she kept them away without caring about it.

493
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:32,740
Then, Mingyue wouldn't have known her own birth history.

494
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,970
Furthermore, she has secretly been in contact with the emperor for such a long time. If there is any conspiracy,

495
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,460
she would not have waited until today.

496
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,470
Father, does it mean that we are now safe?

497
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,860
The emperor is with her all the time. What can we do?

498
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,690
She is just a girl from the brothel. How long can the emperor be enchanted with her?

499
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,420
When he is tired of her and throws her aside, this person

500
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,890
definitely can't be kept around when that time comes.

501
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,210
I understand.

502
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,620
Also, Sun Er must be gotten rid of without any trace, in order not to leave any future trouble.

503
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,880
Yes.

504
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,590
Send a message to your little sister. Tell her that she must bear with it these few days.

505
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,590
Don't think that because Mingyue doesn't look like a threat to us,

506
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,170
she can lose control and get into a jealous fight with her.

507
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,570
Yes.

508
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:38,870
Anything is possible since she deliberately got close to the emperor.

509
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,670
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

510
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,840
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

511
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,330
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

512
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,690
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

513
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,650
♫ A long dream ♫

514
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:30,410
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

515
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:38,910
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

516
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:47,110
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

517
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:54,150
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

518
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,550
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

519
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,420
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

520
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:08,030
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

521
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,410
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫♫

522
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,170
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

523
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,050
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

524
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:23,540
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

525
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,560
♫ Time reverses ♫

526
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,780
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

527
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:37,700
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

528
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:44,460
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

529
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:52,000
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

530
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,670
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

531
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,840
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

532
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,230
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

533
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,600
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

534
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,620
♫ A long dream ♫

535
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,390
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

536
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:28,990
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

537
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,310
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

538
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,130
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

539
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:40,020
