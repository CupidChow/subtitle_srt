00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,020
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,640
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,290
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,580
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,970
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:57,560
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,150
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,200
♫  so what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,960
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,590
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,820
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:39,140
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,930
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

15
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,800
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,660
[Episode 21]

17
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,050
A'Du!

18
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,150
Miss A'Du, don't sleep on the roof anymore.

19
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,900
If the guards mistake you as an assassin, then your life is over.

20
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,610
Also, the weather outside is so cold.

21
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,150
What happens if you catch a cold?

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,110
Your Highness, His Imperial Majesty is making his way towards the Longevity and Benevolence Palace.

23
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,630
Your Highness...

24
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,130
Ninth Princess.

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,000
I need you to take a closer look at the contents of this book.

26
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,860
This isn't right.

27
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,560
Neither is this.

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
It is correct.

29
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
No, it's not!

30
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,380
Look here! Look at what's written here.

31
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,160
Not even a word is accurate. No, no! You have to change it.

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,340
This is all correct.

33
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,480
Ninth Princess, can you even recognize all of our Central Plains characters?

34
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,320
Are you going to correct it or not?

35
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,050
I won't.

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,780
My grandson, you are busy with court affairs.

37
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,070
It is not necessary to visit me this often.

38
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,140
No matter how busy I am, I still have to pay my respects to you, Grandmother.

39
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,070
Besides, there aren't many court affairs these days, and I have the crown prince helping me take care of things,

40
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,080
so I have some free time on hand.

41
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,520
Your crown prince is quite sensible.

42
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,000
He is able to unburden his imperial father.

43
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,770
Grandmother, how is your health these days?

44
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,050
Great, I'm doing great.

45
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,710
The ninth princess comes over to my palace often.

46
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,590
It's very lively.

47
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,510
I feel very energetic lately.

48
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,330
That's great.

49
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,600
The ninth princess is a straightforward and interesting girl.

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,790
She has been editing the Annals of the Western Border with Fifth these past days.

51
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:02,270
How are they getting along? Is everything going smoothly?

52
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,560
It's going very smoothly. Speaking of him, let me tell you.

53
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,960
I've heard from the eunuchs of Luminous Benevolence Hall

54
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,610
that Fifth has been more hardworking than your scholar-officials.

55
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,670
And you may not even believe this, but he and the ninth princess have been looking through the contents together.

56
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,370
He said that the ninth princess is from the Western Border.

57
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,570
If the content in this book

58
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,880
is approved by a person from the Western Border,

59
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,850
then it makes it a truly wonderful book.

60
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,590
Looks like the ninth princess is helpful to your fifth prince.

61
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,100
Fifth is really a promising lad.

62
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,070
They are really getting along very well.

63
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,140
- Come here with me!
- Let me go!

64
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,550
It's Ninth Princess and Prince Yi arguing.

65
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,660
I'm not letting go!

66
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,240
Let's go then! Who is afraid of whom?

67
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,600
Imperial Father. Imperial Great Grandmother.

68
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,950
Your Majesty. Imperial Great Grandmother.

69
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,530
I want to ask you two to be my judge today.

70
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,020
Why are you two arguing so early in the morning?

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,100
What would you like me to judge?

72
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,800
It's this.

73
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,830
In this Annals of the Western Border, there are a lot of places that are wrong.

74
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,730
But when I told Prince Yi to correct it, he refused.

75
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,250
Imperial Father. Imperial Great Grandmother. The content is according to the ancient records

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,520
and court files from the Western Border Protectorate General Office.

77
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,950
It cannot be changed just because Ninth Princess says so.

78
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,710
Those are ancient books and official records of your Li Empire.

79
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,420
Of course, it will only have positive input on your state.

80
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,910
Our Li Empire is a heavenly country that other kingdoms must pay homage to. That's the truth.

81
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,230
Why would we need to say good things about ourselves?

82
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,430
That doesn't mean you can say bad things about us!

83
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,390
Even though Xi State is a small country, it is still prosperous and peaceful.

84
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,190
Have you tried our grape wine?

85
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,820
Have you seen the colored glass dome of our palace?

86
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,090
Have you heard our hichiriki and reed pipe play music?

87
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,420
Have you heard it? You haven't!

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,890
Then what makes you think you can call our Xi State a barbaric place?

89
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,910
I insist on writing that. What are you going to do about it?

90
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,750
I don't agree.

91
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,260
The poetry and songs from our empire have an everlasting reputation.

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,380
There are unaccountable skilled workers and craftsmen.

93
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,790
Using our casting production as an example, the Xi State can never surpass us even in a hundred years.

94
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,580
What a joke! Your metal casting skills?

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,580
Those copper coins of yours are even of variable sizes.

96
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,710
They couldn't even compare with our flat silvers.

97
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,560
Xiaofeng,

98
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,770
this book is based on an individual's experience.

99
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:53,260
If you think Prince Yi is biased on some things, you can just correct him.

100
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,120
You don't have to get too serious.

101
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,220
Being serious is good!

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,850
It's quite interesting when two people get serious.

103
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,900
But you don't need to argue; keep it harmonious.

104
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,630
Great Grandmother, I'm speaking the truth.

105
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,420
I saw it myself!

106
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,070
If Your Majesty and Great Grandmother don't believe me,

107
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,880
I...I'll go look for two copper coins now!

108
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,750
Wait for me!

109
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,050
- Do you have any coins? Let me borrow a couple.
- I don't have any.

110
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,250
- Do you have any copper coins?
- I don't have any.

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,420
- Princess.
- Do you have any copper coins? Lend me two of them.

112
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,680
I've lent someone all my coins.

113
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,490
Does anyone have any copper coins?

114
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,810
- No, we don't.

115
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,920
No one has them?

116
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,780
Sisters!

117
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,170
If the other Her Highnesses find out that we aren't respecting authority,

118
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,090
and keep joking around with the future crown princess consort, we'll all be in big trouble.

119
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,800
- Understand?
- Understood.

120
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,390
Let's get back to work.

121
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,530
You've just earned a great merit, yet I made you stay inside the palace to edit books.

122
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,940
It's really aggrieving you.

123
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,090
Imperial Father, I don't feel wronged. I just want to do the job right.

124
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,580
Even if it's just editing books, if I take it seriously, there is a fun side to it.

125
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,520
Xiaofeng, did you find any evidence?

126
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,970
No.

127
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,830
I usually don't get any allowance, so I don't have any copper coins.

128
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,960
And then I went to borrow some, but they didn't have any either.

129
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,880
Ninth Princess, are you sad about not getting any allowance money?

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,210
Don't worry. Come to my palace tomorrow.

131
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,460
I'll give you a lot of golden leaves. You can exchange it for whatever you want.

132
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,260
- Great Grandmother, I didn't mean—
- I'm afraid that someone doesn't have any evidence so they're just making excuses.

133
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:32,430
Your Imperial Majesty. Great Grandmother. Can you give me two more days? I'll definitely find evidence.

134
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,410
All right. All right. It's up to you.

135
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,190
Three red jade bracelets, one set of a wishful jade pillow,

136
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,200
one golden hairpin, five hairpins adorned with pearls,

137
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,730
one pair of pearls, ten goblets of sandalwood,

138
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,090
one pair of amber enamel carvings!

139
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,790
Yongniang.

140
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,120
Thank you, Eunuch Wu.

141
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,440
Your Highness, the crown prince really cares about you.

142
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,370
He sent you so many things!

143
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,880
What's so good about that? I can't even find a place to put my feet down.

144
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,670
Yongniang!

145
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,440
Yongniang!

146
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:38,460
Can you help me account for these things and then send them to the storage room?

147
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,740
Aren't you going to take a look and then keep what you like?

148
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,820
No, I'm a little tired. I'll take a walk in the backyard.

149
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:57,050
Yongniang, remember, you have to personally account for them

150
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,270
one by one, and then record it in here.

151
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,390
I don't trust other people.

152
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,450
Then, you can go do your work now.

154
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,860
Good! Good!

155
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,020
- Good!
- Young Lord,

156
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,460
come take a look.

157
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,380
It's all new.

158
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,480
A'Du, with this, don't even say a couple of copper coins,

159
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,440
we can even get a couple of carts of them.

160
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's go.

161
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,240
- Wow! Wow!
- Again! Good!

162
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,680
Not accepted.

163
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,550
Shopkeeper, this is gold! 100% gold!

164
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,930
Can I not even pawn it for ten pieces of copper coins?

165
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,770
I won't accept it. We won't do business with you.

166
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,760
No, you are open for business. Why won't you do business?

167
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,610
Young Lord, do you think I'm dumb.

168
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,720
This cup was made by the government.

169
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,270
Forget about pawning it. Even if you give it to me, I wouldn't take it.

170
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,110
From which eye can you tell that it was government made?

171
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,360
I... can tell from both of my eyes.

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Hurry up and leave. I'm telling you.

173
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,700
Even if you go around the whole East Market,

174
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,340
there won't be a pawn shop that would accept this gold cup.

175
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,250
Even if it's government made, why can't you pawn it?

176
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,150
Young Lord, originally I wanted to save you some face.

177
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,960
But you are too obstinate.

178
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,670
All right, I will tell you.

179
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,170
This court-made, gold cup is a reward from the emperor.

180
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,660
The recipient is either a royal family member or a high court official.

181
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,290
Let me ask. Who dares change His Imperial Majesty's reward for some copper coins?

182
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,090
Young Lord, from how you are dressed and your speaking manner,

183
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,230
you do not look like a thief.

184
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,410
Most likely you took an imperial reward from your home

185
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,370
to exchange here for money to use.

186
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,090
Your capable of pawning it, but I'm too scared to accept it.

187
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,000
Hurry up and leave. Stop preventing me from doing business.

188
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,660
If you don't believe me, go somewhere else. Okay?

189
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,880
Hurry up and leave. Leave. Leave.

190
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,950
I originally thought I could exchange this for a large sum of copper coins.

191
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,320
Now, really good.

192
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,730
It wasn't easy to find the chance to sneak out, but we're unable to get any copper coins.

193
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,630
There's still Mi Luo. Let's go.

194
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,320
Gu Jian?

195
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,890
Do you have any copper coins?

196
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,450
We are closed today?

197
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,640
Whenever you are looking for someone urgently, you definitely will not find the person.

198
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,960
It was like this since ancient times.

199
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,730
How do you not know that she's not here today? Don't you come here frequently?

200
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,830
Recently, I owe her a lot of money. I would rather avoid her as much as possible.

201
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,210
What should I do then?

202
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,760
You're just like your old self. You haven't changed at all.

203
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,000
I told you you were stupid, and you still have to show me how stupid you are.

204
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,860
Could you even exchange that for money?

205
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,650
You tell me what to do then.

206
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,020
What are you doing?

207
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,740
Now, it's not a gold cup used by the royal family.

208
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,190
It's only a few pieces of gold.

209
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,620
We'll start from here and exchange one at every shop.

210
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,510
I've packaged all the cloth that you wanted.

211
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,840
- Thank you!
- Here's your change.

212
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,280
Here.

213
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,370
Wow! This much! Thank you, shopowner.

214
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,050
No problem! No problem! Please come often!

215
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,670
Okay. Let's go.

216
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,590
It could be exchanged for this much!

217
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,260
Thanks!

218
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,400
How are you going to thank me?

219
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,060
I spent all day exchanging coins with you.

220
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,340
We must thank you indeed for running around with us all day. I owe you a favor.

221
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,490
If you need anything later, I'll definitely help you.

222
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,820
I don't need you to owe me a favor.

223
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,990
You should've said something sooner.

224
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,390
I feel relieved since you spoke,

225
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,570
so from now on, if I trouble you again, I will compensate you.

226
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,500
Fine.

227
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,860
Thanks.

228
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,060
A'Du, Gu Jian isn't a bad person.

229
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,990
Let's go.

[Weipin Pavilion]

231
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,100
For the money I owe you, I'm paying it with this.

232
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,320
Did you rob a pawnshop?

233
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,990
This is for the wine money.

234
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,900
For the change, it's for my future wine and room charges.

235
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,930
What kind of attitude is that? You think you're better because you have some money?!

236
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,290
Let me tell you! If it wasn't for this young lady...

237
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,040
This lady boss...

238
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,930
This old lady pitying you, who else in Shangjing City would be willing to take a troublesome fellow like you in?!

239
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,300
At least, he's conscientious.

240
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,070
Your Imperial Majesty and Imperial Great Grandmother, please take a look.

241
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,820
Xiaofeng, where did you get all these coins?

242
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,300
Great Grandmother, I'm at fault.

243
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,040
I snuck out of the palace to find these.

244
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,710
But this was to prove that everything I said in front of His Imperial Majesty last time was true.

245
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,790
Please take a look. These are the 1000 coins I gathered from the market.

246
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,430
Four hundred pieces of them matched the coin that Prince Yi showed me before.

247
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,630
They were finely crafted. But the remaining six hundred pieces are different.

248
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,110
Even though the thickness differed only slightly, the craftsmanship was slightly lowered,

249
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,320
the writing only slightly worse.

250
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,690
But if you look carefully, you can still tell the difference.

251
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,200
If Prince Yi doesn't believe me, you can look over every single one yourself.

252
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,790
Prince Yi, what do you think about this?

253
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,290
Replying to Imperial Father.

254
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,290
I also heard rumors of people privately creating copper coins.

255
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,000
But I didn't expect that it was to such a large extent.

256
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,200
If it's really just as what Ninth Princess said, the counterfeit money is twice more than the government made coins.

257
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,510
I'm afraid that... this will be a disaster for the imperial court.

258
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,480
Continue speaking.

259
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,680
Your Imperial Majesty, please look.

260
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,310
Base on quality and weight, these private coins are very similar to official coins.

261
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,550
I think that an ordinary common folk workshop won't be able to create these.

262
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,030
We must investigate this matter,

263
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,270
but we can't publicize it.

264
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,650
Prince Yi,

265
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,190
you go investigate this privately. Report back to me directly.

266
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,250
Yes, Imperial Father.

267
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,410
Your Imperial Majesty, this started because of me

268
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,490
and I wanted to know the truth, too.

269
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,290
So, I would like Your Imperial Majesty to permit me to investigate it as well.

270
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,840
All right. I'll allow it.

271
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,720
Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.

272
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,190
I've been in Shangjing for a long time,

273
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,460
but this is the first time that I've been able to leave through the palace door properly.

274
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,160
Imperial Great Grandmother has allowed you to come out and play.

275
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,870
Isn't that exactly what you wanted? Go look around.

276
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,160
Are you buying that for Miss Zhao?

277
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,930
No, I'm just looking around.

278
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,180
Miss Zhao is so refined and beautiful. You must really like her.

279
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,300
- Good!
- Good!

280
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,410
Good!

281
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,840
I actually envy you and her.

282
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,140
Envy?

283
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,450
Yes.

284
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,660
I thought that there wouldn't be true love in the Li Empire imperial family.

285
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,820
Royal Brother is a man of striking appearance. You will also like him.

286
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,280
Like? I am more likely to be afraid of him.

287
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,050
Royal Brother holds the position of crown prince.

288
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,730
He does normally seem too strict and serious.

289
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,760
After interacting with him more, you'll get used to it.

290
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,150
You are his little brother. Of course, you would talk about him nicely.

291
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,090
If I was your friend or little sister,

292
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,590
would you still want me to marry him?

293
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,820
Nevermind, it's pointless to ask you.

294
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,980
Anyway, it doesn't matter if I want to or not.

295
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,450

00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,850
Why are we here?

299
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,020
Since we don't have any leads, we might as well pray to Buddha.

300
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,720
It might even help.

301
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
You're kidding me, right?

302
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,040
One shouldn't lie in front of Buddha.

303
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,960
If there's Buddha in your heart, how sure are you that Buddha would not show you everything?

What are you looking at?

328
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,510
Do these Buddha statues look like they're made out of copper?

329
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,060
Yes.

330
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,910
These two days, I've checked all the documents of the Ministry of Revenue.

331
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,720
Every year, Li Empire produces less than 150,000 kilograms of copper.

332
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,860
All the production and uses are recorded in detail.

333
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,620
There are also records of the copper used for coins.

334
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,800
Ever since Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas was built,

335
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,110
other than approximately 50,000 kilograms of copper being used on copper coins,

336
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:59,270
the rest are used for casting the Buddha statues.

337
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,760
But if according to what you've just said,

338
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,070
Li Empire's annual copper production is only around 150,000 kilograms,

339
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,770
of which 50,000 kilograms are used for making the copper coins.

340
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,940
But currently, there are twice as much privately made copper coins than government made ones flowing in the market.

341
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,060
That means the private coin copper is about 100,000 kilograms.

342
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,840
How could there still be copper left to craft these Buddha statues?

343
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,290
Could it be that the output of private copper mining is more than that of official mines?

344
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,970
That's not right.

345
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,100
Owning a copper mine is a crime that could cause you to be beheaded.

346
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,710
150,000 kilograms of copper output.

347
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,800
50,000 kilograms for making official coins.

348
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,030
100,000 kilograms of copper were used for private coin production.

349
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,600
Then, wouldn't the copper used for these statues appear out of thin air?

350
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,950
Or maybe...

351
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,500
the copper used to make the counterfeit coins was the one that appeared out of nowhere.

352
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,690
Prince Yi.

353
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,950
Ninth Princess.

354
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,650
Elder Cousin.

355
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,380
Why did the two of you have the interest to come to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas today?

356
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,480
Ninth Princess heard that Buddhism is popular in the capital,

357
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,810
so she wanted to come and burn some incense and visit Buddha.

358
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,440
If Ninth Princess wants to visit Buddha,

359
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,810
why didn't you ask the crown prince to accompany you,

360
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:03,900
but instead, secretly come here wearing men's clothing?

361
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,690
Whether the crown prince accompanies me or not,

362
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,510
how is it your business, Official Li?

363
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,420
Elder Cousin, when Ninth Princess was speaking of this matter,

364
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,200
I happened to be in Longevity and Benevolence Palace paying my respects to Imperial Great Grandmother.

365
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,860
Great Grandmother said that Ninth Princess was getting very stifled because of staying in the palace every day.

366
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,560
So she asked me to take her out for a visit.

367
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,360
Wearing men's clothing is also just for convenience.

368
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,770
Is that so?

369
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,510
Otherwise, what does Elder Cousin think it is?

370
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,650
Should I report everything to you?

371
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,620
You spoke too seriously. That is not my meaning.

372
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,980
Hurry up and leave quickly.

373
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,000
Go, faster!

374
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,140
- Elder Cousin, we will take our leave now.
- All right.

375
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,960
- 1, 2, 3, move!
 - Let's go.

376
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,100
Hurry!

377
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,380
One, two, use your energy!

378
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,880
- 1, 2, 3!
- Come, be careful!

379
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,840
[Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas]

380
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,960
You shouldn't have knocked on the statue in front of Li Yan today.

381
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,210
Logically speaking, for a large Buddha statue like that, the interior should be empty.

382
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,100
But when I knocked on it earlier, it sounded heavy.

383
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,790
Seems like it is solid inside.

384
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,920
They must've used a different material to make a fake one,

385
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,730
then painted over with copper powder on the outside.

386
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,560
- You seem to know everything clearly.
- Of course.

387
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,640
I am not ignorant like you think I am.

388
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,250
Since Li Yan supervises this work, he must be involved.

389
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,730
Let's report this to Your Majesty quickly.

390
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,880
Let's capture him. I am sure we can get the truth out of him.

391
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,650
- No!
- Why?

392
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,460
You shouldn't rush this.

393
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,520
You can't say anything conclusive just based on knocking on the Buddha statue.

394
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,730
If these statues are not made of copper, then someone must've changed all that copper into coins.

395
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,420
We have to find the location that they make these private coins first.

396
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,160
That will be enough evidence to prove that Li Yan is making fake coins.

397
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,150
You shouldn't be too anxious yet.

398
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,560
All right then, but you need to hurry.

399
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:31,470
I am afraid if they do something to conceal this, then it will get more complicated.

400
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,920
All right.

401
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,500
But you need to promise me that you will not report to Imperial Great Grandmother and Imperial Father on your own.

402
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,870
Don't worry. This matter was discovered by the both of us.

403
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:43,520
I will not steal your credit.

404
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,720
All of you, leave now.

405
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,310
Did something urgent happen?

406
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,170
Fifth went to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas today.

407
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,590
He said he was decreed by Grand Empress Dowager to accompany Ninth Princess in paying respect to Buddha.

408
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,630
Did he make any strange actions at the temple?

409
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,390
None. Fifth seemed very unwillingly to go there.

410
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:29,140
But that Ninth Princess kept circling around and looking.

411
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,840
Ninth Princess?

412
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,160
What did she look at?

413
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,820
She seemed very curious about the copper statues.

414
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,360
Our newly made big Buddha statue just happened to have been delivered at that time.

415
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,910
She touched the statue and also knocked on it.

416
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,190
She knocked on the statue?

417
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,510
Yes, she did knock on it. But afterward, she walked away.

418
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,980
On her face, there wasn't any shocked expression.

419
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,990
Immediately send someone to check what Ninth Princess has been up to lately.

420
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,940
Who did she interact with? Also, watch Fifth closely, too.

421
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,860
I just fear that their trip to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas was not a sudden plan.

422
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,010
All right.

423
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,970
Also, tidy up the matters at Tongchang immediately.

424
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:11,230
If there are any slight occurrences, you don't need to report and just close it down to avoid any information leaking.

425
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,500
[Embracing the Moon Pavilion]

426
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,460
Greetings, Ninth Princess.

427
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,620
His Highness gave instructions that since the weather is cold today, we don't need to write the book.

428
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,820
The literary officials are not here yet.

429
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,400
I didn't come for that matter.

430
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,440
Ninth Princess, Your Highness is no longer here in the palace.

431
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,020
He has already gone back to his manor.

432
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,880
He is not here? When did he leave?

433
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,820
He left about two... Wrong, one hour ago.

434
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,550
- That early in the morning?
- Right.

435
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,250
All right. I know it. Leave.

436
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,940
Yes.

437
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,380
I just knew it! You were inside the palace! Why are you hiding from me?

438
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,910
I've seen dumb ones, but never seen one as dumb like you.

439
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,570
You're still not assisting me up?

440
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,220
Hurry and get me up.

441
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,660
Wait. Wait.

442
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,510
You twisted your ankle?

443
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,380
Come, I will carry you.

444
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,260
Hurry up.

445
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,580
Why were you hiding from me?

446
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,550
I am asking you a question.

447
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,590
It's been three days since we came back from the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

448
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,300
Why haven't you still reported this to His Imperial Majesty what we found out that day?

449
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,550
Up to when are you going to wait?

450
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,530
Say something.

451
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,450
I am speaking with you. Are you deaf?

452
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,010
Be gentler. Gentler.

453
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,320
Gentler.

454
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,510
No, he... really wasn't here earlier.

455
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,740
What are you doing?

456
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:02,780
Are you going to hit me with a snowball while I am hurt?

457
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,690
Ice pack.

458
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:15,810
Gentle. Gentle.

459
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,690
Shi'en, you go put the scrolls back quietly. Don't let the others know.

460
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,850
Yes.

461
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,720
What scrolls?

462
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,040
Is it those account books from the Ministry of Revenue?

463
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,820
You can't return those! They are for His Imperial Majesty to look at!

464
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,640
What I told you before was only the account books, not real evidence.

465
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,750
You are only inferring. They don't mean anything.

466
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,640
How is it inferring? We saw it with our own eyes.

467
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,960
Let me ask you.

468
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,010
Do you have evidence to show that just because the Buddha statues are suspicious,

469
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,790
they are already related to the counterfeit coins?

470
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,440
In our empire, Li Yan is an heir apparent to the elder prince's noble title. If you report him to His Imperial Majesty without hard evidence,

471
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,800
that's slander.

472
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,430
You are making me so angry.

473
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,990
It was Grand Empress Dowager and His Imperial Majesty who commanded us to investigate. It's an imperial decree.

474
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,380
In addition, the account books are evidence. Show it to His Imperial Majesty.

475
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,230
Imperial matters are not that simple.

476
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,990
Without any hard evidence, everything is inference. Do you understand?

477
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,510
If you won't go say it, I will go.

478
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,020
Stand still.

479
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,310
Do you know that those with loose tongues in the palace do not live long?

480
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,860
In whatever you do, you must protect yourself.

481
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,580
Do you hear me?!

482
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,990
Sit down!

483
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,700
All right.

General Pei—

502
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,230
Fortunately, you came.

503
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,390
Later on, help me carry him back to his room.

This person, when he is awake, he can walk on the roof and through the walls.

505
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,870
But after getting drunk, he's possessed by a drunken cat.

506
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,830
Say, he wasn't like this before, right?

507
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:44,490
What about you? Are you always so quiet?

508
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,550
Yes.

509
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,490
What are you looking at?

510
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,250
I'm looking at you.

00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,410
I want to see when you are going to smile, General Quiet!

513
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,220
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

514
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,330
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

515
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,970
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

516
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:04,350
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

517
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,190
♫ A long dream ♫

518
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,930
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

519
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:19,090
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

520
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:27,730
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

521
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:34,780
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

522
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,200
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

523
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,000
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

524
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,860
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

525
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,970
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

526
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,690
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

527
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,660
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

528
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,230
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

529
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:08,170
♫ Time reverses ♫

530
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,390
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

531
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:18,390
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

532
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,020
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

533
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:31,970
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

534
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,240
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

535
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,440
