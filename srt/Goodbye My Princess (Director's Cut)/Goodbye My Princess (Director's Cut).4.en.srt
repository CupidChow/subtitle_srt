00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,210
[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,030
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,340
Minister Gao, what do you think?

4
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,330
I think although the Danchi people are daring and haughty,

5
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,500
being suppressed by the Li Empire in recent years, they do have some fears.

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,010
The assassination of the crown prince happened so suddenly. There's something peculiar about it.

7
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:11,120
Dispatching troops hastily before finding out the truth

8
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,500
is just too rash.

9
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,370
Your Imperial Majesty,

10
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,600
the Danchi people are naturally warmongers.

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,300
At this time, if we don't strike at them head-on,

12
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,800
we will be raising a tiger with endless troubles ahead.

13
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Don't you want to figure out why the Danchi people assassinated the crown prince?

14
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
For an act that would only

15
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,110
bring harm and no benefit to one's state, why would one do it?

16
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,580
It's possible that they are being framed.

17
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,790
Then Minister Gao, what evidence do you have?

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
None, at the present time.

19
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,230
The crown prince of our empire was assassinated.

20
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,400
Such a major event, if there's no countermeasure,

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,070
neighboring countries will think that our empire

22
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,160
is weak and can be easily bullied.

23
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,370
Chengye!

24
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,130
I command you to immediately bring soldiers to the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border.

25
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,710
First of all, to investigate the assassination of the crown prince.

26
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,700
Second, to let the countries in the northwest be aware of our deterrent power.

27
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,540
Draw up another decree.

28
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,940
Let Chengyin bring an envoy to Xi State.

29
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,880
Although the crown prince was assassinated,

30
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,190
the Eastern Palace still remains.

31
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,810
If the daughter of the king of Xi State

32
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,000
marries into the Eastern Palace,

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,280
it will win over Xi State's stabilization and peace.

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,290
At this moment, that is extremely important.

35
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,800
I will obey your decree.

36
00:03:49,420 --> 00:04:00,700
[Minister Manor]

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,100
Father, based on our Gao family's power in the imperial court,

38
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,350
why do you still need to work so hard and pretend that you're sick in front of other people?

39
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,100
Zhen, you should know, to be in the emperor's company is virtually the same as living with a tiger.

40
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,350
In the past, Father got rid of the Gu family.

41
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,280
He was reproached by the ministers in the imperial court.

42
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,190
In fear of offending the emperor,

43
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,860
Father's hair turned grey overnight.

44
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,860
Without any choice,

45
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,800
Father pretended that he suffered an ischemic stroke, laid up in bed and didn't appear in the imperial court for a year.

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,830
Zhen, to be in the emperor's company is virtually the same as living with a tiger. You need to understand Father's pains.

47
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,700
All those years, Father took every step with extreme caution.

48
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,000
The Gu family's power was eliminated long ago.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,250
What else do we need to be afraid of?

50
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,270
Moreover, the case of the Gu family was closed a long time ago. The people have already forgotten about it.

51
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,400
- Father, why do you still take this to heart?
- That's what other people like to think...

52
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,420
that the case of the Gu family has all ended.

53
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,470
But in the emperor's heart,

54
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,500
what's needed is an official whom His Majesty can control.

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,160
An official should never overstep the limit between himself and the emperor.

56
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,830
No matter how powerful the Gu family or the Gao family are, such power is granted by the emperor.

57
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,450
All these years, I've pretended to be sick.

58
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,180
I just didn't want to make the same mistake as the Gu family did.

59
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,700
You... if you could have half the shrewdness like your second brother,

60
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,410
I'd be more at ease about you.

61
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,150
Father, His Imperial Majesty really thought that

62
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,040
the crown prince was killed by the Danchi?

63
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,860
The emperor is just playing dumb and is going with the current.

64
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,300
How can the emperor give up such a good opportunity of making a move on the Danchi?

65
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,340
His Imperial Majesty has been wanting to strike the Danchi for years.

66
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,910
But His Majesty has been bitter about not being able to find a reason to justify the military action against the Danchi.

67
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,140
But I didn't expect that... it helps Chengye to profit from this.

68
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,620
If he gains big merit in the northwest, later on in competing for the crown prince position,

69
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,460
there'll be one more rival.

70
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,630
Send a message to your elder brother.

71
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,440
Tell him that Second Prince will be going to the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border.

72
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,420
Yes. Father, is there any other advice?

73
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,240
No more. He should know what to do.

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,990
Gu Jian, as a teacher, you should be punished for not being strict with disciplining your student.

75
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,800
I know my mistake.

76
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,870
But since you also found Ninth Princess, your merit will atone for your wrongdoing.

77
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,470
Going forward, you'd better watch her more carefully.

78
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,920
Don't allow her to step even half a step out of the palace.

79
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,650
- Yes, Sir.
- You may go down now.

80
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,330
Dead silly girl, I will kill you!

81
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,790
- Dad!
- What are you doing?

82
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,620
Mom, quickly save me!

83
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,380
I will not forgive you today!

84
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,100
Okay already!

85
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,650
- I... I will beat you to death!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Enough! What are you doing? Enough!

86
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,460
Xiaofeng is safely back. That's good enough.

87
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,500
Look at that. You spoiled her!

88
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,680
Isn't it because Father forced me to?

89
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,310
For so many days, she must've suffered a lot by herself out there.

90
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,170
You still want to hit her?

91
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,000
Mom, I haven't eaten well for a few days.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,080
Did you hear that?

93
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,270
Better to let her suffer a little. Otherwise, she wouldn't know how high the sky is and how wide the land is.

94
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,700
If you keep up with this lawlessness, no one will wish to marry you!

95
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,760
That's the best. I don't want to marry the prince of Central Plains.

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,130
That's enough.

97
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,530
A marriage alliance is not child's play.

98
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,100
Starting from now on, you are not allowed to step outside the palace.

99
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,270
- Be obedient.
- You are going to detain me again, Father?

100
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,480
How long are you going to lock me up this time?

101
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,520
Until you get married.

102
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,900
I...

103
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,180
Dad!

104
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,090
Enough.

105
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,060
Godfather.

106
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,240
Kneel down.

107
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,020
Gu Jian,

108
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,410
do you still remember your mission for coming here?

109
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,270
I dare not forget.

110
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,260
The villains made false accusations against the Gu family.

111
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,800
The crime of treason was sentenced. All nine generations of the Gu family were implicated.

112
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,980
The dead bodies that were carried out of the Gu family could only be buried in the nameless abandoned graves.

113
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,060
No memorial tablets could be set up.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,610
One of these days, I will rake up the unjust case.

115
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,470
One of these days, I will let the Gu family memorial tablets be respectfully displayed and worshiped in the ancestral martyr temple.

116
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,000
What's more?

117
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,340
What's more?

118
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,250
I can't get too close to Ninth Princess. We don't belong together.

119
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,390
I shouldn't be infatuated with her and indulge in vain hopes.

120
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,840
Since you can remember all these things so clearly,

121
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,620
then you will be able to accomplish it.

122
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,130
Princess, the bath is ready.

123
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,510
Princess?

124
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,100
A'Du, come look at this for me. Hurry.

125
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,790
Do you understand this word?

126
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,400
Princess, don't make it hard for me. How would I understand the Central Plains' language?

127
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,040
My head hurts. I can only understand three words.

128
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,300
Look here. Something about "three,"

129
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,330
then some "day,"

130
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,960
and something about "meet."

131
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,860
Does he mean he'll come find me in three days?

132
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,300
Who is he?

133
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,260
The person that left this cloth note.

134
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,160
Who is he then?

135
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,500
If I knew, I wouldn't have a headache.

136
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,980
He also said he promised me three things.

137
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,010
Then he did nothing and ran off.

138
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,800
Princess, if you really want to know, why not ask Young Lord Gu?

139
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,820
I'm not asking him.

140
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,200
I wonder if that person has recovered yet.

141
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,620
Come. Come over here.

142
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,430
Good. Hit harder.

143
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,890
Good. Throw him down.

144
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,460
Grandfather, Central Plains has stationed troops at the border.

145
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,730
What really happened in the Central Plains?

146
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,690
Gao Xian didn't say it clearly, but I could figure it out.

147
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,490
Something big must have happened in Li Empire.

148
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,510
We can't treat this as some unimportant matter.

149
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,500
- Yimoyan.
- I'm here.

150
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,460
Take 30,000 elite troops

151
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,070
and station 100 li from the Protectorate General Office of the Western Border. Wait to see if changes occur.

152
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,470
Yes.

153
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:17,230
Looks like something big happened between the Li Empire and Danchi.

154
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,740
We, Shuobo, can't ignore it. Pass on my decree.

155
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,160
Gather 20,000 elite troops and camp at the border.

156
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,710
Quietly wait for any changes.

157
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,350
Yes.

158
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,590
[Middle Palace Gate]

159
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,720
My Lady.

160
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,700
My Lady, you've coughed up blood.

161
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,210
Should we summon the royal physician, My Lady?

162
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,320
My Lady, are you all right?

163
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,540
- No need, I am fine. You all can leave.
- My Lady!

164
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,210
Leave, all of you.

165
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,770
Yes.

166
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,230
What's wrong? Are you all right?

167
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,230
Did you find Chengyin?

168
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,760
Fifth Prince is fine.

169
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,310
The crown prince is gone and the Eastern Palace remains empty.

170
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,000
Prince Xuande harbors wild ambitions and sets his greedy eyes on the crown prince position.

171
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,460
The empress has ganged up with Prime Minister Gao. In order to solidify the power of the empress' family,

172
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,730
the empress definitely will find ways...

173
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,500
to prop up a puppet to take over the Eastern Palace.

174
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:42,360
Chengyin's carefree lifestyle will be over soon.

175
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,690
It doesn't matter whether he likes it or not, he will still be involved in this bloody political fight.

176
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,500
Fifth Prince is simple and innocent. He is easily exploited by people. He trusts others readily.

177
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,150
Also, he is not the empress' own son.

178
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,560
If by any chance he is no longer useful, I worry that...

179
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,780
his life could be in danger.

180
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,600
Maybe... it's time to tell him the truth.

181
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,880
The fifth prince of the Li Empire is here!

182
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,520
I, Li Chengyin, the fifth prince of Li Empire, greets Your Majesty.

183
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,790
You may rise.

184
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,520
I came to Xi State as ordered by my imperial father to especially offer this marriage alliance letter.

185
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,750
Please look over it, Your Majesty.

186
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,600
My imperial father wishes that you can have your honorable country's ninth princess marry into the Central Plains.

187
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,660
After Princess Mingyuan, the two countries will then be able to once again establish a marriage alliance,

188
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,170
promote friendly relations, and be on good terms for many generations.

189
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,290
Having the marriage alliance and good terms for generations to come is my long-cherished wish.

190
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,870
- I...
- I've already been staying at the post house for seven days! Why can't I see the king? Move aside.

191
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,130
Your Majesty, is this how the Xi State treats their guests?

192
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:38,640
Your Majesty, since you have domestic affairs to take care of, why don't you let the fifth prince leave first? Regarding the marriage alliance, I will take care of the details.

193
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,140
Your Majesty, I heard that Aunt Mingyuan is not feeling well. I would like to visit her.

194
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,480
Is it permissible?

195
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,290
Yes, it is.

196
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,360
If Mingyuan sees you, she will definitely be happy.

197
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,090
- Servant!
- Here!

198
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,000
Bring the fifth prince to see Consort Mingyuan.

199
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,590
- Yes!
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

200
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,650
Come in.

201
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,900
Here.

202
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,050
Look at how you are eating.

203
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:36,820
You really don't have any worries.

204
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,170
What is the matter, Mom?

205
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,680
You are my only daughter.

206
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,110
When I think of how far you are going to be married off to,

207
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,710
my heart...

208
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,950
- Mom...
- My Queen! Ninth Princess!

209
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,270
- My Queen! Ninth Princess!
- What is it?

210
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,970
The ambassadors from Li Empire and Shuobo State are both here proposing marriage to princess.
(T/N: "shuo" means new moon/north; "bo" means to win or attain)

211
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,250
What did you say? Shuobo is also proposing marriage?

212
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,070
Yes.

213
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,730
This...

214
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,650
♪ The far-reaching mountains. The long winding river ♪

215
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,730
♪ The faraway mountains and rivers always in my dream ♪

216
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:23,540
♪ In my dream, I resent the green mountain suddenly blocks my view ♪

217
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:29,210
♪ And there's the evening cloud covering the green mountain ♪

218
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:34,450
♪ The wind is blowing. The snow is falling ♪

219
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:40,940
♪ Windy and snowy... I long to return home ♪

220
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:50,760
♪ People said when the sun sets at the farthest corner of the earth. So far away, I can no longer see it ♪

221
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,790
♪ My hometown is out of sight ♪

222
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,710
Aunt.

223
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,850
Aunt, I'm Chengyin.

224
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,190
Chengyin?

225
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,320
You've grown up so quickly.

226
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,220
Imperial Grandmother and His Imperial Majesty... how are they doing?

227
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:48,000
They are fine. Imperial Great Grandmother and Imperial Father both miss you very much.

228
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,230
Aunt, how are you? Has your health improved?

229
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,370
Come.

230
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,850
Aunt, the music you just played... is the tune of homesickness, right?

231
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,030
Right.

232
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:19,070
I've been away from Shangjing for years. I really want to go back and see it.

233
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,430
Aunt, how about this?

234
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,940
You come back with me to the capital and live there for a while.

235
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,630
So that the imperial doctor can take care of your health.

236
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,940
You are just like Yuyao.

237
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,880
Very sensitive and thoughtful towards others.

238
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,650
Mother?

239
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,620
When Mother passed away, I was still young. I don't even remember what she looks like.

240
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,730
Chengyin, I have something to tell you today.

241
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,220
Go ahead, Aunt.

242
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,920
Let me take you somewhere first.

243
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,050
Your Majesty, if I remember correctly,

244
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,210
the deceased Shuobo queen should be the aunt of the ninth princess of Xi State.

245
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,350
If Ninth Princess marries to the king of Shuobo,

246
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,700
then, the king of Shuobo will greet Your Majesty as "father-in-law?"

247
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,300
We people on the Western Border don't have so many rules like the Central Plains people have.

248
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,880
You can ignore the etiquette, but not the rules.

249
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:34,380
Your Majesty, our empire was the first to offer the marriage alliance letter. There should be a first-come, first-served policy.

250
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Prince Lidun, you should just hurry and return to your kingdom. Or else, you'll be putting His Majesty in a bad position.

251
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,100
If we're talking about the order of arrival, I was waiting at the posthouse for seven days already.

252
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,680
And besides, a marriage alliance is based on sincerity.

253
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,250
The Shuobo State is willing to give ten years worth of tribute as a betrothal gift to ask for the ninth princess' hand in marriage.

254
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,860
That's right, to ask for marriage,

255
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,890
sincerity must be the most important.

256
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,860
Your Majesty, I, servant A'Du, was ordered by the ninth princess to come here.

257
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,910
No fooling around here.

258
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,820
We heard that both Li Empire and Shuobo State have sent envoys to ask for marriage at the same time.

259
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,780
Your Majesty is being placed in a difficult spot. The princess has an idea to help Your Majesty decide.

260
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,550
Your Honorable Envoys, the princess has ordered me to come to see which one of you extends the most sincerity.

261
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:39,180
She had me prepare the blood of the five evils.

262
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,970
Whoever drinks it can marry her and win her heart.

263
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,290
- What is this?
- The blood of the five evils?

264
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,640
This blood of the five evils is highly nutritious.

265
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,480
It is distilled from the blood of red bat,

266
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,840
poisonous lizard, blood toad, python, and centipede.

267
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,430
It's just that most people dare not take it.

268
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,400
What do you mean?

269
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,480
Are you saying that the princess wants to kill us?

270
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,470
What are you saying? If you don't want to drink it, then don't. Why must you slander the princess?

271
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,270
It's not that I dare not drink it. I just don't want to drink it. I won't drink it.

272
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,300
And how about you, noble envoy? You don't want to drink it either?

273
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,970
If he doesn't drink it, I won't either.

274
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,740
Since neither of you dares to drink it,

275
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,920
I will drink it for you.

276
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,250
I'm going to drink it.

277
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm going to drink it.

278
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Why is there a centipede leg in the blood?

279
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,770
Look, it's still moving.

280
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,880
It's such a surprise that both envoys are so gutless.

281
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,260
What's inside the cup is just grape juice that's been boiled thick.

282
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,350
Your Majesty, we at Xi State have always admired fearless brave warriors. How can the ninth princess marry a coward?

283
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,730
That is just trickery!

284
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,790
Your Majesty, is this how Xi State greets its guests?

285
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:36,440
Your Majesty, this woman is so bold! She's making a mockery of the court and damaging the relationship between kingdoms.

286
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,860
I think it shouldn't be directed by Ninth Princess.

287
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,460
These are someone's underhanded tricks.

288
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,500
Guards! Drag this maidservant away and lock her up! Without His Majesty's command, you can't release her!

289
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,420
Yes!

290
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,650
You, two envoys, have been harassed. It's my fault.

291
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,740
Please go back to the post house and rest first.About the political marriage,

292
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,820
I'll give you an answer in three days.

293
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,700
Sir Chai?

294
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,660
Greetings, Fifth Prince.

295
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,930
Sir Chai has worked for me for many years. You can trust him.

296
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,920
Whether it's now or in the future, you can trust him.

297
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,710
Okay.

298
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,110
[Ancestral memorial tablets]

299
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,880
[Ancestral memorial tablets]

300
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,080
Chengyin, come here.

301
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:00,440
These paintings are of your uncle and mother.

302
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,270
Kneel down.

303
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,420
The Gu clan was eminent in the Central Plains.

304
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:20,820
Your uncle, Gu Ruhui, was a cavalry general of the previous reign. As a young man, he was versed in both literature and military affairs.

305
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:28,670
He, with your father, together with Chen Zheng and the general of the Sixteenth Prefecture Guards, were close like brothers.

306
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,070
When your father was the crown prince, General Gu and General Chen,

307
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,200
frequently followed your father to fight battles and gained merits.

308
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,560
Your father succeeded to the throne after the former emperor passed away.

309
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,000
General Gu was appointed as the Right Minister to command the Three Departments.

310
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,990
General Gu was an upright man and won great popularity in Li Empire.

311
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:59,880
But back then, Left Minister Gao Yuming was full of ambition. He appeared loyal but harbored wickedness.

312
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:05,240
He didn't get along with General Gu and harbored resentment in his heart.

313
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,890
Minister Gao flattered the emperor and won the emperor's trust.

314
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:14,930
He secretly established his own power and used every means in his power to eliminate those who opposed him.

315
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,730
He kept making slanderous remarks to the emperor, defaming General Gu for overshadowing the emperor.

316
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,760
He also fabricated letters exchanged between General Gu and Khan Tömür.

317
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,620
He falsely accused General Gu as a traitor colluding with the enemy to start a revolt.

318
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:37,190
When faced with the evidence present, the emperor started having doubts and ordered Prime Minister Gao to investigate the case.

319
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,690
General Gu and General Chen, whom they thought was related to the case, were brought to the Court of Judicial Review for interrogation.

320
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,720
Prime Minister Gao falsified the royal decree and led the army to charge into the Gu Family Manor for a killing spree.

321
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:02,330
That night, the blood of the Gu family flowed like a river. Bones piled up into a mountain.

322
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,940
Hundreds of innocent lives died a tragic death under the cold sharp blades.

323
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,930
And dozens of the Chen family members were tragically buried alive.

324
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:18,870
Even General Chen's wife and daughter couldn't escape.

325
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,700
For a while...

326
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,660
the case of the Gu and Chen families made a great stir in the imperial court.

327
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,520
In front of the emperor, Minister Gao confounded right and wrong.

328
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,630
He brought a false charge against Gu and Chen for collusion and rebellion. They were all executed because they resisted arrest.

329
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,730
His Imperial Majesty was unaware of the truth

330
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,050
and believed Minister Gao's one-sided story. In anger,

331
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,850
the emperor ordered the arrest of General Chen Zheng and the remaining people.

332
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,700
You are... General Chen Zheng?

333
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,260
Yes, I am.

334
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,530
General Chen, please rise.

335
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,040
You have suffered... all these years.

336
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,110
General Gu and I went on expeditions for so many years.

337
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:23,540
I am indebted to him for saving my life. I'm still alive because of him.

338
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,940
But Fifth Prince, please remember this... Chen Zheng is dead.

339
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:34,210
My name is Chai Mu.

340
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Right.

341
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,080
Aunt, what happened afterward?

342
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,040
Afterward, Minister Gao took your uncle's position.

343
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,460
For a while, it was magnificent.

344
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,810
Secretly, he instigated other ministers to implore the emperor to abolish Consort Shu and banish her to the cold palace.

345
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,340
The emperor was deeply in love with your mother and reluctant to give the order.

346
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,590
In the palace, your mother was devastated over the news of the extermination of the Gu family.

347
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:15,470
In order not to make things difficult for the emperor, she asked to be demoted as a commoner and to live outside the palace to cultivate in seclusion.

348
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,810
His Imperial Majesty had no choice but to order people to build another Jade Collecting Hall outside the capital.

349
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,000
A replica of the hall was built for her.

350
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,070
During that time, because of what happened to the Gu family,

351
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,830
your mother was feeling depressed.

352
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,640
His Imperial Majesty frequently left the palace and disguised as a commoner to go visit her.

353
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,910
And that was the time...

354
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,450
when your mother was pregnant with you.

355
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,140
She was brought back to the palace after she became pregnant.

356
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,630
Her position as a consort was restored.

357
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,790
Not long after, she gave birth to you in the palace.

358
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,630
My royal son.

359
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:07,390
The empress was barren, and she was jealous of your mother being favored by His Majesty.

360
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:12,780
Your birth made her feel even more insecure.

361
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:21,400
After giving birth to you, because of the Gu family's case, your mother

362
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,430
became depressed and her health worsened.

363
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,400
Here.

364
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,390
The empress used this opportunity to pretend to be friendly with your mother.

365
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:36,190
On the surface she acted like a caring sister, but she secretly had someone

366
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:41,050
- add a slow-acting poison into your mother's medication.
- Drink this medicine while it's warm.

367
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:58,800
The chronic toxicity slowly encroached on her body.

368
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,540
When your mother discovered the schemes of the empress,

369
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,330
she knew she could not escape death.

370
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,960
To safeguard your life,

371
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,370
she pleaded with His Majesty, before her death,

372
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:11,970
to let the empress raise you.

373
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:14,790
Don't ever tell Chengyin.

374
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,110
I want him...

375
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,360
to peacefully...

376
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,310
and happily...

377
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,820
to go on living.

378
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,070
Yuyao!

379
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,420
Yuyao!

380
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,020
[Yin]

381
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,910
- Fifth Prince!
- Slowly, Fifth Prince!

382
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,570
Slowly, Fifth Prince! Don't fall!

383
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,380
Be careful!

384
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,190
Fifth Prince!

385
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,440
- Yin'er!
- Mother.

386
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,910
What happened?

387
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,740
Who did this to you?

388
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,610
They said you were not my mother.

389
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,410
They said my mother is Consort Gu of Shicui Palace,

390
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,510
who is already dead.

391
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,740
I was so angry... and had a fight with them.

392
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,940
Mother, is it true of what they've said?

393
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,870
Is Consort Shu truly my mother?

394
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,290
Don't believe them! I am your real mother, remember that!

395
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,910
Do not play with them anymore, you hear me?!

396
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,940
Yes.

397
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,330
Yin'er,

398
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,380
my son, you are my only future in this palace.

399
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,240
You must make me proud.

400
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,430
You have to overwhelm all your older brothers.

401
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,560
But I want to go out and play with them.

402
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,800
Show me your hand... quickly.

403
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,390
The way of great learning means to extol high virtue,
(T/N: From "The Great Learning," part of the Confucian Canon)

404
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,790
to be kind to people, to strive for perfection,

405
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,860
to know shame... shame...

406
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,160
...shame...

407
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,950
Mother,

408
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,460
I have not been a filial son.

409
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,870
All these years, I've been regarding your killer as my mother.

410
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:49,020
Mother, I swear

411
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,270
that I will seek revenge for you and the entire Gu family.

412
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,730
No, Chengyin.

413
00:41:56,730 --> 00:42:00,220
By telling you all those things, I didn't mean to ask you to take revenge.

414
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,690
I just want you to eliminate all the evildoers, to relieve people from pains

415
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,070
and to share His Imperial Majesty's worries.

416
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,100
There is another matter

417
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,220
that I need to tell you.

418
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,670
Back then, Sir Chai disregarded his own safety

419
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,010
and gave his all to save the only bloodline

420
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,940
left by the Gu clan.

421
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,710
Come in!

422
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,400
He is your Uncle Gu Ruhui's only son

423
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,520
and your cousin, Gu Jian.

424
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,650
Fifth Prince.

425
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,430
Cousin.

426
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,940
