[Goodbye My Princess]

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,120
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,890
Let's go.

4
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,240
Follow me.

5
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,090
Xiaofeng!

6
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,760
Xiaofeng!

7
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,370
Let's go!

8
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,820
Keep up!

9
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,990
Xiaofeng!

10
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,410
Xiaofeng!

11
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
Princess!

12
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,810
Xiaofeng!

13
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,500
Look. There really is a River of Oblivion.

14
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,140
Xiaofeng! Come over here!

15
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,130
Come here first. Come.

16
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Gu Xiaowu,

17
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,660
if you catch 100 fireflies for me again, I'll go back with you.

18
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,400
Xiaofeng, look. There aren't any fireflies here.

19
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,740
The Central Plains is a good place. They have fireflies.

20
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,550
You will definitely like it there.

21
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,310
Fine. Fine. A hundred fireflies.

22
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,660
I will give you anything you want! Pleas stop moving backward!

23
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,640
Xiaowu, you think that the water from the River of Oblivion

24
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,750
can really let us forget our feelings, worries, and everything else?

25
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,300
Xiaofeng, if you dare to jump,

26
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I will make the whole Xi State be buried with you!

27
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Your Highness, you wouldn't.

28
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,900
If Your Highness continues to wreak havoc on Xi State,

29
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,840
you won't just destroy a measly Xi State,

30
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,340
but also, the peace surrounding the borders of the Li Empire.

31
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,190
Don't... Xiaofeng!

32
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,700
Gu Xiaowu, I misjudged you.

33
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,020
Now, my kingdom has been devastated and my home is gone.

34
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,640
Great God punished me to suffer this tribulation.

35
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:30,110
For all of eternity, I must forget you forever.

36
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,330
Xiaofeng!

37
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:45,100
♫ Parting shattered the heart... Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

38
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,780

♫ Time reverses... With a sip to forget love ♫

40
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,950
Xiaofeng, hold onto me!

41
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,870
Xiaofeng, give me your other hand!

42
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,570
Xiaofeng! What are you doing?!

43
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,500
What are you doing?! Are you crazy?! Hold on tight!

44
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,960
Xiaofeng!

45
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,730
Fifth Prince!

46
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,300
Xiaofeng!

♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,040
I want to hold my little princess in my palms everyday.

50
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Xiaofeng!

I'll join you.

54
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,400
We will forget together.

55
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,020

What?

63
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,700
- Yongning is here?
- Yes

64
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,240
Xiaofeng, let me introduce you to a new guest. Look at who this is.

65
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,170
- Yongning.
- Xiaofeng, have you been good these days?

66
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,100
Let me introduce her. This is my eighth little sister, Luoxi.

67
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,300
A little while ago, she went back to Yizhou with her mother to visit some relatives. She just arrived in the capital today.

68
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,130
This is the ninth princess of the Xi State, Xiaofeng. She will be our empire's future crown princess consort.

69
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,060
Basically our sister-in-law.

70
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,080
Greetings to Princess Luoxi.

71
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,480
You are truly beautiful.

72
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,200
Princess Luoxi, thank you. You are beautiful, too.

73
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,710
You two can stop on the politeness. I'm the seventh princess.

74
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,730
Luoxi is the eighth princess. I was thinking why hasn't our father given us a ninth princess.

75
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,900
And now here you are.

76
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,490
Xiaofeng, we don't have that many sisters around to play cards with us.

77
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,730
It's great that you're here. We can then gather all the time.

78
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,700
Hence, don't see yourself as an outsider.

79
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,310
Xiaofeng, have you learned the card game technique I taught you last time?

80
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,450
I remember! I remember a little.

81
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,450
Let's go!

82
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,970
I'm done.

83
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,220
I lost again.

84
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,360
Xiaofeng, it's okay. In card games,

85
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,350
you have to learn how to lose before you know how to win.

86
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,700
Come here.

87
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,400
Come here.

88
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,790
Yongning!

89
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,750
Let's play again.

90
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,800
Luoxi, which of our brothers is most suitable with Xiaofeng?

91
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,410
I think our third brother is too straight-laced without a mind of his own.

92
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,900
Our fourth brother is stupid and cowardly.

93
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,790
Neither of them has a chance to become the crown prince.

94
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,890
As for our second brother, he is our father's favorite.

95
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,620
He is also the first one to have a title. He behaves modestly.

96
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,900
He has the highest chance of being the crown prince.

97
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:19,890
But I think fifth brother is handsome and humorous.

98
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,100
His personality best matches Xiaofeng.

99
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,680
Fifth Brother? He does excel at everything, but...

100
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,400
Dad, I've been in the capital for about a month now.

101
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,660
It's been hard on all of you.

102
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,580
From now on, just stay here and recuperate.

103
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,400
Slowly strengthen your body. Slowly get back your memory.

104
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,510
I heard them say that our marriage alliance convoy ran onto thieves, and everyone died.

105
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,600
A'Du and I were luckily saved by the fifth prince,

106
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,380
but A'Du got poisoned and became mute by those thieves beforehand and I'd forgotten many things.

107
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,300
The imperial doctor said that these symptoms are temporary.

108
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,280
Just take good care of yourself, and these memories may slowly come back.

109
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,300
But I think that forgetting those bad memories aren't so bad.

110
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,990
Eat this.

111
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,650
Imperial Great Grandmother, just let me do it by myself.

112
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll hold it for you and you just eat.

113
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,410
- Mother and Father, I've been enjoying my life here.
- Here. Eat.

114
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,850
- Shangjing's scenery is very nice. People at the palace also treat me well.
- Here. Wipe your mouth.

115
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,250
Put this away for now.

116
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,300
I like you a lot. I chose a good palace official

117
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,290
as your chief lady-in-waiting. This is her.

118
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,530
Greetings, Ninth Princess.

119
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,790
Yongniang, don't be so courteous.

120
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,460
I had the Embracing the Moon Pavilion prepared for you, which is just right next to my Longevity and Benevolence Palace.

121
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,860
How about it?

122
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,430
This way I can often

123
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,400
hear you talk about Elder Princess Mingyuan.

124
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,060
Your Imperial Highness, Princess Yongning is here.

125
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,780
Yongning greets Great Grandmother.

126
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,020
Come over here.

127
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,280
This is my darling, Princess Yongning.

128
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,760
This is the princess from Xi State, named Xiaofeng.

129
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,720
You are close in age.

130
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,270
You be sisters and take care of one another.

131
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,900
Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng!

132
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,530
What are you thinking?

133
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,540
Nothing. What were you saying?

134
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,860
We want to know who among our brothers do you like.

135
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,850
Don't make fun of me.

136
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,680
I am here for a political marriage. I can only be married to the crown prince.

137
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,930
- Either way, I haven't seen any of them yet.
- You are right.

138
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:12,220
When we have a chance, I'll take you to go see them. How about it?

139
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,920
Dad. Mom.

140
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,500
Don't worry. No matter which prince I am marrying in the future,

141
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,770
for you both and the citizens of both countries,

142
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,190
I won't be as stubborn like before.

143
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,060
A'Du! A'Du!

144
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,240
Secretly send this family letter to the nearest relay station.

145
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,630
I will obediently stay here in Shangjing and accept my fate.

146
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,910
Dad. Mom. Take care. I'll be waiting for your reply.

147
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,270
We've been in the capital for so long, yet we never had the chance to go out.

148
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,040
If I still don't go out, I will suffocate to death.

149
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,590
[Longevity and Benevolence Palace]

150
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,720
Ninth Princess, you cannot leave the palace without the Grand Empress Dowager's permission.

151
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,250
I am a princess of Xi State. I don't need to follow your rules. Let's go.

152
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,850
I have special permission from the Grand Empress Dowager.

153
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,560
If you stop me and she finds out, you won't be able to bear the responsibility.

154
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,690
Your Highness! Ninth Princess!

155
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,870
Your Highness, go back inside. Directress Fang of the Ceremonial Service Office is waiting for you in Embracing the Moon Pavilion.

156
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,980
Who is Directress Fang?

157
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,550
Every young woman should first learn how to establish her person.

158
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,370
To establish her person, she must cultivate tranquility and chastity.

159
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,710
If she is tranquil, her body will be pure.

160
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,930
If she is chaste, her person will be honored.

161
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,370
Directress Fang, do I have to read all of these books?

162
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,330
Princess, these are all the etiquette classics that Grand Dowager Empress asked

163
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,420
our Ceremonial Service Office to deliver to you for your studies.

164
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,320
She said that your wedding is upcoming and you need to study the most important things.

165
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,500
You can study about the other etiquette and rules gradually.

166
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,560
Wedding?

167
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,200
You don't even have a crown prince yet. Who will I get to marry?

168
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,890
Regardless of who becomes the crown prince,

169
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,890
you will be the future crown princess consort, the model woman of the Eastern Palace.

170
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,110
Sooner or later you'll have to study these etiquette and classical rules.

171
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,050
Aside from these daily rules and procedures, the crown princess consort

172
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,540
must manage all the matters inside the Eastern Palace.

173
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,370
You will also be the leader of all the royal harem of the Eastern Palace.

174
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,030
You will be their role model

175
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,420
in terms of speech and actions.

176
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,310
Directress Fang, I don't understand anything you're saying.

177
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,450
Please let me off. I can't study anymore.

178
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,960
I beg you. I beg you.

179
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,160
- A'Du!
- A'Du!

180
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,620
How dare you to hide a weapon inside the palace?!

181
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,560
When I report this to His Imperial Majesty, you will be executed!

182
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,300
A'Du, don't be unruly! Do you want the princess to be punished because of you?

183
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,180
A'Du.

184
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,420
Take away her knife!

185
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,020
Stop!

186
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,730
If you want to punish someone, punish me. Why must you vent it on A'Du?

187
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,710
Your body is precious, Princess, and I dare not punish you.

188
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,850
But as your personal servant,

189
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,840
she is being too unruly. She deserves to be punished.

190
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,600
Fine, I'll learn.

191
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,090
Princess, please learn the "Lessons for Women" with me.
("Lessons for Women" is written by Ban Zhao of the Eastern Han Dynasty; one of the four Confucian books for women alongside "Analects of Women")

192
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,370
There are four edifying behavioral characteristics for women.

193
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,560
There are four edifying behavioral characteristics for women.

194
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,850
The first is womanly virtue.

195
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,880
The first is womanly virtue.

196
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,200
The second is womanly speech.

197
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,620
The second is womanly speech.

198
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,360
- Good! Good! Good!
- Once more!

199
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,160
- Hand-pulled noodles!
- Give me a bowl.

200
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,110
Hand-pulled noodles! Come!

201
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,120
- Good!
- Good!
- Have some!

202
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,510
Miss, would you like to try this brush?

203
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,170
Okay.

204
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,020
Here.

205
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,760
[Yin]

206
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,240
You wrote well.

207
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,080
Your Highness.

208
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,710
[Yin]

209
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,430
[Yin]

210
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,400
The penmanship is lovely and variable. It reflects your heart.

211
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,690
You wrote my name, so is it a gift for me?

212
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,110
Your Highness, I was just testing the brush.

213
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:54,710
If Your Highness likes it, I will write another piece for you later.

214
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,010
When you write without overthinking it, it's a true reflection of your heart.

215
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:01,850
I want what you write as a test, and I also want what you write deliberately.

216
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,970
Your Highness, how did you know I was here?

217
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,950
Did you forget? The other day when we saw each other, you said you were going to the East Market to buy the four treasures of study (brush, ink, paper, ink stone).

218
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,400
I calculated the time and thought you would be here, so I came to see if I would be lucky.

219
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,920
Your Highness, there's something you don't know. My Lady has been here since morning. She's been waiting for Your Highness to find her.

220
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,670
Jin'er!

221
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,810
I'm glad I didn't disappoint you.

222
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,490
I will treasure this piece of paper. When I go hunting in the Forbidden Park in a few days,

223
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,960
I will catch you a hunt and make a present for you.

224
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,980
In a few days, I will also be at the hunting grounds with my father and brother.

225
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,450
That's great! I'll take you hunting with me there.

226
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,010
Let's go.

227
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,760
Empress.

228
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,210
Prince Yi is here.

229
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,660
- Yi'er, you're back!
- Greetings, Imperial Mother.

230
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,600
You may rise. Bring his favorite desserts here. Come sit.

231
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,100
Yes.

232
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,870
Come drink some tea.

233
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,890
Imperial Mother, let me.

234
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,960
It's not easy to live outside the palace.

235
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,360
It's more comfortable and carefree here in your palace.

236
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,940
After you received your title, you appeared more outgoing than before.

237
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,070
Since moving out of the palace, I don't see Imperial Mother as often. I miss you a lot.

238
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,870
I forget my etiquette. I hope you can forgive me.

239
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,090
Mother and son don't require etiquette.

240
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,680
You acting close to me naturally makes feel happy.

241
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,040
Drink tea.

242
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,700
These are all your favorites. Eat more.

243
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
- Is it good?
- It's good.

244
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,500
Yin'er, I heard some rumors recently.

245
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,510
They say you are very close to the daughter of Zhao Jingyu.

246
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,040
Even though Zhao Jingyu is a General of the Second Rank (literally: General Who Assists the State),

247
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,970
he doesn't have real authority. Your friendship with his daughter

248
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,770
won't help your future.

249
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,530
Mother, don't listen to all that gossip.

250
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:24,000
I've known Sese since childhood. When I was sick,

251
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,730
she and her elder brother would come to visit me.

252
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,790
We are close, but not like what you think.

253
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,740
Good, as long as you understand.

254
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,780
- Yes, I know.
- Hurry and eat.

255
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,070
Wait!

256
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,130
Princess, that egg isn't for you to eat.

257
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,220
Please copy what I do.

258
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,670
According to the sages, "Do not lift your lips when you eat. Don't make any noise with the utensils."

259
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,840
Slowly chew and swallow the vegetables and fruits.

260
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,740
You must pick up the chopsticks

261
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,910
slowly like this.

262
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,010
Place back slowly.

263
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,200
Princess, please enjoy your meal.

264
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,630
Watch your manners!

265
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh shoot!

266
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,570
Princess.

267
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,720
Watch your manners.

268
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,030
Please do it again!

269
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,590
Princess, the way you're eating is not acceptable!

270
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,060
It's delicious.

271
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,280
Directress Fang,

272
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:06,130
how is the recent progress

273
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,840
of the ninth princess in her study of etiquette

274
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,870
and palace rules?

275
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,640
Replying to Your Highness.

276
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,570
Ninth Princess is very smart and has high comprehensive skills.

277
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,650
But she is playful and mischievous by nature.

278
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:26,280
I am afraid that I have disappointed your trust.

279
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,270
I can't teach her well.

280
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,010
How can you say that?

281
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,560
The imperial consorts in this palace

282
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,440
were taught by you.

283
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,120
You are the most qualified and most sensible for this job.

284
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,270
No matter how naughty Ninth Princess is,

285
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,930
I'm sure you can teach her well.

286
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,290
Thank you for your compliment.

287
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,540
I will do my best to teach Ninth Princess.

288
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,900
Teaching is important,

289
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,610
but you can't be too strict.

290
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,890
You should remember how pitiful she is.

291
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,260
She is away from home at such a young age.

292
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,800
She not only encountered a disaster, she even lost her memory.

293
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,120
So pitiful.

294
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,820
I shall abide.

295
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,060
- You may leave.
- I will take my leave.

296
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,770
- Yongniang.
- I'm here.

297
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,770
You are always with Ninth Princess.

298
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,260
The destruction of Danchi

299
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,900
and her mother's death

300
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,350
you must never speak of them to her.

301
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,890
Do not mention it to anyone else, either.

302
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes.

303
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,110
[Prince Yi Manor]

304
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,460
Your Highness, Sir Chai has been waiting in your study for a while.

305
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,830
Did anyone see him enter?

306
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,450
Don't worry. He followed the gardener and came from the back entrance.

307
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,000
I've verified. No one noticed.

308
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,870
You have Prime Minister Gao's help.

309
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,680
But Prime Minister Gao...

310
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,390
His high power in the court is not necessarily good for you.

311
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,180
Remember, the way to rule a country is about balance.

312
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,900
His Highness will safeguard his authority

313
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:52,320
and will not easily hand the crown prince title to you.

314
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,100
As it looks now, Second Prince has the support of some elder ministers.

315
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,980
Plus, the fact that he doesn't make mistakes on his tasks, this has earned him His Imperial Majesty's trust.

316
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,930
You and he are like the black and white pieces on a chessboard.

317
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,400
Only one must stay.

318
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,450
What you mean is, I must compete with Second Brother?

319
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:27,090
Grow strength quietly. Doing nothing is doing something. To not openly compete is being competitive.

320
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:38,310
Sir, do you have news of my cousin?

321
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,950
Princess Yongning and Princess Luoxi are here!

322
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,830
- Yongning!
- Xiaofeng.

323
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,510
Why did you write words on your forehead?

324
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,020
- Did I?
Princess, let me see.

325
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,080
Let me get some water.

326
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,660
Yongning, you don't know how I'm almost dying of boredom in this palace.

327
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:39,200
We came to tell you some good news.

328
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,930
Our imperial father will go hunting tomorrow. All the princes, princesses, and nobility will be there. It will be fun.

329
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:48,100
Don't you want to see our brothers? We'll ask Second Brother to take us. How about it?

330
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,010
But you told me Prince Xuande lives on the outside of the palace.

331
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:57,800
On our way coming here, we saw him visiting our great grandmother.

332
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,600
By now, he should be leaving the place.

333
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,770
Let's go find him.

334
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,290
Princess, wipe your face.

335
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,200
Your Highness, why hasn't the emperor named the crown prince yet?

336
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:23,290
Now that Li Chengying is titled, is the emperor considering him as the crown prince?

337
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:28,150
You are overreacting. Giving him a title is within the rules.

338
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,400
The battle with Danchi

339
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,450
is a major accomplishment for him.

340
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,240
If the emperor wishes to have him as the crown prince,

341
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,000
he would've done so when he returned from Danchi.

342
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,790
Since there is no discussion among the court officials,

343
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,200
and the emperor remains silent on the topic of the crown prince,

344
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,430
it means that he has no wish to name him as the crown prince.

345
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:58,800
In terms of age, conducts, and merit,

346
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,680
Your Highness is the best of all the princes.

347
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,700
Now that Li Empire is at peace and the emperor is healthy,

348
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,070
you must not bring up the crown prince issue.

349
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,500
You are right. But Fifth Brother's Danchi battle had exposed his ambition.

350
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,530
He also has the support of Prime Minister Gao.

351
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,960
I fear change may be coming. We can't sit around and do nothing.

352
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,300
Don't worry, Your Highness. A couple of officials and I

353
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,200
will bring up the crown prince issue with the emperor.

354
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,030
During this time, you must remain careful.

355
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,650
Do nothing as a reaction to any changes that may come.

356
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,210
I understand. I will follow your advice, Uncle.

357
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,390
Brother!

358
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,970
We finally caught up to you.

359
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,390
Let me make the introductions. This is the ninth princess of Xi State, Xiaofeng.

360
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,600
Greetings, princesses.

361
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,940
I'll take my leave now.

362
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,360
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

363
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,530
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

364
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,960
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

365
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,470
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

366
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,300
♫ A long dream ♫

367
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,010
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

368
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:22,900
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

369
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,690
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

370
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:37,710
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

371
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,220
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

372
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:44,100
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

373
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:53,020
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

374
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,040
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

375
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,800
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

376
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,620
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

377
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,520
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

378
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,190
♫ Time reverses ♫

379
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,450
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

380
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:21,600
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

381
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,660
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

382
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,360
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

383
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,330
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

384
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,110
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

385
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,800
♫ Time reverses ♫

386
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,920
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

387
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:48,230
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

388
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,800
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

389
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:03,070
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
