00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,980
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,580
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:44,140
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,930
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,560
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,080
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,140
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,220
♫  So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,950
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,610
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,810
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:39,090
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,850
♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:51,750
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,680
[Episode 44]

17
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,900
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

18
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm here to visit A'Du.

19
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,880
Shi'en.

20
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,810
This is the lingzhi mushroom that Imperial Father has rewarded me with.

21
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,620
It has amazing effects on the healing of internal injuries.

22
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,390
You sustained a serious internal injury because of me.

23
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,010
Speaking of it, I owe you half a life.

24
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,410
She...

25
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,560
A'Du is saying thank you.

26
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,210
It looks like A'Du has forgiven me.

27
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,910
What about you then?

28
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,980
Today, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is released from her house arrest.

29
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,310
Have you gone to visit her?

30
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,970
These past days that you were injured, she was really worried about you.

31
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,990
We are talking about matters concerning us now.

32
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,640
Do not bring other people into the picture.

33
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,600
Because of the assassination attempt on you, the wedding between Luoxi and Pei Zhao was pushed back.

34
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,570
There is no one taking charge of the empress' palace.

35
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:26,930
Imperial Great-Grandmother wants me to help Her Lady Consort Hui in organizing their wedding.

36
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,870
I almost forgot. I have to go and visit Imperial Great-Grandmother.

37
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,580
When I was unconscious, I heard every word you said to me.

38
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,490
Now that I'm well, why are you pushing me away again?

39
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,960
What are you really trying to hide from?

40
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,080
Li Chengyin,

41
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,360
we are people who had been tied together.

42
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,090
Now, you think that I am good,

43
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,560
because we experienced many extraordinary events together.

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,430
Just like when we cross a hanging bridge together,

45
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,000
we will be holding hands and our hearts will be beating faster,

46
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,580
but this is not true love.

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,750
Although I am the Crown Prince Consort of the Li Empire and also your official wife,

48
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,590
I'm not the one that you love the most.

49
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,870
You are the crown prince. In the future, you can have numerous consorts.

50
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,200
But I just want a love that is unique and unmatched.

51
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,480
You can't give that to me.

52
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,880
Bowing in greetings to Grand Empress Dowager.

53
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,330
Greetings to Consort Hui and Lady of Handsome Fairness Yan.

54
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,060
Come forward.

55
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,650
Bring the gold dangling ornament to me.

56
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,100
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao,

57
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,750
take it.

58
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,760
- Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.
- Wait a moment.

59
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,180
Child, you have suffered many grievances.

60
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,290
It was not hard for me.

61
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,760
Please take it.

62
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,800
Thank you, Imperial Great-Grandmother.

63
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,190
The two of you please listen well.

64
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,180
From now on, you have to support and help each other,

65
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,180
bear more burdens for the crown prince,

66
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,660
so that he can concentrate on the affairs of the state

67
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,140
and be more hardworking.

68
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,640
- Yes, Imperial Great-Grandmother.
- Yes, Imperial Great-Grandmother.

69
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,550
Please take your seats.

70
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,860
Consort Hui, it will be Luoxi's wedding on the 9th day of next month.

71
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,360
Now, there is no one in charge of the empress' palace.

72
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,090
For the time being, you will take charge of this matter.

73
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,020
Yes, Grand Empress Dowager.

74
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:49,420
Crown Princess Consort, you are now in charge of the Eastern Palace

75
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,760
and are good friends with Luoxi.

76
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,980
You should help Consort Hui well,

77
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,520
and take care of the matters concerning this marriage properly.

78
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,560
There is no need to be extravagant,

79
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,640
but it must be very lively.

80
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
Yes, Imperial Great-Grandmother.

81
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,400
I already knew that Luoxi would be married.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,280
But now that the day has finally come, I am so unwilling to let her go.

83
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,320
In this deep palace, I'm the only old unmarried princess left.

84
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Yongning, are you envious of Luoxi?

85
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,120
I am. But at the same time, I am not.

86
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,260
I am envious of the fact that she can marry the person she loves.

87
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,120
But just like how you said,

88
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,570
we do not know if they will be happy in the future.

89
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,220
From what we can see now,

90
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,930
Pei Zhao's feelings for her are not as deep as her feelings are for him.

91
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,230
Xiaofeng,

92
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,830
do you think they will be happy?

93
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,480
Probably.

94
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,390
Didn't Luoxi wish to marry General Pei since she was young?

95
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,230
Now that her wish has been fulfilled,

96
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,160
I think that Luoxi will not care about the rest.

97
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:47,220
Perhaps, being able to see the person you love every day is the biggest blessing.

98
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,010
That's right, a royal princess is raised in luxury.

99
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
But we do not have control over our marriage.

100
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,460
The fact that Luoxi was able to be with the person she loves

101
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,580
and not have to marry far from her hometown, is already a blessing.

102
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,090
While I... I have never tried

103
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,350
the taste of loving someone nor have I been loved before.

104
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,030
In a few more years,

105
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,320
I will also have to marry far from my hometown and enter a marriage alliance for the Li Empire.

106
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,800
If one day my husband decided to wage war against the Li Empire,

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,290
I would either die for my home country or die for my husband.

108
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,830
Greetings to Crown Princess Consort.

109
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,250
Hurry and get up. There is really no need to kneel.

110
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,070
You all rise as well.

111
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,780
You've moved to the Eastern Palace from the Clean and Peaceful Palace for quite a while already. You don't need to be so constrained.

112
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,230
Here, I brought some cakes for you. Try and see if you like them.

113
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,850
What? Are you afraid that I will poison you?

114
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,950
Look, no poison. Right?

115
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,230
Even though I am the crown princess consort, I never liked the palace scheming.

116
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,400
Since we call each other sisters, then we need to really treat each other like sisters.

117
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,460
I don't know how to say one thing and mean another.

118
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,000
If you still feel uneasy around me, I will come here less often.

119
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,810
I did not mean it that way.

120
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,560
Then that is good.

121
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,380
I can see that your complexion has gotten better these past days.

122
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,040
You should frequently go outside and take a walk.

123
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,130
Stop always frowning and crying. Smile a bit more.

124
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,950
The crown prince will then get closer to you.

125
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,750
The two of you will have more children in the future.

126
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,350
Yongniang. A'Du. You two can go as well.

127
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,110
Okay now. It is just the two of us.

128
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,020
If you have anything to say, you can speak freely.

129
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,650
Crown Princess Consort, to tell you the truth, the crown prince never liked me.

130
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,170
I was just a pawn of the empress.

131
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,260
That was before. Now, you are free.

132
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,580
You can love whoever you want to love.

133
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,330
As long as you are sincere towards His Imperial Highness,

134
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,380
the two of you will eventually have feelings for each other.

135
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,840
Actually, my heart is not in this palace.

136
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,140
What did you say? Crown Princess Consort went to Serene Reflection Hall?

137
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,280
Yes. The two of them chatted and laughed. They got along very well.

138
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,660
I never thought that the crown princess consort was this scheming.

139
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,770
She is clearly trying to win over Lady of Precious Bevy Xu in order to suppress me.

140
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,420
I will not sit still waiting for death.

141
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,180
- Eat this. This cake tastes very good.
- Okay.

142
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,130
Why are you all not eating?

143
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,160
Greetings to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

144
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,990
You are all dismissed.

145
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,340
Crown Prince, these pastries have been gifted by Crown Princess Consort.

146
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,120
I thought they tasted good, so I wished to share them with the others.

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,930
You are a Lady of Precious Bevy, not a servant.

148
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,410
But I...

149
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,160
You do not have to worry. Zhang Can has died.

150
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,900
And you have lost your child, so just stay here for the time being.

151
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,190
I will find an opportunity to send you out of the palace, so you may live a normal life.

152
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,890
I thank Crown Prince greatly.

153
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,120
Rest properly. I will leave first.

154
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,740
Your Imperial Highness!

155
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,200
Is there anything else?

156
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,160
Crown Princess Consort is a good woman.

157
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,850
I know that.

158
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,680
Crown Princess Consort!

159
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,510
Crown Princess Consort! Hurry and wake up! Crown Princess Consort!

160
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,950
Hurry and wake up!

161
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,680
Here, get up.

162
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,390
I finally have a chance to relax today. Yongniang, what is the matter?

163
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,680
Crown Princess Consort, a talisman made of peach wood was found under Lady of Precious Bevy Xu's bed.

164
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,910
I heard it is an item of witchcraft. Related Lady of Excellence Zhao's birth specifics were even written on it.

165
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,970
Lady Zhao has already arrested Lady Xu and is waiting outside your palace asking for your verdict.

166
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,940
I was wondering what the huge matter was. Making a fuss over nothing.

167
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,060
Isn't it just a wooden board?

168
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,940
Will Lady Zhao be cursed to death because of a wooden board? Isn't she fine right now?

169
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,020
Crown Princess Consort, you mustn't think of this matter lightly!

170
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,690
Witchcraft is a banned practice in our empire. One could be executed for it if His Imperial Majesty knows of this.

171
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,030
Normally, you can pass this matter over to the empress for handling.

172
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,240
But currently, the inner palace has no master.

173
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,970
I think you can let the crown prince decide on this matter.

174
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,530
Him?

175
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,300
If this matter leaks out, it will ruin the royal family's reputation.

176
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,140
It's better to pass judgment within the Eastern Palace.

177
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,050
Witchcraft is only folklore.

178
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,600
I also believe that this was not done by Lady of Precious Bevy Xu.

179
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,930
Maybe, it's some underling's doing.

180
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,480
Underlings? The more we really need to investigate clearly.

181
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,290
Who are these people? How many are involved?

182
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,330
Is anyone outside of the palace involved? We need to find out all of this.

183
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,520
You shut your mouth!

184
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,290
If Imperial Father knows of this, heads will roll.

185
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,920
Who's head do you wish to lose? Yours or those beneath you?

186
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,520
Li Chengyin, what do you mean by this?

187
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,040
I originally took pity on you because of your sad situation.

188
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,620
You lost a child. I wanted you to have a safe place to live.

189
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,260
But I didn't expect you to be so daring.

190
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,750
You dared to cross the line and even try to hurt someone I love.

191
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,610
This situation has not even been properly investigated. What right do you have to criticize her?

192
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,320
Lady of Precious Bevy Xu, don't be afraid of him. An innocent person will be cleared.

193
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,630
If he does not wish to investigate, then I will have Imperial Father do so.

194
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,280
Let the Court of Judicial Review investigate and give you justice.

195
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,930
Crown Princess Consort, the empress' matter has just ended. It's best not to bother the emperor.

196
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,150
Regardless of who did this, since Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is not hurt,

197
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,190
let's just follow His Imperial Highness' decision on this.

198
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,680
Good thing, someone here is clear-headed!

199
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,340
From now on, Lady of Precious Bevy Xu is rid of her consort position and demoted to a commoner.

200
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,990
She will temporarily be locked in Serene Reflection Palace to consider her wrongdoing.

201
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,960
Li Chengyin, you are too outrageous!

202
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,900
From today onwards, Crown Princess Consort is to be confined for half a month.

203
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,770
She is not to take even half a step out of Bearing Graces Hall!

204
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,190
Sese, let's go.

205
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,550
Li Chengyin! You don't know how to discern right from wrong! You're an asshole!

206
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,260
Crown Princess Consort, I deserve to die!

207
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,210
In consideration of my lowly life, stop making a fuss about this matter!

208
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,220
I thought he understood me and that he trusted me.

209
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,020
But it seems like I was just daydreaming.

210
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,050
You must properly fulfill the duty I instructed you.

211
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,130
Your Imperial Highness, don't worry. I will surely handle it appropriately.

212
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,730
Go now.

213
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,260
Yes.

214
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,320
Your Imperial Highness, this matter surely has nothing to do with Crown Princess Consort.

215
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,680
You really don't plan to get to the bottom of it?

216
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,700
What? Do you feel Crown Princess Consort has been aggrieved?

217
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,720
You're already married. Why do you still have such a stone face?

218
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,660
I considered how sincere Sese was towards me.

219
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,690
So no matter what she has done wrong, I still pity her

220
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,590
and can't bear to punish her. But I never thought that

221
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:29,850
after indulging her, she would harm an innocent person just for selfish reasons

222
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,290
and with such a vicious act.

223
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,900
With Xiaofeng's naive personality, if I don't do this,

224
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,960
she will have fallen into Sese's trap.

225
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,570
Since you know the truth—

226
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,100
Although I don't love Sese anymore,

227
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,810
I still have a responsibility towards her.

228
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,210
I will find time to point out her wrongdoings and tell her to shape up.

229
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,000
[Singing Jade Brothel]

230
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,940
You deserve this.

231
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,440
Remember it well. You can't let anyone know about this.

232
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,010
Don't worry, you.

233
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,540
I'm leaving.

234
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,400
Sir, take care then. Come back to have fun again!

235
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,970
You have to come often to play.

236
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,670
Lord, I didn't fail you.

237
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,460
Look! I got these from Singing Jade Brothel.

238
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,230
They are Mingyue's childhood clothes.

239
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,450
"On the 18th of the first month, the feather of a flying swan.

240
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,180
Everyone getting stabbed right in the middle by the cold frost sword." It's a letter written in blood.

241
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,140
How old is Mingyue?

242
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:13,500
Replying to My Lord. The brothel madam said that when she bought her, she was around four years old.

243
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,130
Now, she is most likely 24 years old.

244
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,560
Okay already. Leave now.

245
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,010
Yes.

246
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,770
I will take my leave.

247
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,320
Come here.

248
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,520
"On the 18th of the first month, the feather of a flying swan?"

249
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,890
[General Manor]

250
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,400
The 18th of the first month is the death anniversary of Gu Ruhui.

251
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,640
Everyone getting... (T/N: Literally: People, people, right)

252
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,790
"Zheng"...

253
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,880
It's Chen Zheng.

254
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,820
Chen Zheng? A rebel remnant.

255
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,900
Mingyue is connected with him?

256
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,730
Chen Zheng indeed had a daughter.

257
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,990
If she's alive, she should be at this age.

258
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,990
Chen Zheng's daughter?

259
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:28,190
Looks like this Mingyue has a scheme for deliberately approaching the emperor.

260
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,030
What Father means is Mingyue

261
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,630
deliberately approached the emperor to seek vengeance on you?

262
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,600
Sun'er has already delivered them the items.

263
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,570
Gao Yuming has always been cautious. Since he already knew about Mingyue's background,

264
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,160
he would surely rather kill an innocent than miss the culprit.

265
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,730
Let's arrange an assassination for him then.

266
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,150
Time it when Imperial Father just happens to go to Singing Jade Brothel.

267
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,370
To remove any obstacles for Gao Ruyi

268
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,710
and to completely eliminate the future trouble of the Chen family reversing the case, just these two things...

269
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:26,590
are enough for the emperor to believe that Gao Yuming wants to kill Mingyue.

270
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,980
My Lady!

271
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,200
My Lady! Lady of Precious Bevy Xu has committed suicide.

272
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,150
What? Suicide?

273
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,020
I never thought about wanting to kill her.

274
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,430
I finally know how this palace handles things.

275
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,820
When the master commits a mistake, the people below him are the ones who suffer.

276
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,590
I'm just angry.

277
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:16,270
I never thought that Li Chengyin would really be blind about what's right and wrong just for Zhao Sese.

278
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,030
Who said that I am blind about right and wrong?

279
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,860
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

280
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,320
Lady of Precious Bevy Xu has already committed suicide in fear of punishment for her crime.

281
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,500
What did you say?

282
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,670
Before she died, she wrote a confession letter.

283
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,310
She said that the peach wooden board matter was done by her alone.

284
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:43,140
Your Imperial Highness, Crown Princess Consort didn't mean that! Don't get mad!

285
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,830
Was he laughing just now? Was he laughing just now?!

286
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,220
Lady of Precious Bevy Xu who got pregnant because of him is dead and he's laughing?

287
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,540
How could he be this cold-hearted?!

288
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,330
There is some money in here. It's a gift from His Imperial Highness.

289
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,830
Take this first and live a peaceful life in your home province.

290
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,800
Thank His Imperial Highness for me.

291
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,200
I will never forget his kindness toward me.

292
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,990
May Eunuch Shi'en hand this handkerchief to His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

293
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,600
Tell him to personally give it to Crown Princess Consort.

294
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,030
Don't you Central Plains women love to make friends by exchanging handkerchiefs?

295
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,240
I'll give this handkerchief to you. If the two of us unite, we'll be stronger than gold.

296
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,430
From now on, we're truly good friends.

297
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,300
Do you like it?

298
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,890
This handkerchief is quite unique.

299
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,470
I know how to embroider. I'll embroider some flowers next time and give it back to you.

300
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,570
Take it as a token of our sisterhood.

301
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,720
When Crown Princess Consort sees this handkerchief, she will believe the words of His Imperial Highness.

302
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,630
She won't blame him anymore.

303
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,310
All right.

304
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:51,370
Ruhui, I brought Jian'er here to see you.

305
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,030
Don't worry.

306
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,900
Jian'er and I will surely punish and eliminate that wicked Prime Minister Gao Yuming.

307
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:10,800
I'll ask His Imperial Majesty to give you justice and allow your memorial tablet

308
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,570
to be worshipped in Li Empire's Shrine of Martyrs again.

309
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:32,460
That sword must be relentless and precise, not even an inch off.

310
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,480
If it's too light, we cannot fool Imperial Father.

311
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,140
But if it's under a heavy hand, Mingyue's life will be in danger.

312
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,140
You are worried about Mingyue's safety?

313
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,070
Let Gu Jian do it.

314
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,120
Are you sure that he can complete the mission?

315
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:08,160
I trust the sword within his hands.

316
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,830
All right. By that time,

317
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,430
I will tell him to take me as a hostage.

318
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,160
In order for the Shenwu Army to not hurt him, he must take me as a hostage.

319
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,160
I am also human. I cannot guarantee a flawless plan.

320
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,560
I am also not willing to gamble on Mingyue's life.

321
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,180
In that kind of situation, the person that can protect Mingyue's life

322
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:42,450
and also escape unharmed, is only you.

323
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:46,550
Is revenge really that important?

324
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,770
More important than the life of your own daughter?

325
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,980
I am not worthy to be a father.

326
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,790
At this time, you actually can still sleep?

327
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,230
Why can't I?

328
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,390
The person who can't sleep should be your Zhao Sese.

329
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,830
Isn't this the handkerchief that I gave Xuniang? How come it's with you?

330
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,550
She asked me to give it to you before she left.

331
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,130
When she left?

332
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,170
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!

333
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,060
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince, please investigate it well. Crown Princess Consort is innocent!

334
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,430
You are already in danger yourself, and you still care about her?

335
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:05,250
My lowly life is not worth anything to begin with.

336
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,960
But I can't bring Crown Princess Consort any harm.

337
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,220
You think I'm really muddled?

338
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,170
I clearly know the truth behind this matter.

339
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,310
I just want to use this chance to send you out of the palace.

340
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,130
If you trust me, then take this pill in.

341
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,390
You will surely wake up after 24 hours.

342
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,400
I believe you.

343
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:00,290
She has always wanted to leave the palace. So you knew all along?

344
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,280
Hence, you used this chance to send her out?

345
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,200
You're quite smart now. How come you didn't think that much when you slapped me?

346
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,580
Then it means... you knew that it was done by Zhao Sese?

347
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,930
Don't bring up this matter anymore. I have my plans.

348
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,210
You have a plan? I think you just want to harbor her.

349
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,380
You... are jealous?

350
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,630
Are you sick?! Who's jealous of you?

351
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,540
You're not mad anymore?

352
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,630
If you have no other matter, then please go back to your palace. I'm still under confinement to reflect on my mistakes.

353
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:55,130
Who said that I don't have any other matter? Have you forgotten your promise?

354
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,190
What?

355
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,580
You indeed have completely forgotten about it! You promised me that you'd take me to tour Singing Jade Brothel!

356
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,190
Don't even think about it. I won't take you there.

357
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,490
The distinguished crown princess consort actually went back on her words?!

358
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,000
You even deceived me. We're even.

359
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,960
Moreover, if I really brought you there and we were found out, wouldn't that taint your imperial family reputation?

360
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:26,410
Fine. You won't take me there? Don't you regret it.

361
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,920
If you take me there, I'll give you the wolf fang.

362
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,740
If you don't bring me there, this is mine. You decide.

363
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,750
If I bring you there, you'll give that to me.

364
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,760
You must be a man of your word.

365
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,290
When do you want to go?

366
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,900
Now. Immediately. At this moment.

367
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,200
If you don't agree, I won't get up.

368
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,310
Aren't you afraid of death?

369
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:03,760
What's to fear about death? When mother died, I'd already died once.

370
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,890
The more you should continue living well.

371
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,020
Continue living to watch my enemy live a happy and satisfying life?

372
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,630
That's more tormenting than dying.

373
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,420
Have you never thought of forgetting all of this and just living an ordinary peaceful life?

374
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:23,410
I did. What about you?

375
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:35,570
Everything that happened before can't be undone no matter what we do.

376
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,510
Upon birth, we were burdened with so much.

377
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,230
There are some things that we can only strive with our life.

378
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,520
Hence, even if you are to lose more things that you cherish,

379
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,960
you won't regret it?

380
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,700
If sacrifices can't be helped, I'm willing to do them.

381
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,420
We're here.

382
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,000
It's this place.

383
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,700
[Singing Jade Brothel]

384
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,230
Madam Wang!

385
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,020
Young Lord Zhou, you're here!

386
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,010
Young Lord Zhou?

387
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,420
You come here quite frequently.

388
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,830
This young lord looks quite unfamiliar.

389
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,770
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes.

390
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,560
Madam Wang, this friend of mine is a bit afraid of strangers.

391
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,470
It's fine. It's unfamiliar the first time,

392
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,420
but you'll be accustomed to it the next time.

393
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,660
Oh, right! Where's Mingyue?

394
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,210
Young Lord Zhou, you haven't been here for a while. Don't you know that

395
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,720
our Mingyue now has an intimate patron?

396
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,010
- Intimate patron?
- That's right.

397
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,630
Mingyue really has taste. This guest is so generous!

398
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,900
Since this golden patron came, Mingyue has never entertained another guest.

399
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,160
Really?

400
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,030
Mingyue is the top courtesan in Shangjing.

401
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,800
She barely pays attention to usual high officials and nobility.

402
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,140
Oh right, Madam Wang. What kind of important guest has such an ability?

403
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,230
Although I haven't seen this guest's face,

404
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,380
his manner of speech is extraordinary and has a very imposing bearing.

405
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,160
Maybe, he's some royal relative!

406
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,790
Really? I must take a look.

407
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,790
This... Young Lord Zhou, you mustn't break the rules.

408
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,550
This guest is currently drinking wine in the pavilion.

409
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,820
Madam Wang, I don't like what you just said. That person is an important guest, and I'm not?

410
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,750
Young Lord Zhou, don't get mad. How about I treat you to a table of good wine

411
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,390
and then call two favorable ladies to serve you. How about it?

412
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,150
Fine! Fine!

413
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,000
Young Lord, please go in then.

414
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,910
Young Lords, please go in.

415
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,670
You two rest first. I'll go and prepare your food and drinks.

416
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,170
Ladies, serve them well.

417
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,820
This sister, I heard that Sister Mingyue recently had an important guest visiting her.

418
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,260
What does he look like? Who is he?

419
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,910
That guest directly enters Mingyue's room.

420
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:47,980
He wears a veiled hat and acts so mysteriously. We all have never seen what he looks like.

421
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,610
How about this? There's really not much happening in here.

422
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,530
Go out first.

423
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,260
A golden leaf!

424
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,350
Thank you, Young Lord Zhou.

425
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,930
Young Lord Zhou, you don't need me to keep you company?

426
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,360
No need. Go now. I'll just call you two if I need anything.

427
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,540
- You must call us then if you need anything.
- Okay.

428
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,150
- We'll take our leave now.
- Thank you, Young Lord Zhou.

429
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,090
Do you want to meet Sister Mingyue who has the looks that can outshine the moon and put the flowers to shame?

430
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,740
I want to.

431
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,970
Sister Mingyue! Sister Mingyue!

432
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,390
Imperial Father.

433
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,600
Chengyin, why are you here?

434
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,790
Answering back to Imperial Father, I am the one who brought His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince here.

435
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,800
Does Crown Princess Consort come here often, too?

436
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,600
No, I don't come here often.

437
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,780
It's just that I acknowledge Mingyue as my elder sister,

438
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,960
so I come when I miss her.

439
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,360
Xiaofeng, so you're the crown princess consort?

440
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,700
Sister Mingyue, I am sorry I never told you.

441
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,900
I've wanted to tell you many times but I just didn't know how to tell you.

442
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,820
I know you wouldn't mind my identity.

443
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,950
I just didn't expect to reveal it to you in such a manner today.

444
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,210
You wouldn't get mad at me, would you?

445
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:22,130
I already consider you my good sister. That's not going to change.

446
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,710
It seems you two have a similar personality.

447
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,560
Imperial Father, you know that I grew up in the grasslands.

448
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,240
I am used to living together with my siblings and friends.

449
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,700
Since coming to the capital, I only have A'Du by my side.

450
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,830
But since I now have Sister Mingyue, I cherish it very much.

451
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,600
Crown Prince, did you also acknowledge a relative here?

452
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,310
No... I...

453
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:54,760
A few days ago, I lost at cards to Crown Prince.

454
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,540
Therefore, I agreed to bring him here to see the most beautiful woman in the world.

455
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,330
That's right.

456
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,110
- The most beautiful woman in the world?
- Yes.

457
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:08,000
Imperial Father, I was only curious about it, so I came to look.

458
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,490
The two of you are really husband and wife who share the same mind and are always appearing together.

459
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:22,120
Your Imperial Majesty, I came to live in this Singing Jade Hall at a young age.

460
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,530
The people around me come and go often, but no one was really close to my heart.

461
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,170
Crown Princess Consort is a kindhearted person.

462
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,680
She treated me as a good friend ever since.

463
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,150
She completely disregarded the gap in our background.

464
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,200
To be able to be sisters with someone as affectionate and faithful like Xiaofeng,

465
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,730
is truly my good fortune.

466
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:51,770
Imperial Father, may I speak a few private words with Sister Mingyue?

467
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,080
Thank you, Imperial Father.

468
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:07,300
I didn't expect that the person who made you lovesick would be of such a huge background.

469
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,000
I was so shocked.

470
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,550
I only found out much later.

471
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,030
Then you tell me, now that you know,

472
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,840
would you still think of him day and night?

473
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,700
No regrets.

474
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,330
- Hey, what are you doing? Release me!
- Are you dumb?

475
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,640
Do you not know that you were talking right in front of the current emperor earlier?

476
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,710
I do know.

477
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,970
Then, why did you still ask those crazy questions to Mingyue?

478
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,740
His Imperial Majesty is Imperial Father: the emperor, a man. He has nothing to lose.

479
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,770
I really need to know whether Sister Mingyue is truly happy and blissful.

480
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:55,210
Furthermore, in my Xi State, when it comes to love, there is no such thing as an emperor or crown prince.

481
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,530
What's important is both are willing and you two like each other.

482
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,730
But this is the capital. You can't speak like that in front of Imperial Father.

483
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,350
What is the matter with this being the capital? I will still say it.

484
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,230
Even if he punishes me to copy the "Lessons for Women," I will say it.

485
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:11,360
Then, I will punish you now. Go back and copy it thirty times.

486
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,550
Really good, Li Chengyin. And I even put on good words for you in front of Imperial Father earlier.

487
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,200
I protected your hypocritical image of a well-behaved person.

488
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,160
You turned hostile so quickly.

489
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,600
I didn't ask for your help. You are the one who wanted to say it.

490
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,620
Who became a wooden statue earlier when being questioned by Imperial Father?

491
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,130
Then copy it fifty times.

492
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,670
All right, I will go tell Imperial Father now that you were the one who asked me to bring you here!

493
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,260
Come back here!

494
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,130
- I am going.
- Come back! You are not allowed to!

495
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,670
- I'm going!
- You're not allowed to go! Come back here!

496
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,360
- Let go of me!
- Come back! Don't move!

497
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,690
- Let's go. Going!
- Let go of me, Li Chengyin! Li Chengyin!

498
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,230
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

499
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,430
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

500
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,920

00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,950
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

504
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:45,000
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

505
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,810
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

506
00:43:53,810 --> 00:44:00,760
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

507
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,110
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

508
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,910
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

509
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:15,010
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

510
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,870
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫♫

511
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,780
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

512
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,550
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

513
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:30,230
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

514
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:34,160
♫ Time reverses ♫

515
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,370
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

516
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:44,420
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

517
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:51,070
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

518
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:58,000
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

519
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,290
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

520
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,390
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

521
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,970
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

522
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,300
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

523
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:23,220
♫ A long dream ♫

524
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,960
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

525
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:35,020
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

526
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,910
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

527
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,730
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

528
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,640
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

529
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,280
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

530
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,080
♫ Time reverses ♫

531
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,290
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

532
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:04,340
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

533
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,530
