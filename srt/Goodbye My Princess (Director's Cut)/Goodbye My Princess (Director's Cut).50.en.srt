00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,980
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,650
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:37,400
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,030
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,850
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,610
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,040
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,120
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,280
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,900
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,670
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,810
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:39,130
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,930
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,630
[Episode 50]

17
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,200
Gu Jian!

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,610
Stop it!

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,300
Stop it!

20
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,270
What did you want with Xiaofeng?

21
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,920
I didn't want anything.

22
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,730
Then, why did you take her to charge out of the Vermilion Gate?

23
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,460
She didn't want to be with you. She wanted me to take her back.

24
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,990
A'Du, let Crown Princess Consort stay by herself for a while.

25
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,490
Your Imperial Highness! Your Imperial Highness!

26
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,650
Your Imperial Highness, the crown princess consort has already returned to Eastern Palace.

27
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,210
Gu Jian has completed his mission.

28
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,660
Please forgive him, Your Imperial Highness. Let him live.

29
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,550
I will definitely take Xiaofeng away.

30
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,210
Gu Jian!

31
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,290
What is your relationship with Xiaofeng?

32
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,260
Answer me!

33
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,170
She hates you.

34
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,350
Hates me?

35
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,960
I'll do what I promised. I will definitely take her away.

36
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,970
I'll wait for you!

37
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,000
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

38
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,760
Xiaofeng!

39
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,660
Your Imperial Highness!

40
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,710
Where is Crown Princess Consort?

41
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,080
She is in the garden.

42
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,700
Xiaofeng, what is the matter? What are you hiding from?

43
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,200
Xiaofeng, why are you looking at me with that kind of gaze?

44
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,960
Why?

45
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,280
You already knew Gu Jian was the assassin, right?

46
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,710
Then, why did you let him take you out of the city gate? Why haven't you returned to the palace for so long?!

47
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,530
Why?!

48
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,020
Because I didn't want to see you.

49
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,740
I want to leave you.

50
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,190
What did you say? What did you say?!

51
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,260
I said I hate you.

52
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,420
She hates you.

53
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,040
Let me go, Li Chengyin! Let me go!

54
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,280
Put me down!

55
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,040
Let me go!

56
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,650
Let me down!

57
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,660
Let me go! Let me go!

58
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,490
Li Chengyin, let me go!

59
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,470
Gu Xiaowu...

60
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,310
Gu Xiaowu...

61
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,250
Gu Xiaowu...

62
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,410
Who is Gu Xiaowu?

63
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,760
Who is Gu Xiaowu?

64
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,840
Gu Xiaowu is the man

65
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,200
who loves me the most in this world.

66
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,200
Then, do you love him?

67
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,450
Answer me.

68
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,050
Yes.

69
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,840
I love him.

70
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,140
I only love him.

71
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,260
Gu Xiaowu...

72
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,530
is Gu Jian. Right?

73
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,990
Anyway, he is not you.

74
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,810
Gu Xiaowu?

75
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,450
You must be that Gu Xiaowu.

76
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,890
She even calls out your name in her dreams.

77
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,520
Say it.

78
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,490
When did you two start?!

79
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,580
Was it in Xi State?

80
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,950
Or was it during the time you kidnapped her?

81
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,700
Listen carefully.

82
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,420
Xiaofeng being with you can only be a calamity to her.

83
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,800
She will not be happy.

84
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,100
She is not happy because of you!

85
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,320
Your appearance has disrupted her peace.

86
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,120
She is my wife.

87
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
It was you who kidnapped her.

88
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,550
It was you two who betrayed me!

89
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,760
She thinks I'm pathetic now.

90
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,980
Is that funny?

91
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,670
Stop assuming that you know everything!

92
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,750
Do you think I forcibly took away Xiaofeng?

93
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:16,350
Tell you what, Xiaofeng and I were already together in Xi State.

94
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,770
We grew up liking each other.

95
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,160
If the Central Plains didn't come requesting a marriage alliance, we would have already eloped as agreed.

96
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,500
If it weren't for you, we would have long been a legally married couple.

97
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,840
So tell me, who was the one that broke up whom?

98
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,480
Do you think I'd believe that?

99
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,690
I can feel her love for me!

100
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,540
To save me, she didn't even care about her own life!

101
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,850
You think that a few lies of yours

102
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,370
can erase all that?!

103
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,130
You are panicking. You're still lying to yourself.

104
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,740
The reason that Xiaofeng loved and admired you

105
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,560
was because she was injured before and lost her memories.

106
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,370
She temporarily forgot me. But she has remembered everything now.

107
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,670
She remembered that I'm her only lover.

108
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,120
That's why I'll take her away.

109
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,750
Take her back to Xi State.

110
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,430
Impossible!

111
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,590
Fine. I'll say it again.

112
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,550
I will definitely take Xiaofeng away.

113
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,660
Gu Jian, I'll say it again, too!

114
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,620
I'll be waiting for you.

115
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,410
A'Du, I am in so much pain.

116
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,400
My heart hurts so much.

117
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,990
Your Highness.

118
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,680
Your Imperial Highness, why are you visiting this late at night?

119
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,160
For now, we probably shouldn't see each other so often.

120
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,220
There may be spies watching us.

121
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,590
Gu Jian... must die.

122
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,470
Your Imperial Highness.

123
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,030
You and Gu Jian are both bloodlines of the Gu family.

124
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,930
You are brothers.

125
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,900
Chai Mu, when did you get so foolish?

126
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,170
The blood flowing in me is from the Li family.

127
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,920
Your Imperial Highness, I always thought that

128
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,860
you were a man that valued love and friendship.

129
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,670
Love?

130
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,350
If it wasn't for love, why would I need to kill him?

131
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,840
I am not afraid of you finding Gu Jian to tell him this. I came today to tell you this

132
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,590
as my last bit of brotherhood affection for him.

133
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,350
Your Imperial Highness.

134
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,090
You are going to be the person who ascends the throne.

135
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,700
I beg of you to not lower yourself down to Gu Jian's level.

136
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,890
The throne of the royal family is piercingly cold to the bone.

137
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,970
If the person sitting on it is not colder than it,

138
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,770
how can he be the one that sits on it?

139
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,740
Crown Prince.

140
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,470
The crown prince just left Chai Mu's place.

141
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,090
Did you get a clear look?

142
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,110
Yes, I definitely looked clearly. It was the crown prince.

143
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,980
- Keep an eye on them.
- Yes, My Lord.

144
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,570
Miss Mingyue, let me call for the imperial physician.

145
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,230
That's not necessary.

146
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,980
I am fine. I just need to rest a little.

147
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,580
Miss Mingyue, the palace purchasing clerk went shopping at Weipin Pavilion yesterday.

148
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,290
The emperor especially asked to buy a precious zither playbook from Weipin Pavilion.

149
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,250
He said that you must look it over.

150
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,800
Bring the playbook to me.

151
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,400
His Imperial Majesty has arrived.

152
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,360
- Mingyue greets Your Imperial Majesty.
- No need for formalities.

153
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,100
You all can leave.

154
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,930
I heard the sound of your instrument from far away.

155
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,390
I know that this is your favorite piece.

156
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,260
After hearing you play music,

157
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,130
my tiredness from these past days has disappeared.

158
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,260
If you like listening to me play,

159
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,350
then I can play for you every day.

160
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,100
Sit down.

161
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,140
There are many affairs in court.

162
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,830
I could not come and see you these past days. It must've been hard on you.

163
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,740
I do not feel wronged. I am thankful for your love, Your Imperial Majesty.

164
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,620
You're only thankful?

165
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,630
There are many people who are thankful to me, but not everyone

166
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,530
can stay beside me.

167
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,100
I... I earnestly ask that you allow me to leave the palace.

168
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,550
Why?

169
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,370
Your Imperial Majesty, the palace is not the place for me.

170
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,100
I don't want to make things hard for you.

171
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,220
Who can make things hard for me?

172
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,650
Your Imperial Majesty, I am just a commoner.

173
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,220
Your great kindness will be remembered by me forever.

174
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,750
You already gave me the best gift.

175
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,500
Mingyue, what's wrong with you today?

176
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,910
I am speaking truthfully from the bottom of my heart. I am not playing around.

177
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,780
Tell me. What has happened? I don't want to guess.

178
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,850
Your Imperial Majesty, I...

179
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,250
am pregnant.

180
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,910
You're pregnant? Really?!

181
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,830
It is a joyous event!

182
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,700
But why do you want to leave the palace?

183
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,530
Disregarding that it is my child, even commoners

184
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,990
would not let their children live a life without their father.

185
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,460
I am not willing to let him get involved in the power struggle inside the palace at such a young age.

186
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,470
You're so silly.

187
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,600
You are now carrying my child.

188
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,770
Who dares to still fight with you?

189
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,760
Your Imperial Majesty...

190
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,100
Just stay here in the palace. Once you have been conferred a title,

191
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,760
you can officially bear my child.

192
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,010
Your Imperial Highness.

193
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,160
Pei Zhao.

194
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,970
From now on, mobilize three hundred more soldiers from the Yulin Army to watch over the Eastern Palace.

195
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,010
Set up an ambush on the inside and outside of every palace hall.

196
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,480
What has happened, Your Imperial Highness?

197
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
You just have to follow my orders.

198
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,310
Remember. The outside must seem lax while the inside is heavily guarded.

199
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,770
You can allow a sparrow to fly in, but even a fly cannot go out.

200
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,410
Yes, Sir.

201
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,000
My Lady, I have something important to report.

202
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,910
You may leave.

203
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,200
Yes.

204
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,560
Come here.

205
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,900
My Lady, Miss Mingyue is pregnant.

206
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,110
His Imperial Majesty has even personally promised her that he would make her an imperial consort.

207
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,720
What?

208
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,590
His Imperial Majesty said that it was the happiest he has been in days. His Imperial Majesty also said...

209
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,960
What did he also say?

210
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,630
His Imperial Majesty said that he was willing to go against the rules of the palace for Miss Mingyue.

211
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,990
- He even said that no one in the palace can fight with Miss Mingyue for his affection.
- I—

212
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,790
My Lady, please calm down.

213
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,780
I went through so many hardships to bear his child.

214
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,810
What kind of vixen or monster is Mingyue?

215
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,710
How can she, in a matter of days, bear a child already?

216
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,040
My Lady, please calm down! My Lady, try not to affect the baby in your womb or hurt your health because of anger.

217
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:03,330
I initially thought... thought that this child

218
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,400
could let His Imperial Majesty take consideration of our husband and wife relationship,

219
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,680
and think about the merit of the Gao family for assisting the court for so many years.

220
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,870
But now,

221
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,600
I fear that only that slut's child is in His Imperial Majesty's eyes right now.

222
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,530
Crown Princess Consort, Miss Mingyue is here to see you.

223
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,340
- Xiaofeng.
- Sister Mingyue.

224
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,690
After not seeing you for so many days, why have you gotten so skinny?

225
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,700
She hasn't been eating, of course, she will be skinnier. Miss Mingyue, can you help me persuade Crown Princess Consort?

226
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,300
Yongniang, you can go and rest. I want to have a few words with Sister Mingyue.

227
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,750
I will take my leave now.

228
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,850
Why aren't you eating? Your health is yours.

229
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,380
In the past, I'd frequently heard you compliment Yongniang's cooking skills.

230
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:27,390
- It will be a waste if you don't eat it.
- Sister Mingyue,

231
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,600
do you remember that day in Singing Jade Brothel,

232
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,930
I asked you a question? I asked if you still felt happy and blissful

233
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:39,980
when you learned that he was the emperor. You answered yes.

234
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,300
But if I ask you again, will you answer the same?

235
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:59,200
I will, but there are certain things that cannot be solved with love.

236
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,280
I always thought that I could be strong enough to endure everything.

237
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,330
But I am just a woman. I want stability.

238
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,800
I want a family. If I cannot see the road ahead,

239
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,530
I feel uncertain.

240
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,840
This feeling of uncertainty makes me feel helpless,

241
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,730
and frequently makes me question if what I am doing is worth it.

242
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,270
The palace really makes things harder on everyone. I can't believe that someone who sees things very clearly like you,

243
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,300
would also fall inside it.

244
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,760
The people from the royal family have always been fickle. In order to achieve their goals,

245
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,120
they are willing to sacrifice everything.

246
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,090
I am very scared... that you will be like me.

247
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,200
Xiaofeng, if you love someone,

248
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,940
you will have to give up some things.

249
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,360
But on the other hand, if you did something that crossed the line,

250
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,450
then your love will have a hole that cannot be fixed.

251
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,930
But feelings cannot be calculated like that.

252
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,800
You have to understand that the crown prince is not an ordinary person.

253
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,640
Maintaining his position as the crown prince is just as hard as that of an emperor.

254
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,280
What he has to go through is often more than you can imagine.

255
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,540
You should try to understand him.

256
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,430
What if the person who killed your family were the emperor?

257
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,080
Would you still pardon and forgive him?

258
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,350
Godfather.

259
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,360
Starting from today, you do not need to enter

260
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,900
this door behind me.

261
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,530
Why?

262
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,110
Leave. The farther the better.

263
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,190
Never return to the capital. And do not come to find me.

264
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
What happened?

265
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,810
I do not need you anymore. You brought disgrace to our mission,

266
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,340
I no longer trust you.

267
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,640
Drink it.

268
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,500
What is this?

269
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,510
A bowl of water.

270
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,380
I want you to think of it as the water from the River of Oblivion. After you drink it,

271
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,500
you must forget all the things I have told you, forget the sword skills I've taught you,

272
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:07,970
forget the revenge I've told you, and even me, you have to forget.

273
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:12,920
Li Chengyin wants to kill me?

274
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,320
Don't ask anything. Just leave.

275
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,790
I won't leave.

276
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,720
Stop dreaming! Xiaofeng cannot be yours!

277
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,900
She is the crown princess consort! Li Chengyin is the crown prince! The crown prince of today will be the emperor of tomorrow.

278
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,890
If a ruler wants his subordinate to die, then he must die. Have you heard of that phrase?

279
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:34,220
I don't even acknowledge him as the crown prince!

280
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,900
Then, do you acknowledge me as your godfather?!

281
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,660
Godfather,

282
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,290
I am unfilial.

283
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,780
The things that I have once firmly believed in could actually become as light as a feather.

284
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
While there are certain things that are more important than my life.

285
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,740
Xiaofeng... jumped into the River of Oblivion,

286
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,330
but she still remembers.

287
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,500
What then can I forget?

288
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,870
You are asking for your death!

289
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,490
Your Imperial Highness!

290
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:59,150
If you have something to say, then I recommend you to not say a thing.

291
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,500
Are you clear with my order?

292
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,160
I am clear.

293
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,000
Then go.

294
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,210
It's Chen Zheng.

295
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,050
How could it be?

296
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,470
It seems like there are changes with the crown prince.

297
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,900
I should've thought of it earlier. After so many years, he would have found out sooner or later.

298
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,840
It is just that I never expected

299
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,730
who that expert behind him was.

300
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,590
If I don't make a move, it will be too late.

301
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,830
[Eastern Palace]

302
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,750
You still want to stop me? Move aside.

303
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,370
Move aside!

304
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,400
Don't come inside. I don't have anything to say to you.

305
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,590
Xiaofeng, how long are you going to be this difficult?!

306
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,300
I am not being difficult. I just simply hate you.

307
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,900
Hate me? You all say you hate me.

308
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,350
Let me ask you then... What do you hate about me?

309
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,410
I hate that you are Li Chengyin and not Gu Xiaowu!

310
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,560
Gu Xiaowu again? Is there nothing else that we can talk about other than Gu Xiaowu?!

311
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,550
What else do you want me to say to you?

312
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,270
Xiaofeng, you just care about being sad without Gu Xiaowu.

313
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,770
Have you thought about how I feel?

314
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,780
You locked yourself inside the palace without eating or drinking. Did you think about whether I would feel sad about it or not?

315
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,500
You are my wife. I treat you wholeheartedly.

316
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,220
I know that you haven't forgotten the beautiful memories we shared with each other. Was all of that fake?

317
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,950
It was all fake.

318
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,110
I forgot about them. You should forget them, too.

319
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,030
How can I forget?

320
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,870
Teach me how.

321
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,110
Let me kill you, then you can forget.

322
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:09,260
I won't let you kill me. I want you to live with me.

323
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,490
I want you to personally see how Gu Xiaowu will die.

324
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,690
You are familiar with this, right?

325
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,620
Why is it with you?

326
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,090
I know that this is how you two communicate. Today, I will release this whistle arrow for you.

327
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,970
I will see whether he comes or not. If he dares to come, my Yulin Army will make sure thousands of arrows pierce through him.

328
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,700
He won't come. He knows that he will die if he comes, so he won't.

329
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,830
Aren't you always thinking of him? Why don't you believe that he will risk his life to see you?

330
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,840
Because my life is worthless compared to other things.

331
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,540
That's great.

332
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,900
If he doesn't come, then forget about him.

333
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:59,320
But if he dares to come, I will help you kill him.

334
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,520
Gu Jian.

335
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,570
Li Chengyin, don't do it!

336
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,810
Li Chengyin!

337
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,440
Gu Jian.

338
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,020
Gu Jian.

339
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,680
Gu Jian, hurry and leave.

340
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,290
Li Chengyin set up an ambush here in the Eastern Palace.

341
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,310
He is waiting to catch you!

342
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,320
I know.

343
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,040
You know and yet you are here to die?

344
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,950
Hurry, leave. Quickly go!

345
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm not leaving.

346
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,880
Why?

347
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,460
There's no one here who can hurt me, but they all could take your life!

348
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,980
I promised you before that if you release the whistling arrow, I would appear.

349
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,770
In the past, I'd broken my promise too many times.

350
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,730
But this time, I won't.

351
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,860
We can't escape.

352
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,120
We will die.

353
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,270
How do we know if we don't try?

354
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,370
That way! Hurry!

355
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,700
- Stop right there!
- Hurry! Keep up!

356
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,990
Stop there! Hurry!

357
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,110
That way! Hurry and follow them!

358
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,910
Hurry! Keep up!

359
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,940
Hurry up!

360
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,220
This way!

361
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,930
Keep up! Hurry!

362
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,090
Hurry and follow them!

363
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,060
Don't run!

364
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,950
Let's go.

365
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,710
You two, leave first!

366
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,260
Let's go.

367
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,730
Release the arrows!

368
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,690
A'Du!

369
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,580
A'Du, let go!

370
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,300
Or else, we will both fall down!

371
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,460
Let go!

372
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,000
A'Du!

373
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,350
Don't mind me. Go save A'Du. Hurry!

374
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,230
- Stay here and don't move.
- Yes.

375
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,780
A'Du.

376
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,580
Crown Princess Consort.

377
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,460
Pei Zhao.

378
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,050
Let's go.

379
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,230
That way, hurry!

380
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,510
Stop running!

381
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,810
Hurry, that way! After them!

382
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,530
Stop trying to break inside. Leave now.

383
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,400
I am a subordinate. The orders from my ruler cannot be opposed!

384
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,620
I understand.

385
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,460
Gu Jian!

386
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,150
Take care.

387
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,920
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

388
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,090
