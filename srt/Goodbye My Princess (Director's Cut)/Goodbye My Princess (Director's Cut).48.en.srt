00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,920
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,600
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,290
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,040
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,890
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,530
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,090
♫ If you're not by my side ♫

9
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:11,210
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,950
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,650
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,870
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:39,110
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,970
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,770
[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,620
[Episode 48]

17
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,330
Imperial Father, everything I said is the truth. It's Minister Gao. Minister Gao had bribed them.

18
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,190
As the head proctor, Gao Yuming violated the law and disrupted the exam system by buying and selling court positions.

19
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,830
He allowed countless mediocre or useless candidates to serve in the government.

20
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,050
If even you are blinded by those who ignore the law of the land,

21
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,880
allowing them to violate the rules and shake the country's foundation,

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,660
one day we will lose the heart of the people; and therefore, the country.

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,790
Leave!

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,670
I've stayed comfortably on my crown prince position for 20 some years.

25
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,180
I've never said "no" to you, Imperial Father.

26
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,690
I don't understand why you don't want to clear up the case.

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,670
Are you ignoring the laws so you can protect those criminals?

28
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,470
Do you really want to be known as a fatuous emperor by history?

29
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,170
I don't have your cold-bloodedness.

30
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,570
Father is being arbitrary. You don't want to know the truth.

31
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,020
Maybe when the party of Gao has taken over the Li Empire,

32
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,000
you will finally understand what I'm saying.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,420
Today, I saw everyone kneeling at the court.

34
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,360
I still feel glad about it whenever I think about it.

35
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,390
That's showing off too much.

36
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,570
It's not advantageous for us to show all our strength.

37
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,830
Didn't you see that the emperor still wanted the crown prince to investigate me?

38
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,610
Father, the crown prince is on our side.

39
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,940
I used to think that even though he called you uncle,

40
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,260
he was still distant from us by a few layers.

41
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,460
After today, I think I was too narrow-minded.

42
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,980
That Zong Hwan should be easy. After all, he is one of our people.

43
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,040
We just need to prepare some gold and jewelry, pass the word, and this matter is done.

44
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,890
Frame this calligraphy and send it to Zong Hwan.

45
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,150
"There are lots of people but only a few who really know me."
(T/N: From the poem "Entrusting my Sentiments to Bingzhou" by Xue Neng)

46
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,540
"If one doesn't have a bosom friend, he will end up loving wine."

47
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,560
"I always fear that without you here, there won't be any fun in living."

48
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,360
"It was a waste how my younger years were spent in Bingzhou."

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,020
Father, this is...

50
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,410
Zong Hwan has high integrity.

51
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,010
He's made many enemies these past years in court.

52
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,520
Without my recommendation and promotion,

53
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,810
he would not have reached his present-day glory.

54
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,470
Even though he has been a government official for many years,

55
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,920
I think he is still proud of his virtues.

56
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,400
To this kind of person, money will create the opposite effect.

57
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,190
This calligraphy is to remind him not to ever forget

58
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,810
how a poor but talented person reached where he is today.

59
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,260
As for the money, use it on the family of those scholars that committed suicide.

60
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,650
Seal their mouths tightly.

61
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,020
Father, you are really smart.

62
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,560
Who does that Xi Qingzhuo think he is to dispute you?

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,460
We should think of something to straighten him up.

64
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,870
Just an old stubborn scholar. No need to waste anything on him.

65
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,760
The key point is, where did that bloodletter come from?

66
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,520
Should we look into those that followed the previous Crown Prince Li Chengji?

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,800
Old Master! Old Master.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,390
What is it?

69
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,350
Prime Minister Gao has sent you a calligraphy painting.

70
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,150
Good, let's take a look.

71
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,580
Old Master, look.

72
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,100
"There are lots of people but only a few who really know me."

73
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,360
"If one doesn't have a bosom friend, he will end up loving wine."

74
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,090
"I always fear that without you here, there won't be any fun in living."

75
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,020
"It was a waste of how my younger years were spent in Bingzhou."

76
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,510
Gao Yuming is truly smart.

77
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,300
He knows I will not accept gold or precious items.

78
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,020
So, he sent over this calligraphy

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,670
to remind me to repay his recognition of me.

80
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,400
Gao Yuming, Gao Yuming...

81
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,470
You should never have

82
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,040
written down the words "Bingzhou."

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,250
Master, should we hang it up?

84
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,170
- Put it in storage.
- Yes, Old Master.

85
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,150
Xiaowu, I caught one!

86
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,990
I caught... I caught... I caught...

87
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,770
I caught...

88
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,280
The rock is so slippery.

89
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,050
No need, I'll do it myself.

90
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,340
Why hasn't A'Du returned? It's been a long time.

91
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,800
We didn't get any fish either. We can only wait for A'Du to bring some yams back.

92
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,050
We'll bake them together later.

93
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,530
All right.

94
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,200
The water is too cold. I shouldn't have let you get into it to catch fish.

95
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,800
It's all right.

96
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,030
Come.

97
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,790
My hands are warmer.

98
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,290
A'Du.

99
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,140
I really feel that I'm lucky.

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,470
I initially thought that here in the Central Plains that you were my only loved one.

101
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,780
But now, there's also Gu Xiaowu.

102
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,860
I thank Heaven for letting me find him again.

103
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,230
For remembering him.

104
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,750
What else can I ask for?

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,690
A'Du, look. There are so many stars in the sky.

106
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,560
But I still don't think that they are as bright as the ones in Xi State.

107
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:53,390
Li Chengyin, I'm going back to Xi State soon.

108
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,730
Gu Xiaowu!

109
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,020
Gu Xiaowu! Gu Xiaowu! Gu Xiaowu!

110
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,330
Gu Xiaowu!

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,250
Gu Xiaowu!

112
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,230
Your Imperial Highness, although the crown princess consort was taken by the assassin,

113
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,280
it's good that we now know

114
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,890
she is all right.

115
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,780
Zhao, do you think Xiaofeng has been taken away

116
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,420
or that she really wanted to leave?

117
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,030
Your Imperial Highness, you are overthinking. Crown Princess Consort has always been full of ideas.

118
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,140
She probably has her thoughts on why she did it.

119
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,480
She has usually been so simple-minded,

120
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,940
but so full of mischievous ideas. She loved causing trouble

121
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,030
and so stubborn like a bull.

122
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,920
Her stubbornness not only brought her trouble.

123
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,640
Sometimes, she was able to hit the right path and helped us big time.

124
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,040
But I didn't want her to get involved in our conflicts.

125
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,570
I only wanted her to stay simple-minded every day.

126
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,260
I only wanted her to fight with me,

127
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,150
argue with me, make a ruckus every day.

128
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:30,430
I only wanted... her to stay in the Eastern Palace

129
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,580
and wait for me to return.

130
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:45,180
Zhao, could it be she doesn't like Shangjing?

131
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,400
Does she want to return to Xi State?

132
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,870
Do you feel homesick?

133
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,500
Yes... I do when I feel happy,

134
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,420
and I do when I feel sad.

135
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,370
So, are you feeling happy or sad now?

136
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,090
Happy!

137
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,410
Do you have a problem?

138
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,720
None.

139
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,540
Rest early. We'll leave the city first thing in the morning.

140
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,710
Xiaowu, I'm thinking that it would be the Shangyuan Festival soon.

141
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,090
Why don't we leave after the festival instead?

142
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,760
The longer we stay here, the easier it will be for the guards to find us.

143
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,080
Also, there are so many people during the Shangyuan Festival. It is not convenient for us to go out in the streets.

144
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,400
Why so? There will surely be a lot of people out in the streets that day.

145
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,780
If we mixed within the crowd, it would be harder to be noticed.

146
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,800
Also, other than grilling fish and roasting yams,

147
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,030
we haven't eaten anything else these past two days.

148
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,450
I want to go to Mi Luo's place and have a good meal.

149
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,490
Are you unable to put Li Chengyin down?

150
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,570
No such thing. Now that I know that you are Gu Xiaowu,

151
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,170
I won't allow my heart to have someone else.

152
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,240
What if I wasn't Gu Xiaowu?

153
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,670
How could you not be Gu Xiaowu?

154
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,880
You clearly look the same as the man in my dream.

155
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,200
Also, you have the scent of Xi State on you. That can't fool anyone, right?

156
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,110
Xiaowu, I don't want to leave this place so hastily.

157
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,500
Can't we say farewell to this place in a magnanimous manner before leaving?

158
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:04,500
Okay. After the Shangyuan Festival, we will immediately leave.

159
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:12,040
Xiaowu, believe me. I will always stay by your side.

160
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:19,030
We will be together forever. I promise.

161
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,050
"From late night 'til dawn," 
(T/N: From the poem "Encourage Learning" by Yan Zhen Qing)

162
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,530
"It's the best time for the youth to study."

163
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,720
"Not knowing they should study hard when they were young."

164
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,180
"They will regret as they turn old."

165
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,590
Teacher, you said, "From late night until dawn was the best time to study."

166
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:49,550
But late at night, my mother is still busy in weaving and cultivating silkworms.

167
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,930
And at dawn, my father gets up to pasture cattle and plow the fields.

168
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,850
They can't read or write.

169
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,970
You will have cloth only by weaving and cultivating silkworms.

170
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,780
And you will have food by pasturing cattle and plowing fields.

171
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,780
Teacher, if we have clothes to wear and food to eat,

172
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,360
why do we still need to study?

173
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,360
A scholar, even if he doesn't have enough to eat or wear,

174
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,570
he will not feel miserable.

175
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,280
This is because a gentleman will persevere in the face of difficulty.

176
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,890
The more knowledge one has, the higher one will stand, and his horizon will be broadened.

177
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,170
He will no longer pay attention to a comfortable life and secular magnificence.

178
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,300
When your mind is occupied with the country, you will only focus on

179
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,860
peace and misery; these two things.

180
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,270
Teacher, what are peace and misery?

181
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,660
Peace, when people have enough to eat and wear.

182
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,030
Misery is when people don't have enough to eat and wear.

183
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:01,530
I understand now. A learned person doesn't care about his own happiness,

184
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,890
but other people's happiness.

185
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,890
To become a gentleman, one needs to work hard for peace on Earth.

186
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,230
Well said!

187
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,190
But not all learned men are gentlemen.

188
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,180
When you're growing up, you have to learn to be a real gentleman.

189
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,940
A true gentleman lives for his aspiration and dies for his aspiration.

190
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,380
Yes, Teacher!

191
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,250
Let's go! Let's go!

192
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,790
Let's go. Going home!

193
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,400
Hurry!

194
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,630
Let's go!

195
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,540
Let's go!

196
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,690
Catch up!

197
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,620
Slow down!

198
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,870
It's a blessing that in my life, I've lived like a gentleman.

199
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,140
Father, we found that grand preceptor that you asked me to search for.

200
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,400
It's just that when we found him, he had already committed suicide.

201
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,380
His corpse is even hanging inside his house.

202
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,500
It looks like he just died recently.

203
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,160
I fear that he knew long before that we'd go find him.

204
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,100
This matter is indeed not that simple.

205
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,160
Who is this person behind the scenes? The crown prince?

206
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,380
The crown prince? No way.

207
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,360
The emperor?

208
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,290
I fear that someone has long started a slow fire to stew something, while we thought all along that it was just cooking soup.

209
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,730
Write to your brother.

210
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,970
If we want to end this matter with us being safe, we can only rely on him

211
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:07,910
in earning us merit from His Imperial Majesty.

212
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,900
[Protectorate General Office]

213
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,680
Yuan Tong!

214
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,410
I'm here!

215
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,890
- General.
- How much money do we still have? Do we have 20,000 taels?

216
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,580
Replying to General. I fear that we can't come up with that much immediately.

217
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
Swallow it down first.

218
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,250
Hasn't the salary for last month not been distributed yet?

219
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,170
It doesn't seem proper to touch that.

220
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,730
Why not?

221
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,330
Don't worry. In a few days, there will be money to fill the gap.

222
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,120
Since Danchi has been eliminated, it's been so long since we played a good act.

223
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,330
What General means is...

224
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,720
Do this. Immediately come up with the money.

225
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,540
Write the king of Shuobo a secret message.

226
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,230
Tell him that I want to invite him for a drink.

227
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,520
My Lord, an urgent report from the Western Border Protectorate General Office. The Shuobo Tribe was able to conquer the three cities

228
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,370
Huaibian, Xizhu, and Youshan in just one whole day.

229
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,100
How is that possible? Any news from the Protectorate General Office?

230
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,990
The two parties fought, but the Western Border Protectorate General Office couldn't resist them and was forced to retreat.

231
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,940
What is this Gao Xian trying to do?

232
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
My Lord, are we going to go there and provide reinforcement?

233
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,480
No. Order the whole army to be on guard and stay put.

234
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,430
- Let's wait for what Shangjing will say.
- Yes.

235
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,400
Xiaofeng wants to wait after the Shangyuan Festival before returning to Xi State.

236
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,690
What? We can't do so.

237
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,220
The more we delay it, the more it would be dangerous. You better convince the ninth princess not to do so.

238
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,540
Let us just satisfy her wish.

239
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,380
She has to truly let go of everything here.

240
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,590
I have thought about it. We can use the disturbance during the Shangyuan Festival

241
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,420
to directly leave the city through the Bearing the Heaven Gate.

242
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,360
Usually, when there are few people, it will be harder to go out of the city.

243
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,790
Okay.

244
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,620
What? Shuobo is suddenly making rebellious movements?

245
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,150
What then are the people of the Protectorate General Office doing?

246
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,360
Where is Gao Xian?

247
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,470
Your Imperial Majesty, this is an urgent memorial from General Gao.

248
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,590
What sandstorm?! Not enough rations, soldiers, and horses?!

249
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,520
Why did he not report this before?! He only thought of reporting it now!

250
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,820
What has Gao Xian been doing?!

251
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,270
Your Imperial Majesty, on behalf of my son, I ask for punishment.

252
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,250
May Your Imperial Majesty take back Gao Xian's military badge and be reassigned.

253
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,610
Your Imperial Majesty, there is an urgent war at the borders now. General Gao lost the first battle.

254
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:10,590
However, he has numerous experiences when it comes to the war at the border.

255
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,970
He is the only choice in pacifying the uprising of the Shuobo Tribe. As long as we send over more rations and military equipment,

256
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,850
there is still a chance to pacify the Shuobo uprising.

257
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,440
I ask Your Imperial Majesty to punish me for my crime.

258
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,790
Prime Minister Gao, what crime have you committed?

259
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:33,720
In the rebellion of Shuobo, Gao Xian is the main commander, yet he failed to resist the enemy.

260
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,590
I am his father.

261
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,860
I was unable to teach my son well and that is my first crime. I am the head of the cabinet of the current empire.

262
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,720
The army garrisoned in the Western Border lacks rations and men.

263
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,420
I failed to know this and that is an oversight of mine. That's my second crime.

264
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,360
May Your Imperial Majesty punish me sternly.

265
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,830
Prime Minister, please rise.

266
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:20,540
Prime Minister Gao, I know of your loyalty.

267
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:28,660
Promulgate my decree! Gao Xian is being promoted to Far Subduing Generalissimo.

268
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,420
Rations and military equipment must be immediately supplied to his army.

269
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,350
I hope Generalissimo can successfully pacify the uprising of Shuobo.

270
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,480
Thank you for Your Imperial Majesty's graces.

271
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,590
Your Imperial Majesty is wise!

272
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,080
When I was still a prince,

273
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,390
I frequently told bold statements to my imperial brothers,

274
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,670
as if I could do anything.

275
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:09,390
I always felt that I could obtain the empire in front of me just by extending my hand.

276
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,540
But after I ascended to the throne,

277
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,690
I realized that I totally can't clearly see

278
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:21,340
how this empire looks like. I also couldn't clearly see

279
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,930
what position in this empire should an emperor be standing.

280
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,200
Tell me. Am I...

281
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,940
still the son of Heaven?

282
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,810
Of course, you are.

283
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:43,140
I dare not guess the intentions of Your Imperial Majesty,

284
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,220
but I know that you are the son of Heaven.

285
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,510
The reason that one is the son of Heaven

286
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,110
is not only because he has complied to the will of his citizens, but more because he has complied to the will of Heaven.

287
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,840
Since it is complying with the will of Heaven, Your Imperial Majesty is naturally standing above this empire.

288
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,990
No one can waver the position that the will of Heaven has bestowed you.

289
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:13,580
Zong Huan, let me be frank with you.

290
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,440
I only have one question for you.

291
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,450
Why did you stop investigating the case about the imperial civil examinees?

292
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,750
Does Minister Xi not know that this is an order from the emperor?

293
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,870
It was His Imperial Majesty who halted the investigation?

294
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,620
When did His Imperial Majesty make such a decree?

295
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,760
I did not know that there was a new decree.

296
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,940
Some of the decrees of His Imperial Majesty may be written in books,

297
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,060
some on his face, and some are even written on his heart.

298
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,300
Minister Xi, you should know that the war in the northwestern region is quite intense.

299
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,090
His Imperial Majesty has to rely on the power of Prime Minister Gao in the northwest.

300
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,190
What official position do we have?

301
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,120
Do you want to throw eggs on a stone, or seek for your own destruction?

302
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,880
Self-preservation. An ant is greedy to survive.

303
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,380
Perhaps a scholar's conscience no longer exists.

304
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,770
Xi Qingzhuo, as a scholar, my conscience is no less than yours.

305
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,230
Then, do you still remember the case of the exam candidates who were wronged and driven to death?

306
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,310
The oldest one who kept failing the exam

307
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,220
and finally died uncleared of a false charge in Bingzhou,

308
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,730
he was Old Master Mu, your first teacher.

309
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,090
How did you find out about this?

310
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,800
To tell you the truth. That night,

311
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,770
the bloodletter that appeared in my study room, a note was attached to it.

312
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:46,510
It listed in detail all the seven scholars' life history and all the names of their friends and relatives.

313
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,980
In the section of Old Master Mu,

314
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,430
I discovered your name.

315
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,080
That's why in the court that day, when the crown prince recommended you to investigate the case,

316
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,530
all the court ministers thought that you were Minister Gao's man.

317
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:07,070
So the case would be concluded without a conclusion. Only me...

318
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,090
I was still holding on to a glimmer of hope.

319
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,630
I imagined that you would look up to books of the sages with great respect.

320
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:21,630
And that you didn't forget to honor the teacher and respect his teaching and knew the meanings of righteousness and loyalty.

321
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,360
Too bad. How could the empty fame of a scholar

322
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,460
win against the official hat of the minister of the Ministry of Personnel?

323
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,410
It is exactly because I have once read all those books by sages

324
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,540
and spent so many years of hard work and arduous training in the political arena;

325
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,620
that's why I will not be like a pedantic old man like you,

326
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,720
who only knows to show off a moment of strength

327
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,360
and eventually cause the eternal loss of the last hope of exonerating those scholars.

328
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,720
You... You are...

329
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,310
What you?! Did I say anything wrong?!

330
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,930
Do you think that in investigating a case, one must openly wear a flag and beat the drums?

331
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:01,330
If everyone was as rash as you, so many innocent people would have died

332
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,990
even before the investigation of this case had finished.

333
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,000
I knew it! I knew it!

334
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
I wasn't wrong about you.

335
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,700
Okay already. Leave.

336
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,960
Are you mad at me?

337
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,030
I am apologizing to you now. Sorry.

338
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,820
How could I have so much idle time to be angry?

339
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,440
Do you not know that the people of Gao Manor have been keeping a watchful eye on me?

340
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,750
Oh...

341
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,880
If needed, I have to do an act for everyone to see.

342
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,150
I understand.

343
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,470
Minister Xi, may I trouble you to write down a list of names when you go back.

344
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,000
Send your most trusted aide to deliver it to me.

345
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,670
I will send people to follow that clue and immediately rush to Bingzhou

346
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,990
for a thorough investigation.

347
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,580
Okay already. Leave. Do you really want me to expel you out?

348
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,450
I'll go. I'll go.

349
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,210
Minister Xi, put on an act.

350
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,400
Put on an act!

351
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,420
You villain! You are such a coward!

352
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,960
Take care.

353
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,610
Stop!

354
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,130
[Gate Pass from the Ministry of Personnel]

355
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,850
- Where are you going?
- Bingzhou.

356
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,350
Let him pass!

357
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,310
Father, I heard earlier that Xi Qingzhuo went to look for Zong Huan,

358
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,990
yet he ended up being kicked out of there.

359
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:50,550
He was so mad that he kept cursing outside the manor of Zong Huan for an hour.

360
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,130
During the Shangyuan Festival, there will be so many people out in the streets.

361
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,410
Gu Jian might use this chance to take Xiaofeng out of the city.

362
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,500
I have already sent a lot of men to strictly guard each city gate.

363
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,650
If they are to go out of the city,

364
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,610
returning to Xi State is their only choice.

365
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,200
And this Bearing the Heaven Gate is a path they must take.

366
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,030
I need you to guard it.

367
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,200
I understand.

368
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,830
If they really appear, I will leave Gu Jian to you.

369
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,450
He must not fall into other people's hands.

370
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:34,310
As for Xiaofeng, I must take her back with me.

371
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,160
I will not let Gu Jian fool around again.

372
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,150
I know. Gu Jian is your disciple. You have always treated him like your own son.

373
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,430
His surname is Gu.Whether based on reason or affection,

374
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,390
I should leave him some dignity.

375
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,770
But if he does not know to mend his ways,

376
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,700
repeatedly doing what he wishes without restraint,

377
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,250
I fear that I do not have such good patience anymore.

378
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,120
You also should not keep being softhearted.

379
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,600
I will surely put the general situation above all.

380
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,940
I must go back now. I still have to enter the palace later.

381
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,070
Your Imperial Highness!

382
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:29,430
Your Imperial Highness, have you seen Mingyue?

383
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,740
Can you relay a message to her?

384
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,930
What message? Wishes for the holiday?

385
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,410
Mingyue is not an ordinary woman. For so many years, she was able to survive by herself.

386
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,530
At this critical moment, why must you disturb the state of her heart?

387
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:55,180
You must know that the more you care for her, the harder it is for her to endure palace life.

388
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,820
The hardest thing to do when it comes to familial love is to not mutually drag each other down.

389
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:04,340
I understand what you mean.

390
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,680
But no matter what, today is a reunion day.

391
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,220
As a father...

392
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,860
Revenge hasn't been sought yet, evil people are in power at the imperial court, my empire's lands are not peaceful,

393
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,980
there are unending problems both internally and externally. How could we still speak about reunions?

394
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,120
For us, the Shangyuan Festival

395
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,980
is just the same as every other day of the past.

396
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,740
Old Master!

397
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,360
Come in.

398
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,430
Crown Prince sent a secret message.

399
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,810
[...there must be an inside story regarding the uprising of Shuobo. Find evidence of the collusion between Shuobo and Gao Xian...]

400
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,790
Crown Prince is indeed very sensitive. Immediately give my command

401
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,960
to have people clearly investigate the background of Shuobo and Gao Xian.

402
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,380
Remember, hard evidence must be found.

403
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,910
Yes.

404
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,390
Gao Xian...

405
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,420
It's time for this game of yours of breeding bandits to make yourself eventually look good

406
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,870
to end its performance soon.

407
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,890
Your Imperial Highness has lost quite a bit of weight lately.

408
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,460
This belt is exactly one inch too long now.

409
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,850
Did Your Imperial Highness not sleep well last night?

410
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,650
No, I slept very well.

411
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:09,560
Even if you don't cherish your own body,

412
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,960
I do worry about it.

413
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,190
I will remember well how considerate and caring you are.

414
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,460
Let the servants do these things. There's no need to tire yourself out.

415
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,910
I have always helped you change into your clothes every time you came.

416
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,210
In addition, today is the Spring Lantern Festival.

417
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,070
Tonight, around 8:00 p.m., Your Imperial Highness, together with the emperor and the empress,

418
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,240
will be climbing up the city tower.

419
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,510
Therefore, I must personally help you put on your robe.

420
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,160
You worked hard.

421
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,390
Your Imperial Highness is becoming more and more polite to me.

422
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,630
People will think we are not familiar with each other.

423
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,760
Today is Shangyuan Festival. There's a cheerful atmosphere inside and outside of the palace.

424
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,460
Only the crown princess consort is still missing.

425
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,450
That really is making people worry.

426
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,160
She was supposed to accompany you to climb up the city gate today.

427
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,470
Crown Princess Consort is not here. She doesn't have the good fortune to enjoy the people's adoration.

428
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,330
You've only lived in the forest for a few days, but you can't bear to part with it now?

429
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,180
That's right. Even the best palace

430
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,470
can't compare to the relaxation I had with this forest you found.

431
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:16,540
The future is long. We will live this kind of lifestyle.

432
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,220
What? Looking down on me?

433
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,260
You think that I am used to life in the palace,

434
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,730
so I've forgotten how I was the boundless ninth princess of Xi State?

435
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:30,710
I wouldn't dare. Even the palace can't hold back that wild heart of yours.

436
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,400
A'Du, why are you nodding? When did you go on his side?

437
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,350
A'Du is the fairest one.

438
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:41,530
A'Du, you are my good sister. How could you be helping him?

439
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,600
Do the two of you have some kind of special relationship that I am not aware of?

440
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,920
Don't jest with A'Du anymore. Be careful that when A'Du gets angry,

441
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,360
you will be done for once her gold knife is unsheathed.

442
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,690
That's not possible. A'Du treats me the best.

443
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,360
She doesn't lie to me nor conceal the truth from me. She lets me win at leaf card games.

444
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,740
How can she pull a knife at me?

445
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,740
Let's head out while it's still early.

446
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,200
Go visit all the places you want to see.

447
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,990
Settle all the issues you need to settle.

448
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,550
I do need to say my farewell to this place.

449
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,440
Are there any clues to the whereabouts of the crown princess consort?

450
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,700
Imperial Father, I am too incapable. There is no progress.

451
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,900
I bumped into Prime Minister Gao a few days ago and asked for his advice.

452
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,010
According to him, the assassin that took the crown princess consort

453
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,050
might be related to the northwest territory. So, I followed his thought pattern,

454
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,120
but still did not have further progress.

455
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,770
I just fear that someone might use the opportunity when the northwest is unstable

456
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,200
to add dirty water into the situation.

457
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,100
Maybe, these past few days, the prime minister has been worrying about the Shuobo rebellion, so he couldn't spare the energy.

458
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,460
Crown Prince, you are still thinking too simply.

459
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:12,560
Pass on my verbal command. Tell Minister Wang Shu of the Court of Judicial Review

460
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,950
to re-interrogate all the important criminals locked up in Celestial Prison.

461
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,920
I don't believe that assassin really didn't leave any trace to be found.

462
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,910
In that case, I worry that will destabilize our court.

463
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,580
My plan is to let everyone know, especially the ones

464
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,950
who hold important position but do not restrain themselves,

465
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:38,640
that the might of the imperial family cannot be offended.

466
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,050
Imperial Father is wise!

467
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:45,390
Imperial Father, I have another small matter needing your advice.

468
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,380
What matter?

469
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,880
Now that the crown princess consort is missing,

470
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,340
who should I bring to climb up the city gate tonight?

471
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:01,520
Take Related Lady of Excellence Zhao. The Shuobo matter caused a big disruption in the northwest.

472
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,250
It's important to assuage the Zhao family's

473
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:08,070
forces in Danchi.

474
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,440
Yes, I understand.

475
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,520
Is Yongniang here?

476
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,860
Related Lady of Excellence, I heard from the lady-in-waiting of Bearing Graces Hall

477
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,660
that Yongniang received the crown prince's orders and went to retrieve the clothing.

478
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,310
She's probably going to be here soon.

479
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,300
Yongniang understands what's important. She won't get into trickery.

480
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,430
If she said she was going to retrieve the outfit, then she surely did.

481
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,150
Related Lady of Excellence, Yongniang is here.

482
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,030
Greetings to Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

483
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,660
Yongniang, please stand.

484
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,690
Jin'er, hurry up and get the clothes from Yongniang. Be careful and not dirty them.

485
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:58,970
Yes.

486
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,720
My Lady, this is an auspicious gown worn by the crown princess consort when she wed into the Eastern Palace.

487
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,860
It was hand-sewn based on the crown princess consort's measurements.

488
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:10,080
I followed orders and brought it to Qingluan Hall today.

489
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,480
But after you are done with it, you have to return it to Bearing Graces Hall.

490
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,060
Since it belongs to Bearing Graces Hall, it also belongs to the Eastern Palace.

491
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:20,140
How could we talk about returning it or not?

492
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,280
It's only a piece of clothing.

493
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,150
My Lady is right. It's only a piece of clothing.

494
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,980
Yongniang, you are really loyal to the crown princess consort.

495
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,530
It's so touching. But you should save your loyalty

496
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,690
to show your mistress when she gets back.

497
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:42,630
It's my duty to be loyal to the crown princess consort.

498
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,710
I especially am an expert in teaching palace rules.

499
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:52,060
That's why I know the best about doing what's appropriate in one's position. Never going out of bounds.

500
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,260
You've brought the clothes here. As for the rules you talk about,

501
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,450
it's best to teach them to those who were born in the Western Border and do not understand etiquette.

502
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,670
I will take my leave.

503
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,480
The jeweled accessories look so ridiculously old. Immediately get someone to redo them for a new look.

504
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,620
And this waistline, alter it smaller to fit me.

505
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,790
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

506
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,010
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

507
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,510
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

508
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,880
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

509
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,740
♫ A long dream ♫

510
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,540
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

511
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:17,020
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

512
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:26,280
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

513
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,330
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

514
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,660
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

515
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:39,620
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

516
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:46,990
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

517
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,480
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫♫

518
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,270
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

519
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,220
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

520
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,800
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

521
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,750
♫ Time reverses ♫

522
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,970
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

523
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:16,860
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

524
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:23,570
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

525
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:30,940
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

526
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,830
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

527
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,970
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

528
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,420
