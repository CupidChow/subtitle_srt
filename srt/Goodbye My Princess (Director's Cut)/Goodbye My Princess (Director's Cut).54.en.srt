00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:25,030
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:30,620
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:37,330
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:45,300
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,740
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:57,470
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,940
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:11,090
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,020
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,560
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:39,270

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,530
[Episode 54]

17
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,700
[Bearing Graces Hall]

18
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,450
Yongniang, your hands are very fragrant.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,010
Like my mother's.

20
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,480
I remember you were terribly sick when you first came to the palace.

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,530
You were so hot from fever every day and night.

22
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:40,010
The imperial physicians were afraid of using random medicines in case something bad happened to you.

23
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,810
I stayed with you all the time.

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,320
You didn't speak the Central Plains language well at that time.

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,340
While dreaming, you kept saying that you want "shanzi."

26
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,370
"I want shanzi."

27
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,360
Later, I came to understand that

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
"shanzi" meant mom in the Xi State language.

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,920
In a blink of an eye, it's been over two years.

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,720
Crown Princess Consort, you are already an 18-year-old adult.

31
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,060
In the future, you must not be willful and boisterous anymore.

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,870
I will listen to you.

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,150
In the future,

34
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,770
I will not be willful and boisterous anymore.

35
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,580
Where's His Highness?

36
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,020
[Qingluan Hall]

37
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,660
You're playing such a sorrowful melody,

38
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,140
as if everyone has betrayed you.

39
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,430
I can betray everyone,

40
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,150
but I do not wish to betray you again.

41
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,070
But you are not worthy of anyone's love.

42
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,030
If you had a little bit of humanity in you,

43
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,420
you wouldn't have said those words to Lady Zhao.

44
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,350
Love has always been not worth a cent at all in front of you.

45
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,020
Power must be what you truly want to pursue in your life.

46
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,260
Xiaofeng,

47
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,050
you are actually the only one I want in my life.

48
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,350
You used to like Lady Zhao so much.

49
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,360
You argued with me every day because of her.

50
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,540
But now, you say you've been using her.

51
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,850
You originally hated me so much,

52
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,530
telling me every day that you wanted to divorce me.

53
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,320
But now, you say that I am the only thing you want in your life.

54
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,750
How do you expect me to believe someone like you?

55
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,940
You do not understand.

56
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,200
A lot of things... were out of my control.

57
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,370
You are forever being forced to do things beyond your control.

58
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,570
Your explanations

59
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,630
will never be able to answer my questions.

60
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,140
If one day,

61
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,810
I endanger your throne, your land, your imperial court,

62
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,200
will you kill me?

63
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,250
The Eastern Palace is even more dangerous than the imperial court.

64
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,070
Being the crown prince is even harder than being the emperor.

65
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,480
- You didn't know all the hardships that I endured along this journey.
- Will you...

66
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,190
one day kill me, too?

67
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,230
Xiaofeng, I will not kill you.

68
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,670
I will not allow anyone to hurt you either.

69
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,920
I will treat you well. I will be good to you for a lifetime!

70
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,600
I beg you,

71
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,070
even if you do not like me, even if your heart does not even have an ounce of me in it, it is fine.

72
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,870
If I wanted you to

73
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,140
let go of the emperor's position that you're so close to obtaining now,

74
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,700
and die with me, would you be willing?

75
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,560
Why must you still speak of death?! We will both not die!

76
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,800
We will not die! Everything has settled down. There are only you and me now.

77
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,620
You are not willing.

78
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,360
Then, will you only believe my words

79
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,120
once you have seen me dead?

80
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,490
You will not die.

81
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,620
You will live well.

82
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,400
But you will not be by my side, right?

83
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,860
I really hate...

84
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,690
really hate that the person in your heart is not me.

85
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,380
Why?

86
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,130
Why?

87
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,300
Li Chengyin,

88
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,430
actually my heart...

89
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,390
has always had you in it.

90
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,010
What did you say just now? What did you say?

91
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,710
Say it again! Say it again!

92
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,510
What I said just now, I really hate...

93
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,250
really hate that my heart has always had you in it.

94
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,600
With these words,

95
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,450
even if I die,

96
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,570
I am contented.

97
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,470
I am telling you this today...

98
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,310
because I am going to say goodbye to you.

99
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,070
Goodbye,

100
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,720
my...

101
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,890
Gu Xiaowu.

102
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,590
The sedating drug of Dashi State is really strong.

103
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,300
When he wakes up,

104
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,110
we will have already left the palace.

105
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,520
Yongniang.

106
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,620
What do we do? If Yongniang doesn't leave, the Yulin Palace Guards will soon get here.

107
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,550
At that time,

108
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,660
we really will not be able to escape.

109
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,530
You wait here for me.

110
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,560
Yongniang, Xiaofeng is leaving.

111
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,900
I will miss you.

112
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,590
Princess.

113
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,620
I thought...

114
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,650
that you would not let me leave.

115
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,340
But you were actually here waiting for me.

116
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,320
In the past, I always thought that

117
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,970
you would only allow me to memorize books, learn rules,

118
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,080
and curry favor with others.

119
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,570
I thought you did not understand me.

120
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,720
Princess, we must hurry and leave.

121
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,280
If we do not leave now, it will be too late.

122
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,080
A'Du, unblock Yongniang's acupoints.

123
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,800
Hurry!

124
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,180
Maybe, it's best for Yongniang this way.

125
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,480
It's cold at night.

126
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,160
Sorry to make you suffer.

127
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,600
Princess...

128
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,970
Mi Luo!

129
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,830
You are finally here.

130
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,280
I was so worried and afraid that

131
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,540
you couldn't make it here today.

132
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,420
I was also not sure before I got here today.

133
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm glad we finally made it out.

134
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,710
You weren't discovered, were you?

135
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,540
What's wrong?

136
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,600
Is there still anything that you can't bear to leave?

137
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,170
It was only until I was leaving that I discovered

138
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,500
there are people who truly cared for me in the Eastern Palace.

139
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,880
There are also people that I feel sorry to.

140
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,650
Xaiofeng, since you've made your decision,

141
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,370
then don't hesitate and drag it further.

142
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,980
Princess, Yongniang won't blame you.

143
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,280
In that palace,

144
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,810
besides hurting your heart, your health,

145
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,320
even your life, there is nothing to gain.

146
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,640
You have to leave in order to keep yourself alive.

147
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,450
Come, let me explain the plan to help you leave the city.

148
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,560
- All right.
- Princess, sit.

149
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,380
Xiaofeng... Xiaofeng?

150
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,740
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

151
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,990
Guards! Guards!

152
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,310
- Xiaofeng!
- Your Imperial Highness?

153
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,740
- Crown Princess Consort! Where is the Crown Princess Consort?
- Crown Princess Consort?

154
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,030
Wasn't she with you?

155
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,170
Your Imperial Highness!

156
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,640
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

157
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,450
Xiaofeng!

158
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,610
Xiaofeng!

159
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,520
Xiaofeng!

160
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,150
Xiaofeng!

161
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,270
Your Imperial Highness, Yongniang stood outside the whole night because her pressure points were locked.

162
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,170
- Where is Crown Princess Consort?
- Forgive me, Your Imperial Highness!

163
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,030
Pei Zhao, order troops to guard all the entryways and gates of the city.

164
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,690
Anyone who is leaving the city and the border

165
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,610
must be checked thoroughly.

166
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,160
Post the portraits of Crown Princess Consort everywhere. You must get me Xiaofeng back!

167
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,690
Yes.

168
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,840
Move away! Move away!

169
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,780
Move away! Move away!

170
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,320
- Go.
- You can go. Come, you're next.

171
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,780
Out of the nine gates of Shangjing city, the Western Gate has the tightest security.

172
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,880
They will definitely think you'd leave from another gate.

173
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,470
We will do the opposite and leave through the Western Gate.

174
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,180
A Goryeo caravan will be leaving the city tomorrow morning.

175
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,500
I've bribed the leader to smuggle you out.

176
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,810
- Guard Commander, we are a Goryeo caravan passing by your land.
- Okay.

177
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,380
Let them through.

My father is the owner of a tea plantation.  My mother is the current empress.

353
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,560
I am Gu Xiaowu from the Central Plains.

354
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,950
Gu Xiaowu?

355
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,370
Gu Xiaowu.

356
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,420
The first task. I want you to catch one hundred fireflies for me.

357
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,060
That is not difficult. Wait for me.

358
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,350
Hero Gu Xiaowu will be my son-in-law!

359
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,490
First kowtow to Heaven and Earth,

360
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,630
second to the high altar (parents).

361
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,680
These pebble stones represent the difficulties we will experience.

362
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,810
Grandfather!

363
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,990
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

364
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,350
Since you agreed to a marriage alliance with Li Empire, it does not matter who you marry!

365
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,960
I will marry anyone but you!

366
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,610
Gu Xiaowu, for generations and generations,

367
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,280
I want to forever forget you.

368
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,800
[Jade Pass]

369
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,590
Crown Prince!

370
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,260
Crown Prince! Crown Prince!

382

♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

383

♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

384
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:11,730
