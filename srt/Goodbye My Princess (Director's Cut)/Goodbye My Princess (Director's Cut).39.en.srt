00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,990
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,600
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,390
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,260
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,770
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,450
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,940
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,230
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:11,140
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,930
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,740
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,760
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:39,240
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14

♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,670
[Episode 39]

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,300
Presenting the Emperor!

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,800
- Greetings, Your Imperial Majesty.
- Rise.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,560
Ruyi, what is this...

20
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,710
Please forgive me.

21
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,410
To pray to my third brother, I had placed his memorial tablet in the palace.

22
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,980
I have violated the taboo of the palace.

23
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,470
But he and I were very close since we were children.

24
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,850
Yet I wasn't able to see him for one last time.

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,340
I miss him terribly.

26
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,170
So...

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,370
Rise now.

28
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,890
I'm afraid to rise.

29
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,020
Ruyi, I will not punish you.

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,230
Here, rise.

31
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,240
Ruyi, you blame me?

32
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,070
Your Majesty, Third Brother ended up this way

33
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,530
because he violated the law. I dare not have any complaints.

34
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,170
Father was always busy with work and failed to properly teach him.

35
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,080
Third Brother's fault is our entire Gao clan's fault.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,630
I miss him, and scared that...

37
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,600
the Gao family will be in shame as a result.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,940
Although the law cannot forgive Gao Zhen,

39
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,480
but Prime Minister Gao is still the pillar of our government.

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,330
The leader of our government officials.

41
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,640
I will not treat your family any differently

42
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,420
because of Gao Zhen.

43
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

44
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,340
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,330
May I...

46
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,330
ask for one more grace?

47
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,590
Go ahead.

48
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,410
Father's health is progressively worse.

49
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,250
Please allow me to return home for a couple of days

50
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,980
to care for my father and fulfill my filial piety?

51
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,960
All right.

52
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,000
I will grant your filial piety.

53
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,460
How is the relationship with the emperor lately?

55
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,650
Does he visit you often?

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,890
Your third brother just passed away.

57
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,610
And Father has not been feeling well.

58
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,090
If you can get pregnant with the emperor's child,

59
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,180
it will be a relief to Father and cement

60
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,350
your position in the harem.

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,600
Brother, Emperor has been acting weird lately.

62
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,880
Not only does he not visit me often,

63
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,080
he doesn't visit other consorts either. His movement is quite mysterious.

64
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,650
It does seem mysterious. Anything else?

65
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm not going to lie to you. I made some efforts

66
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,320
and bribed a minor eunuch serving the emperor.

67
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,640
He told me that lately the emperor often leaves the palace in the middle of the night.

68
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,260
So I risked getting someone to tail him.

69
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,950
I found out he went to...

70
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,250
Singing Jade Brothel.

71
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,200
Singing Jade Brothel?

72
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,120
Your third brother often visited that place.

73
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,490
It's a brothel.

74
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,460
Right. There is a woman named Mingyue.

75
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,720
Your third brother was familiar with her, too.

76
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,310
He was obsessed with her.

77
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,490
Brother, it's inconvenient for me in the palace.

78
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,040
You have to find out who that woman is.

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,260
What if the emperor is bewitched by her

80
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,840
and he wants to bring her into the palace?

81
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,540
Don't worry, Sister. Anything that threatens you,

82
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,340
I will eliminate it.

83
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,220
Imperial Mother.

84
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,840
I called you here today

85
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,630
to ask about the investigation of Gao Zhen's death.

86
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,960
He just died on the way there.

87
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,110
It's so suspicious.

88
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,390
Yes, I investigated it.

89
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,120
They really did run into a wild beast

90
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,800
while passing through the mountain path and lost their lives.

91
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,180
Did Zhao Shixuan not play any tricks?

92
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,990
I have thought about it. Zhao Shixuan is indeed suspicious.

93
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,980
But it is all based on speculations, we have no evidence.

94
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,030
But I will not ignore your words

95
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,940
and will keep my distance from him in the future.

96
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,310
What about that Related Lady of Excellence Zhao of yours?

97
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,230
Imperial Mother, this has nothing to do with Sese.

98
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,850
Please do not vent your anger on her.

99
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,350
Every time I bring up that Concubine Zhao, you act as if someone stepped on your tail!

100
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,680
Even now, you left Xuniang and your child

101
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,460
without any status!

102
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,200
Crown Prince, the Zhao and Gao families have irreconcilable differences.

103
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,820
You have to think about your own stance first,

104
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,020
before thinking about that Concubine Zhao!

105
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,090
Imperial Mother, Sese marrying into the Eastern Palace makes her my woman.

106
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,670
No matter what goes on between the Zhao and Gao families, I will treat her well.

107
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,730
The harem is connected to political affairs. How can you not know?

108
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,380
You should learn from His Imperial Majesty. Uniformity is the right way for an emperor.
 (T/N: Proverb: "The sun shines and rain drops on the just and unjust" - to be fair and not have bias towards only one person)

109
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,880
The right emperor's way for imperial father,

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,870
is being unable to protect even the woman that he loves and painfully regret it for the rest of his life!

111
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,640
What's the point for me to follow such a right way?!

112
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,620
Imperial Mother, I am going to make things clear with you today.

113
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,780
No matter what, I will not let anyone

114
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,210
hurt my woman!

115
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Imperial Mother, you have been tired lately. You should rest.

116
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,010
Rongshuang, what did he say?

117
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,630
His Highness the Crown Prince said that he won't let anyone hurt Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

118
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,650
No.

119
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,480
What did he say about His Imperial Majesty?

120
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,990
He said that His Imperial Majesty's right emperor's way...

121
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,190
was being unable to protect even the woman that he loves

122
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,490
and painfully regret it for the rest of his life.

123
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
Rongshuang,

124
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,840
could the crown prince already know it?

125
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,470
Crown Prince... How could he know?

126
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,380
His words and actions today

127
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,980
are making me uneasy.

128
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,290
Back then, I could hold onto him because he needed my support to become the crown prince.

129
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,630
But now, I can feel that

130
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,590
he and I are no longer of the same mind.

131
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,910
And now, because of Gao Zhen's matter,

132
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,960
Uncle's feelings have been hurt.

133
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,040
If even Uncle breaks ties with me,

134
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,430
then my position as the empress

135
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,120
is at stake!

136
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,840
Empress, don't panic! Prime Minister Gao is still your uncle.

137
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,940
If you keep pulling strings, he won't sever ties with you.

138
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,560
You're right. You're right.

139
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,040
We need to handle this matter of Xuniang as soon as possible.

140
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,140
Yes, Empress.

141
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,410
Empress, this way, please.

142
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,350
Uncle.

143
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,420
Empress, please forgive me.

144
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,070
I cannot get up, so I have neglected etiquette.

145
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,620
This isn't the palace. I am just your niece.

146
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,250
Empress, please take a seat.

147
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,430
Uncle, you have to believe me.

148
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,340
I will not harm Little Brother Zhen.

149
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,340
Even though you lost him,

150
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,030
Ruyi is highly favored by His Imperial Majesty.

151
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,130
I will put in good words to His Imperial Majesty. Ruyi will soon be promoted to Lady of Handsome Fairness. 
(T/N: "Jieyu" is an imperial consort rank higher than "Meiren")

152
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,270
She'll have a place of her own in the inner palace.

153
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,580
Uncle, you can be comforted now.

154
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,980
I understand.

155
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,930
What happened a few days ago was just a little quarrel between the empress and the Gao family,

156
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,940
causing a little crack to occur that others took advantage of.

157
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,220
I was foolish.

158
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,950
I hope that Uncle can lead me in the right way.

159
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,150
It's not that I don't have a way.

160
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,670
I'm afraid that you won't put your heart into doing it.

161
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,650
Uncle, just tell me.

162
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,330
The crown prince has been causing too much trouble lately.

163
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,840
If the crown prince and crown princess consort

164
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,330
get along well and he gets support from Xi State,

165
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,610
then in the future,

166
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,310
the more he will not listen to you anymore.

167
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,730
Uncle, your worries are correct.

168
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,950
Also, he cannot get too close to the Zhao family.

169
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:36,980
Zhao Sese cannot be spared.

170
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,960
But the crown prince now only has eyes for Zhao Sese.

171
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,510
The other day, I reprimanded him for relying too much on the people of the Zhao family.

172
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,810
He ended up raising his voice at me.

173
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,620
Getting the crown prince to demote Zhao Sese is not an easy task.

174
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,770
You are the empress. Do you have to ask the crown prince's permission

175
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,730
to demote someone?

176
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,960
You can use Xuniang

177
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,540
to create a commotion.

178
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,510
Chengyin was just foolish for a moment

179
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,270
and slept with that palace maid. I am afraid that he will not understand such affairs,

180
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,910
so I asked people to prepare things.

181
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,320
Empress knows it very clearly who the child in Xuniang's womb belongs to.

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,380
It is most definitely not the crown prince's.

183
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,670
Do you really wish for that child to be born?

184
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,580
Uncle, what you have said is correct.

185
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,980
I will handle this affair soon.

186
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,740
Son,

187
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,440
you have to behave and listen to me

188
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,370
so that you can be born safely.

189
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,340
Mother did not think that you would be born in this type of place.

190
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,210
Your father is a useless man.

191
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,890
You will never be able to meet your biological father for the rest of your life.

192
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,860
But... you do not have to worry.

193
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,220
I will protect you.

194
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,070
The crown prince promised that he would treat us well.

195
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,620
Someone come!

196
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,070
- My Lady!
- Quickly. Get some water.

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,900
Your Imperial Highness, something bad happened to Xuniang.

198
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,760
Crown Princess Consort! Crown Princess Consort, something happened in the palace.

199
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,200
- What is it?
- Xuniang's child is gone.

200
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,770
What?

201
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,440
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.
- Crown Princess Consort.

202
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,850
Greetings, Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort.

203
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,100
Today, around 5:00 to 7:00 p.m., Xuniang's stomach started to hurt and she passed out.

204
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,240
The empress urgently called the imperial physician over.

205
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
But by the time the imperial doctor arrived,

206
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Xuniang already lost her baby.

207
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,990
After the imperial doctor checked her pulse, he found out that Xuniang mistakenly ate food that induced labor, causing her to lose the baby.

208
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,560
Empress already detained all the people serving Xuniang.

209
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,430
All of the food and water were also preserved. The director of Sleeping Apartments was the one who interrogated them.

210
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,500
They eventually found out that there was medicine within the rice.

211
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,690
Someone wanted to get rid of the child.

212
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,310
Empress was so furious and ordered an investigation.

213
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,680
Finally, a palace maid couldn't take the torture and said that she was following someone's order.

214
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,780
I can't believe that in the Eastern Palace, right under my supervision,

215
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,730
a child of the crown prince would be plotted against.

216
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,830
Empress, we need to investigate this matter to its roots.

217
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,160
We can't let the evil person get away with it.

218
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,710
Do you guys know who the servant said it was?

219
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,650
I don't know.

220
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,070
Read the confession to Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort.

221
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,910
"Originally, I was a servant in Embracing the Moon Pavilion.

222
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,800
I served Crown Princess Consort when she was still Ninth Princess.

223
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,660
So, every time Crown Princess Consort came to the palace, she would speak with me.

224
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,240
When Xuniang was two months pregnant,

225
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,390
Crown Princess Consort entered the palace and she called me over."

226
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,600
Me?

227
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,700
- When did I...
- "The Crown Princess Consort gave me a box filled with gold nuggets.

228
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,630
She also gave me an unknown bag of medicine."

229
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,400
Imperial Mother, I didn't do this!

230
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,810
Why would I cause Xuniang to have an abortion? Please believe me!

231
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,960
Now that we have physical evidence and a witness,

232
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,550
you must have evidence to prove your innocence.

233
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,630
Evidence?

234
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,750
Mother, I don't even know where Xuniang is. I don't have any evidence!

235
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,800
If I suddenly had evidence, that would be more strange.

236
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,740
Crown Prince,

237
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,200
what do you think?

238
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,440
Imperial Mother, please make the decision.

239
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,040
Although Crown Princess Consort is of special status

240
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,150
and is also the princess of Xi State,

241
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,410
she was still muddled for a moment and did such a thing.

242
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,210
It seems that she's not fit to head the Eastern Palace anymore.

243
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,510
I didn't do it! I have nothing to do with this matter!

244
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,390
Even if you killed me today, I wouldn't confess to the crime!

245
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,690
The confession is here.

246
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,020
What do you think Crown Prince?

247
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,380
Imperial Mother, please make the decision.

248
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,790
As they say, a hundred days as husband and wife is equivalent to an everlasting harmonious relationship.

249
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,090
Crown Prince, you're not even giving your husband and wife relationship any consideration?

250
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,600
A country has its laws. A family has its rules.

251
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,210
I dare not be swayed by personal affection.

252
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,770
Knowing that is good.

253
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,980
A country has its laws. A family has its rules. It's a good statement.

254
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,310
Deliver my order. Demote Related Lady of Excellence Zhao to be an ordinary citizen.

255
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,420
- Immediately expel her from the Eastern Palace!
- Imperial Mother!

256
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,710
That servant's confession wasn't fake.

257
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,030
But she committed suicide right after the confession.

258
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,960
Don't think that just because she died I don't have any proof.

259
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,390
The Director of Sleeping Apartments has always been diligent in her job. She continued the investigation

260
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,500
and found out that that palace servant received graces from the Zhao family years ago.

261
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,840
They even found 100 ingots of silver in her house.

262
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,220
Her family confessed that

263
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,530
Concubine Zhao sent someone to go to their home.

264
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,250
This Concubine Zhao really devised a good "killing two birds with one stone" scheme

265
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,760
to wreak havoc in the Eastern Palace. It's really despicable that she is so evil.

266
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,920
How could we keep her?

267
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,380
- She wants the royal family to not have an heir.
- Mother, calm down!

268
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,760
I think that someone is trying to frame Sese!

269
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,520
We need to have someone investigate this slowly. Please don't be angry. It might harm your health.

270
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,650
I think you are so enchanted by that vixen that you can't think clearly.

271
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,430
Initially, Concubine Zhao was crying and making a big scene about Xuniang's situation.

272
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,760
Now, she even sent someone to harm Xuniang and tried to put the blame on the crown princess consort.

273
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,160
With such evil intentions, she's worthy to be killed.

274
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,110
Mother, Sese isn't that type of person! Please investigate further!

275
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,770
Investigate what?

276
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,050
Investigate what? She looks at her as an eyesore.

277
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:53,320
Leaving a person like that in the Eastern Palace would just invite future disasters.

278
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,450
When the servant was reading the confession earlier, you didn't even defend Crown Princess Consort one bit.

279
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,630
Now that I've told you the truth, you keep saying that seducing vixen is innocent.

280
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:07,380
How could you do something like this?

281
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,250
I think that if we don't kill a troublemaker like this, I fear that you'll get bewitched by her to even give up the empire!

282
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,810
- Imperial Mother, please don't.
- Imperial Mother, please appease your anger!

283
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,980
- Related Lady of Excellence Zhao, might just be muddled for a moment. If you have her executed, I fear—
- Imperial Mother,

284
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,660
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao's father and older brother are all working for the imperial court and are important high officials of Imperial Father.

285
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,240
May Imperial Mother reconsider!

286
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,200
Didn't you just say that "A country has its laws. A family has its rules?"

287
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
That you wouldn't dare be swayed by personal affection.

288
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,830
Imperial Mother!

289
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,470
The matters of the Eastern Palace should be handled by Crown Princess Consort.

290
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,240
It's because I have no choice, that's why I'm handling it on her behalf.

291
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,740
Just let me be the evil person.

292
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,940
- Imperial Mother, please ease your anger.
- Imperial Mother, please ease your anger.

293
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,370
Since you said that it's me who should make the decision in the Eastern Palace,

294
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,980
and I also know that I'm not doing a good job, but can you listen to me for a while?

295
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,950
Say it.

296
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,950
Imperial Mother, His Imperial Highness sincerely loves Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

297
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,930
If you bestow her death, I fear that His Imperial Highness might never be happy again.

298
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,190
I and His Imperial Highness have been married for a year. Although he doesn't like me,

299
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,430
I know that he can't live without her.

300
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,240
Without her, he will hate me more!

301
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,820
Also, there are a lot of things in the Eastern Palace that I couldn't understand. It was Related Lady of Excellence Zhao who has been helping me.

302
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,480
For example, those accounting books, I couldn't understand them at all.

303
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,270
If there is no her, I...

304
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,400
Yongniang, can you explain things for me?

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,230
Yes.

306
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,990
Empress, what Crown Princess Consort means is

307
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,510
in attending to Crown Prince, even if Related Lady of Excellence can't be considered to be meritorious, she did exert painstaking efforts.

308
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,620
- Right.
- Also, Related Lady of Excellence was good to everyone.

309
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,550
She also treated Crown Princess Consort with respect.

310
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,680
She has been assisting Crown Princess Consort in managing the Eastern Palace.

311
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,690
May Empress consider that it was just a moment of confusion and give her a lighter sentence.

312
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,240
- That's right.
- I hope Imperial Mother can be more lenient.

313
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,180
That Related Lady of Excellence Zhao

314
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,690
can be spared from death, but has to suffer other penalties.

315
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,410
She's demoted to a commoner and will be confined for three months.

316
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,370
Thank you, Imperial Mother.

317
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,030
Regarding Xuniang's situation, Crown Prince, no need to be so sad.

318
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,640
You and Crown Princess Consort are still young.

319
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,920
You will have kids sooner or later.

320
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,380
It's just that Xuniang is quite pitiful.

321
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,190
Empress, why don't we promote her as Lady of Precious Bevy?

322
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,000
The Eastern Palace should prioritize harmony.

323
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,110
Crown Princess Consort acts like a child. She can't take care of many things.

324
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,440
It's a good thing if there would be a Lady of Precious Bevy Xu to help her.

325
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,590
Yes, Imperial Mother.

326
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,200
Crown Prince, you two have been married for about a year.

327
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,130
Why is there no news of a son yet?

328
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,430
Normally, you should be more intimate with Crown Princess Consort.

329
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,570
Keep a distance from those foxy women.

330
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,310
Yes.

331
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,230
Okay now. Rise.

332
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,980
Rise now!

333
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,180
You vicious woman, I know that it was you.

334
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,970
You made this trap to get rid of the child in Xuniang's womb and then framed Sese for it.

335
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,710
How could you say I did something like that?

336
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,310
You are always pretending to be innocent and pitiful in front of Imperial Mother.

337
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:15,150
Don't think I don't know about you telling her that I have been cold towards you!

338
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,590
You are jealous of Sese, so you set this up to frame her!

339
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,750
You are even more evil than the world's most poisonous snake!

340
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,620
You pushed Sese away

341
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,620
and broke us up. Let me tell you.

342
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,110
If something happens to Sese, I will not forgive you!

343
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,820
Then, remove me from my crown princess consort position now!

344
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,260
Do you think I married you willingly? That I care about being the crown princess consort?

345
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,080
Let me tell you that there are thousands of men in our Xi State and all are valiant heroes!

346
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,060
None of them is a useless scumbag like you!

347
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,080
Li Chengyin, what else can you do besides reciting poems?

348
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,180
Your horse riding skills aren't even as good as mine.

349
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,830
If we were in Xi State, no one would want a man like you!

350
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,650
Crown Princess Consort, the crown prince is just venting his anger on you because of Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

351
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,100
- Don't take it to heart.
- I know that he doesn't like me,

352
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,090
but I never thought that he hated me this much!

353
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:27,410
He doesn't even hesitate to think of me as a malicious person!

354
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,110
His Related Lady of Excellence Zhao was framed.

355
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,450
He felt wronged.

356
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,820
But why does he have to vent out his anger on me?!

357
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,890
His Imperial Highness is just angry.

358
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,810
Don't think about it too much.

359
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,760
He said that I am jealous of Related Lady of Excellence Zhao.

360
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,880
I am indeed jealous of her

361
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,200
because she has someone that cares about her.

362
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,310
No matter when and where that person will trust, protect, and love her.

363
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,650
But I never thought about hurting her.

364
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,400
I know. I initially was afraid of Concubine Zhao using you

365
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,690
to do bad things,

366
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,960
so I was cautious around her. But I never would have thought that she would still become impatient.

367
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,340
She still went to harm Lady of Precious Bevy Xu and her child.

368
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,760
The empress promoted her to Lady of Precious Bevy, so what?

369
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,230
Because Li Chengyin doesn't like her, she will be an addition to the pitiful people in the Eastern Palace.

370
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,530
Yongniang, let's go see her.

371
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,220
All right.

372
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,100
You saw Rongshuang earlier, right?

373
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,950
I saw her.

374
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,220
You know that I had no way out of this.

375
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,500
Under that situation, what else could I do?

376
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,240
I know that hitting the crown princess consort

377
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,220
hurt you more than it may have hurt her.

378
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,010
Troubles in the palace are happening constantly like clouds and waves.

379
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,330
Especially around me. I doted on Sese.

380
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,820
It caused her to be sent to the abandoned palace.

381
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,420
She might even lose her life.

382
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,210
As of right now, your relationship with the crown princess consort has shattered.

383
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,430
This might be a good thing for her.

384
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,050
You're right.

385
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,910
But I don't know if she will be able to understand me.

386
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,070
That loud and careless girl from Xi State.

387
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,820
Right, about Sese,

388
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,760
she has treated me wholeheartedly. I'm not heartless.

389
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,150
Since she is from my palace, then I will protect her safety.

390
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,700
Zhao,

391
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,370
help me send in some medicines, food, and daily needs there.

392
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,120
Then let her know about my current situation and try consoling her.

393
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,400
You still care about Related Lady of Excellence Zhao, Your Imperial Highness.

394
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,130
Pei Zhao, don't speak so sarcastically.

395
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,710
As the crown prince, I am useless.

396
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,350
Right now, I can't protect the person I love.

397
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,960
I can't even protect the person who loves me.

398
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,150
Empress.

399
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,420
The crown prince claims that it was crown princess consort who framed Concubine Zhao.

400
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,790
Once he stepped foot outside the palace, he hit her. Then they started arguing outside.

401
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,890
The crown prince even said that once he was the emperor,

402
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,340
the first thing he would do is to dismiss her from her main consort position.

403
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,510
Younger Sister, what do you think about this scheme?

404
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,100
Elder Sister, it's such a great plan. You hit two birds with one stone.

405
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,940
I have been preparing presents for Uncle, but I never had the chance to send them to him.

406
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,010
Today, I finally can ask you to send them to him

407
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,110
and tell him to take care.

408
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,360
Once Father hears about what happened today

409
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,070
he will surely recover earlier.

410
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,310
Greetings to Crown Princess Consort.

411
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,380
No rush, just lie down.

412
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,210
You don't have to greet me.

413
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,420
You are very weak. You must take care of yourself.

414
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,130
You are still young. Don't be sad.

415
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,880
Thank you, Crown Princess Consort.

416
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,890
What do you want to eat? I'll ask people to make it and then bring it over.

417
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,230
Or do you need anything?

418
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,480
I'll send someone to get it for you.

419
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,100
I overheard the empress saying that she will write the decree to officially promote you.

420
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,860
In the future, you will be the Lady of Precious Bevy.

421
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,590
The first month after miscarriage and birth are similar.

422
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,620
You must take care of yourself.

423
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,130
You are still young. There are still many days to come.

424
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,720
Once your health has recovered, you can still bear a child.

425
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,050
Don't cry. It will hurt your eyes.

426
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,280
Godfather? You're back.

427
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,420
Jian'er, you're here.

428
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,920
I heard from Hu Xiao that while I was gone,

429
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,030
you were able to independently take care of things.

430
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:31,310
And alongside the crown prince, you got rid of Gao Zhen.

431
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,480
I am very pleased.

432
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,500
Godfather, you flatter me.

433
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,650
Right, how is Mingyue?

434
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,260
Sir.

435
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,330
What is wrong?

436
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,590
I told him about Mingyue.

437
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,560
I am here to pick you up.

438
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,770
Hurry and pack your things. I will send you out of the capital overnight.

439
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:41,650
If I disappear, the emperor will turn the whole sky upside down

440
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,150
and will eventually find me.

441
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,910
Do you know that these past years, I always had nightmares?

442
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,570
I dreamed of the once peaceful Chen family turning into a river of blood.

443
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,700
I dreamed of Mother dying while staring up into the skies.

444
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,760
I don't want to see nightmares anymore.

445
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,280
I want those people to pay for their crimes!

446
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,820
I want the innocent souls of the Chen family to rest in peace.

447
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,390
I can only take revenge by bringing down the Gao family.

448
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,600
Then, I can go back to being Mother's daughter, not Mingyue of Singing Jade Brothel.

449
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,370
Taking revenge is a job for men.

450
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,930
What does it have to do with a girl like you?

451
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,970
For revenge,

452
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,350
I spent twenty years of my life.

453
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,770
I don't want you to follow my footsteps.

454
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,430
I know that you hate me,

455
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,590
but you should not do this to take revenge on me.

456
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,040
I'm not taking revenge on you.

457
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,240
No matter what, I will not keep myself out of this.

458
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,210
But you are my daughter.

459
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,110
I don't want to see you get involved.

460
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,420
If you had another chance,

461
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,230
would you save the Gu family

462
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,430
or come back home?

463
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,610
You know my answer.

464
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,930
If Heaven gave me another chance,

465
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,040
I would risk my life to save you and your mother,

466
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,350
then go fight until death alongside the Gu family.

467
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,210
Unfortunately,

468
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,020
it is too late now.

469
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,370
Think about it well. You can come and find me anytime.

470
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,170
Are you willing to come with me

471
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,050
and pay respects to mother's tomb?

472
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,470
At that time, I was still too young.

473
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,700
I couldn't claim mother's body.

474
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,930
I was only able to make a memorial tomb for her.

475
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,680
I couldn't even carve her name on it.

476
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,360
I just left a nameless tomb for her.

477
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,750
On the day of the incident,

478
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,730
I bought your mother

479
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,560
a jade hairpin from a street stall.

480
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,970
I was planning to put it on her myself,

481
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,750
but I never had the chance.

482
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,950
Mother!

483
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,170
Father said he'd come back.

484
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,430
Mother, you finally saw him.

485
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,140
Father is back.

486
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,790
He is back to see you.

487
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:18,420
A'Du, it is dark! How can the crown princess consort not eat or drink all day?

488
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,480
I know that she is sleeping, but she can't sleep all day.

489
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,860
Crown Princess Consort!

490
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:33,070
My life is on the line! A'Du, hurry and find her!

491
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,690
What are you doing here?

492
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,530
I know that something happened in the palace.

493
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,690
I was worried so I came to see you.

494
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,730
Why are you up here?

495
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:03,000
I came up for a fresh breath of air. Who knew you were here, too.

496
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,980
Do you want to go outside the palace?

497
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,500
No, it's fine. I need to behave these days.

498
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,100
Or Yongniang and others will panic and cry again.

499
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,930
He hit you?

500
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,570
How did you know?

501
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,930
It's fine. I hit him back.

502
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,510
He didn't get anything good out of it. I used so much strength that my hand went numb.

503
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,220
Xiaofeng,

504
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,020
do you want to leave?

505
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,480
Leave with you?

506
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,070
Before, I thought that as long as you were happy,

507
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:47,210
it would be fine if you stayed in the Eastern Palace.

508
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,360
I could be by your side from time to time.

509
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,220
But you aren't happy here.

510
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,000
Instead of being like that, it's better if you leave now.

511
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,230
Who said that I am unhappy?

512
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,310
Xiaofeng, look.

513
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,330
Look at this Eastern Palace.

514
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:10,040
The walls are so tall, and they're surrounding you.

515
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,310
It's like a prison that shuts you away from any sunlight.

516
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,470
How can you be trapped away like that?

517
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,730
Gu Jian, are you crazy?

518
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,330
How can I leave with you?

519
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,540
What do you want me to do so that you are willing to leave with me? Do you want me to tie you up?

520
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,070
If you think that you can make decisions for me just because you are my teacher,

521
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,890
then you are wrong.

522
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,110
Do you think that because you are highly skilled in martial arts, no one can stop you?

523
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,650
Let me tell you! If I scream or make a commotion

524
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:47,060
and alert the Yulin Palace Guards, you'd be shot until you turned into a porcupine.

525
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,410
Did you forget who I am?

526
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:54,360
As long as I have my sword, even if the Yulin Palace Guards of the whole Eastern Palace came,

527
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,410
they wouldn't be able to stop me.

528
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:03,070
Since you are so skilled, does that mean you are the best in the world and have never lost?

529
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,500
Don't you really remember

530
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,530
that I lost to you in a sword fight?

531
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,430
Me? You lost to me in a sword fight?

532
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,270
In that sword fight, we bet on the remainder of our lives.

533
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,950
If I lost, then I would be your husband.

534
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,560
I would love, protect, treasure, and accompany you.

535
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,530
Then, what if I lost?

536
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:31,100
If you lost, then you would marry me.

537
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,900
For me to love, protect, treasure, and accompany you.

538
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,860
That's not funny.

539
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,700
I did not go easy on you.

540
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,550
But you took my sword when the duel started,

541
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,620
so it counts as me losing.

542
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,940
I was able to take your sword away? Even if you killed me, I wouldn't believe it.

543
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,680
I don't remember who lost or won. Since I don't remember anything,

544
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,580
I will not believe whatever comes out of your mouth.

545
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,150
When we made the promise of a lifetime,

546
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,810
it was the fifteenth of July, the night of the full moon.

547
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:06,660
We promised that you would wait for me on top of the sand dune,

548
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,970
then I would take you to roam the world.

549
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,350
You are saying that we planned to elope?

550
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,710
Then, why didn't you come to get me?

551
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,970
I did you wrong.

552
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,180
Something came up that day,

553
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,200
and I couldn't come and get you.

554
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,210
By the time I got to the sand dune,

555
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,850
it already passed the time that we promised to meet.

556
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,990
And you left.

557
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,700
Your story isn't interesting at all.

558
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,050
You're lying, aren't you?

559
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,640
If I'm lying to you,

560
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,240
then my punishment is that you will never forgive me.

561
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,740
I'm going to go back and sleep now.

562
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,270
You aren't willing to leave with me,

563
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,210
because you fell in love with him again. Right?

564
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,060
