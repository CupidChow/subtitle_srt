[Goodbye My Princess]

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,130
[Episode 7]

3
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,230
You are not tea merchants. Who are you really?

4
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,770
Since you won't talk, don't blame us for attacking you with an overwhelming force. Attack!

5
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,070
Why isn't Teacher here yet?

6
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,620
Wait.

7
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,690
What is it?

8
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,450
I hear horses' galloping.

9
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,100
About 30-some riders.

10
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,150
Oh no, so many soldiers.

11
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,400
Go hide, Xiaowu!

12
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,890
Hurry and hide!

13
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,970
Hurry and hide, Xiaowu!

14
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,280
Hurry and hide!

15
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,070
- Let's go!
- What? What're you doing?

16
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,490
I can't swim!

17
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,880
Over there! After them!

18
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,410
- What are you doing?!
- What were you doing earlier? Why did you kiss me?

19
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,690
I was giving you air! Who wants to kiss you?

20
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,900
Air? I don't need your air! Who asked you?

21
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,550
You are not being reasonable.

22
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,840
If I didn't give you air, you would have drowned.

23
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,290
Drown? Even if I drown, I don't want you to kiss me!

24
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,930
I don't care to kiss a woman who loves someone else!

25
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,040
Who wants your kiss? I sure don't!

26
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,080
Let me tell you this. A man like you

27
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,320
is the worst luck for any woman!

28
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm not continuing this talk.

29
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,720
I don't know when the Shuobo Army will catch up with us.

30
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,820
We must hurry to Gongyue City.

31
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,890
Where are you going?

32
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,580
Where's my little red horse?

33
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,350
Are you coming or not?

34
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,780
I'm coming!

35
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,150
Slow down!

36
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
Have you had enough?

37
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,060
Slow down!

38
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,890
Your Majesty, we've searched the royal city and fifty miles around.

39
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,330
There are still no signs of the ninth princess.

40
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,340
That girl. Where is she?

41
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,390
Your Majesty,

42
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,230
don't worry too much.

43
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,800
Xiaofeng should be all right.

44
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,020
Xiaofeng is missing, but you aren't worrying at all.

45
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,630
You know where she is, right?

46
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,400
That's right. I sent her out of Xi State.

47
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,470
You are Xi State's queen.

48
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,070
How can you be so soft like a woman?

49
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,310
Yes, I am Xi State's queen.

50
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,600
But I am a mother first.

51
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,150
I'd rather Xiaofeng marry a Danchi soldier,

52
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,190
than some Shuobo king

53
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,700
or send her off to the Li Empire!

54
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,330
- Did you send Xiaofeng to Danchi?
- Yes!

55
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,600
You clearly know that the Li Empire and Danchi will eventually go to war!

56
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,790
I've tried hard to maintain the peace because I was afraid of people being plunged into misery and suffering!

57
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,680
You are dooming our daughter! Forcing me to a path of no retreat!

58
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,950
I...

59
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,890
Spread my decree... Activate the spy network.

60
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,700
A reward of 100 gold ingots.

61
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,330
Order all our spies in Xi State to covertly search for the ninth princess.

62
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,460
She must be found!

63
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,800
Yes.

64
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,960
This Gongyue City is quite big.

65
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,800
Teacher didn't say where exactly to meet.

66
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,610
We should find a place to stay for the night.

67
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,400
We can't. When we were being chased,

68
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,380
we lost our bags. We don't have any money.

69
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,390
There's an inn over there.

70
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,620
What about it?

71
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,230
Do you have any valuable items on you?

72
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,140
How about this? Let's ask the innkeeper to make an exception.

73
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,370
I am the Xi State's ninth princess after all.

74
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,790
I'll just have my dad deliver him silver next time.

75
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,590
Right!

76
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,690
Wait!

77
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,980
[Wanted Poster]
- Come!

78
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,130
That's you, right?

79
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,940
"Reward for the ninth princess...

80
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,900
100 gold ingots?"

81
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,290
I am only worth 100 gold ingots?

82
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,000
I am at least worth 1,000 ingots, right?!

83
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,920
Plus rank, and countless cattle and sheep!

84
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,960
Say, I'm the favorite little princess of my dad.

85
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,600
The most favorite princess is worth such a small reward?

86
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,200
Stingy. Too stingy!

87
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,020
What are you laughing about?

88
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,080
Okay. Okay. I won't laugh.

89
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Come heat up your clothes, or you'll get a cold.

90
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,140
What's the matter?

91
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,320
What is it?

92
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,640
My thing.

93
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,670
What thing?

94
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,470
What thing is it?

95
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,810
A jade pendant.

96
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,890
Isn't it just a piece of jade? I'll ask my grandpa to buy you one once when we get to Danchi.

97
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,140
Buy what? Don't think just because you're the ninth princess, you can buy anything!

98
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,260
That jade pendant is very important to me! It's not something that you can just casually buy in the streets!

99
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,750
Why are you so mean? I wasn't the one who lost it for you?

100
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,590
Of course, it's you! Those soldiers came for you, right?

101
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,290
I...

102
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,010
I didn't ask you to save me.

103
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,520
I almost forgot.

104
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,420
He probably couldn't hear me. The hammer was too loud.

105
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,850
You want me to confess by torturing me?

106
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,120
I will never give in to your false charges.

107
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't think that suicide will be the end of it.

108
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,570
Even if you're dead,

109
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,530
we can still send a punitive expedition to Khan Tömür.

110
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,600
I just don't like you Central Plains people.

111
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,160
Not only could I kill a crown prince,

112
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
even if it's your emperor's head,

113
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,490
we would dare take it.

114
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,690
There will come a day...

115
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,890
that your Li Empire will be flattened by our Danchi cavalry!

116
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,780
- General Gao.
- I'm here.

117
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,760
Are you going to continue with this trial?

118
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,820
The assassin is caught. It's Your Highness' decision on what to do with him.

119
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,540
All right. Would you please write a confession statement and send it to the capital?

120
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,900
Give the emperor an account of what happened.

121
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,560
Your Highness,

122
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,390
assassinating the crown prince is a high crime.

123
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,920
The Protectorate General Office doesn't have the authority

124
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,450
to execute the criminal.

125
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,270
Prince, I think we should just

126
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,630
escort this assassin back to Shangjing and have the emperor decide on his sentence.

127
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,400
What do you think about that, Prince?

128
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,440
Good, let's carry that out.

129
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,560
I will obey.

130
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,430
Xiaofeng.

131
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,600
Xiaofeng?

132
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,890
Xiaofeng!

133
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,490
Xiaofeng!

134
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,380
Oh no!

135
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,810
Are you all right, Xiaofeng?

136
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,140
Xiaowu.

137
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,320
I found... I found the jade pendant.

138
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,320
Hey!

139
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,800
Weren't you afraid of running into the Shuobo soldiers?

140
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,150
So what if I'm afraid.

141
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,760
Didn't you say I lost your pendant?

142
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,710
Of course, I had to get it back for you.

143
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,170
I was too selfish.

144
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,960
I think I'm selfish a lot of times, too.

145
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,200
Sneaking out like this,

146
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,640
my dad and mom must be really worried now.

147
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,830
But I am not as great as Consort Mingyuan.

148
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,630
For her country and people, she was willing to be married off to such a distant place.

149
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,560
She suffered loneliness for such a long time.

150
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,010
Before, I thought that being the Xi State's ninth princess,

151
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,630
I was pampered and loved.

152
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,720
I could happily live forever.

153
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,320
But now, I really wish I wasn't a princess.

154
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,040
If I wasn't the Xi State's ninth princess, then I wouldn't have to marry for an alliance.

155
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,550
If I wasn't the Xi State's ninth princess,

156
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,190
I might even be able to marry someone I love.

157
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,570
You...

158
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,670
Do you like my cousin that much?

159
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,570
Teacher and I grew up together.

160
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,860
Whenever I needed help, he was always the first to appear.

161
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,270
In my heart, he represents integrity, kindness, and loyalty.

162
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,330
He is a genuine, upstanding hero.

163
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,480
But it's impossible for us now.

164
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,930
I wish I could jump off into the River of Oblivion and forget all this mess.

165
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,390
River of Oblivion?

166
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,750
You don't know about it?

167
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,800
There is a valley inside the Sky Span Mountain.

168
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,220
In there, water flows without ever stopping.

169
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,810
The water is so clear that you can see the bottom. Truly beautiful.

170
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,730
There are also rock ridges, cascading waterfalls, and the most beautiful flowers.

171
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,930
The most magical about it is

172
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,490
that every early morning and near evening

173
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,480
when the cloud disappears,

174
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,850
you can see the sun and the moon shining together.

175
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,650
Sun and moon together?

176
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,370
That's when the sun and the moon are in the sky at the same time.

177
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,200
Isn't it amazing?

178
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,830
The older folks say that the water of the River of Oblivion

179
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,230
can help you forget sentiments, love, and any worries.

180
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,700
If you love someone deeply but can't be together,

181
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,720
then you should jump and forget everything.

182
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,840
Hey, don't have such narrow-minded thoughts.

183
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,620
There is plenty of good men in the world.

184
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,020
Besides, isn't the world's best man

185
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,110
right in front of you?

186
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,830
You have thick skin.

187
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,520
I don't even know how my teacher is.

188
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,640
Don't worry.

189
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,030
My cousin is so highly skilled in martial arts.

190
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,040
Those Shuobo soldiers can't harm him.

191
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,230
General Gao.

192
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,620
- General Pei.
- Are you looking for me?

193
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,240
General Pei, Second Prince has ordered Li Yan to escort Batuer back to the capital.

194
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,680
We can finally close the chapter on the crown prince's assassination.

195
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,520
Our Protectorate General Office can finally return to peaceful days.

196
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,760
But lately, there have been bandits in the desert.

197
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,410
I am thinking that you should take 2,000 soldiers

198
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,850
to patrol. What do you think?

199
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,560
I obey your order.

200
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,420
Thank you, General Pei.

201
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,970
I don't deserve your thanks.

202
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,880
General, according to your order—

203
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,810
Did anyone see you when you secretly drew this?

204
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:30,290
Don't worry, General. There was no one around in the prison.

205
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,410
Go ahead and leave.

206
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,150
Yes, sir.

207
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,440
[Father...]

208
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
Why don't you stay instead? I'll order someone else to escort him back to the capital.

209
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,190
Why?

210
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,180
In case I haven't thought of everything,

211
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,720
and His Imperial Majesty discovers our plan,

212
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,490
being at the vanguard, I'm afraid you'll be the first one to be blamed.

213
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,040
If I don't personally take him back to the capital,

214
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,770
His Imperial Majesty will be even more suspicious.

215
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,460
- But...
- This plan is critical.

216
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,740
With this man, you can easily become the crown prince.

217
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,020
Our future is worth the risk.

218
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,910
Danchi...

219
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:23,090
They thought we arrested Batuer for the town massacre.

220
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:27,290
They were in the wrong first and could only accept the blame.

221
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,980
They would never dare to try to ask for their guy back.

222
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,560
I have arranged for the person to be transported.

223
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,230
No one will know.

224
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,470
Don't worry. I trust who I trust.

225
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,440
My people will know how to keep him under control.

226
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,420
If the Emperor were to discover the truth, you can kill him off for me.

227
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,900
If the Emperor did become suspicious, I will not let anyone drag you down.

228
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,600
Prince! Heir Apparent!

229
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:06,960
Your Highness, I have prepared some wine to send off Heir Apparent on his journey.

230
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,500
I am on an important mission. I should not drink.

231
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,930
I thank General Gao for your kind regard.

232
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:22,880
Heir Apparent, are you sure you don't want me to add another cavalry to escort you?

233
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,440
No need. My people can handle a small matter such as transporting a prisoner.

234
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,550
By the way, General Gao, there has been instability near the Western Border.

235
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:37,450
To prevent Danchi's ambush,

236
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,640
don't spread out your men.

237
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,760
What you said is right, Your Highness.

238
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,430
Your Highness. General Gao.

239
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,740
I am on my way then.

240
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,490
Safe journey, Heir Apparent!

241
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,280
Take care!

242
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,700
The whole city has pictures of you up. It's inconvenient for you to be out.

243
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,880
Why don't I go to the city and find my cousin first,

244
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,260
and we will meet up with you later?

245
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,470
Then... you be careful.

246
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,090
Don't worry. They won't be interested in a tea trader like me.

247
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,810
Stay here and wait for me to come back.

248
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:48,890
I already took care of your family for you. You don't have to worry.

249
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,200
Come back with me to the capital.

250
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,720
Do you have anything else that you want me to do?

251
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,060
Thank you, Your Highness Heir Apparent.

252
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:05,720
Your Highness, you don't have to worry. I won't fail the mission.

253
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,300
Remember.

254
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,460
From now on, there is no Leng Kun in this world.

255
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,950
Only you, Batuer.

256
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,500
Yes.

257
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,730
Why hasn't Gu Xiaowu come back yet?

258
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,540
Did he run into the Shuobo soldiers?

259
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,130
Teacher!

260
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,690
Cousin! Cousin!

261
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,590
Cousin, are you all right?

262
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,180
Where's Xiaofeng?

263
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,260
Don't worry. She is safe. Follow me.

264
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:41,570
I clearly told her to wait here. Where did she go?

265
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,940
Cousin, I heard the whistle just now. Maybe she went to find you.

266
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,490
But I didn't blow the whistle just now.

267
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,890
What?

268
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,580
Oh no, that must have been a Shuobo trap.

269
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,860
Let's look for her separately.

270
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,170
Hu Xiao, follow me. The others follow Fifth Prince!

271
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,730
Yes, sir!

272
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,660
Kill!

273
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,440
Oh no, this is a trap.

274
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,540
Everyone, chase!

275
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,570
Capture the ninth princess!

276
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,760
Hurry, everyone!

277
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,700
Everyone, fast! A reward for anyone who catches her!

278
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,340
Heshi? Heshi, save me!

279
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,470
Heshi

280
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,170
Little Princess, what's going on?

281
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,020
Those Shuobo soldiers are despicable.

282
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,490
They have been after me like flies. I can't get rid of them.

283
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,360
Don't worry, Little Princess. No tribe will dare make any moves when they see Khan Tömür's banner.

284
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,470
If they fight Danchi warriors,

285
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,920
Danchi's iron cavalry will flatten their cities.

286
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,410
Heshi of Danchi is here!

287
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,600
You are in Danchi territory!

288
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,930
Are you declaring war on us?

289
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,670
We lost a slave!

290
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,260
We chased her to here!

291
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,610
The Sky Span Mountain is at the border

292
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,750
intersecting Shuobo, Danchi, and Xi State.

293
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,590
To say it belongs to Danchi

294
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,470
is too much!

295
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:56,540
How dare you say our Little Princess is a slave!

296
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,340
Don't get upset first!

297
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:02,950
If you return the slave to us,

298
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,180
we will stay in peace!

299
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:12,020
Otherwise, don't fault us for fighting you with a stronger force.

300
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Little Princess, they have more soldiers than us.

301
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,010
You should go north to find Khan Tömür's tent and call for backup.

302
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,150
Shuobo is being arrogant and disrespectful. If we can't stop them,

303
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,180
you must tell Khan Tömür not to fall prey to their plot.

304
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,230
I'm not leaving. I'll fight with them. Who is afraid of them?

305
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:34,630
Little Princess! We don't have spare people to protect you here.

306
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,230
Go north for 300 miles. Go around Binli (Guest) River.

307
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,520
You'll find the khan's tent by the river's east.

308
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,300
I'm not leaving!

309
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,680
What are you doing?! Release me, Heshi!

310
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,520
Heshi, you—

311
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,040
Everyone, charge!

312
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,290
Attack!

313
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,780
The assassin was caught.

314
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:26,290
Prince Xuande was very lucky this time.

315
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,270
He found the crown prince's assassin

316
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,270
and achieved a big accomplishment.

317
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,210
I'm worried that this will cause him to be on the emperor's good side.

318
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,670
That won't be good for Chengyin when he fights for the throne.

319
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,870
That's not true.

320
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,960
Whether it was Danchi who assassinated the prince or not,

321
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,380
we won't know until the assassin is brought back and

322
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,150
His Imperial Majesty makes the judgment.

323
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,910
The most important thing to His Imperial Majesty right now is

324
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,930
the arranged marriage with the Xi State.

325
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,320
If in his journey to the Xi State,

326
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,750
Fifth Prince and that Xi State's ninth princess...

327
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,230
Then, there will be a better chance for him to be the head of the Eastern Palace.
(The Eastern Palace is the lodging of the crown prince)

328
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,800
If it was really like that,

329
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,990
then we don't have to worry as much.

330
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm worried that Chengyin is too arrogant

331
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,490
and doesn't know how to please girls.

332
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,670
Xiaofeng!

333
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,150
Xiaofeng

334
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,050
Tell Fifth Prince that we've found Xiaofeng.

335
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,540
Yes!

336
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,340
Xiaofeng!

337
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,890
Water...

338
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,680
Water...

339
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,730
Xiaowu, quickly run!

340
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,100
Quickly run, Xiaowu!

341
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,110
It's all right. You're safe now.

342
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,860
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

343
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,130

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:21,200
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

354
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,570
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

355
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,160
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

356
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

357
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,120
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

358
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,700
♫ Time reverses ♫

359
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,040
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

360
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,170
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

361
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,210
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

362
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:56,840
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

363
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,830
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

364
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,750
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

365
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,400
♫ Time reverses ♫

366
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,600
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

367
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:16,860
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

368
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:23,400
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

369
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:30,950
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫
