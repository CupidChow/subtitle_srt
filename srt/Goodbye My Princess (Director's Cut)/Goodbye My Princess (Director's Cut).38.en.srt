00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,000
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,540
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,590
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,780
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,420
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,250
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,170
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:18,010
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,680
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,780
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:39,190
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:45,810
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:56,740
[Episode 38]

17
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,990
- The oar fell.
- You are so dumb!

18
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,370
Why are you showing off trying to row the boat?

19
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,140
Oh, no! What to do?! What to do?

20
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,430
- Be careful!
- It's going very far!

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,670
Oh no, we are done for. Done for. It's now so far away.

22
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,510
You really are so stupid! If there is no oar, how are we getting back?

23
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,340
Who says that rowing a boat requires an oar?

24
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,120
Then, what are we going to use?

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,830
Hurry, use all your strength over there!

26
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,040
- I am using all my strength!
- Use some effort!

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,560
- You use all your strength, too!
- This will not do. We cannot get back like this!

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,350
Hurry and use your strength!

29
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,140
Put in some effort!

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,280
- Why do I always have such bad luck when I am with you?!
- Hurry up!

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,060
- If you do not want to remain on this river for an entire night with me...
- Quickly exert some effort!

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,120
...then hurry up and row the boat!

33
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,810
Hurry, more strength!

34
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,710
- Jinx woman.
- You are the one who's the jinx!

35
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,380
Crown Princess Consort, where did you go? General Pei was looking for you for an entire night!

36
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,140
- Thank you for your efforts Yongniang and General Pei.
- As long as Crown Princess Consort is back, all is good.

37
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,120
Crown Princess Consort, are you okay? Where were you for an entire night?

38
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,860
- Are you hurt?
- There is nothing wrong with me.

39
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,460
- I am not hurt.
 - Crown Princess Consort was with me last night.

40
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,210
- Greetings, Your Imperial Highness.
- Your Imperial Highness.

41
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,690
Yongniang, Crown Princess Consort did not rest well last night.

42
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,240
So, today, watch over her carefully and let her rest well.

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,420
I—

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,550
Yongniang, first cook a bowl of ginger soup for Crown Princess Consort

45
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,190
and then call an imperial physician to check on her.

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,620
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Remember that.

47
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,130
Pei Zhao, let's go back to my palace.

48
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,290
- Crown Princess Consort, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

49
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,670
- Later, ask the royal physician to come and take a look at the crown prince.
- Yes.

50
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,290
It's not necessary.

51
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,200
Your Imperial Highness, you suffered a chill while in the Western Border.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,310
While you haven't fully recovered from it yet, it's now recurring.

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,340
It could get really bad.

54
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,120
- All right.
- I'll go there now.

55
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,100
Zhao, what has Zhao Shixuan been doing these days?

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
How is he progressing with the case?

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,460
Zhao Shixuan has collected all kinds of evidence.

58
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,140
He even met Minister Wang of the Court of Judicial Review and Minister Zong of the Ministry of Justice.

59
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,660
Soon, they will send men to arrest Gao Zhen in Ling Province.

60
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,470
But I am concerned about something.

61
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,170
What is it?

62
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,860
Zhao Shixuan has found a lot of evidence and will soon make an arrest, but...

63
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,060
he hasn't reported it to you.

64
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,980
He is, after all, your guy.

65
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,320
If he doesn't handle this matter well,

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,700
you might end up offending the empress and Prime Minister Gao.

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,230
Zhao Shixuan thinks I am allied with Prime Minister Gao.

68
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,580
He is afraid that I will harbor Gao Zhen, that's why he avoids reporting it to me.

69
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,120
What about the empress and Prime Minister Gao?

70
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,270
Zhao Shixuan likes getting all the credit.

71
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,700
I'll just act like I don't know anything. It will actually help me to deny any responsibility.

72
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,590
Your Imperial Highness, Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is outside waiting to see you.

73
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,490
Why is she here now?

74
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,220
You can leave.

75
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,840
Sese, why are you here?

76
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,240
I heard that you didn't eat much at lunchtime.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,170
It so happens that I picked some silver chrysanthemums this morning.

78
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,740
So, I made a honey silver chrysanthemums cake. Please try some.

79
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,300
Sure.

80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,850
What's the matter?

81
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,300
Did you go somewhere last night? Did you get a cold?

82
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Last night...

83
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,230
I was with your brother investigating a case at the Court of Judicial Review.

84
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,220
Maybe I picked up some chilled air. It's all right. I'll be fine in a couple of days.

85
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,050
- Elder Brother?
- Yes.

86
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,650
It's actually all your brother's accomplishment.

87
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,020
It took him no time to find the culprit that killed Zhang Can.

88
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,720
It's all because of your blessing that

89
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,730
Elder Brother can luckily accomplish his mission.

90
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,720
Zhao Shixuan is your brother and also a capable person.

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,390
Of course, I will use the best talent for the best job.

92
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,510
I thank Your Imperial Highness on behalf of my brother.

93
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,860
Since you are busy now, I will quit bothering you.

94
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,010
I will take my leave.

95
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,990
[Eastern Palace]

96
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,400
Related Lady of Excellence, what's the matter?

97
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,630
Are you worried about the crown prince getting a cold?

98
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,950
How about this? Let's go to the kitchen and brew a ginger broth for him.

99
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,700
You don't understand.

100
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,960
He was brushing me off.

101
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,660
Yesterday, Elder Brother sent me a message.

102
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,880
He has been busy investigating the case

103
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,090
and wouldn't return to the capital until tomorrow.

104
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,040
Crown Prince said he went to the Court of Judicial Review last night.

105
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,750
How could he have met my brother?

106
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,940
My Lady, the crown prince is the heir to the throne.

107
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,030
If he has something that he doesn't want to tell,

108
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,290
you probably shouldn't

109
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,730
keep pursuing it.

110
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,690
Forget it. Go to the kitchen and make a bowl of ginger broth for him.

111
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,710
Sister A'Ci, I would like...

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,490
- Sister, are you cooking ginger broth?
- Yes.

113
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,080
His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince ordered us to make one for the crown princess consort.

114
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,910
Related Lady of Excellent! My Lady!

115
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,570
Assistant Minister Gao,

116
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,200
the Court of Judicial Review has found that you are connected to the Zhang Can case. We're arresting you to be tried in the capital.

117
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,210
- Take him away!
- Yes!

118
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,380
Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty!

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,770
Your Imperial Majesty! Your Imperial Majesty!

120
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,260
Excuse me for being late! Excuse my rudeness, please!

121
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,990
There's one thing that I can't understand and want to ask Your Imperial Majesty

122
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,930
to give me justice!

123
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,920
What is it?

124
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,980
I just found out this morning

125
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,640
that my third brother in Ling Province

126
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,340
has been arrested by the Ministry of Justice and the minister of the Court of Judicial Review for trial back here in the capital.

127
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,290
In front of you, I would like to ask the ministers in charge of the Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice,

128
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,560
what crime has my third brother committed?

129
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,060
Why was he imprisoned without a charge?!

130
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,840
Your Imperial Majesty, I was just ready to report on this matter.

131
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,420
Your Imperial Majesty, when we joined forces in investigating the murder case of Zhang Can,

132
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,490
we discovered some new evidence.

133
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:13,550
Gao Zheng's crime is indisputable. All evidence points to him.

134
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,060
Your Imperial Majesty, Gao Zhen set up an illegal gambling house and collected a grand sum of money.

135
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,200
Zhang Can had reported it to the authorities previously,

136
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,940
but Gao Zhen learned of it.

137
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,010
As revenge, he killed Zhang Can first in the back courtyard of the gambling house,

138
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,570
threw the corpse into the river to fabricate a crime scene,

139
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,940
and then he escaped to Ling Province.

140
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,480
That's impossible!

141
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,560
My third brother was not even at the gambling house that day!

142
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,230
My brother has nothing to do with the gambling house! He is being framed!

143
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,520
Your Imperial Majesty, please wisely investigate.

144
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,780
Official Gao, did you personally see that Gao Zhen wasn't at the gambling house?

145
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,020
Your Imperial Majesty, there is a witness at the gambling house

146
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,020
who saw Gao Zhen beating up Zhang Can inside the courtyard.

147
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,510
I also questioned the bouncers at the gambling house.

148
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:15,300
On that day, Gao Zhen ordered them to take Zhang Can to the gambling house.

149
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,520
I verified their testimonies separately.

150
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,940
They can testify at the trial.

151
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,670
On the night of the incident, Gao Zhen left for Ling Province.

152
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,270
Wasn't he, exactly, hiding from something?!

153
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,360
Your Imperial Majesty, based on all the evidence,

154
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,760
Gao Zhen, despite being a government official,

155
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,370
illegally set up a gambling house then deliberately killed someone

156
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,150
and hid in Ling Province.

157
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,150
To prevent the suspect from escaping again,

158
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,100
the Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice

159
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,690
arrested him first in Ling Province to bring him to trial.

160
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,290
Assistant Minister Zhao, I'm the one in charge of this case.

161
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,420
Why didn't you report to me first?

162
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,140
It was urgent. Please forgive me, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

163
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,430
Prime Minister Gao,

164
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,080
on this matter, what do you think?

165
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,090
With Your Imperial Majesty personally watching the case

166
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,080
jointly tried by the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review,

167
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm sure that no mistakes will be made.

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,260
If Gao Zhen committed a crime against our empire's law, he should be convicted.

169
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,910
I will not dispute it.

170
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,590
But everyone at the Gao family has been loyal to the emperor

171
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,870
and may have offended some in the court.

172
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,630
If anyone has any ulterior motive

173
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,470
and schemed behind the scenes, it's possible, too, that it was revenge set up by them.

174
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,280
Please investigate thoroughly, Your Imperial Majesty.

175
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,450
Otherwise, I would not be able to be at ease.

176
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,180
Don't worry.

177
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,930
I will justly decide on Gao Zhen.

178
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:14,290
I have a plea and hope that Your Imperial Majesty will kindly approve.

179
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,420
What is it?

180
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,490
Please issue an edict to inspect all of the Gao family's assets.

181
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,520
Why?

182
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,970
My son made a mistake. It means I did not raise him right.

183
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,800
All of the Gao family members are also in the wrong.

184
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,540
Please approve the inspection of all of the Gao family's assets.

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,930
Gao Zhen committed a crime by himself, and he should bear the consequence alone.

186
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,490
Prime Minister Gao, you are a pillar of this nation;

187
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,580
my left and right arm.

188
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,760
If I am to implicate the whole Gao family just because of this matter,

189
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,710
wouldn't it disappoint all the people who are loyal to me?

190
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,650
I thank your grace,

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,310
Your Imperial Majesty.

192
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,880
[Supreme Ultimate Hall]

193
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,380
Grand Uncle! Grand Uncle, please wait!

194
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,300
Grand Uncle,

195
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,360
about today's matters, I really did not know about them beforehand.

196
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,150
Zhao Shixuan got the evidence but did not report back to me.

197
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,320
He directly colluded with the Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice to catch Uncle.

198
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,050
If I knew about this matter, I wouldn't have allowed it to develop into this current situation.

199
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,000
It was I who did wrong to Uncle Gao Zhen.

200
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,070
It's your great fortune that your subordinates are very capable.

201
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,480
Regarding if you wronged Zhen'er or not,

202
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,580
it is not important.

203
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,570
Empress!

204
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,840
Empress, bad news!

205
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,640
Empress! Empress!

206
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,500
Why are you panicking? Talk properly.

207
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,760
Empress, just now at the Supreme Ultimate Hall, Crown Prince was able to find the person who actually killed Zhang Can.

208
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,540
The killer was Gao Zhen.

209
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,010
What? Gao Zhen?

210
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,550
It is Prime Minister Gao's third son, Gao Zhen.

211
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,030
What's going on? Tell me everything!

212
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,710
Father.

213
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,960
Father!

214
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,580
Ever since I turned a blind eye on Zhen'er's illegal gambling house,

215
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,090
I thought it was good for him to be busy

216
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,210
rather than doing nothing as a playboy.

217
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,820
I didn't know it would blow up to this stage.

218
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,570
- Looks like we won't be able to suppress it.
- Then, will we abandon third little brother?

219
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,620
The emperor monitors me closely every day. He's hoping to catch me making a mistake.

220
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,660
I cannot show any help to Zhen'er on the surface,

221
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,160
but the emperor wouldn't also dare to touch my son.

222
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,980
Father, you say this,

223
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,770
but what if the emperor hardens his resolve and kills the rooster to scare everyone who dares to follow his steps?!

224
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,780
- Then, Third Brother—
- We won't beg for mercy!

225
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,780
We can yield.

226
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:06,370
Kun'er, hurry to the gambling house and inspect the accounts.

227
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,640
Find out how much money Zhen'er really made in the past two years.

228
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,980
Whatever money is left, submit it to the State Treasury.

229
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,590
For the deficit, we'll pay it out of our own money.

230
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,220
I didn't expect this to go this smoothly.

231
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,560
But why did Prime Minister Gao ask for such a strange request?

232
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,180
Was he upset with the emperor?

233
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,770
Old ginger is the spiciest.

234
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,780
Gao Zhen has hurt the Gao family's reputation.

235
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,400
Prime Minister Gao is cutting a clear line between Gao Zhen and the family.

236
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,760
He is telling all the officials in the court, even though Gao Zhen falls,

237
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,960
the Gao family is still standing.

238
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,440
Even a vicious tiger won't eat its cub.

239
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,510
Isn't Prime Minister Gao actually cutting all of Gao Zhen's options?

240
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,710
It's probably the end of the road for Gao Zhen.

241
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,310
Prime Minister Gao and the empress will sooner or later have a wedge between them.

242
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,550
Our plan has successfully reached midway. Everything looks good.

243
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,900
The rest is also under our control.

244
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,190
Mingyue,

245
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,280
you don't have to risk such danger again.

246
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,580
Are you telling me these words from the position

247
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,810
of my father's adopted son,

248
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:35,030
or because you wish to take me away from here?

249
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,570
I am doing this for your good. After all, Singing Jade Brothel is not a place one stays at for long.

250
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,240
That person...

251
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,470
is not necessarily a trustworthy person.

252
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,830
No need for you to act rashly just because of your anger at me.

253
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,200
If one day I really do leave Singing Jade Brothel,

254
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,130
I will definitely leave with a man who sincerely cherishes

255
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,430
and loves me.

256
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,120
Greetings to Imperial Mother.

257
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,210
Why did you still come to my palace?

258
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,460
Imperial Mother, are you already aware of what happened in the imperial court today?

259
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,690
You ask even when you know the answer.

260
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,430
What exactly happened?

261
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,380
How come the killer suddenly became Gao Zhen?

262
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,480
If you already knew it was Gao Zhen who acted,

263
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,960
why did you not inform me and Prime Minister Gao, so that we could devise a plan ahead of time?

264
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,260
Imperial Mother, I did not even know that Gao Zhen had anything to do with this affair in the first place.

265
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,960
That Zhao Shixuan directly colluded with the Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice to catch him, and then publicly announced this matter while in the imperial court meeting.

266
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
I knew it not much earlier than you did.

267
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,540
Now, Gao Zhen is your cousin.

268
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,110
Zhang Can is your cousin as well. It is best if you stay away from this matter.

269
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,570
Are you trying to remind me through other means

270
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,470
that the imperial harem cannot interfere with political affairs?

271
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,530
No, no! Imperial Mother, what I meant was

272
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,320
you are in an awkward position right now.

273
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,780
If you really want to help Gao Zhen, let me do it.

274
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,150
I indeed asked you to help me, but how did that turn out?

275
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,080
What did Zhao Shixuan do?

276
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,650
You know that Gao Zhen and Zhao Shixuan don't get along.

277
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,420
If Gao Zhen ends up in his hands, it's not going to be a good thing.

278
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,710
Imperial Mother, at the start, I did not know that Gao Zhen was involved.

279
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,370
Now that it already happened, I will try my best to make up for it.

280
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,620
Make up for it?

281
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,700
Do you know that you forced Prime Minister Gao today to personally eliminate Gao Zhen?

282
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,820
Even though he may seem neutral about it,

283
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,540
he has already started to bear grudges against us!

284
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,960
I understand. I am wrong.

285
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,890
In the future, when working with the Zhao family, I will be more careful.

286
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,330
However... Hey, Imperial Mother! Imperial Father

287
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,420
took great consideration of Grand Uncle's reputation. I believe there is still a chance to turn things around.

288
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,800
Should I go clear things up with Grand Uncle?

289
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,440
How foolish!

290
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,500
Imperial Mother, don't be angry.

291
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,050
Why would you go? Your imperial father is watching your every move.

292
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:38,840
Do you want him to know about your motives for getting close to the Gao family?

293
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,250
I understand. I am foolish

294
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,610
and did not consider it thoroughly.

295
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,050
You may leave now!

296
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,480
Yes, I will take my leave now.

297
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,100
Empress, Gao Zhen's matter was not your fault.

298
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,120
He killed someone and then ran away. Don't worry too much.

299
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,960
You just need to clearly explain the situation with Prime Minister Gao.

300
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,360
I am afraid that I cannot clear it up.

301
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,000
Zhang Can is someone I secretly sent to the Eastern Palace from my maiden family.

302
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,640
I have hidden this matter from Uncle.

303
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,060
No matter how I word things, I was still wrong first.

304
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:46,370
Empress, no one can accurately calculate what is to happen.

305
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,840
Stop blaming yourself.

306
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,770
Chengyin cannot go see Prime Minister Gao.

307
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,290
I will take this risk.

308
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,400
Hurry and let people of the Gao Manor know that I want to see Prime Minister Gao.

309
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,070
Yes.

310
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,990
My old master and young master are not home.

311
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,970
I will relay your message.

312
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,740
Why don't you go back first?

313
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,420
General, can we speak for a bit?

314
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,570
This... I cannot accept that.

315
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,940
My status may not be worth considering,

316
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,210
but the person that I work under,

317
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,810
you better look carefully.

318
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,870
Miss Rongshuang, it's not that I don't want to let you in.

319
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,320
But His Majesty specifically ordered that those who are not related to this case

320
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,030
must not see Gao Zhen. Please don't make things harder for me.

321
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,450
Then with this money, I am hoping that you will take good care of Gao Zhen.

322
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,680
All right.

323
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,940
Your Imperial Highness.

324
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,300
Miss Rongshuang, have you seen Gao Zhen yet?

325
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,920
The guard wouldn't let me in. Do you have any plans, Your Imperial Highness?

326
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,030
I am in charge of this case, so I can freely enter and exit the Celestial Prison.

327
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,810
Go back and let Imperial Mother know to not worry.

328
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,910
I will relay what she wishes to say.

329
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,280
Your Highness, you know what the empress wishes to say?

330
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,210
The words that Imperial Mother wishes to say are words that I wish to say as well.

331
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,510
I understand it all. I will definitely relay the message.

332
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

333
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,360
Uncle!

334
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,930
I did not expect that the Gao family would not come,

335
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,530
and the first one to come is actually you, Crown Prince.

336
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,370
Uncle, have you been suffering hardships in prison?

337
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,380
Of course not. I do not think they would dare to do so as well.

338
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,800
Crown Prince, do you have good news for me this time.

339
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,210
This case... has been completely given to the Court of Judicial Review and the Ministry of Justice for handling.

340
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,300
I cannot interfere with it either.

341
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,540
Crown Prince! You are the crown prince!

342
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,200
Chengyin... Chengyin, you have to help me.

343
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,490
I don't want to die or be exiled.

344
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,050
You have to help your uncle.

345
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,760
Uncle, you have to know

346
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,960
that the crux of this case is not with me.

347
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,570
It's with Imperial Mother.

348
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,130
Zhang Can is from Imperial Mother's maiden clan. How minor or major this case ends up,

349
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,890
is based on one word from Imperial Mother.

350
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,340
Uncle, you also know

351
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,210
how I ascended to the crown prince position.

352
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,260
Everything is decided by Imperial Mother.

353
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,300
I can only do so much.

354
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,210
Then, go persuade your mother.

355
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:00,180
The empress always listens to my father's words.

356
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,990
Ask my father to go ask her. I definitely will be able to come out then.

357
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,940
Uncle, you don't know how difficult it is to do so,

358
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:11,800
for Imperial Mother and Grand Uncle are avoiding any contact with each other to dismiss any suspicions.

359
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,570
But don't worry, I'll go say some good words for you in front of Imperial Mother.

360
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,200
If Imperial Mother asks Imperial Father for a lighter punishment, then your situation won't be as bad.

361
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,820
All right.

362
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,140
Uncle, it's late. I cannot stay for too long.

363
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,720
- You should take a good rest.
- All right.

364
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,500
Reporting to Your Imperial Majesty! Suspect Gao Zhen has already admitted to committing the crimes of starting an illegal gambling business and killing Zhang Can.

365
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,000
May Your Imperial Majesty bestow a sentence for his crimes.

366
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,460
Your Imperial Majesty, my third brother has committed a major crime.

367
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,440
My father is in agony for failing to discipline his son.

368
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,500
He suddenly fell ill yesterday and could not attend the court meeting today.

369
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,580
Even though my father feels bad for my third brother, he knows that the country's law cannot be ignored.

370
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,220
Your Imperial Majesty, you do not have to take the Gao family's reputation into consideration.

371
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,010
Gao Zhen's crimes are unforgivable.

372
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,820
He should be sentenced to pay life for a life.

373
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,520
Your Imperial Majesty, Gao Zhen has submitted all the profits made from the gambling house to the State Treasury.

374
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,450
Zhang Can had debt and didn't pay it. He deserved to be punished.

375
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,780
Even though Gao Zhen committed a crime, his apology was very sincere.

376
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,780
Your Imperial Majesty, please lighten his punishment.

377
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,040
We wish you would lessen the punishment, Your Imperial Majesty!

378
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:12,420
Gao Zhen may be pardoned from death,

379
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:16,170
but will not escape any other punishments.

380
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:18,660
He will be flogged 40 times and then exiled to Ya Province.

381
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,070
- Your Imperial Majesty is wise!
- Your Imperial Majesty is wise!

382
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,820
Father, the case was closed

383
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,240
in today's morning court.

384
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,570
Third Younger Brother has been exiled to the Ya Province.

385
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,330
Try to preserve his life first.

386
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,480
When the timing is right, we will bring Zhen'er back.

387
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,340
After morning court, His Imperial Majesty called for me to come to the imperial study.

388
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,240
He is giving us special permission to send him off tomorrow.

389
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,560
I won't be going.

390
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,200
Tell Zhen'er not to worry.

391
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,030
I am afraid that Third Younger Brother will suffer a bit this time.

392
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,860
This could have been both a major and minor issue.

393
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,710
It's all the empress' fault. She just had to escalate this case to reach His Imperial Majesty.

394
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,680
This empress... We helped her put Li Chengyin into the crown prince position,

395
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,290
but she is ungrateful.

396
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,300
She thinks that she no longer needs the Gao family. She is full-fledged

397
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,210
and wants to control the crown prince herself,

398
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,330
so she ended up targeting Third Younger Brother.

399
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,640
I will take revenge!

400
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,570
The empress can be replaced,

401
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,560
but the Gao family will always be here.

402
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,870
[Court of Judicial Review]

403
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,770
Second Brother, I don't want to go so far.

404
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,740
Elder Brother, can you help think of a way where I don't have to go?

405
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,320
Third Younger Brother, now that things are like this, just stay calm and stay there for a couple of days.

406
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,180
When the situation eases down, Father will definitely bring you back.

407
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,910
It's all the empress' fault. Our Gao family helped her a lot, but she refused to even come out and save me.

408
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,570
Stop talking!

409
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:38,930
Third Brother, once you leave the capital, you have to be careful with your words and actions.

410
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,450
Don't worry. I won't let you suffer for nothing.

411
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,540
One will reap what he sowed. Father has his own plans.

412
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,030
Take care of yourself.

413
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,950
I have taken care of everything along your journey.

414
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,640
Minister Gao, we have to take the prisoner and be on our way.

415
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,970
The wooden restraint is unnecessary.

416
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,660
Minister Gao, it's regulations. We still have to play the part.

417
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,510
When we exit the Court of Judicial Review and start our journey, we will take it off him.

418
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,570
Third Brother, I have to make you suffer for now.

419
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,950
Put it on him.

420
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,140
Let's go.

421
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,390
Third Younger Brother!

422
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Take care.

423
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,090
Let's go.

Assistant Minister Zhao.

427
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,760
Third Young Lord Gao,

428
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,210
how does it feel to be a prisoner?

429
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,750
You can say that no acquaintances are made without a fight.

430
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,430
I am here to especially

431
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,930
send you away.

432
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,600
So, it was you.

433
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,890
You were the one instigating at the back, that's why I got punished to be exiled to Ya Province.

434
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,130
Zhao Shixuan, just you wait.

435
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,180
My father is Prime Minister Gao.

436
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,760
He is under one man but above ten thousand.

437
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,170
Your father is just some rotten North Subduing Marquis.

438
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,600
When the time comes, I'll be back before he will.

439
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,610
I will then watch how you and your Zhao family dies.

440
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,580
You should save these words once you arrive in Ya Province!

441
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,650
Then, don't ever come back.

442
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,260
I heard that the mountain roads near Ya Province are dangerous and steep.

443
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,000
There will be wild animals wandering

444
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,170
and accidents are bound to happen.

445
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,650
Yes, Sir! We understand!

446
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Crown Princess Consort, I heard that the crown prince is in a bad mood these days.

447
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,680
Do you want to visit him?

448
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,970
Yongniang, you want me to visit him when he's in a bad mood?

449
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,560
Are you not afraid of me angering him even more?

450
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,910
Why is he in a bad mood?

451
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,690
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

452
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,920
If you have the time to worry about others,

453
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,250
why don't you worry about yourself?

454
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,810
Yongniang, you see?

455
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,010
He said that his business is considered "someone else's" business.

456
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,340
You still want me to worry about him?

457
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,490
Then according to you,

458
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,110
I am not "someone else?"

459
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,550
What are you doing here?

460
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,480
I heard that you refused to drink medicine today.

461
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,910
I don't need to take medicine. I'm healthy.

462
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:16,480
Also, that medicine tastes so bad.

463
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,820
Every time I smell it, I— That is indeed the smell!

464
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,140
Why are you at it again?

465
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,540
So, I am going to drink it with you today.

466
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,170
Huh?

467
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,950
The imperial doctor said that you have a lot of cold aurae within you.

468
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,570
You need to nurse your body well...

469
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,320
or you can't bear children.

470
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,200
Who said I want to bear your child?

471
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,170
Crown Princess Consort, those words are considered to be against morality. You cannot say them.

472
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,470
If it's me that has too much cold aura, why are you drinking medicine?

473
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,650
I also have a lot of cold aurae, so I also have to take medicine.

474
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,700
Such a coincidence.

475
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,530
Give it to her.

476
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,930
Either you drink it or I feed it to you.

477
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,460
No, thanks. I'll drink it myself.

478
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,760
I'll do it myself.

479
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,640
All right, in the future, I'll drink medicine with you every day.

480
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,210
Yongniang, what part of him is in a bad mood?

481
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,740
The crown prince was indeed in a bad mood, that's why he came to see you.

482
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,120
I think that you and the crown prince are looking more like a married couple now.

483
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,880
Yongniang, are you blind?

484
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,140
- Who is there?!
- Prime Minister Gao!

485
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,230
Prime Minister Gao, Young Master Gao ran into a wild beast

486
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,290
while entering Ya Province. He is already...

487
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:44,360
Already...

488
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,450
What kind of nonsense are you saying?!

489
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,310
- Father! Father!
- My Lord! My Lord!
- Father! Hurry!

490
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,130
My Lord!

491
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,630
What? Gao Zhen died?

492
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,820
This was not in our plan.

493
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,150
It must be Zhao Shixuan. Within the capital,

494
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,160
it was only he who wanted Gao Zhen to die and only he who dared to do it.

495
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,260
If Prime Minister Gao investigates further and finds out that it's Zhao Shixuan,

496
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,930
the arrow might end up facing us.

497
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:40,020
Good thing Zhao Shixuan knows how to get things done.

498
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,610
They may not find an answer through investigating. We aren't sure yet if this is a good or bad thing.

499
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:49,320
At least the relationship between Prime Minister Gao and the empress now has cracks.

500
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,560
We technically didn't miss our target.

501
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,910
Listen up. With Zhao Shixuan's matter,

502
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,070
we have to act like we don't know.

503
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,640
At the very least, we have to commend the Zhao family for this merit.

504
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,550
Order your men to send some things to the Zhao Manor.

505
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,680
Better send it to Qingluan Hall. Sese will understand what I mean.

506
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,460
My Lord, the empress wishes to see you.

507
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,190
What?

508
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,480
If it wasn't for her, Third Younger Brother wouldn't end up like this!

509
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,700
She still has the face to come here?

510
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,360
- I don't want to see her.
- Yes, My Lord.

511
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,420
Empress, My Lord is unwell.

512
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,180
He is in no condition to meet any guests. It's better that you just go back for now.

513
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,690
Then, I will stay here and wait until Uncle is done resting.

514
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,470
Empress...

515
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:14,220
Empress, why don't we come back another day?

516
00:42:57,610 --> 00:43:00,880
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

517
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,000
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

518
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,590
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

519
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,900
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

520
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,840
♫ A long dream ♫

521
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,610
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

522
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:26,160
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

523
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:34,360
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

524
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:41,340
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

525
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,900
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

526
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,680
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

527
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,600
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

528
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,600
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫♫

529
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,360
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

530
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,230
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

531
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,900
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

532
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,830
♫ Time reverses ♫

533
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,990
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

534
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:24,970
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

535
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:31,530
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

536
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:39,380
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

537
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,960
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

538
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,150
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

539
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,410
♫ Matters of the past life ♫
