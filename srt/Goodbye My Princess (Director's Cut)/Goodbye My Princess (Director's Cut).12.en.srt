♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,580
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:37,270
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,310
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,920

♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,020
♫  The wind blows by, dragging the candlelight with it,  ♫

[Protectorate General Office]

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,660
Although we have practiced twice,

19
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,920
I will go through it once more to ensure there is nothing left out.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,720
Where's the fifth prince?

21
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,050
Replying to Prince Xuande,

22
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,430
the fifth prince is still eliminating bandits in the desert and hasn't returned in time.

23
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,090
I will relay the plan's details to the fifth prince.

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,010
This battle against Danchi must only be won!

25
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,550
I want Khan Tömür's head as a tribute to my imperial father.

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,430
Yes!

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,590
Sir Chai.

28
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,390
How did Prince Xuande arrange the battle?

29
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,360
He wants all the side armies to cooperate with him. And in the end,

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
he will be the one to charge into the royal tent of Danchi.

31
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,580
I have my own arrangements.

32
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,760
This is the map that His Highness privately handed to me.

33
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,760
There are two roads that lead directly to the royal tent of Danchi.

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,090
We must help the fifth prince win the top honor in this battle.

35
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,330
Great!

36
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,080
What are they doing?

37
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,470
The footprints represent the path that we took together and the memories we left.

38
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,060
This is to tell us that we must always walk forward.

39
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,510
What are these stones?

40
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,230
These pebbles represent the difficulties we will soon go through.

41
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,720
Excellent!

42
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,650
Listen to me!

43
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,650
Today is the wedding day of our ninth princess!

44
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,570
Khan Tömür provided fine wine and meat.

45

Li Yan, send someone to notify First Prince Lidun of Shuobo.

57
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,580
On the Day of the battle, dispatch a team

58
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,320
to make a sneak attack on the Eastern Military Camp of Lilu King of the Left.

59
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,110
I will abide.

[Bing Pass]

61
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,560
When Shuobo's troop attacks, the top Danchi military leaders will all be at the wedding.

62
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,760
Khan Tömür will surely not dispatch help from his central army.

63
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,670
He will only send Lilu King of the Left in the Western Camp to assist them.

64
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,970
That leaves their west side less guarded.

65
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,890
- Colonel Pei.
- Present.

66
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,410
You and Shuobo's troops will join forces to surround the Western Camp.

67
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,680
At that time, I will lead men to enter from the center.

68
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,520
I offer my obedience.

69
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,380
Reporting!

70
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,670
Reporting! My Khan, the Shuobo Army has come from the east.

71
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,470
- They are only twelve miles away from our Eastern Camp.
- Eastern Camp?

72
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,040
Doesn't Luli King of the Left have 30,000 men on the east side?

73
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,030
What's wrong?

74
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,240
Why are you panicking?

75
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,000
I have about 100,000 soldiers here in the central army.

76
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,280
The Western Camp also has tens of thousands of cavalry.

77
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,730
Even if Shuobo attacks with their entire army,

78
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,010
they won't be able to cause any havoc.

79
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,870
That's right. Perhaps, when that old king of Shuobo

80
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,990
heard that you were marrying off your granddaughter today, he couldn't bear the embarrassment.

81
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,760
Hence, he's coming here to create a fuss.

82
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,870
What's the estimated number of soldiers who are coming here?

83
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,980
About 30,000 to 50,000.

84
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,000
Just 30,000 to 50,000 soldiers and they want to take down my main camp?

85
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,560
Tell the Luli King of the Left to lead 30,000 cavalrymen through the Eastern Camp

86
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,860
and see what's going on.

87
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,320
- I will abide!
- Wait!

88
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,150
Today is an important and joyous occasion of Danchi.

89
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,130
Tell Luli King of the Left to fight gloriously.

90
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,600
Yes!

91
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,490
Good!

92
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,500
The Great God...

93
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,570
is their marriage witness.

94
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,200
May the Great God bless them and protect them;

95
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,120
wish them happiness forever.

Reporting to My Khan—

105
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,860
Why are you panicking?

106
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,930
Take your time to speak.

107
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,080
My Khan, originally we thought the Shuobo fighters were only here to harass us.

108
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,880
But when Luli King of the Left led his men to the Eastern Camp, the Western Camp was attacked.

109
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,230
Now, the Shuobo army are heading to the royal tent.

110
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,640
Sir.

111
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,100
The Western Border Protectorate General Office has decided

112
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,850
to dispatch the army during the fifth prince and ninth princess' big wedding day.

113
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,240
Jian'er has been making muddled actions regarding their situation.

114
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,670
I am afraid that he will cause more trouble.

115
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,310
Hu Xiao, this time, you will lead our men

116
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,770
to quickly infiltrate the Danchi compound. You must relay this information to the fifth prince.

117
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,320
Yes!

118
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,450
Grandfather.

119
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:26,750
Xiaofeng, don't be nervous! Grandfather is here.

120
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay.

121
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,020
- Heshi hear my orders.
- Here!
- Grandfather!

122
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,950
Let me go!

123
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,350
You?

124
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,410
I'm willing to be the vanguard! May you lend me 30,000 cavalrymen to wait for our enemies!

125
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,930
King Shuobo may be old but is very experienced in warfare. You may be outstanding in archery,

126
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,410
but you would face tens of thousands of enemy troops.

127
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,180
Grandfather, if you don't trust me, you can order a general to lead then. I will assist him in battles.

128
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,430
If my arrows can disrupt the enemy's formation,

129
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,970
that's still helpful. Grandfather?

130
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,200
My Khan,

131
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,020
Brother Gu's military strategy skills are pretty good. Last time, we were able to win against Shuobo,

132
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,990
all thanks to his and that Central Plains general's idea.

133
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,390
Let him go. He's very capable.

134
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,140
What great courage!

135
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,800
Go!

136
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,270
Get Shuobo King's head as a tribute to the Great God for your wedding ceremony.

137
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,240
Okay.

138
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,950
- Yimoyan!
- Here!

139
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,100
As an older brother, you should accompany your brother-in-law to battle.

140
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,790
Yes!

141
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,510
Danchi people are skilled in fighting on horses,

142
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,550
We will make sure they don't have horses to ride.

143
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,240
Before Danchi's army deploys, you make sure to take action.

144
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,380
This will give us an advantage on the battlefield.

145
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,210
Brother Gu, once on the battleground, just follow me.

146
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,800
For our princess, I will protect you.

147
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,640
Don't worry.

148
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,610
- Brother Heshi, I'll get on with my preparations.
- Okay.

149
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,090
- I will go find you the best war horse.
- Okay.

150
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,600
Okay.

151
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,230
What's going on? Isn't it still fifteen days from the agreed attack date?

152
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,130
Prince of Xuande moved the date up.

153
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,290
General Pei's army will be coming from the southwest direction.

154
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,470
They will reach the royal tent soon. Your Highness, just be at ease and meet up with General Pei.

155
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,510
No, the ninth princess is still here.

156
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,220
You must protect her and find an opportunity for her to leave.

157
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,120
- Yes.
- Hurry and go.

158
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,740
Gu Xiaowu!

159
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,730
Little Sister, don't worry.

160
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,350
With me around, I will take good care of him. Go roast the lamb.

161
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,450
In the time it takes to cook a meal, we will be back.

162
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,120
You just take care of yourself. I'll wait for your return to drink wine together.

163
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,620
- Okay!
- Little Princess, rest assured.

164
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,300
When the lamb is grilled, we will be bringing Shuobo people's heads back.

165
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,590
I'm leaving!

166
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,400
Gu Xiaowu, you still haven't given me your belt!

167
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,060
My little princess, there's no need to worry.

168
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,570
Although Shuobo has fifty thousand people, they are tired.

169
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,790
Our Danchi elite army can win one against ten.

170
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,640
Thirty thousand is enough.

171
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,960
Additionally, our main military camp is just nearby.

172
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,860
If the enemy army really have one hundred thousand soldiers,

173
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,560
our main forces will also immediately rush to their rescue.

174
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,880
Don't worry.

175
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,340
Xiaowu, don't be afraid. Khan's one hundred thousand cavalry troops are right behind us.

176
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,210
Go!

177
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,370
Xiaowu, come back!

178
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,950
Xiaowu!

179
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,840
Xiaowu!

180
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,880
Xiaowu, hurry and come back! Beware of the troops waiting in ambush!

181
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,690
Xiaowu, come back quickly!

182
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,690
Fifth Prince.

183
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,620
Gu Xiaowu!

184
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,250
Gu Xiaowu!

185
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Gu Xiaowu!

186
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,080
Kill!

187
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,340
Charge!

188
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,580
Reporting! My Khan, we fell into an ambush!

189
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,200
Shuobo and the Li Empire set up an alliance.

190
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,110
Behind that first wave of Shuobo troops,

191
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,800
hid three hundred thousand Shuobo and Li Empire alliance soldiers.

192
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,120
Our horses all died!

193
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,730
What happened to the horses?

194
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:13,200
All our war horses just fell on the ground.

195
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,910
We have no war horses to use and got trampled upon by the cavalry of Shuobo and the Li Empire.

196
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,060
The lead army didn't have time to withdraw

197
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,300
and suffered heavy casualties!

198
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,290
What about Yimoyan?

199
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,040
What about Gu Xiaowu?

200
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,010
The front unit's formation is chaotic with their scouts having disappeared.

201
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,200
I was part of the last unit. I couldn't see the battle flag of General Yimoyan.

202
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,270
I'm afraid... that the outcome is fraught with grim possibilities!

203
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:53,170
Every soldier, wear your armor!

204
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,070
Await orders in the royal tent!

205
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,690
Yes!

206
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,060
The middle unit prepare to fight. Everyone, listen to my order!

207
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,890
Hear my command!

208
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,880
Protect your tribes! Go!

209
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,290
Yes!

210
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,750
Use your lives to protect your home!

211
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,690
Go!

212
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,050
Reporting!

213
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,480
My Khan, our thirty thousand soldiers are all gone. The middle cavalry has already moved up front.

214
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,470
The enemies came prepared. They are familiar with the landscape.

215
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,700
There must be a spy.

216
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,650
Light the smoke signals.

217
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,050
Count the remaining people and horses within the chiefdom.

218
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,450
Yes!

219
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,500
Reporting!

220
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,930
Xiaofeng, don't cry.

221
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,730
Grandfather is here.

222
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,890
A'Du.

223
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,790
Speak.

224
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,090
The army of Luli King of the Left was completely annihilated. The Eastern and Western camps have been overtaken.

225
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,800
Li Yan!

226
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,140
Li Yan! Li Yan!

227
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,640
Li Yan!

228
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,200
Release the arrows! Release the arrows!

229
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,880
Stop!

230
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,420
Heshi! Heshi!

231
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,340
My good brother.

232
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:39,820
Let's have a drink again in the next life.

233
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,050
Heshi!

234
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,270
Reporting!

235
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,250
My Khan, General Yimoyan and General Heshi have all died in battle!

236
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,580
Ninth Princess, the khan ordered me to take you away from here.

237
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,430
Who are you? Why haven't I ever seen you before?

238
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,650
Ninth Princess, don't worry. I won't ever hurt you.

239
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,450
Please, come with me.

240
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,000
Stop!

241
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,750
Sorry to offend you, Ninth Princess.

242
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,650
Reporting!

243
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:28,580
My Khan, Li Empire's troops have attacked our base camp.

244
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,730
Capture Khan Tömür alive!

245
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,000
Capture Khan Tömür alive! Capture Khan Tömür alive! Capture Khan Tömür alive!

246
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,080
Capture Khan Tömür alive!

247
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,390
No!

248
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,200
I swear to protect Our Khan until death! I swear to protect Our Khan until death!
