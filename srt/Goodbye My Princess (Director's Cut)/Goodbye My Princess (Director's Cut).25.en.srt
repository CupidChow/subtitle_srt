♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

[Episode 25]

[Supreme Ultimate Hall]

17
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,820
Second Brother, stop now. This is an insurgency.

18
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:51,980
Insurgency? Our existence...

19
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,340
is in itself an insurgency.

20
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,730
Your Imperial Majesty! All rebels have been vanquished.

21
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,700
Crown Prince has been taken to Court of Judicial Review to await your sentence.

22
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,400
"Cries of the parent birds resonate in the sky,

23
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,550
exhausting their voices, yet unable to call them back.

24
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,780
Returning to an empty nest,

25
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,500
chirping sadly the entire night."

26
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,060
[Court of Judicial Review]

27
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,570
You already dared to raise an insurrection. Who else would you not kill?

28
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,340
If I were able to sit on your throne, I would kill whomever I pleased.

29
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,490
However, I didn't succeed.

30
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,160
Refusing to come to one's senses.

31
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,020
Didn't you also ascend to the throne in such fashion?

32
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,300
You should understand that in the royal family,

33
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,050
it's impossible for true brotherly love and respect.

34
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,890
As the crown prince, you diverted the copper for Buddha statues of the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas,

35
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,900
secretly cast coins, and disturbed state governance.

36
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,040
Now, all the believers are still waiting for my explanation. You think that you

37
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,230
only committed a crime of slaughtering one's brother?

38
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,330
If I didn't have so many charges, I wouldn't have started an insurgency.

39
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,060
But everything was caused by you. It's you!

40
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,890
You were the one who was showing favoritism.You insisted on appointing that useless eldest brother as the crown prince.

41
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,790
You forced me to compete. Now, you're criticizing me for harming my own brother?

42
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,250
Even when you appointed me as the crown prince, you still indulged Fifth to investigate me.

43
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,860
Allowing my crown princess consort to investigate the case with him!

44
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,510
In your heart, you never really acknowledged me!

45
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,980
I... have always known...

46
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,970
that Chengji's death was related to you.

47
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:57,170
I still appointed you as the crown prince!

48
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:01,580
You say that I played favoritism. Yes, I am partial.

49
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,250
I am partial to you!

50
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,430
Prince Yi is also my son.

51
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,990
Do you still want me to lose a son for the second time?

52
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:23,310
Do you think Fifth is a good person?! The filthy stuff inside him is no less than mine.

53
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,630
Behind him is the Gao clan that you hate the most. Don't you have any suspicions of him?

54
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,740
Now, I failed.

55
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,360
If you really pass the crown prince position to him, just wait and see

56
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,530
if this empire will still belong to the Li's or to the Gao's!

57
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,600
If you weren't this prejudiced,

58
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,820
this throne, this empire,

59
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,060
would have been yours eventually.

60
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,250
You are the son

61
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,830
that I most wanted to appoint.

62
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,820
Imperial Father!

63
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,470
Grand Empress Dowager, this contrite subject boldly ventures

64
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,530
to beg you to save my entire clan!

65
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,780
Grand Empress Dowager, you are the most benevolent and generous!

66
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,780
Please save my clan!

67
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,850
Grand Empress Dowager, this contrite subject boldly ventures

68
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,960
to beg you to save my entire clan!

69
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,460
Li Yan... was my only son!

70
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,870
I've educated my son improperly. I ended up...

71
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,320
seeing my child dying before myself!

72
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,010
I can't blame anyone. I can't hate anyone.

73
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,090
But my clan's old and young are truly innocent!

74
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,800
This charge of insurgency is truly unbearable!

75
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,690
I...

76
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,850
No! I, your grandson,

77
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,200
am willing to use my life

78
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,790
in exchange for my clan's survival.

79
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,820
I beg that Grand Empress Dowager consider how Heaven has the virtue of favoring life.

80
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,700
Please speak on our behalf

81
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,030
and make a suggestion to the emperor.

82
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,560
Grand Empress Dowager...

83
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,290
Reporting to Your Imperial Majesty, the cases of the deceased crown prince's assassination, the Buddha copper statues of the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas,

84
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,200
and the poisoning of Xi State's princess have all been tried by the Court of Judicial Review.

85
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,890
The perpetrators are the crown prince and Li Yan.

86
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,450
I've brought the trial proceedings.

87
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,000
May Your Imperial Majesty give your judgment.

88
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,080
Your Imperial Majesty, the crown prince committed a grave mistake. Li Yan is probably guilty of instigating him.

89
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,900
Li Yan is already dead. The whole clan of Elder Prince Zhong should be punished by law.

90
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,350
But considering that the crown prince had done many merits for the empire, I wish that Your Imperial Majesty

91
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,020
will be lenient.

92
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,100
Grand Empress Dowager arrives!

93
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,710
Please rise. With all bent over,

94
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,900
I can't recognize any of you.

95
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,190
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager!

96
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,000
Imperial Grandmother, you could have just sent a message for any matter. Why must you come here in person?

97
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
Your Imperial Majesty.

98
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,140
I am here firstly for to ask for a favor.

99
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,110
Imperial Grandmother, you are making things difficult for me.

100
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,700
Please let me finish,

101
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,600
then see if it is difficult or not difficult.

102
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,220
Please tell.

103
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,060
I ask Your Imperial Majesty

104
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:22,000
to take away Elder Prince Zhong's imperial grace of having a hereditary nobility title and confiscate his entire assets.

105
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,570
Among the four clans and three generations of Elder Prince Zhong, from henceforth, they may not

106
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,780
enter the court as officials.

107
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,820
Since Imperial Grandmother has spoken,

108
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,730
I will definitely give you this favor.

109
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,340
What about Li Chengye?

110
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,830
Imperial Grandmother!

111
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,090
Li Chengye brought in an army late at night, charging through the Gate of Heavenly Purity.

112
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,800
He attempted to commit patricide and usurp the throne. He also masterminded the three cases of assassinating the former crown prince,

113
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,740
misappropriating the copper meant for the Buddha statues, and poisoning the Xi State's ninth princess,

114
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,690
then framing it on Prince Yi.

115
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,630
My Li Empire definitely cannot tolerate

116
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,470
a crown prince with such a wolfish nature!

117
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,250
Considering that he is my son,

118
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,340
I will leave his corpse intact.

119
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,100
I bestow upon him a cup of poisoned wine.

120
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,840
He is to be buried outside the ancestral tomb.

121
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,600
I never expected that Grand Empress Dowager wouldn't consider Elder Prince Zhong as being a son from her own maiden family.

122
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,640
She pulled out the House of Elder Prince Zhong up to its roots.

123
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,520
Grand Empress Dowager is formidable. It only took three statements to finalize the cosmos.

124
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,930
What does that mean?

125
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,510
For those offenses that Li Yan and the crown prince committed, if judged harshly,

126
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,750
it is acceptable to even have the entire clan annihilated.

127
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,190
What the Grand Empress Dowager said might appear as a harsh punishment,

128
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,910
but in reality, she only took the right of serving the government from Elder Prince Zhong's clan. No one lost their lives.

129
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,790
This is like when our own child fought with someone outside. When that child family come to confront us,

130
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,800
if you go up and slap your child a couple of times and give him a good scolding,

131
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,750
would they still dare to give him a piece of their mind?

132
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,580
Oh, so that's it.

133
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,150
Brother, are you being sarcastic to me?

134
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,710
It's still Kun'er who can understand it all.

135
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,510
I just don't understand

136
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,020
why His Imperial Majesty would rather let Elder Prince Zhong go,

137
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,630
but not leave his own son a way to live.

138
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,900
Dad, why are you caring about Li Chengye now?

139
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,460
If he dies, everyone will be happy.

140
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,430
Father is only saying that the emperor's heart is ruthless.

141
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,600
His Imperial Majesty is here!

142
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,430
Grandmother. Everyone can leave now.

143
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:29,600
Your Imperial Majesty, why did you come?

144
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:36,500
I heard you got sick after coming back, so I came to visit.

145
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,820
Grandmother, please do not get angry and overtax yourself.

146
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,650
Acting this way can damage your body.

147
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,290
Overtaxing myself?

148
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,380
Your Imperial Majesty, you should know

149
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,000
why I am so sad.

150
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,280
They are all your closest kin!

151
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,790
Why must you be this heartless?!

152
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,530
Grandmother,

153
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,290
when Chengye made his first step,

154
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,900
he should've anticipated an outcome like this today.

155
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,290
If I do not severely punish him, make him an example,

156
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,720
then next time, the other princes will imitate him.

157
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
If there is any problem, they would just rebel and try to kill their father.

158
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,160
Will my empire still be at peace?

159
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,950
It's not that I don't know how cruel the power struggle has been in every generation, in every dynasty.

160
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,220
But how come you think

161
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,750
that the person who's able to eat up all his prey is the one suitable to inherit your throne? Hence, you've been

162
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,860
allowing these princes to...

163
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,680
fight openly and secretly.

164
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,870
Isn't all this your doing?! They are all children.

165
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,190
They are all our children!

166
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,540
The reason why

167
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,180
Chengye went this far...

168
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,010
Have you thought about it? It's all because you spoiled him.

169
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,200
You taught him to be like that.

170
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,480
I am not wrong. My way isn't wrong.

171
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
He went wrong because he had a prejudiced heart.

172
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,900
Grandmother, to be the sovereign of a nation, he should be thinking of the people

173
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,470
and conducting himself righteously.

174
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:46,090
But Chengye, he deviated too much.

175
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,710
Your Imperial Majesty,

176
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,320
Chengye may indeed be too prejudiced,

177
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,330
but you proclaimed him as the crown prince.

178
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,430
You gave him the power.

179
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,540
If you don't want to repeat the tragedy,

180
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,660
why do you still insist on

181
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,500
the doctrine of the winner takes all? You should be proclaiming

182
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,180
a mild-mannered person to be the crown prince.

183
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
Am I right?

184
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,290
Grandmother, you are tired. Get some rest.

185
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,490
The inner palace and the imperial court

186
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,900
are ultimately two different places.

187
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,390
Li Chengye's situation is hopeless.

188
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,430
What else is Your Highness worrying about?

189
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,000
Insurgency.

190
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,370
Our very existence... itself is insurgency.

191
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,300
Sir Chai,

192
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,760
I actually never thought of forcing Second Brother to rebel.

193
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,200
Even less wanted him to lose his life over this matter.

194
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,460
Before I went to Xi State, this position of the crown prince was really not so important,

195
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,090
but it has already caused so many people to spill their blood.

196
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:12,110
I do not know if what I am doing is really meaningful.

197
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Li Chengye has a stubborn and bigoted personality. Rebelling

198
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,560
is his own decision. It has no relations with you.

199
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,230
What about Xiaofeng?

200
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,190
She got involved in our sibling fight and almost lost her life!

201
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,260
Sir Chai, how could I not feel fear or regret?

202
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,990
In your opinion then, how did the matter develop to this current stage?

203
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,700
If Your Highness was able to be resolute back then, you wouldn't have had partnered with Ninth Princess to investigate the case together.

204
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,000
The more you shouldn't have defended her after the statue was weighed;

205
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,020
hence, putting her life in danger.

206
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:59,010
All of this was because your heart...

207
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,730
your heart is too soft. You gave Li Chengye the opportunity to find your weakness.

208
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,410
Your Highness, from henceforward, the enemies that you will encounter

209
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:22,200
will be stronger than Li Chengye by a thousand times more. If you cannot maintain a clear head,

210
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,670
what you will lose... will be much more than one elder brother.

211
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,940
If Your Highness wishes to reduce the harm to a minimum,

212
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,290
you must learn to become a merciless person.

213
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,160
Only once your heart is as hard as stone, will it be impenetrable by spears and swords.

214
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,270
You would then be able to protect the people you want to protect.

215
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:10,330
Princess, these are all your favorite deserts. Eat something.

216
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,450
I can't eat.

217
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,300
I know you are anxious about all these major events in the palace.

218
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,560
But you haven't eaten anything all day. You shouldn't let your worries destroy your health.

219
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,400
Yongniang, how can I not have lingering fear? This palace was originally calm and peaceful.

220
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Suddenly, there was a mutiny. Suddenly, the crown prince was punished to commit suicide.

221
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,500
Only then did I know that the person I was going to marry was so scary.

222
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,720
You tell me. With this crown prince position being so full of danger, did every person who had risen and was given that title, do so by stepping on the blood of others?

223
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,730
Ninth Princess, you absolutely cannot speak this way.

224
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,470
The future crown prince will definitely have outstanding morality and conduct.

225
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,520
I understand. Yongniang, you should quickly go rest now.

226
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,360
I want to write a letter to my mom and dad.

227
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,040
Yes.

228
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Yongniang actually knows everything.

229
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,570
She only wants to say nice things to humor me.

230
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,220
A'Du, quickly come here! Come!

231
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,800
Now that the crown prince is gone,

232
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,930
can I not get married anymore?

233
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:49,410
If it's like this, then I'll write to Dad

234
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,740
and have him take us back.

235
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,850
Let's go back to the Xi State.

236
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,320
What do you think? Is that all right?

237
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,860
Yes. Yes. I'll do that.

238
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,760
Fourth Little Brother, think thrice before making a move.

239
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,130
Since your fourth little brother can't make a decision,

240
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,590
Chengwen, you come and help him.

241
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,930
I will obey.

242
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,480
Chengyin, what do you think?

243
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,640
I am weak in chess and dare not offer any opinion.

244
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,720
Come over here and try it.

245
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,850
Imperial Father, it's a "bent four in the corner."

246
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,770
There are no more moves that I can do and this game is over. Even I am unable to reverse this desperate situation.

247
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,490
Imperial Father, your chess game skill is superb. We are ashamed of our inferiority.

248
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,680
No need to feel uneasy.

249
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,510
I asked you all to come for a get-together today and worked your brains hard.

250
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,800
You all go back and rest.

251
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,910
We are leaving.

252
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,130
Your Imperial Majesty, it's time for you to eat.

253
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:59,510
Cao Ji, what do you think about the chess match today?

254
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,870
I am slow-witted and don't understand chess.

255
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,390
You have an answer in your heart. Say it.

256
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,700
Prince Yun is very cautious about his moves and thinks for a long time,

257
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,000
but he's too wary.

258
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,440
Prince Yong is very ambitious and brazen.

259
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,880
When he makes his move, it is clean and precise,

260
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,660
but he never thinks about the whole game.

261
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,520
Prince Yi continued to play this losing game.

262
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,000
His attack and defensive moves were all reasonable. Even though he only placed a few chess pieces,

263
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,750
he was able to change the losing situation of the game.

264
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:53,760
But he said that this was a lost game.

265
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
You saw that, too.

266
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,460
This chess game was actually 50-50 even.

267
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,540
Prince Yi had a chance to redeem the game, but he gave up.

268
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,310
Very intelligent. He knows when to advance and when to retreat.

269
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,970
He would surely be able to shoulder greater responsibility in the future.

270
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,400
Too bad.

271
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:28,050
We'll have to see if he has the skills to compete.

272
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,560
[Longevity and Benevolence Palace]

273
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,810
I want to go see her.

274
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,070
See who? Lady Zhao?

275
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,200
"Go southwest...

276
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,860
to the protectorate...

277
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:04,680
to the protectorate office..."

278
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:11,400
"Three hundred..."

279
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,690
Li Cheng—

280
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,290
Your Highness Prince Yi!

281
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,020
Ninth Princess.

282
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,420
Prince Yi, why are you here?

283
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,180
I just came out from the Grand Literature Library

284
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,320
and was getting ready to leave the palace so I passed by here.

285
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,980
Isn't the Grand Literature Library over there?

286
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,560
From now on, I might not be able to come to the palace often.

287
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,280
From now on, it will indeed be hard for us to see each other.

288
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,120
Oh right! Wait for a while.

289
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,690
This kongming lock is super complicated. I can't unlock it.

290
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,410
I'll just give it back to you. I don't like complicated things like this.

291
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:39,040
The cheap tricks here in the Eastern Palace are like this kongming lock.

292
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,430
It looks simple, but it's actually complicated.

293
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:46,030
You should learn to protect yourself no matter what is ahead of you.

294
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,780
Don't ever easily believe in someone.

295
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,520
Do you understand?

296
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,030
Does that mean I can't believe you either?

297
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,460
Greetings, Empress.

298
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,350
Please rise.

299
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,570
I was about to have someone summon you. I didn't expect you to come here instead.

300
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,350
Is that a gift for me?

301
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,700
It turns out you have one, too.

302
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,360
What a coincidence!

303
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,870
This was a congratulatory gift from your Xi State's envoy.

304
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:59,000
Light and warm.

305
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,900
It's just that the red color is a little too bright.

306
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,620
Your black one is more formal. It fits my taste more.

307
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,770
It's good that you like it.

308
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:13,140
- That, you said a congratulatory gift from the Xi State's envoy?
- Yes.

309
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,310
What congratulatory gift?

310
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,660
Of course, a gift for your marriage with the crown prince.

311
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,350
Wasn't the crown prince dethroned?

312
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,550
Xiaofeng, you are the crown princess consort of our Li Empire.

313
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,310
You are marrying the crown prince of our empire.

314
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,240
Chengye was indeed removed from his post,

315
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,070
but our Li Empire will have its next crown prince.

316
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,670
Who's going to be the next crown prince then?

317
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,570
No matter who the next crown prince is,

318
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,610
you will always be Li Empire's crown princess consort.

319
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,820
You just have to wait for marriage.

320
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,780
I want to go home!

321
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:06,730
I don't want to go anywhere else!

322
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,620
Mi Luo. Mi Luo.

323
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,350
Let me tell you.

324
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:50,210
I'm... just like...

325
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,880
that fox stole.

326
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,430
I'm being gifted here,

327
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,380
and then gifted there later.

328
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,340
Gifted here and gifted there.

329
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,460
I want to go home, Mi Luo!

330
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,510
I actually want to go home!

331
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,570
I just want to go home!

332
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,830
I miss my dad.

333
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,690
I miss my mom.

334
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,910
My name is Qu Xiaofeng.

335
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:10,270
You know that I don't want to get married over there! I only want to remain here in the grassland!

336
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,380
You said before

337
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,260
that you cared for me the most.

338
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,640
- Be good.
- Mi Luo, I want to go home.

339
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,690
I want to go home...

340
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,550
Is Xiaofeng here?

341
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,750
This place is a drinking house.

342
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,750
People who come in to drink are my guests.

343
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,080
I only answer the questions of my guests.

344
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,950
I don't have time to joke around with you.

345
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:11,590
Is Xiaofeng here or not?

346
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:17,950
Come in, drink a glass of wine, and I'll answer your question.

347
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,030
Tell me.

348
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,880
She didn't come here.

349
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,620
General Pei!

350
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,960
General Pei, slow down!

351
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,770
Are you all right?

352
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,100
This wine of mine has a nickname called "Fall in Half a Jug."

353
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,630
You drank a whole jug in one breath and drank it so quickly.

354
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,770
How could you not get drunk?

355
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,530
I don't have time for this nonsense with you.

356
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,450
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

357
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,940
She was indeed here?!

358
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,850
Was it Gu Jian who took Xiaofeng away?

359
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,560
I believe that Gu Jian will make sure Xiaofeng is safe.

360
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,590
You don't understand anything.

361
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,020
I...

362
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,000
How could I not understand?

363
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,800
I should have let you drink two jugs.

364
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,520
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

365
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,630
♫ The cold moonlight shines on the window ♫

366
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,190
♫ Matters of the past life ♫

367
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,600
♫ are carefully being considered ♫

368
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,510
♫ A long dream ♫

369
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,220
♫ Yet always gathering and separating into uncertainty ♫

370
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:22,410
♫ Watery eyes are wishing for your return ♫

371
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,030
♫ Wounds have frosted in my heart ♫

372
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:38,060
♫ Can't forget your image in my mind ♫

373
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,450
♫ Looking back to our first meeting ♫

374
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,330
♫ That first moment when we saw each other ♫

375
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:52,380
♫ Can't hold onto the fingertips that you've extended ♫

376
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,290
♫ Parting shattered the heart ♫

377
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,890
♫ Useless tears for the person isn't coming back ♫

378
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:03,920
♫ The River of Oblivion ♫

379
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,560
♫ Silently gazes unto the troubles of the mundane world ♫

380
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,450
♫ Time reverses ♫

381
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,730
♫ With a sip to forget love ♫

382
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:21,730
♫ If we meet for the first time again, who are we returning to ♫

383
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:28,260
♫ Fall goes and spring comes again ♫

384
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:35,130
♫ Dream and awakening are just in cycle ♫

385
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,530
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

386
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:51,720
