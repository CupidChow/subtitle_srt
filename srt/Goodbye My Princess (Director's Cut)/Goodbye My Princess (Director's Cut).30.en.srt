♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental when one reminisces  ♫

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,630
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,660
[Episode 30]

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,740
Give all these items to the crown princess consort.

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,710
Tell her that you've received a reply letter and gifts from the king of Xi State.

19
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,070
Yes.

20
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,010
Oh, right.

21
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,790
You have to remember that I haven't given anything to the crown princess consort.

22
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,930
A third person can't know about this.

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,130
I understand. The crown prince—

24
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,050
It's good that you understand.

25
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,130
Crown Princess Consort!

26
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,090
Crown Princess Consort! A letter came in from Xi State!

27
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,210
Dad said that everything is good in Xi State.

28
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,660
He told me to not worry.

29
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,180
He said he misses me a lot.

30
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,340
But because there are too many state issues,

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,450
he can't come to visit me.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,720
This letter is already enough to lessen my homesickness.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,530
[Eastern Palace]

34
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,620
I, Qu Lun, the crown prince's Grand Preceptor,

35
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,670
pay my respects to Your Highness the Crown Prince.

36
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,180
I, Li Shiqing, the crown prince's Junior Preceptor, pay my respects to Your Highness.

37
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,580
I, Fang Shiqing, the crown prince's Junior Mentor, pay respects to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

38
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,990
I, Lu Yong, the crown prince's Household Provisioner of the Office of Domestic Affairs,

39
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,760
pay my respects to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

40
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,270
I, Zhong Yi, the Junior Supervisor of Household Administration,

41
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,340
pay my respects to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

42

I, Pei Zhao, the Commander-in-Chief of the Right and Left Guards,

43
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,760
pay respect to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,290
I, Liu Shan, in-charge of the Right and Left Ministerial Path Security,

45
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,210
pay respect to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

46
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,930
I, Ma Yan, the Leader of the Gentlemen of the Palace's Luben Army,

47
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,490
pay my respects to Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

48
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,900
Everyone, please stand.

49
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,010
Thank you, Your Highness!

50
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:02,890
Your Highness, the topic that we will discuss with you today is salt and iron.

51
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,560
Currently, salt and iron are produced by the government.

52
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,350
The iron manufacturing plants given to the local government only care about the amount produced.

53
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,700
The quality is bad and the price is high.

54
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,300
The farming equipment produced is abundant but not useful.

55
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,410
Also, for salt, some local government officials aren't doing things according to the government's methods.

56
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,540
This led to a lot of money lost and the corruption of society's culture.

57
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,770
I believe that we should sympathize with the hardships of the people.

58
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,240
We should open up the production of salt and iron to private individuals.

59
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,870
I heard that you were tired and couldn't concentrate today.

60
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,500
I especially told Rongshuang to make this blood and vital energy supplementing soup for you.

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,910
Thank you, Imperial Mother, for your thoughtfulness.

62
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,760
Mother, you don't know how many responsibilities that I must attend to in the Eastern Palace.

63
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,080
For the past half month, I haven't been able to sleep well even once.

64
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,860
Especially that Li Shiqing.

65
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,550
He keeps going on and on about what is right and wrong.

66
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,880
It's unbearably annoying.

67
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,990
Your three preceptors were rigorously selected by His Imperial Majesty and Prime Minister Gao

68
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,330
among thousands of talented individuals.

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,020
Their experiences and knowledge are top-notch.

70
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,250
You should be modest and let them guide you.

71
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,260
Your position isn't the same as before.

72
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,020
You need to have the attitude of a crown prince.

73
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,550
Any governmental issues that you don't understand,

74
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,990
you should talk it over with Prime Minister Gao.

75
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,950
I understand.

76
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,530
[Prime Minister Manor]

77
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,920
Does the crown prince think highly of you, Junior Mentor Fang?

78
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,220
Speaking of this, I'm just basking under the light of Junior Preceptor Li.

79
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,130
After the Junior Preceptor Li admonished the crown prince several times,

80
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,720
His Highness started to ignore his opinions.

81
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,020
He would rather talk about official matters with me.

82
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,190
Two days ago, he angered Junior Preceptor Li so much,

83
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,750
that the latter just called in sick to take some days off at home.

84
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,230
Now, every time there's a test,

85
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,690
the crown prince will pester me to make a guess at the exam question.

86
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:36,010
And he even recited the answers without one word less.

87
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,060
With His Imperial Majesty's autocratic rule,

88
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,870
it's extremely hard to make blind guesses.

89
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,740
I may sound like I'm talking nonsense, but

90
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,200
coincidentally, these past few days,

91
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,020
my guesses have been correct all the time!

92
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,540
Because of this, the crown prince has been rewarded by His Imperial Majesty multiple times.

93
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,240
His mood has improved a little from this.

94
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,220
Indeed, every time there is a test lately, the crown prince will answer

95
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,110
in a straightforward and confident manner.

96
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,160
But during court meetings, he will put on a stoic face and keep quiet.

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,110
The whole smart and keen look turned out to be a pretense.

98
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,020
I am afraid that the crown prince's change in mood

99
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,050
was all because that Concubine Zhao is no longer grounded.

100
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,330
I'm still suspicious of the crown prince because of what happened to the Danchi in the Western Border.

101
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,850
If he isn't capable, then he must have someone behind him.

102
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,160
But I don't know who this person is.

103
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,480
It is making me very worried.

104
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:42,380
Don't worry Prime Minister Gao. In the Eastern Palace, I am able to voice my opinion now.

105
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,660
I will find a way to investigate this matter.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
Greetings, Crown Prince Consort.

107
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
General Pei.

108
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,800
I've already prepared the carriage. I want to take you somewhere.

109
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,680
Please come with me, Your Imperial Highness.

110
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,630

113
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,530

116
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,420
Crown Princess Consort,

117
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,660
when the crown prince came back from the Western Border, he requested for this memorial temple to be built.

118
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,430
The crown prince said that Khan Tömür had been a hero his whole life and deserved a proper burial.

119
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,520
Grandfather!

120
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,120
Grandfather!

121
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm now here to see you, Grandfather!

122
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,380
Don't cry, Xiaofeng.

123
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,190
I'm here.

124

[Bearing Graces Hall]

125
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,960
Take her there.

126
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,090
If she resolves her emotional burden, her illness might get better.

127
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:23,020
Oh right. Make sure you don't tell her that I told you to bring her there.

128
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,540
Did Li Chengyin ask you to bring me here?

129
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,170
No.

130
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,700
I wanted to bring you here myself.

131
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,480
General Pei...

132
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,490
The conflict between the Li Empire and Danchi has been going on for several decades.

133
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,500
Whether a war will erupt or not isn't under the crown prince's control.

134
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,840
If there are states, there will be war.

135
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,030
War means there will be bloodshed and death.

136
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,380
It doesn't matter if they are warriors from the Li Empire or Danchi.

137
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,850
Once they go onto the battlefield, they might not return.

138
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,370
The Li Empire also had many warriors that died on the battlefield.

139
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,060
Even now, some of their remains can't be found.

140
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,160
Their fathers, mothers, wives, and children suffered the same unbearable pain.

141
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,570
I hope Your Highness can put yourself in their situation and resolve your emotional burdens.

142
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,210
Don't hate the crown prince too much.

143
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,950
I understand that no one can prevent war from happening between the two states.

144
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,320
But the person who died was my grandfather.

145
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:04,140
The leader of the attack on Danchi was my husband.

146
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,030
General Pei...

147
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,610
How can I resolve my emotional burdens?

148
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,300
What would happen if I did resolve them?

149
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,890
Would my grandfather come back to life?

150
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,670
If I don't blame him, then who should I blame?

151
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,750
Who should I hate if I don't hate him?

152
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,080
Fate has a way of being cruel.

153
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,730
Why did I have to become his crown princess consort?

154
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,400
The Crown Prince is here!

155
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,570
Sese!

156
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,660
Welcome, Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince.

157
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,330
Sese,

158
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,730
it's been hard on you.

159
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,920
As long as I can see Your Highness again, I don't feel wronged at all.

160
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,000
For the past half month, I've been blaming myself every day.

161
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,790
But now that I see you are all right, I feel more at ease.

162
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,560
I knew that

163
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,500
if you saw me in a haggard manner,

164
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,300
you would blame yourself more and be more concerned.

165
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,030
Knowing that Your Highness also missed me every day

166
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,690
makes me very happy.

167
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,880
Crown Princess Consort, your writing looks better and better now.

168
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,150
Now that I have more time on my hands, my writing will naturally improve.

169
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,120
Ying'er, did you hear?

170
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,790
Yesterday, Qingluan Hall's restriction has ended.

171
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,690
The crown prince then rushed to see Related Lady of Excellence Zhao at once.

172
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,280
Over there, they were put under house confinement, so the crown prince couldn't enter.

173
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,740
We aren't even under house confinement here,

174
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,200
but it feels like we are.

175
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,480
Look at the crown princess consort,

176
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,720
she has been sick for about a month now. Right?

177
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,410
Besides coming the first day and making a scene,

178
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,120
His Highness the Crown Prince hasn't returned at all.

179
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,580
Don't be so loud!

180
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,800
The fact that the crown princess consort isn't on the crown prince's good side isn't something new.

181
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,040
What's there to be surprised about?

182
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,590
I'm going to rip the mouths off of these senseless servants!

183
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,970
Yongniang, forget it. Just let them be.

184
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,750

185
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,560
I'm not the person he likes anyways.

186
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,140
I was forced upon him.

187
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,190
He's unwilling and I'm unwilling, too.

188
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,230
But Your Imperial Highness, you clearly care about the crown prince.

189
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,160
If not, you wouldn't have been sad for this long.

190
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,050
I was sad before because I couldn't go back to the Xi State

191
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,900
and I married someone who I didn't want to marry.

192
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,460
But now, I've figured it out.

193
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,420
Since I can't go back, I should just be happy here.

194
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm not going to think about those sad things anymore.

195
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,400
Your Highness...

196
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,040
Yongniang, by thinking this way,

197
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,260
I will feel a lot better.

198
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,050
Isn't that a good thing?

199
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,460
It's good as long as it makes you happy.

200
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,000
I haven't left the palace for so long.

201
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,600
I wonder if Miss Mingyue and Mi Luo miss me.

202
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,330
They do. They miss you a lot.

203
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,550
I knew that we couldn't do this without you.

204
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,120
I knew you would leave the palace today.

205

Mi Luo!

207
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,510
Today, you have to be a witness for me.

208
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:12,560
What do you want me to be a witness for?

209

Gu Jian.

210
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,650
Before, I was a little distant with you.

211
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,390
It was because I lost a lot of my memories

212
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,730
and had to become familiar with you again.

213
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,350
But these past few days,

214
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,320
you brought me food, treated my illness,

215
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,920
took care of me, and was concerned about me.

216
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,320
I will remember this in my heart.

217
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,430
So, I want to...

218
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,640
I want to...

219

What do you want?

220
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,450
I want to be your sworn sister.

221
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,490
From now on, I'll treat you like my real brother.

222
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,960
Is that all right?

223
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,590
You scared me a little.

224
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,920
I thought you would pledge to marry me.

225
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,310
I was scared I would be charged for seducing a married woman.

226
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:00,550
Look at you.

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,950
Xiaofeng, I haven't seen you for a few days and you're married!

228

Tell me which young lord is it? Is he handsome?

229
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,100
Don't interrupt our conversation. We're having a serious talk.

230
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,170
Let's get back to the subject.

231
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,990
I'm unworthy of being your sibling.

232
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,380
Also, siblings with no blood relations

233
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,960
often have an ambiguous relationship that makes other people misunderstand.

234
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,840
You're speaking nonsense again.

235
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,060
Hence, why don't we just...

236
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,480
have a teacher and student relationship.

237
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,450
You want to be my teacher?

238
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:49,350
There are many advantages to having me as a teacher.

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,850
Tell me some, then.

240
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,930
If you have me as a teacher,

241

then in this world,

Mom, you probably don't know him either.

My men are trying to capture an important criminal right now.

349
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,610
I will ask you a few questions.

350
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,630
I hope you answer them truthfully.

351
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,300
Who are you?

352
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:16,370
Officer, I am Mingyue, a courtesan of Singing Jade Brothel.

353
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,330
I heard from my subordinates

354
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,340
that you are the top courtesan at the Singing Jade Brothel.

355
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,890
Every day, you just have one guest. Right?

356
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,460
Who did you see today then? Are you well acquainted with him?

357
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,830
I felt ill today.

358
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,230
I didn't take care of any guests.

359
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,890
Really?

360
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:48,430
Then, why did my men find a trace of blood in your room

361
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,120
when they were searching for the criminal?

362
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,440
Who does this blood belong to then?

363
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,530
Tonight, I was in my room playing my Chinese lute.

364
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,290
Suddenly, two strangers burst into my room.

365
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,630
They gave me ten taels of silver.

366
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:10,180
They threatened me and told me that my lute sound mustn't stop no matter what was happening outside.

367
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,270
I didn't know that those two were important criminals.

368
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,830
I should thank you for saving my life.

369
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:21,060
If your men didn't appear at that time,

370
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm afraid that I would be dead by now.

371
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,270
Miss, you've spoken well. Water-tight explanation.

372
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:39,310
Officer, I grew up in the Singing Jade Brothel.

373
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:42,160
I would never be acquainted with those lawless criminals.

374
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,830
If you don't believe me, you can investigate me.

375
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,920
Do you remember what those two looked like then?

376
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:02,180
Those two men... One was wearing a hood while the other covered his face.

377
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,880
I didn't see their faces properly.

378
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:12,000
But... based on their voice, one was a middle-aged man.

379
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,910
Plus, he had a Western Border accent.

380
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:21,460
Western Border accent? Does that mean the man wasn't from the Li Empire?

381
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,660
Probably not.

382
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,700
I've asked all my questions.

383
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,480
You must have been frightened today.

384
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,670
It's all right. I should thank you for saving me.

385
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,250
I heard that in the capital,

386
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,520
multiple young aristocratic lords

387
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,450
are willing to spend thousands of gold just to listen to you play one song.

388
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:57,120
You must have amazing musical talents.

389
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,580
I haven't listened to a lute song in a while.

390
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:06,780
Today, could I have the honor of listening to a song played by you?

391
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,450
No one has ever caused such a big scene just to invite me over and have me play him a song.

392
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,990
What kind of song would you like to hear, Officer?

393
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,660
I'll listen to whatever you're willing to play.

394
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,800
I'll play you the song

395
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,080
"Liuyao" then.
(T/N:Liuyao, literal translation 'Minor Sixth' is a song from the Tang Dynasty musical compilation "The Pipa Tune")

396
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,950
- Bring a seat!
- Okay.

397
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,340
Who told you to go to a brothel?!

398
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,910
You disobedient thing!

399
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,320
- Father! I really didn't know they were—
- You went to a brothel!

400
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,120
I also didn't know why His Imperial Majesty's Shenwu Army was trying to arrest them!

401
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,810
- Father!
- Get away!

402
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,880
The most important thing is...

403
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,760
They took...

404
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,920
They took...

405
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,530
Father! Calm down.

406
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:25,060
I told you not to go to Singing Jade Brothel! But you just have to invite trouble upon yourself!

407
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,260
Father, Mingyue and I have true love between us!

408
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,680
You worthless thing!

409
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,260
Officer!

410
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,880
Good!

411
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,660
Just like beads falling into a jade plate. Just like Buddha's voice.
(T/N: Very pleasing and moving sound)

412
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,070
Miss, you played the Chinese lute very well.

413
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,620
Cao Ji.

414
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,610
Take the gold with you.

415
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,320
One can only meet so few bosom friends.

416
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,640
Meeting one is the most valuable thing in life, gold or riches can't compare.

417
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,510
Even though I was born with low status,

418
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,740
I would never try to please anyone just for these earthly items.

419
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:59,060
Officer, if you really want to hear me play music,

420
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,780
you can come and find me at Singing Jade Brothel.

421
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,110
If I have a chance, I will definitely come to find you at Singing Jade Brothel,

422
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,060
to listen to you play the Chinese lute again.

423
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,960
Ceng Xian, escort the lady back.

424
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,660
Yes!

425
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,120
