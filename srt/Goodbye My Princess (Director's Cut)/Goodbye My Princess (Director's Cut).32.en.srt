00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,410
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,630
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,380
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,980
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,560
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,980
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,190
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:11,160
♫  So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:17,950
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:24,700
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,920
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,150
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14

♫ For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,670
[Episode 32]

17
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,550
Crown Princess Consort, return to the palace with me.

18
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,060
Then, what about these items that I've ruined?

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,390
Don't worry, Crown Princess Consort. I will pay them back in double.

20
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,890
Please.

21
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,610
They should have been taught a lesson a long time ago. You're right.

22
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,270
Right? It's satisfying to watch. Indeed.

23
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,200
These bad people, they'll be punished.

24
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,430
They are bad people.

25
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,970
What are you doing?

26
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,300
In a moment, say that it was I who did not allow you to go.

27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,600
Your Highness the Crown Prince, the empress is waiting.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,720
Please come in.

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,130
Paying respect to Imperial Mother.

30
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,840
Rise.

31
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,700
Crown Prince, you said that the crown princess consort was sick and could not get up,

32
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,450
that is why you had Related Lady of Excellence Zhao attend on her behalf.

33
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,340
Why then did Crown Princess Consort appear at the fair by herself?

34
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,500
Imperial Mother, she was the one who faked being sick.

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,170
Her legs grow on her own body. How would I know where she will go?

36
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,210
Crown Princess Consort.

37
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,730
Responding to Imperial Mother, it is I who did not want to go.

38
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,820
The Bathing Buddha Festival is a grand event,

39
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,960
but I don't understand all the rules and traditions of the Central Plains.

40
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I was afraid of hurting the reputation of the royal family if I went.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,300
You!

42
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,420
Aren't those words deliberately making my imperial mother think that I didn't allow you to go?

43
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,510
First, you faked an illness and said you couldn't go.

44
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,150
Then, you show up at Vermilion Bird Tower to let Imperial Father and Mother see you!

45
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,220
You're doing this because I went to Sese's place on our wedding night.

46
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,410
Jealousy has become a habit of yours!

47
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,700
You are willing to do anything just to take revenge on me!

48
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,450
I'm taking revenge on you?

49
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,050
Stop misinterpreting my acts just because you're evil!

50
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,390
Who was it that went to my place and started a huge commotion,

51
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,750
said that I'm a barbaric girl and that I will ruin the royal family's reputation?

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,570
Who took the clothes away just so Related Lady of Excellence Zhao could attend the festival?

53
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,770
Yongniang can be my witness!

54
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,190
That is right! I did not want you to go!

55
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,250
I was afraid that you would cause the imperial family to lose face.

56
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,930
Be quiet!

57
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,200
Do you know that if we pursue any charges, you all have just committed the crime of lying to the emperor?

58
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,270
Xiaofeng is the Li Empire's Crown Princess Consort.

59
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,120
Even if there was impropriety, who would dare comment on it?

60
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,540
Are you telling me that by allowing a concubine to attend the festival instead of the crown princess consort,

61
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,150
the imperial family would not be disgraced?

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,020
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao, you have some guts.

63
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,090
Empress, I do not know what I did wrong.

64
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,530
The crown prince is always careful with his words and actions.

65
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,300
This time, it must be you bewitching him into doing so.

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,190
You pestered the crown prince and forced the crown princess consort to fake an illness, so you could substitute her.

67
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,010
I did not!

68
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,250
In consideration that it is your first offense, I'm punishing you to stay in your own palace,

69
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,870
- reflect on your wrongdoings, while kneeling and reading Buddhist manuscripts for three days.
- Imperial Mother!

70
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,660
Empress, I'm not the one who committed these mistakes.

71
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,930
Why are you punishing me?

72
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,680
You even dare to defy me?

73
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,200
Since you do not know what you have done wrong,

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,120
then I will punish you to kneel and pray for a month.

75
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,500
You are to kneel for six hours every day and are not allowed to take even half a step out of Qingluan Hall,

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,310
until you have figured out what you did wrong!

77
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,800
Imperial Mother, this situation has nothing to do with Sese.

78
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,970
It was I who did not wish to bring the crown princess consort.

79
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,590
That is right, Imperial Mother. It was I who did not want to go.

80
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,490
- It has nothing to do with Concubine Zhao.
- Be quiet!

81
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,090
Crown Prince, do you think that the punishment is not severe enough?

82
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:36,270
- Imperial Mother—
- Your Imperial Highness, say no more.

83
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,090
I am ready and willing to receive my punishment.

84
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,800
I thank Empress for your grace.

85
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,680
Related Lady of Excellence!

86
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,450
After saying so much, do you know what you did wrong?

87
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,310
You wish to vent your anger out onto Sese. I have nothing more to say.

88
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,670
How can you still speak up for her?

89
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,330
If that Concubine Zhao really had womanly virtues, was respectful and obedient,

90
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,440
even if you want her to substitute the crown princess consort into going,

91
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,250
she should have refused it.

92
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,770
How could she ignore the palace traditions and wear the dress designated for the crown princess consort?

93
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,390
One month is a mild punishment for her.

94
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,230
You are the crown prince now. You mustn't dote on Concubine Zhao alone.

95
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,270
Xiaofeng is the true crown princess consort of the Eastern Palace.

96
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,590
Yes, I know. I will take my leave now.

97
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,550
Empress, as His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince was leaving, he looked very upset.

98
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,360
I am afraid that he did not even listen to a single word of advice I gave him.

99
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,160
Empress, you do not need to be too worried.

100
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,320
The crown prince's current favorite is Related Lady of Excellence Zhao, so it is natural for him to cherish her this much.

101
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,540
After a while, this novel feeling will go away.

102
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,650
Do you think that the crown prince is only temporarily infatuated with Concubine Zhao?

103
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,170
The crown prince is still young.

104
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:45,510
Since he is full of vigor and vitality, it makes sense for him to be enchanted like so.

105
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,590
I keep feeling that the crown prince is not like how he was.

106
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,060
Although, before, he had a dull personality,

107
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,090
he was affectionate towards me.

108
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,710
But now, I keep feeling that he has distanced himself from me.

109
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,400
Especially after that Concubine Zhao entered the palace.

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,960
He will frequently defy me for her.

111
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,320
The Zhao and Gao families have always been at odds.

112
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,910
If Prime Minister Gao finds out that he only dotes on Concubine Zhao,

113
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,530
I am afraid that the prime minister might develop other goals.

114
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,480
It's fine if that crown princess consort isn't being favored by the crown prince.

115
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,300
With her personality, even if I help her now,

116
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,680
she may not necessarily be of use to me in the future.

117
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,540
Since it is like this, Empress, why not find someone you can control

118
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,970
and give her to the crown prince as a lower-rank concubine?

119
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,390
- Out of the way!
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince! Crown Prince!

120
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,120
Empress has made an imperial decree that no one is allowed to enter Qingluan Hall!

121
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,610
- Sese!
- Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince!

122
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,640
Your Imperial Highness, please sympathize with Related Lady of Excellence,

123
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,670
so that she will not receive more punishments.

124
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,180
I will have a few words with her then leave.

125
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,320
- Step down.
- Yes, Your Imperial Highness.

126
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,890
Sese! Sese!

127
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,460
Your Imperial Highness.

128
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,810
Sese, it is I who implicated you.

129
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,210
If I had known that having you enter the palace to be by my side would result in this situation,

130
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,880
I would rather part with you and allow you to live in a carefree manner.

131
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,230
I would never let you bear these grievances.

132
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,500
Your Highness, do you still remember the words I wrote for you?

133
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,840
"One flower, one world;

134
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,180
One leaf, one pursuit;

135
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,670
One melody has its sad moments;

136
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,860
One life for one person."

137
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:46,840
I have never regretted the decision I made at that time. Since I chose to be with you,

138
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,170
my only hope is that in this life, we will never abandon each other.

139
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,020
Sese...

140
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,600
This situation has really aggrieved Sese.

141
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,640
I had originally planned to put all the blame on myself,

142
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,830
but I didn't expect that I would bring suffering to Sese.

143
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,030
Zhao, do you think I am being too biased by doing so?

144
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,730
This is your house affair.

145
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,460
House affair?

146
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,570
A man should manage his household, govern a country, and bring peace to the world.

147
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,660
But as the distinguished Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace, I couldn't even protect my wife.

148
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,300
Zhao, I am going to Bearing Graces Hall now to put on a show.

149
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,600
I must let everyone know that it is I who behaved like a scoundrel and bullied the crown princess consort.

150
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,350
This way, if Xiaofeng does any wrong in the future,

151
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,460
they will think that it was I who forced her to do so. They will not blame her.

152
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,150
It will be done like this.

153
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,250
- Where is the crown princess consort?
- Your Imperial Highness, she has already retired for the night.

154
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,500
Your Highness, she is already resting!

155
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,350
I've long known that you were a person who didn't stand by your words.

156
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,190
I trusted you wrongly!

157
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,050
What do you mean?

158
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,910
You only told me that the two of you would go to the Temple of Ten Thousand Buddhas.

159
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,200
You did not tell me about going to the Vermilion Bird Gate.

160
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,730
You are ignorant and incompetent.

161
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,910
If you had properly researched the rites during the Bathing Buddha Festival, then you would have known that

162
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,300
Imperial Father and Mother would appear at the Vermilion Bird Gate at that time.

163
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,890
I was not even going to attend that Bathing Buddha Festival, so why would I research its rites?

164
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,460
Okay, even if you did not understand those things,

165
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,150
since you said you were sick, you should have stayed in the palace.

166
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,840
Yet, you were rambunctiously playing around in front of the Vermilion Bird Gare, right under the watchful eyes of Imperial Father and Mother.

167
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,860
What was that about?!

168
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,860
It is because you lacked foresight.

169
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,660
If you knew it would be like this, you should have tied me inside Bearing Graces Hall.

170
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,630
I would not be able to go anywhere then.

171
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,360
Then you admit it? You are doing this on purpose!

172
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,880
First, you made an insincere promise. Then, you purposely made your appearance.

173
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,210
You caused Imperial Mother to vent her anger on Sese and punish her!

174
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:22,420
Li Chengyin, since coming through the doors until now, only you have been talking.

175
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,100
Let me tell you! Related Lady of Excellence Zhao cherishes you, but I do not!

176
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,270
You two better keep your distance from me. Let's have nothing to do with each other!

177
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay, remember the things you said today. The two of us have nothing to do with each other!

178
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,970
Your Imperial Highness the Crown Prince! Your Imperial Highness!

179
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,780
Strange.

180
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,290
Your Imperial Highness!

181
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,490
- No one is asking you to cherish me.
- Your Highness!

182
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,090
- Your Highness, please calm down!
- Stay where you are!

183
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,860
Shi'en! Shi'en!

184
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,690
- I am telling you!
- Your Imperial Highness.

185
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,400
Relay my order! From this day forward, no one in the Eastern Palace is to speak to the crown princess consort!

186
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,460
If I find out that anyone spoke to her, I will have their tongue plucked out and punish them with menial labor!

187
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,790
What happened?

188
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,030
- The crown prince getting this angry is a rare sight.
- Right.

189
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,410
- How come he is like that?
- I do not know.

190
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,090
Are you sure the crown prince and the crown princess consort aren't just acting?

191
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,960
The crown princess consort doesn't seem like someone who can act.

192
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,780
Oh right. The crown prince left the crown princess consort in the palace today,

193
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,230
and instead took Related Lady of Excellence Zhao to attend the Bathing Buddha Festival.

194
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,280
I am afraid that he wants to use this to win over the Zhao family to his side.

195
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,160
The Zhao family's power is not strong enough for us to fear.

196
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,820
But that Chai Mu who is behind the crown prince...

197
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,260
I am concerned that if the crown prince and the crown princess consort are only fighting on the surface,

198
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,050
and His Imperial Highness has secretly sent that man to get Xi State's allegiance,

199
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,630
it will be hard for us to maintain control by then.

200
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,510
Dad!

201
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,940
- Second Brother!
- Ruyi is here.

202
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,580
Ruyi.

203
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,200
Dad, I personally made a ginseng broth for you.

204
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,330
Drink it while it is hot.

205
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,720
Look at this Ruyi.

206
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,430
Even though Ruyi is the youngest among your siblings,

207
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,560
she is the most sensible.

208
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,740
Father is biased.

209
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,700
Elder Brother and I did so much for you,

210
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,680
- but all are incomparable to Ruyi's one bowl of soup.
- Of course.

211
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,250
That's for sure. Everyone says the daughter is a father's precious pearl.

212
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,900
Tastes good. Tastes good.

213
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,130
Ruyi, only Father gets one? What about me?

214
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,970
Of course, I saved a portion for you.

215
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,410
I'll tell someone to send it to your room later.

216
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,280
Father, look.

217
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,160
She's smart, witty, and such a sweetheart.

218
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,210
Second Brother, you too.

219
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,530
It's so late, why aren't you letting Father rest?

220
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,570
Even though Father is healthy, he is still of old age.

221
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,930
You can't be careless about his health.

222
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,620
Of course. Of course.

223
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,870
You also have to watch out for your health. You are always busy with court affairs.

224
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,850
If you don't take a break, how can your body handle it?

225
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,330
Yes, your lectures are so right.

226
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,620
Father. Second Brother. Make sure to rest early.

227
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,550
- I'll take my leave now.
- Okay.

228
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,690
So great.

229
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,760
Father, do you think

230
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,190
that with my younger sister's outstanding appearance,

231
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,480
who can be worthy of her?

232
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,130
Besides the man that owns the world,

233
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,150
no one can be worthy of my Ruyi.

234
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,970
That's weird.

235
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,650
Why are they avoiding me today?

236
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,000
- Crown Princess Consort.
- Yongniang.

237
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,330
Crown Princess Consort, Princess Yongning and Luoxi are here to see you.

238
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,230
They're inside waiting for you.

239
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,750
Okay. I got it.

240
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,810
Yongniang, do you know why everyone in the Eastern Palace

241
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,170
is purposely avoiding me today?

242
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,510
Do you know that the crown prince made an order

243
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,020
that no one in the Eastern Palace can talk to you?

244
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,630
What?

245
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,510
So, that's what happened.

246
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,710
Crown Princess Consort, in the future, try not to be rash and argue with His Imperial Highness anymore.

247
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,270
If no one talks to me, then I just won't talk. Who's afraid of him?!

248
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,470
Yongniang, put these flowers in a vase for me.

249
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,450
Yongning. Luoxi. I haven't seen you guys for so long.

250
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,640
Xiaofeng, I heard that my brother, the crown prince, has ordered

251
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,720
that no one in the Eastern Palace can talk to you.

252
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,640
I was afraid you would get bored, so I especially dragged Luoxi here today to chat with you.

253
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,660
You don't even know what kind of things have happened these days.

254
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,410
That Zhao Sese, you can tell she is strategic and scheming.

255
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,840
Brother Crown Prince really has no taste.

256
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,820
You're saying too much.

257
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,980
Xiaofeng, today is Luoxi's birthday.

258
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,250
Really?

259
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,160
We should celebrate it.

260
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,220
No need to.

261
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,470
Imperial Great-Grandmother initially planned to hold a birthday banquet, but I don't like lively events.

262
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,220
Either way, birthdays go by every year.

263
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,780
There's not much to celebrate.

264
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,020
The banquets in the palace have too many regulations. Of course, they're no fun.

265
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,650
Do you guys want to go out of the palace?

266
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,440
- Go out?
- I want to.

267
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,140
I have a friend who owns a wine house in the East Market.

268
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,320
We can go to celebrate there tonight, all right?

269
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,780
All right, let's go.

270
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,570
Luoxi.

271
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,260
- Let's go!
- I...

272
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,070
I also want to go out of the palace.

273
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,880
That's good, then!

274
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,960
Tonight, at the first quarter of haishi,
(Haishi: 9:00 to 11:00 p.m, the first quarter being 9:30 p.m.)

275
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,620
when the soldiers change shifts at the Eastern Gate,

276
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,290
- we'll meet there.
- All right.

277
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,870
Oh right! Tomorrow is Sese's birthday.

278
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,190
I remember she came to the palace to play when we were little

279
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,460
and my mother gave her a present.

280
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,320
Why must you remember her birthday?

281
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,960
Her birthday is right after mine.

282
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,200
It's really like that?

283
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,590
I also heard that His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince

284
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,330
went to the crown princess consort's palace and created a commotion.

285
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,500
The crown princess consort argued with His Imperial Highness.

286
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,490
Under a moment of frustration, His Highness ordered that everyone in the Eastern Palace

287
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,300
must not speak to the crown princess consort.

288
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,040
Those who go against his orders will have their tongues plucked and exiled.

289
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,730
Just for a woman, he is becoming so unruly!

290
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,080
How did I teach you on a regular basis?

291
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,370
How could you lose etiquette in front of Empress?

292
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,400
Empress, please forgive me. I don't know why

293
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,620
but I feel nauseous after smelling the aroma of the soup.

294
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,040
How audacious! How can you say that Empress's soup is nauseating?

295
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,520
I think you want a beating.

296
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,380
Empress, please forgive me! Please be merciful!

297
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,210
Stop!

298
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,050
Tell them all to leave!

299
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,610
Yes.

300
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,130
All leave. Leave.

301
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,600
Take her to the back for an examination.

302
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,930
See if she is still a virgin.

303
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,470
Yes.

304
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,290
Come quickly!

305
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,060
Empress, this wretched maid is actually pregnant.

306
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,230
How brazen! You dared to seduce the emperor?!

307
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,790
Your Imperial Highness Empress, I didn't seduce the emperor!

308
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,160
I didn't.

309
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,120
Not the emperor? Say it.

310
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,030
Who did you have a secret affair with?

311
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,620
You're not talking?

312
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,020
My management style has always been strict,

313
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,460
yet such a scandal occurred in my palace.

314
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,880
- Wei Chen!
- Here.

315
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,390
Drag her out and cane her to death!

316
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes.

317
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,620
Empress, no!

318
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,830
No! Empress, please spare my life!

319
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,820
Empress...

320
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,010
Empress, please appease your anger.

321
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,910
I'll talk. I'll talk.

322
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,530
This child...

323
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:33,630
This child belongs to the Yulin (Feather Forest) Palace Guard... Zhang Can.

324
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,540
What? Zhang Can?

325
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,920
Empress, please spare my life!

326
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,600
What do you want to say to me?

327
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,930
Audacious, you dare not answer me when I speak to you?

328
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,510
Aren't you afraid that I will report it to the empress and have you both punished?

329
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,700
Your Imperial Highness, I don't understand.

330
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,210
Why won't you allow the people in Eastern Palace to speak with the ninth princess?

331
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,920
Empress is watching her. She clearly wants to use her to suppress Sese.

332
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,740
The less she speaks, the less trouble she will get into.

333
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,800
Tell your men to secretly protect the crown princess consort. Don't let her notice it.

334
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,360
Yes.

335
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,750
- General Pei!
- General Pei!

336
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,220
Necklaces!

337
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,130
Come take a look!

338
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,960
Take a look again!

339
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,430
Owner, how much is this?

340
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,670
- That one?
- Yes, this one.

341
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,450
Two copper coins.

342
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,690
They keep following us.

343
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,110
We need a plan.

344
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,130
Let's meet at the hospital later. Try to lead them away.

345
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,740
Look at this shop. They seem to be doing well today.

346
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,600
Out of the way!

347
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,250
Out of the way!

348
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,730
Go!

349
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,380
Where's the crown princess consort?

350
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,090
You better tell the truth, or we won't be able to explain it to our superior.

351
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,940
Gu Jian!

352
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,050
- Where is Xiaofeng?
- She's waiting for me at the hospital in front.

353
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,830
Hospital?

354
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,830
Go look for her first. I have something else to do.

355
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,230
Later, go wait for me at the Mi Luo Drinking House.

356
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,310
[Saving the People Hospital]

357
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,370
Doctor, some time ago, I suffered a severe head injury and lost some memories.

358
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,750
Can you help take a look?

359
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,550
What's the matter?

360
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,850
There's no scar on your head.

361
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,990
There are also no signs of trauma on your head.

362
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,670
The one odd thing I found is... there is a lot of cold qi in your body.

363
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:05,020
You are certain I don't have head trauma?

364
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,140
Cold qi inside my body?

365
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,570
A'Du, are those two people still following?

366
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,520
I'm fine.

367
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,980
You're saying that Gu Jian knocked out those two people?

368
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,200
He told us to meet him at Mi Luo Drinking House? Let's go.

369
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:06,150
Doctor, that patient earlier, what illness did she come in here for?

370
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,020
Here. Here. What's wrong?

371
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,390
It's been awhile since I saw you. Why are you so quiet?

372
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,230
What's wrong?

373
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,200
I keep feeling like there's something bothering me.

374
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,220
I can't let it go, but I can't remember it.

375
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,070
You seem to be better off. You don't have any problems, no worries.

376
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,200
Foolish girl. While living in this world,

377
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,750
who can really be totally worry-free?

378
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:17,470
It's only that people use different methods to live how we wish.

379
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,710
Xiaofeng, for those matters that you can't let go of, just let them be dispersed by the wind.

380
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,200
For those memories you can't remember, don't try to recall them.

381
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Many things are already arranged by fate.

382
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,220
Just let everything go according to destiny.

383
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,120
For the way you are dallying with me, aren't you afraid that you won't be able to get married?

384
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,970
Lord, why don't you take me?

385
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,220
Right, I almost forgot about serious business. Today is one of my friend's birthday.

386
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,040
Therefore, tonight, I want to reserve this place to celebrate for her.

387
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,840
I brought the deposit with me.

388
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,720
Lord is so generous.

389
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,560
All right. Since you've said it, I'll clear this place tonight. I will entertain your friends well.

390
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,820
Good.

391
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,600
- You guys go ahead and enjoy your food.
- Okay.

392
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,340
Hurry up! Hurry up! Get up! Hurry! Leave!

393
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,520
These masters... This... What are you doing?

394
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,040
They are Yulin Palace Guards.

395
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,260
Don't go!

396
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,400
Stop with your nonsense. Clean the table up!

397
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,740
All right. All right. I'll clean it up right away. Waiter, what are you doing?!

398
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,870
Hurry! Take these away! Please wait a bit, Masters.

399
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,890
- What is she singing?
- Change to another song!

400
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,090
This, sir, that gentleman already asked for this song.

401
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,400
Once I finish the song, I can sing for you.

402
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,850
Nonsense! Change when I ask you to change it!

403
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,370
Quickly change it! Hurry up!

404
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:59,600
Please calm down, Masters. How about this? This song will be completed soon.

405
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,350
If you want something else, when she finishes, she will sing whatever you want. Is that okay?

406
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:06,620
I want her to change right now!

407
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,000
Are you being...

408
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
At such a nice shop,

409
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,310
how come a group of shameless ugly toads had to come?

410
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,400
Who is the ugly toad?!

411
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,230
Aren't you asking for something you already know the answer?

412
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,520
You...

413
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:34,920
Look at those two. Expect some good scenes soon.

414
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:40,550
You are more good looking than that singer.

415
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,210
Drink with me.

416
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,900
I hate two kinds of people the most.

417
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,200
One is a person who bullies the weak. The other is someone who overreaches himself.

418
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,730
Yet, you are actually both of these types.

419
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,730
As for the wine, I can drink with you,

420
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,590
but I'm afraid that you don't have the good fortune of enjoying it.

421
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,140
You—

422
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,940
Masters!

423
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,200
Please calm your anger, Officers!

424
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,660
I will get you a physician, now! From where did gangsters like you come from? Quickly leave!

425
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,670
You better scram! Get out!

426
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,740
Master, please calm down. I'll go get you a doctor now.

427
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,180
- Sir, how are you?
- Cut the nonsense! Quickly go after them!

428
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,380
Hey, officers! Officers!

429
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,790
Stop! Don't run!

430
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,930
Don't run!

431
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,520
You two go that way! Hurry!

432
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,820
Yes!

433
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,320
Careful!

434
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,520
Stop!

435
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,840
My god, you are finally here. I was so scared earlier. You don't know how chaotic it was. I don't know what to do.

436
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,500
Xiaofeng offended some officials. They have run out eastward.

437
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,100
Gu Jian, I couldn't find you before. Hurry and go...

438
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,670
find them.

439
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:25,380
Looks like this fight is unavoidable.

440
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:38,000
General Pei!

441
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,990
- Out of the way! Out of the way! 
- Crown Princess Consort.

442
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,400
Crown what? Help me catch those people!

443
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:50,990
Out of the way! Out of the way! There they are!

444
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,970
Gen-Gen-General Pei.

445
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,400
From what troop are you?

446
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,540
General Pei, I am Zhang Can, from the Left Yulin Palace Guards.

447
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,150
Being noisy in the busy streets, do you still obey army laws?

448
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,220
I-I know my wrongs. I know my wrongs.

449
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,650
Since you know your mistakes, go back quickly to accept your punishment.

450
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,270
Yes, I will listen to your order.

451
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,610
Go!

452
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,100
Yes.

453
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,390
Xiaofeng!

454
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,560
Gu Jian!

455
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,100
I heard from Mi Luo that you offended some officials, are you okay?

456
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,750
I am okay. You do not know this, but just now, after those officials saw General Pei, they were scared witless and ran away.

457
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,410
Let me introduce him to you. This is the Eastern Palace's Yulin Palace Guards Commander-in-Chief, General Pei Zhao.

458
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,260
Crown Princess Consort, it is getting late. You should return to the palace.

459
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,540
I know I have to go back to the palace, but today I am afraid that you will have to send not just myself back.

460
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,270
What do you mean by that?

461
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,170
Crown Princess Consort, this—

462
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,380
- Let's go.
- Crown Princess Consort.

463
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:11,280
You brought so many people. Are you telling everyone that the crown princess consort has sneaked out of the palace?

464
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,900
If you had not knocked out my people, would the crown princess consort run into trouble?

465
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:19,700
They were disguised so well, how was I supposed to know they were your people?

466
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,260
My mistake. Okay, you go first. I will follow her and definitely send her back to the palace.

467
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,310
Since you are selecting a gift for Princess Luoxi, why do you not choose something more expensive?

468
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,380
What do you know? There are plenty of expensive things in the palace.

469
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,200
I want to find something that cannot be found in the palace.

470
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,500
You can find all sorts of strange and rare items by coming to our Weipin Pavillion.

471
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:52,390
These items are quite clever and fun. Best for gifts.

472
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,630
Your store really does have many good items. I am from Xi State. Do you have any special things from there?

473
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,900
You have come to the right place. Since you are from Xi State,

474
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,400
then you should be no stranger to malachite stones.

475
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Yes, that is right. There are lots of these malachite stones back at home.

476
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,940
Shiny bluish-green color. A texture quality similar to natural silk.

477
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,190
Even in Xi State, this is rare and of the highest grade.

478
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,550
It is really beautiful. Look.

479
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,810
Malachite stones symbolize peace and prosperity. Gifting this to Luoxi is very suitable.

480
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,180
- Shopkeeper, this one it is. Help me wrap it up, please.
- Okay.

481
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,810
And then help me write two names on it.

482
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,400
Write Luoxi on one and Zhao Sese on the other.

483
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Okay, Young Lord.

484
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,700
Why are you gifting one to Zhao Sese?

485
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,710
Tomorrow is her birthday.

486
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,170
You really are generous.

487
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,140
Lady Zhao is quite a nice person. A'Du, give her the money.

488
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,830
How come your shop also has glass beads?!

489
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,940
Shopkeeper, help wrap some for me.

490
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,300
Okay, Young Lord.

491
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,160
What are you buying these for?

492
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,130
Using glass beads to make belts is my expertise.

493
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,490
Really? I do no believe it.

494
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,570
If you make one for me, then I will believe you.

495
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,070
Do you think I am a three-year-old child? I am not going to fall to your trick. Prodding me is no use.

496
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,100
I'm taking these to gift to a friend.

497
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,990
Thank him for saving me so many times.

498
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,830
I saved you so many times, but you are not going to thank me at all?

499
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,590
You are my teacher. Saving me is a must.

500
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,040
Here, Shopkeeper.

501
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,200
- Yongning, slow down. Slow down!
- Hurry!

502
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,210
- Be careful.
- Hurry!

503
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,760
Hurry! Hurry!

504
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,790
Look, Xiaofeng's carriage. Xiaofeng!

505
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,190
Xiaofeng! Xiaofeng!

506
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,860
- Greetings to both princesses.
General Pei? Why is it you?

507
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,330
Where is Xiaofeng?

508
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,480
- Crown Princess Consort wanted me to take you two.
- Let us go.

509
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,500
Princess, please slow down. Crown Princess Consort is very energetic and has no restraint.

510
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,100
But you two princesses have grown up in the palace from birth and have deep knowledge on the rules of the palace.

511
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,820
I urge that you two not go out anymore.

512
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,240
Are you here to fetch us or to stop us?

513
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,400
I did promise Crown Princess Consort that I would fetch you two, but I—

514
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:44,530
It's good that you know what your role is. You know my temper very well. As long as I wish to go out,

515
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:47,390
no matter what you do, I will find a way.

516
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:52,240
Yongning, do not speak like this. General Pei is just doing his duty.

517
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,480
General Pei, today is my birthday.

518
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,800
Normally, aside from visiting temples and my elders with my mother,

519
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,060
I have never left the palace.

520
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,300
For so many years, I've always wanted to have a birthday that was truly for me.

521
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,210
Can you grant me this wish? If you are worried, you can come with us.

522
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,990
We promise that we'll return to the palace with you before zishi. (zishi: between 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.)

523
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,400
If you get reprimanded, then—

524
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,430
Say no more. I'll be responsible. Either way, there's still Fifth Brother.

525
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,790
Let's go. Don't worry.

526
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,270
Here, the good wine.

527
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,700
Drunk kitten, how can you get started even before the guests are here?

528
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,590
Hurry and go to the kitchen to serve the dishes.

529
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,250
Wait! Wait!

530
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,680
Princesses.

531
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,470
- Xiaofeng.
- Xiaofeng.

532
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,510
- Xiaofeng.
- Xiaofeng.
- You're finally here!

533
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,180
Luoxi, happy birthday!

534
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,790
Do you like it?

535
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,320
It's so pretty!

536
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,800
That is a malachite stone, only found in Xi State.

537
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,000
Why didn't you prepare a present for me?

538
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,190
I did. How can I forget about you?

539
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,160
I don't know what you like, but I'll carefully pick one when it's your birthday.

540
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,750
As long as it's from you, I'll like it.

541
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,270
Xiaofeng's friends are here?

542
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:29,600
Introduce them to me. What kind of people would require General Pei to personally escort them?

543
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:35,350
This is my good friend, Mi Luo. This is Luoxi and Yongning, my best friends from the palace.

544
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,020
Hello.

545
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,890
Luoxi, look how pretty Xiaofeng's friend is.

546
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,830
Miss Mi Luo, I've already heard Xiaofeng speak of you. She said that you are her best friend.

547
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,000
Now that I've met you, you really are generous, hearty, and charming.

548
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,160
It's the first time a girl has praised me like that.

549
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,500
Come! Let me introduce the wine I have here.

550
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,140
All right, let's go.

551
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:03,200
Here, look. This is my private collection.

552
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,480
Men like stronger wine.

553
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,200
But for girls, you should choose a more fruity flavor so it will be easier to drink.

554
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,500
Look. I have Tusu wine, Autumn Dew spirits, Misty Mellow wine,

555
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:20,400
Full Water Spring wine, Lotus Bud wine, Cold Sandalwood, Thousand Mile wine, Apricot wine, Golden Sand,

556
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,960
there's also Hedong wine, Cinnamon wine, Pearl Springs wine,

557
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,020
Pear Blossom Spring wine, and Ruoxiachun wine.

558
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:33,100
The names of these wines sound really nice. I've never heard of so many before.

559
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,600
What types of wine do you usually like to drink?

560
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,550
I have never drunk before.

561
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,040
No way! You never drank wine?

562
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,660
Then, for your birthday, we will drink our hearts out. Let's go.

563
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,480
Mi Luo, you can't.

564
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,560
♫ The night has yet to fade ♫

565
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,740
