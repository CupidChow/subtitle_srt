00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,630
♫ As dusk starts, I look at the setting sun in the horizon ♫

2
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:30,600
♫  I faintly remember the outline of your face ♫

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,320
♫  After all, it can't be helped to feel more sentimental
when one reminisces  ♫

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,270
♫  I sigh softly at our happy times ♫

5
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,800
♫  The night hasn't ended, so many stars fall into the
rim of my eyes  ♫

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,580
♫  Collecting a soft and gentle light  ♫

7
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,000
♫ The sky is clear, the scenery are good ♫

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,370
♫ If you're not by my side♫

9
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,120
♫ So what if I can go up the Firmament ♫

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,960
♫ The boat passes an empty harbor and feeds the loneliness ♫

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,740
♫ Frost falls over the wilderness, drooping the tears ♫

12
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,880
♫ Who caused my sun to fall from the sky ♫

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:39,320
♫ It’s your face that took away my entire light ♫

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,960
♫  For only you are my heaven ♫

[Goodbye My Princess]

16
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,700
[Episode 35]

17
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,220
This will take some time and processing.

18
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,470
How about this? I'll give you half a month.

19
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,650
Make sure to use your shop's best craftsman to make it. This is the down payment.

20
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,730
All right, Young Lord! I'll make sure our best craftsman makes the outfit.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,870
Do you need any other clothes?

22
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,740
What else do I want?

23
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,360
I want this. Make a silk dress with flower embroideries with it.

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,640
All right, Young Lord!

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,780
What are the measurements for the dress?

26
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,960
Measurements?

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,060
Let me borrow your measuring tape.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,900
- I'll let you know when I'm done measuring.
- All right!

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,520
Xiaofeng. Xiaofeng! Come!

30
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,250
What do you want?

31
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,350
- Raise your arms.
- Why?

32
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,270
What are you doing?!

33
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,140
Your stature is about the same as Sese's. I'm using your measurements to make her a dress.

34
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,880
No, you're the one measuring it?

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,190
Why not ask the shopkeeper to measure instead?

36
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,580
Do you want her to find out that you're not a male?

37
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,200
Besides, we're a married couple. What's the big deal about taking measurements?

38
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
Lift up your arms.

39
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,500
Just be quick about it!

40
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,950
- Hurry up!
- Don't move!

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
- Does it look nice?
- Who asked you to measure me? Why did you take my measurements?

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,950
What's wrong with that?

43
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,890
- Pinwheels! Colorful pinwheels!
- Hold it well.

44
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,870
Pinwheels! Take a look!

45
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,960
Accessories!

46
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,920
- Accessories!
- You walk like a camel, so slow. Let's go.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,600
Drunk kitten,

48
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,020
who is that man with Xiaofeng?

49
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,800
Why did she pretend not to know us?

50
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,160
We're here.

51
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,260
This person is cold one moment and hot the next.

52
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,120
- Have you planned Xuniang's incident accordingly?
- Everything is prepared.

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,260
His Highness the Crown Prince sent words that he'll come over for dinner after his lectures.

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,200
A'Du, what are you doing here alone?

55
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,940
Xiaofeng...

56
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,110
I saw Xiaofeng with a handsome man

57
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,730
together on the streets earlier.

58
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,080
Did she ask you to wait here?

59
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,480
All right, just find a spot and sit.

60
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,560
I'll prepare some good food and drinks for you.

61
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,700
You're also looking for Gu Jian Jian?

62
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,200
He's here, in the back.

63
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,520
Gu Jian!

64
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,600
Gu Jian, are you okay? Is it because the injury hasn't healed yet?

65
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm all right.

66
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,290
I drank too much so my stomach hurts.

67
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,850
Are you hiding something from me?

68
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,360
What can I hide from you?

69
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,830
Stop giving me that excuse.

70
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,340
If you're not telling me, then I'll tell the princess.

71
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,520
Don't.

72
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,410
I fell down the cliff

73
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,900
and heavily injured myself last time.

74
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,630
I haven't fully recovered yet,

75
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,560
but it's nothing serious.

76
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:27,640
Is it from when I stabbed you?

77
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,950
- That's why...
- Don't think too much about it.

78
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,970
No matter what, I am an accomplice to the murders of your clan.

79
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,130
Just one knife injury is not a big deal.

80
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,360
Compared to the mental trauma Xiaofeng received,

81
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,140
my injuries are nothing.

82
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,200
What I am most afraid of is...

83
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,910
Xiaofeng remembering the past.

84
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,500
I am afraid of her resenting me

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,580
and even herself.

86
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
A'Du,

87
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,850
I know.

88
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,810
I know you are in as much pain as me.

89
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,740
We want to forget, but we cannot.

90
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,090
If you want to cry, then cry.

91
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,050
Here. Here.

92
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,560
Sir, this way, please.

93
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,340
Mi Luo!

94
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,940
- Where's A'Du?
- Why did you just come now?

95
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,090
A'Du is in the back with Gu Jian.

96
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,810
You're making my teacher chop wood again?

97
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,680
He owes me money, so he has to work for me. It's reasonable.

98
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,920
Prepare some food and drinks for us. I'll go back there to find them.

99
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,220
All right! I'll bring it up.

100
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,360
A'Du! A'Du!

101
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,150
A'Du?

102
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,270
What's the matter?

103
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,980
Did Gu Jian bully you?

104
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,320
How is that possible?

105
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,460
Don't look at me!

106
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,290
I wouldn't dare bully her.

107
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:53,460
But you... you left her behind and secretly met with another man.

108
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,610
Of course, she would be sad.

109
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,600
What do you mean secretly meeting? What kind of teacher talks to their students like that?

110
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,330
Teacher?

111
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:09,920
I thought you would keep pretending not to know me.

112
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,260
You're an infamous thief.

113
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,610
If the crown prince saw you and reported you to the local officials, what would you do then?

114
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,760
I did that for your own good.

115
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,290
- So, you're afraid of implicating me?
- Obviously.

116
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,640
Obviously what?

117
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,320
Xiaofeng said your wine is obviously the best in town.

118
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,410
You have the best fortune when it comes to drinking.

119
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,440
I just asked this drunk kitten earlier to go get a batch of wines that came from Xi State.

120
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,910
It's not even displayed in the shop yet, and we already bumped into you.

121
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,770
- You went to get the wine earlier?
- Indeed.

122
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,560
Move over a bit.

123
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,910
Xiaofeng, I saw you on the streets earlier. The man with you

124
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,140
is your husband, right?

125
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,280
You guys were quite lovey-dovey and looked good together.

126
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,650
- Hand-in-hand, walking along the streets.
- What lovey-dovey?

127
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,130
He went to buy clothes for his concubine but wanted me to come with him.

128
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,140
He has a concubine?

129
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,900
Why did you have to go if he was buying clothes for his concubine?

130
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,960
How would I know?

131
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,050
Maybe he wants to give her a surprise?

132
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,590
But some things were weird.

133
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,650
Speak up.

134
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,840
Look. One time I fell into the water at the same time as his concubine did.

135
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,010
But he saved me first and didn't care about his concubine.

136
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,200
And one more time, I came here to get some wine for his concubine.

137
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,820
But the wine gourd was smashed and we both almost fell.

138
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,780
He also pulled me up first.

139
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,460
His concubine ended up falling and hurting her hand.

140
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,150
Isn't that weird? He obviously dislikes me, but always saves me first.

141
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,520
- Those really happened?
- Yes, they did.

142
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,380
You haven't been here for a meal in a long time.

143
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,480
I specifically asked the Imperial Buttery to make your favorite dishes.

144
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,450
Quickly try them to see if they suit your taste.

145
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,060
All right.

146
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,320
You know me so well.

147
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Today's dishes taste really good.

148
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,980
- Then, you should come eat with me more often. All right?
- All right.

149
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,910
Here, eat this.

150
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,760
Thank you, Imperial Mother.

151
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,820
How have you been getting along with your two consorts?

152
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,970
Related Lady of Excellence Zhao is gentle, respectful, cautious, and understanding.

153
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,350
But the crown princess consort...

154
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,980
She is from Xi State after all. So unruly and overbearing. It is giving me a headache.

155
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,920
There are many official affairs you have to take care of. Don't be stressing over women.

156
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,500
Let them take care of it by themselves.

157
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,370
Imperial Mother, if the crown princess consort could take care of these things,

158
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,190
would I need to worry about it?

159
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,920
Here, have some soup.

160
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,470
Forget it. We won't talk about anything bothering you anymore.

161
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,480
- Rongshuang, pour some wine.
- Yes.

162
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,030
This is a newly delivered pear blossom wine from the Court of Imperial Entertainments.

163
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,710
Try it. It's sweet and easy to drink. The weather is cold so it can also warm you up.

164
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,290
All right.

165
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,790
It tastes good.

166
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,310
Drink one more cup.

167
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,110
Imperial Mother, try some, too.

168
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,670
Imperial Mother, a toast for you.

169
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,630
All right.

170
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,690
I haven't been so happy in such a long time.

171
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,620
You're right.

172
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,660
If you like it, then drink some more.

173
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,230
All right.

174
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,750
Why are you still standing there? Hurry over.

175
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,850
Do you remember the things you need to do?

176
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,590
I remember them well.

177
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:36,710
Enough. There is someone here to wait upon him. Mind your business.

178
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,390
Go down now.

179
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,240
Don't bear any grudge against the empress. After tonight,

180
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,140
you and your child will start to enjoy a luxurious life.

181
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,290
Remember that you need to take really good care of the crown prince tonight.

182
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,590
From my perspective, I think that this husband of yours

183
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,930
does not dislike you like the way you described him.

184
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,180
Do you know that when a person faces an accident,

185
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,530
his first reaction is the most truthful.

186
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,840
Since you are the first person he saved,

187
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,100
it means you are the person he cares about the most.

188
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,140
Crown Princess Consort, if it wasn't for the crown prince helping you today,

189
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,430
not only would you not learn how to open a crab, you probably would have been laughed at by others.

190
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,520
This shows that His Imperial Highness really does care about you.

191
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,820
In my opinion, I think most men in this world

192
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,920
don't know how to interact with the woman they like.

193
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,030
That's why he treated you badly.

194
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,580
He only wants to hide his affections for you.

195
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,990
He clearly loves Zhao Sese.

196
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,680
Why would he care about me?

197
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,300
Related Lady of Excellence, get some rest soon.

198
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,140
Recently, the crown prince has had a lot of governmental issues to deal with.

199
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,410
Don't wait for him.

200
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,620
Let's wait a little more.

201
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,730
Jin'er, do you think His Imperial Highness is really that busy?

202
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,290
Or is he just tired of me already?

203
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,140
He's not willing to see me anymore.

204
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,130
Related Lady of Excellence, don't think too much.

205
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,820
In His Highness' heart, you are the person he cares about the most.

206
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,760
Is that so?

207
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,610
Before, I thought that His Highness cared about me the most, too.

208
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,120
But now, the way he looks at the crown princess consort...

209
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,280
Jin'er, I'm really scared.

210
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm scared that I will lose him.

211
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,730
Related Lady of Excellence.

212
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,800
Jin'er, do you know when the first time

213
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,960
I met the crown prince was?

214
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,090
I don't know.

215
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,060
I remember the first time I entered the palace.

216
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,750
Yongning and the younger princesses would always play pranks on me.

217
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,420
They tricked me into going to the fake mountain in the garden. They caused me to hurt my leg.

218
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,870
I cried and screamed, but no one would come and save me.

219
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,960
Yongning!

220
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,640
Yongning! Is anyone there?

221
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,040
It was really cold then. I was really scared.

222
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,010
I curled up into a ball and prayed that someone would find me.

223
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:36,070
At this time, His Imperial Highness appeared.

224
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,460
Come, I'll carry you on my back.

225
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,820
He carried me from the bridge

226
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,400
all the way back to the main hall.

227
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,500
The moment I was on his back,

228
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,980
I felt really safe.

229
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,830
From that point on, I was determined

230
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,460
that he was the man I was going to marry.

231
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,900
Now, my wish has been fulfilled

232
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,170
and I'm married to him.

233
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:50,060
This might have been fate.

234
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,000
That's right. The crown prince and you are a match made in heaven.

235
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,790
You guys will grow old together for the rest of your lives.

236
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,870
You're right.

237
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:06,620
The crown prince told me that he would never betray me and would treat me well for the rest of his life.

238
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,990
How could I make blind assumptions?

239
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,040
Jin'er, hurry and prepare some pastries to send to His Highness.

240
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,780
This way he can rest well and not tire out his body.

241
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,350
Yes.

242
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,110
I, Pei Zhao, greet Crown Princess Consort.

243
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,730
- General Pei, you are on duty tonight?
- Yes.

244
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,810
Why are you still outside when it is already so late?

245
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,920
I cannot sleep, so I came out to take a walk.

246
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,960
Look at how beautiful the stars are tonight.

247
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,180
But I feel like Shanjing's starry sky is so far away from me.

248
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,750
So far, far away. So far that I cannot reach it.

249
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,650
Unlike the grasslands of Xi State.

250
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,370
The starry sky hung so low

251
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,390
that it seemed like you could get a star just by reaching out your hand.

252
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
Crown Princess Consort, you miss your homeland?

253
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,400
I am a bit troubled,

254
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,990
but have no one to tell it to. I feel suffocated.

255
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,330
Someone said that Li Chengyin treats me very well.

256
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,290
But whenever I see him, we will fight.

257
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,920
I feel like he does not like me at all.

258
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,100
You are also a man of the Central Plains.

259
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,650
Based on your viewpoint, does he treat me well?

260
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,800
This is a family matter between you and His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince. It would be unsuitable for me to speak about it.

261
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,740
I am not the crown princess consort right now. I am your friend.

262
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,000
Caring is one matter,

263
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,590
but knowing how to care is another matter.

264
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:34,260
Do not think of her in your heart, but kept doing things that would hurt her.

265
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,430
You have been thinking for so long.

266
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,120
Is it really so hard to answer my question?

267
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,830
His Imperial Highness naturally cares about you.

268
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,860
But no one is born knowledgeable

269
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,370
on how to be a good husband, right?

270
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,350
You should give His Highness some time.

271
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,930
Really?

272
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,420
Crown Princess Consort and General Pei's relationship is most definitely not ordinary.

273
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,880
My Lady, say, if this affair

274
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,480
was accidentally made known to His Imperial Highness,

275
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,820
then I believe that he would hate the crown princess consort even more.

276
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,020
Empress! Empress!

277
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,050
Empress! Emp...

278
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,840
What are you rushing about so early in the morning?

279
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,240
Respon...

280
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,510
You are all dismissed.

281
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,340
- Responding to Empress...
- What exactly happened?

282
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,480
Rongshuang, did you go to the Side Hall

283
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,700
and see Xuniang?

284
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,570
I took people to the Side hall to tidy it up, but saw...

285
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,770
saw Xuniang on the crown prince's bed.

286
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:21,020
Xuniang?

287
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,560
I originally thought of sending you one or two more maidservants to serve you in your palace.

288
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,040
Since you took a fancy to Xuniang, this is also a good thing.

289
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,390
I thank Imperial Mother for your good intentions.

290
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:43,790
Last night, I was drunk. I did not necessarily fall for her.

291
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,940
Crown Prince, what do you mean by this?

292
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,350
You are the crown prince of the Eastern Palace. Is it not allowed for one or two more maidservants to be serving you?

293
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,030
Imperial Mother, you know that the only person I have in my heart is Sese.

294
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,300
She... She was already mad at me. If she finds out about this affair,

295
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,340
I... I...

296
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,370
Zhao Sese is just a Related Lady of Excellence.

297
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,530
Even if you took a few more secondary consorts, there would be no need to worry about her.

298
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,780
Mother, I have never defied you.

299
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,820
If you want to gift her to me, I...

300
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,840
I wouldn't say anything against it. It's just one more person in my palace.

301
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,990
But I have a favor to ask you. Wait until I comfort Sese

302
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,340
before you send her to my palace.

303
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,800
You are this scared of her?

304
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,270
Imperial Mother, if you won't even do this small favor for me,

305
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,740
then I'll have to disobey you.

306
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,760
You dare contradict me because of that woman?

307
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,890
Your Highness, please calm down. The crown prince didn't mean to argue with you.

308
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,850
That Xuniang is only a lady-in-waiting here in the palace.

309
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,240
Sending her over a few days later is not an issue.

310
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,660
- Empress, do not pressure the crown prince anymore.
- Enough.

311
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,170
Imperial Mother, I have finished drinking this porridge.

312
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:00,240
I still have important matters to attend to, so I will leave now.

313
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,570
Your Imperial Highness, General Pei has arrived.

314
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,280
Your Imperial Highness.

315
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,090
Shi'en, go outside and close the doors.

316
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,800
Yes.

317
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,640
A'Zhao,

318
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,570
I slept at the empress' palace last night.

319
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,550
She asked a lady-in-waiting named Xuniang to take care of me.

320
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,800
Imperial Mother, you drink, too.

321
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,790
Here's to you, Imperial Mother.

322
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,530
All right.

323
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,920
Cheers, Mother.

324
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,410
All right. Cheers.

325
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,010
Who are you?

326
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,420
Your Highness! I-I-I'm Xuniang.

327
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,390
I'm a lady-in-waiting for the empress.

328
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,820
You know how you got onto

329
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,160
my bed tonight.

330
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,480
If you tell someone else

331
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,160
what happened tonight,

332
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,690
you will lose your life.

333
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,330
Please spare my life, Your Imperial Highness!

334
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,120
I really want to see what result

335
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,770
the empress wants from this scheme.

336
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,000
Just to prevent me from favoring only Sese,

337
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,730
arranging a few ladies-in-waiting by my side is reasonable.

338
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,920
But why did she choose this Xuniang?

339
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,120
Your Highness means...

340
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,020
You must clearly investigate this situation

341
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,510
with Xuniang.

342
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,150
I understand.

343
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,890
What is the update on the preparations for Mingyue's affair?

344
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,640
I knew you were going to come so I made a few dishes for you.

345
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,160
This is Azure Dragon Lying on the Snow,

346
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,200
Hidden Needle in Snow,

347
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,240
Buddha's Hand and the Goddess of Mercy Lotus, and Fallen Leaf Lute Shrimp.

348
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,050
All these are dishes from my hometown.

349
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,650
When my mother was alive, she would make these often for me.

350
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,830
I don't know if it would fit your taste or not.

351
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,140
Mingyue.

352
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:41,250
This contains some of the living details of Pure Consort Gu.

353
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:44,300
Crown Prince asked someone to find

354
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,340
an old lady-in-waiting that used to take care of Pure Consort Gu.

355
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,430
After multiple confirmations, there aren't any errors.

356
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,500
I understand.

357
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,410
Mingyue, think carefully about it.

358
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,260
Once you take this step forward,

359
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,420
you will never be able to turn back.

360
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,480
Since the first day we reunited,

361
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,140
there was already no way to go back.

362
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,390
This Fallen Leaf Lute Shrimp has to be paired with the sweet mulberry wine with a high alcohol content to taste good.

363
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,490
This Fallen Leaf Lute Shrimp

364
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,910
has to be paired with mulberry wine for it to taste refreshingly good.

365
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,340
I don't know if you have heard of this poem.

366
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,710
"I don't know for whom the mulberry wine

367
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,170
would be poured for this year."
(T/N: a line from the Tang Dynasty poem ""Narrating One's Emotions to the Magistrate of Henan in Autumn" by Liu Yuxi)

368
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,040
"Today, I must get drunk with the mulberry wine you brought to send me off;

369
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,380
or else, how could I

370
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,430
endure the grief of our separation?"
(T/N: from the poem "Goodbye, My Companion" by Zhang Wei)

371
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,830
You have to help me take care of him.

372
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,040
Did I make you recall a sad past?

373
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,270
No. No.

374
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,030
You let me

375
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,450
remember some happy times.

376
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,400
Mingyue, you have treated me with sincerity.

377
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,830
I don't want to hide anything from you.

378
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,810
It's true.

379
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:29,490
I'm the emperor of the Li Empire.

380
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,740
Mingyue, you were a gift given to me

381
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,200
by the heavens.

382
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,980
How's the investigation on Xuniang going?

383
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,680
I've checked it. She doesn't have a background.

384
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,100
She's been working in the palace for five years. Normally, she's honest and does her duties.

385
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,890
But I heard that in these past few months, she's been in contact with a person named Zhang Can.

386
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,810
- Who's Zhang Can?
- He is one of my subordinates. He is fond of eating and averse to work. He is a fiend in human form.

387
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,020
But he could be considered a distant cousin of the empress.

388
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,880
The empress' distant cousin?

389
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,440
Your Imperial Highness, I've picked up the clothes.

390
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,420
Good. Follow me to Qingluan Hall.

391
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,050
Yes.

392
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,720
Do you like it?

393
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,160
I thought you looked really pretty when you wore an aqua blue dress.

394
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,270
I don't know if you like it or not.

395
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,260
Your Imperial Highness is very thoughtful. Thank you.

396
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,110
As long as it's gifted by you, I will always like it.

397
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,360
If you like it, then change into it so I can see.

398
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,590
All right. Then, please wait a while. I'll go change right now.

399
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,200
All right.

400
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,940
Your Highness!

401
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,350
Does it look good?

402
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:18,840
Not bad. Beautiful and refined. Gentle yet stylish.

403
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,610
Oh right, Sese. I have something to talk to you about.

404
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,500
The wolf tooth that I gave you before is actually Xiaofeng's.

405
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,690
I didn't know before as I just randomly picked it up from my camp.

406
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:36,540
That wolf tooth is really older sister's.

407
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,180
Yes.

408
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,770
No wonder she kept on asking me where I got it from.

409
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:49,640
Xiaofeng told me that her grandfather obtained it when he killed the wolf king.

410
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,980
Since it's something from her grandfather, we should return it to her.

411
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,520
Plus, the wolf tooth is an evil object. It's unlucky if you wear it.

412
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,680
Since it's older sister's,

413
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,590
of course, we should return it back to her.

414
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,420
Jin'er, bring my wolf tooth.

415
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,150
Yes.

416
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,150
Oh right, Sese.

417
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,030
I picked out an excellent piece of jade. It fits this outfit perfectly.

418
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,640
Here.

419
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

420
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,450
Leave. Leave.

421
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:18,910
Since Ruyi has entered the palace, Father will probably

422
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,080
never be able to drink the soup that she makes.

423
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,540
If you don't want to part with Ruyi,

424
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,900
then why did you heartlessly send her into the palace?

425
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,710
Neither the empress nor the crown prince are from the Gao family.

426
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,530
It is inevitable that they will be disloyal.

427
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,940
I'm not scared of the empress.

428
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,870
She's just a female without a royal child.

429
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,530
In the end, she has to rely on us. But the crown prince...

430
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,840
I can't see through the crown prince.

431
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,740
I have a feeling that once he is full-fledged,

432
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,840
he will separate himself from the control of the Gao family.

433
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,540
That's why I took this unwise move and made Ruyi enter the palace.

434
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,610
Ruyi has always been intelligent since she was young.

435
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,420
If she can seize this opportunity

436
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,890
and have a prince,

437
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:24,650
then we won't have any worries from now on.

438
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,760
About Ruyi serving in the His Imperial Majesty's bedchamber, have you asked the empress to make the arrangements?

439
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:37,030
The empress specifically wanted me to tell you

440
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:40,210
that she's secretly planning for it.

441
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:44,590
If there aren't any accidents, Ruyi will be in the emperor's chambers in a few days.

442
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,690
May you be at ease.
