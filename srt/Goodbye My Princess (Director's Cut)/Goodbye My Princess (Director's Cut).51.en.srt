I cannot do what you ask.

25
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,590
He isn't an assassin.

26
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,700
He is Gu Jian!

27
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,870
Release the arrows!

28
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,260
No!

Come here! I want you to see this!

30
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,670
Didn't you say that you like him?

31
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,480
I want you to see him die!

32
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,490
No!

33
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,070
Open your eyes and look!

34
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,440
Look at it!

35
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,310

Release the arrows.

39
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,900
Li Chengyin, stop right now! Stop right now!

40
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,460
You cannot keep shooting. You cannot keep shooting!

41
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,130
Aside from Gu Jian, A'Du is there, too.

42
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,930
What did A'Du do wrong?! What did A'Du do wrong?!

43

Li Chengyin, I beg you. Please stop!

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,440
Hurry!

47
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,820
Stop!

A'Du...

52
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,480
A'Du is all right.

53
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,660
You saved her. She is alive.

54
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,390
A'Du...

55
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,750
If something happens to her,

56
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,820
you will be devastated.

57

I...

58
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:58,000
I cannot let you be sad anymore.

59
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,120
You hid her under you.

60
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,580
You were protecting her, right?

61
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,670
Right?

62
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,100
Why are you so foolish?

63
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,420
Why are you so foolish?

64
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,460

What's the meaning of you continuing to live?

169
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,250
You want revenge,

170
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,050
or do you want to see your enemies living very well?

171
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,970
You might as well just die.

172
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,310

No matter what happens, it will be better than living like how you are now.

176

I forgot that you don't have the ability to choose between dying or living right now.

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:25,010
If you expose the conspiracy between the Danchi and Gao Xian back then,

179
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,320
I will then give you a quick and satisfying death.

180
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,860
Maybe, you will hate me.

181
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,320
But I wasn't the person who annihilated Danchi.

182
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,810
So not only should you not hate me,

183
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,050
you should also thank me.

184
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:49,220
I, the new ruler of Danchi, used only two years

185
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,420
to recover the vegetation and domestication of this place.

186
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,750
All the citizens are living in peace and prosperity.

187
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:02,690
So, choosing to work with me isn't betrayal.

188
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:13,730
Father, I've never seen His Imperial Majesty so smitten to a woman.

189
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,860
Ever since she entered the palace, whenever His Imperial Majesty comes to the harem,

190
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,680
he will surely stay at that vixen's place.

191
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,510
For her, he desolated the other concubines in the harem.

192
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,230
I can not understand it.

193
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,380
She is just a commoner; a lowly servant from a brothel.

194
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,300
How could she have smitten His Imperial Majesty like that?

195
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,180
Daughter, after today, do not say such things anymore.

196
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,810
Be patient.

197
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,260
There's no need to fight for affections that will only last for a short moment.

198
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,850
Unlike in the past, we are now in a tight position.

199
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,900
It's better to have one less thing to worry about.

200
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,470
I understand, but I'm still angry.

201
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,470
You are a noble consort. You have to be tolerant.

202
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,610
The better you are to Mingyue, the more considerate His Imperial Majesty will be to you.

203
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,240
Am I right?

204
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,370
I know already.

205
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,140
I just wanted to complain.

206
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,800
If you want the emperor to come, go find the grand empress dowager.

207
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,390
I understand now.

208
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
Thank you, Father.

209
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,070
Send some more smart servants to Mingyue's place.

210
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,120
Father, why are you careful to this extent?

211
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,200
One needs to be cautious in order to live longer.

212
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,270
I know now.

213
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,240
Come. Come, come, come.

214
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,750
Leave, leave, leave.

215
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,890
North Subduing Marquis, you've drunk the wine and watched the dance.

216
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:22,330
Just tell me what your motive is for coming here.

217
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,620
King of Shuobo, no need to be nervous.

218
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,590
I am here to give you a present.

219
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,570
Stop going in circles.

220
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,890
This little gift of mine

221
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:39,430
is not as grand as the gift from Lord Gao of the Protectorate General Office of the Western Borders.

222
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,550
Speaking of Lord Gao and the cities that he lost to me,

223
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,880
those indeed count as a magnificent gift.

224
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,890
King of Shuobo, you should think about

225
00:23:53,890 --> 00:24:00,900
how things in this world cannot easily have fallen into your hands.

226
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,430
What are you trying to say?

227
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,230
The conspiracy between the tribes and the people in charge of guarding the borders.

228
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,420
The frontier pretends as if they are no match,

229
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,780
in exchange for more military power and supplies.

230
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,470
The government has no choice but to rely on them heavily

231
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,270
and promote the officials within the borderline.

232
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,590
Day after day, year after year, the border is never at peace.

233
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,780
Then the soldiers that guard the border become more important.

234
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:35,320
The idea of raising bandits for one's own benefits is nothing new.

235
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,180
Maybe in the past, Gao Yuming was indeed a big tree that fostered shelter for others.

236
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,650
But now, he is facing enemies from all directions,

237
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,520
His Imperial Majesty's trust for him is less than before.

238
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,710
He is already ordering an investigation.

239
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,210
You, King of Shuobo, are his last move.

240
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,850
He wants to use the clan of Shuobo in his end game.

241
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,190
You wouldn't want to be his stepping stone before he falls, right?

242
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,100
I have evidence of the conspiracy between Gao Xian and Danchi.

243
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,090
King of Shuobo, are you interested in taking a look?

244
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,560
Think of how Danchi turned out.

245
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,910
But on the other hand,

246
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,710
if Danchi didn't bring trouble amongst themselves,

247
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,950
I wouldn't be here to give you this big gift.

248
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:41,900
Next, it all depends whether you, King of Shuobo, would appreciate my kindness.

249
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,380
The way you look when you play the zither reminds me of someone.

250
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,560
No wonder, the emperor treasures you.

251
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:44,790
Also, you have saved his life. It's only natural.

252
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:50,060
However, I know that you are a smart person.

253
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,700
You surely know to do things with propriety.

254
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,840
I understand. I will remember your words, Grand Empress Dowager.

255
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,270
Do you usually read books?

256
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:10,310
I do not read books very often.

257
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,200
I only read poems when I have nothing to do.

258
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,020
How about the "Lessons of a Woman," have you read that?

259
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,930
You haven't read it.

260
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:28,680
All right, bring it here.

261
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:38,100
This is a gift from me. Read it.

262
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,410
Every day, you will copy it three times.

263
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,050
This is both beneficial and helpful to you.

264
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,880
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

265
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,930
My Lady.

266
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,070
What's the matter?

267
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,980
Grand Empress Dowager went to Mingyue's place and left her a set of the "Lessons of a Woman."

268
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,960
She also told her to copy it three times a day.

269
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,420
Really?

270
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,790
Of course, it's real.

271
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,460
You always have great ideas.

272
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,870
This time that vixen can't live life as easily.

273
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,750
Only making her copy it three times?

274
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:32,430
The way I see it, three hundred times doesn't even sound like it's too much.

275
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,820
My Lady, just wait.

276
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,980
She is now being watched by Grand Empress Dowager.

277
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,480
We don't have to worry about not having something interesting to watch.

278
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,080
Grand Empress Dowager.

279
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,110
The palace will be quite lively these days.

280
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,750
Earlier, when Xiao Haizi was passing by the Imperial Food Service,

281
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,850
he saw Noble Consort Gao heading towards our place from afar.

282
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,260
What else could she be here for?

283
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,870
We cannot really blame her for coming here.

284
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,780
I heard that since Miss Mingyue from the brothel entered the palace,

285
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,240
His Imperial Majesty never visited anyone else's place.

286
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,170
Just say that I am resting.

287
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,900
You won't see her, Grand Empress Dowager?

288
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,890
I won't.

289
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,320
Everything's my fault.

290
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,870
It's me who killed everyone,

291
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,400
because I fell in love with Gu Xiaowu.

292
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,290
I knew early on that

293
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,180
he was not my Gu Xiaowu.

294
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,690
My Gu Xiaowu already died.

295
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,270
But why...

296
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,500
Why did I remember again?

297
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,980
Is God punishing me?

298
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:39,660
Punishing me, so I fell in love with the same ruthless person.

299
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,380
Punishing me because I killed so many innocent people by my side.

300
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:53,970
Punishing me to always be lucid and live in pain.

301
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,440
Punishing me...

302
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,130
Punishing me...

303
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,970
Crown Princess Consort, take a sip.

304
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,260
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

305
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,830
How many days has she been like this?

306
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,100
Ever since A'Du was brought back here, she has been like this.

307
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,950
Has she eaten food?

308
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,170
She hasn't even drunk a little water.

309
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,970
Take a rest.

310
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:44,900
Even without you, A'Du will not die.

311
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,270
But if you keep going on without eating, drinking, and resting,

312
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,460
maybe you won't be able to continue living.

313
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,850
Drink the porridge.

314
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,960
If you don't drink it,

315
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,270
then I will order my men to carry A'Du somewhere else.

316
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,730
You won't see her again.

317
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,040
Men!

318
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,180
Carry A'Du out.

319
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,980
Or she might transfer an illness to Crown Princess Consort.

320
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,400
Yes.

321
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,060
I finished drinking it. You can leave now.

322
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,440
If I find out again that you have not eaten any of your meals,

323
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,110
then I will order them to take A'Du away immediately.

324
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,640
Your Imperial Highness, a secret report from Lord Zhao from the border.

325
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,410
The reason you are here,

326
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,320
- I knew that already.
- Since you knew,

327
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,080
then may I ask you.

328
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,600
How did the Bingzhou case go?

329
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,280
It went very well.

330
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,030
About the evidence of Gao Yuming bribing the candidates' families to shut their mouths,

331
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,300
did you obtain it?

332
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,020
Yes, I did.

333
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,370
Then may I ask you.

334
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,570
Why didn't you impeach Prime Minister Gao in the imperial court?

335
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:32,770
Did you get scared at the last moment?

336
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,120
When I went to Bingzhou to work on that case, I thought it would be full of obstacles.

337
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,250
But who would have thought that everything went so smoothly?

338
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:47,330
Wherever I went, it's like someone already arranged it and was waiting for me to find out.

339
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,350
All of the spearheads are pointing towards Prime Minister Gao.

340
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,770
I don't know who would make such painstaking effort

341
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,300
to bring forward such a huge bloody storm.

342
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,060
This person's position cannot be lower than Prime Minister Gao's.

343
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,410
Hence, you're hesitating?

344
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,910
Because you don't want to become someone's chess piece,

345
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,810
and you're not willing to let other people make the utmost profit from it. Right?

346
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,510
Yes.

347
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,980
Lord Zong, do you know what you're doing makes no difference from Gao Yuming,

348
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,670
who only cares about his own personal gain

349
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,210
and disregards the country?

350
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,790
Xi Qingzhuo, please abandon your old-school temperament.

351
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,350
Think about the ending of the old grand preceptor!

352
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,000
Forget it!

353
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:42,950
Lord Zong, at this very moment,

354
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,860
you think you're not helping a tyrant to victimize his subjects.

355
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,910
Then, you can feel at ease as an onlooker?

356
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,240
No...

357
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,380
You are wrong!

358
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,100
You, I, and every single official

359
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,140
are the mortise and tenon of this imperial court.

360
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,530
It is because we strictly stick by our duty; hence, it is able to be stable.

361
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,920
If we waver, this huge building will then collapse.

362
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,860
No one can keep themselves out of this!

363
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:16,310
If you read all those books of good conduct and virtue for nothing,

364
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,020
then you can wait and see

365
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,070
how this imperial court will fall apart and collapse.

366
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,060
It will bury everyone, including me and you!

367
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,900
All right.

368
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,500
Please say no more, Lord Xi.

369
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,950
Your words have made me feel ashamed.

370
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,610
All right!

371
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:45,570
Since Lord Xi has already put your life and death aside, then I will accompany you!

372
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:51,790
Even if my life is at stake, I will investigate this case til the very end!

373
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,940
Lord Zong!

374
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,690
Lord Xi!

375
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,170
[Courthouse]

376
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,170
Father, it turns out that the one who led the mass suicide of the examiners

377
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:26,700
then was an old xiucai.
(T/N: "xiucai" is the term given for examiners who have passed initial local exams and qualified to take the imperial civil exam)

378
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,880
His hometown is Bingzhou, from the administrative division named Zong Huan.

379
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,700
Thirty years ago, Zong Huan's initial studies started with this person,

380
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,010
so he is considered as Zong Huan's benefactor.

381
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,930
It looks like the slight worrying I have been experiencing these days didn't come up for no reason.

382
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,230
Zong Huan.

383
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,580
What is going on in the palace?

384
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,510
I heard His Imperial Majesty was furious.

385
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,360
Did he see anyone today?

386
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,400
He didn't ask for Zong Huan, who wrote the memorial.

387
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,100
Neither did he see Xi Qingzhou. He just asked for the crown prince.

388
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,580
My Lady Noble Consort.

389
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,300
Greetings to Your Imperial Majesty.

390
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:45,010
Your Imperial Majesty, I especially asked the Imperial Buttery to make these desserts for you.

391
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,500
I originally wanted to make them myself,

392
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,680
but I am not in good shape.

393
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,090
I get uncomfortable if I tire myself out.

394
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:59,470
You can go back now. I still have to read over these memorials.

395
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,800
Your Imperial Majesty, are you still angry at Prime Minister Gao?

396
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,420
You should not interfere with political affairs.

397
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,920
The prime minister is my father.

398
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,030
I cannot see my father suffer and not do anything about it.

399
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,390
The prime minister has been by your side for so many years.

400
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,330
You know he is loyal.

401
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,900
You have not punished my father until now,

402
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,020
because you took his efforts into consideration.

403
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,790
You cannot bear to actually punish him, right?

404
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,430
Don't talk anymore. Go back.

405
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,100
Your Imperial Majesty.

406
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,300
The prime minister is the grandfather of the child I am bearing.

407
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,040
Enough!

408
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,320
No! Not enough!

409
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,470
Your Imperial Majesty, we are husband and wife.

410
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,610
Please show mercy even if you don't show love.

411
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:55,620
In working for the imperial court, even without merit, my father has exerted so much effort.

412
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:02,380
If you won't give any considerations for these, then, please,

413
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,640
grant death to me and my unborn child.

414
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,800
You're threatening me with the child in your belly now, is that it?

415
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,840
I do not dare.

416
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,410
Now, only Mingyue dares to use her unborn baby...

417
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,150
Impudence!

418
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,490
Your Imperial Majesty!

419
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:29,210
Do you know why the empress hasn't had any kids all these years?

420
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,780
Was it because she didn't want to?

421
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,270
It's me who didn't allow her to have any.

422
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:39,790
If you want the child in your belly to be able to continue living, know your place.
