1
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,680
You're now a part of the Union,
so do as I fucking tell you, okay?

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,348
Fucking answer me, okay?

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,725
-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

4
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,101
Hello, brother!

5
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,352
Hello, sir!

6
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,270
Hello, sir!

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,856
What the fuck is this? The mafia?

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,567
Don't talk to me, or I'll kill you.

9
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,945
People will report the noise,
you dumb fucks.

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,447
We're sorry, sir.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,369
Lower your fucking head.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:40,749
Stand up straight!

13
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:48,298
Hello.

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,966
-Hello.
-You're here.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,776
What the hell are you staring at?

16
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,861
Go inside.

17
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:35,804
Just a sec.

18
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,811
I'll only say this once.

19
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,647
Listen carefully.

20
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:52,529
I don't care what Park Hu-min
and all of you are up to.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,157
And I didn't need to come here.

22
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,289
But I came… just to make this clear.

23
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,422
If I see you
around Su-ho's hospital again…

24
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,678
I'll kill you all.

25
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,557
I will kill all of you.

26
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,163
You need to separate
the variables to solve it quickly.

27
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,917
A fixed range variable
is no different from a constant.

28
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,587
MATHEMATICS

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,426
Keep your word…

30
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,471
and no one will get hurt.

31
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,978
Stop hanging around Hu-min.

32
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,191
Fine.

33
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,152
I understand.

34
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,530
So keep your word too.

35
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:45,350
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

36
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,326
Hey.

37
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,168
Don't look at me like that,

38
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,838
or I'll gouge your eyes out.

39
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,149
Is that fun to read?

40
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,868
You just let him go?

41
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,083
Then why did you tell me to bring him?

42
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,842
Do I have to explain it?

43
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,644
I mean, fuck,
why are you obsessed with Eunjang?

44
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,149
It's not like they bring in much money.

45
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,653
You know you can't outmuscle Baku.

46
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,322
Right?

47
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,826
So I need to make him come to me.

48
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,708
Did our boys go to his dad's restaurant?

49
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,629
44, 45, 46,

50
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,631
LIFE'S TOUGH
BUT IT'S OKAY. I'M TOUGH TOO

51
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,548
…47, 48, 49,

52
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,469
50, 51, 52, 53, 54.

53
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,014
DAD

54
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,557
Five more!

55
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,519
50, 60, 70,

56
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,146
80, 90, 100!

57
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,736
Yeah, Dad?

58
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,488
Hey, Hu-min. It's Officer Han.

59
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,657
Your dad got into trouble again.

60
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,826
-Can you come talk to him?
-Get back here.

61
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,829
How the fuck should I know
if it was real or fake?

62
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,622
-Tell the truth!
-Hey, Mr. Park!

63
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,874
-Come with me, and we'll talk.
-Hey, assholes!

64
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,793
Come here and tell them!

65
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,919
-I'll kill you!
-Park!

66
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,838
-Keep those kids quiet.
-Go inside.

67
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,297
-Why?
-Dad, stop.

68
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,675
Come on. Please stop!

69
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,135
You punk.

70
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

71
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,389
Why did you apologize, punk?

72
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,224
I did nothing wrong! Why say sorry?

73
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,350
Damn, please!

74
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,936
Park. I understand.

75
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,439
So let's go and fill out a report first.

76
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,315
We have rules to follow.

77
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,694
He wasn't a minor! I even checked his ID!

78
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,903
His photo too! Damn it!

79
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,655
Yes, so let's talk at the station.

80
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,699
You sold alcohol to minors, didn't you?

81
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,200
Fuck this, seriously.

82
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,536
Fine, let's go.

83
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,246
Let's go.

84
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,415
Officer Kim, get the kids in the car too.

85
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,666
Hey! Get in the car!

86
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,668
Hey, get in. Quickly.

87
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,004
Hey, I'm going already. Damn.

88
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,759
Hey, Baek-jin asked me to tell you
that he misses you.

89
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,649
NA BAEK-JIN

90
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:15,786
Where are you?

91
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,955
Let's meet tomorrow.

92
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,500
I'll send the address.

93
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,849
Keep your word…

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,939
and no one will get hurt.

95
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,616
Yeah, lower your stance a bit.

96
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,953
Keep looking straight ahead. That's it.

97
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,498
That's right. It'll become muscle memory
if you do it about a hundred times.

98
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,457
Good!

99
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:02,792
That's it.

100
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,879
-Yeon Si-eun.
-Si-eun.

101
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,300
What brings you here?
Are you joining our team?

102
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,553
If you want to join,

103
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,846
you'll have to pass our rigorous tryouts.

104
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,139
I met Na Baek-jin.

105
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,850
The guy in the Union.

106
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,603
What?

107
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,651
Baek-jin, that fucking lunatic.

108
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,194
Hey, well,

109
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,613
did anything happen?

110
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,574
Nothing happened.

111
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,288
I don't care what you guys are doing
but leave me out of it.

112
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,332
Si-eun.

113
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:44,959
What's going on?

114
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,087
I don't have as much free time as you.

115
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,338
I have a lot to do.

116
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,299
You guys have fun.

117
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,051
What the hell is your problem?

118
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,887
We didn't ask you to join us.

119
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,347
That's right.

120
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,142
So let's go our separate ways.

121
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,022
Okay.

122
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,482
I get what you're saying.

123
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,654
Fine.

124
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,491
Let's ignore each other.

125
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,830
Good.

126
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,805
Si-eun!

127
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,691
Baku seemed like
he was doing that on purpose.

128
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,568
And you too.

129
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,367
I don't know what happened to you,

130
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,828
but I bet Baku didn't mean what he said.

131
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,331
Don't let it bother you.

132
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,834
Jun-tae.

133
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,169
Yes?

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,634
It's just…

135
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,223
I'm more comfortable alone.

136
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,700
Now, that's it for transformers,

137
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,786
which are a typical example
of mutual induction.

138
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,746
Let's take a look at another example.

139
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,475
Hang on.

140
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,061
Hey, Eunjang.

141
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,568
Where are your friends?

142
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,954
Hey, didn't Baek-jin tell us
to leave this punk alone?

143
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,372
He did?

144
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,875
Let's just go.

145
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,215
Hey, where's Seong-je?

146
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,509
No idea. He'll be back soon.

147
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,190
Jun-tae, where's Si-eun?

148
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,901
He left right after class.

149
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,235
He left?

150
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,073
Man, what the heck is wrong with him?

151
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,826
Did you talk to him?

152
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:07,953
No.

153
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:09,955
Well,

154
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,876
I'm not sure, but I kind of have an idea.

155
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,506
I mean, I don't think Si-eun meant
what he said either.

156
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,222
I'll go ahead. See you tomorrow.

157
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,765
Damn, man.

158
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,601
Tell me you aren't meeting Baek-jin.

159
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,895
Nothing like that, man.

160
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,064
Take care. See you later.

161
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,776
Then where are you going?

162
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,070
On a date. Someone from Buil Girls' High.

163
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,295
Let's go.

164
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,509
Call Seong-je.

165
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,309
Where could it be?

166
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,187
I dropped my toy around here somewhere.

167
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,072
It's been a while.

168
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,245
How's your knee?

169
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,044
Why did you come here?

170
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,880
Hey, I don't see the newbie.

171
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,089
Si-eun or whatever.

172
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,425
Playing with him would be more fun.

173
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,342
Is it fun

174
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,637
to be Na Baek-jin's minion?

175
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:51,849
It is fun.

176
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,894
I get to kill punks like you.

177
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,776
Are you fucking counting?
There are four of them.

178
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,322
You're my playmate.

179
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,867
What? Are you scared?

180
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,119
Go, Jun-tae.

181
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,914
What?

182
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,874
I said go, idiot!

183
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,339
You're so fucking cool.

184
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,674
-You son of a bitch.
-Hey!

185
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,762
-Hey, fuck you.
-Get back here, asshole!

186
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,681
You guys are fucking ridiculous.

187
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,523
This place is no good.

188
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,859
Let's go somewhere quiet.

189
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,865
Don't glare at me like that.

190
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,992
You fucking wimp.

191
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,455
You son of a bitch!

192
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:58,958
Hey!

193
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,085
Where are you going, asshole?

194
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,419
Hey!

195
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,549
You fucker! Get back here!

196
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,010
Hey, you bastard!

197
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,262
Man, that fucking asshole.

198
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:14,890
Hey!

199
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,481
-Go that way.
-Okay.

200
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,446
Fuck.

201
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,699
Hey, Seong-je.

202
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,576
You need me to find one more?

203
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,328
Yeon Si-eun?

204
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,873
Man, I just let him go earlier.

205
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,458
Yeah, got it.

206
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,220

SEO JUN-TAE
MISSED CALL

209
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,456
SEO JUN-TAE:
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY TO CRAM SCHOOL?

210
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,733
Hello?

211
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:49,902
Si-eun.

212
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,195
What's that message about?

213
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,991
I was just wondering
if you made it to cram school.

214
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,954
Why are you asking?

215
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,254
I just wanted to see if
you made it there safely.

216
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,965
That's why I called.

217
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,218
Yeah.

218
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,764
-Hey!
-Si-eun, don't worry about me. I'm fine.

219
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,557
-Go home after cram school.
-Hello?

220
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,059
Seo Jun-tae?

221
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,102
This asshole!

222
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,646
-You son of a bitch!
-Man, fuck you.

223
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,356
-Lift your head.
-Fucking bitch.

224
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,822
You wear this all the time.

225
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,658
It's my best outfit.
Now go get me some cigarettes.

226
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,826
Hey, let's split it.

227
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,868
Quit smoking.

228
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,370
Hey, give me a smoke.

229
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,371
I just quit.

230
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,039
We're not open yet.

231
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
Where's Baek-jin?

232
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,798
Baek-jin?

233
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,175
They're on first-name terms?

234
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,095
You must be fucking crazy.

235
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,346
-Seriously.
-Whatever.

236
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,598
Hey, isn't that guy Park Hu-min?

237
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,684
-Park Hu-min?
-Who?

238
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,271
-I've heard that name.
-Eunjang's top dog. Don't you know him?

239
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,273
-That's him?
-Keep playing cards.

240
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,941
He's acting so fucking tough.

241
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,235
Fuck!

242
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,118
Na Baek-jin.

243
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,412
Where is he?

244
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:32,421
It's been a while.

245
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,404
Park Hu-min.

246
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,366
I still think of you as a friend.

247
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,083
Joining the Union
is a good deal for you too.

248
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,544
After graduation,

249
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,089
it'll become a regular business.

250
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,759
It's all planned out.

251
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,270
You're actually a fucking dumbass.

252
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,320
Hey.

253
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,073
Fucking moron.

254
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,080
Do you still not know
why I don't do your thug stuff?

255
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,417
Or do you pretend not to know?

256
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,215
I just…

257
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,345
really fucking hate you.

258
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,693
I think you're the dumbass, not me.

259
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,366
What the fuck did you do?

260
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,829
How's Go Hyun-tak doing?

261
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,726
Hey.

262
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,398
Did Baek-jin say you can leave?

263
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,483
I doubt that.

264
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,153
I don't have time for this.

265
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,780
Let's make it short.

266
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,089
Son of a bitch!

267
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,687
Your punches are still as weak as ever.

268
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,776
You fucking…

269
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,293
Hey, we're not done yet.

270
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,921
Get up, you fucking idiot.

271
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,550
Fucking shit.

272
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,553
Fuck you.

273
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,471
Come on.

274
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,100
Fuck you!

275
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:19,981
Want some more?

276
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,358
Fuck! Kill him!

277
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,401
Shit!

278
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,862
Hey! Fuck you!

279
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,824
Fuck!

280
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,160
Hey, you son of a bitch!

281
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,333
Fuck you!

282
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,506
Fucking son of a bitch.

283
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,801
Can I leave now?

284
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,266
That's enough.

285
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,984
That's enough. He can leave.

286
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,114
Go see for yourself
to understand the situation.

287
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,159
How long can you hold out like this?

288
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,914
Hey.

289
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,294
You're not letting me go.

290
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,465
I'm leaving for your sake.

291
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,343
Everyone here almost died.

292
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,568
Fuck!

293
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,537
Hey, I heard Hyun-tak went
to fight Seong-je.

294
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,957
Fuck. Hyun-tak is dead.
Seong-je is a fucking psycho.

295
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,585
-Want to go watch? I got the address.
-Are you crazy?

296
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,503
Hey.

297
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,560
Stop it!

298
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,104
What the fuck are you doing?

299
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,023
Hey, isn't this guy fucking cute?

300
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,525
-Look at this guy.
-Don't do it!

301
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,360
-Fucking asshole.
-Stop it!

302
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,362
Stop it!

303
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,698
Man, fuck this.

304
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,250
Hey, you fucker!

305
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,807
Glasses.

306
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,977
Are you okay, Hyun-tak?

307
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,775
Now, time for a photo. Look over here.

308
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,947
One, two, three. For fuck's sake. Hey.

309
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,616
I said look here.

310
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,745
What's this? You sad?

311
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,290
Should I beat him some more?

312
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,334
Let's get this over with.

313
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,964
Now, smile big.
One, two, three. Say cheese!

314
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,357
Newbie!

315
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,530
I've missed you.

316
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,495
Today's been fun!

317
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,539
Is it my birthday or what?

318
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,833
Should I buy a lottery ticket too?

319
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,513
Whoa. You were going to stab me with this?

320
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,032
You're a fucking wimp.

321
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,327
This is no damn fun.

322
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,791
Fuck you.

323
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,923
Fuck you!

324
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:42,929
Let go!

325
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,247
That's it!

326
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,474
Fuck you!

327
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,310
Let me go, you fucker!

328
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,572
Fuck you, asshole!

329
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,392
You fucking moron. Fuck you.

330
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,770
Get up, you fucking bastard.

331
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,814
Fuck you.

332
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,081
So I have to

333
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,917
kill you to end this, don't I?

334
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,271
Hey, Si-eun! Are you okay?

335
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,230
Hey, Si-eun!

336
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,156
Su-ho.

337
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,869
