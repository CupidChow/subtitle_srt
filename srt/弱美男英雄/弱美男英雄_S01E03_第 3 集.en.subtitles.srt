1
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,586
Fucking bastard.

2
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,216
Who was it?

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,475
Hey.

4
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,272
I told you not to fuck around

5
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,733
when you're out working for me.

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,863
What the hell are you doing?

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,701
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,787
Hey.

9
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,999
Seok-dae's cousin

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,376
was beaten up by someone.

11
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:45,086
So we went to see him.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,547
So you went to see him and got beaten up?

13
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,300
It wasn't that bad--

14
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,560
Okay.

15
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,148
Payback will be ten times worse.

16
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,108
Right?

17
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,119
Let's make some money, yeah?

18
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,454
I'll help you out.

19
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:51,903
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

20
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,168
Watch how the master does it.

21
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,589
Take away ten.

22
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,136
Didn't we meet for the assignment?

23
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,474
Yeah, you're right.

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,185
Mr. Si-eun.

25
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,687
It's the weekend, right?

26
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,398
Sometimes you need to play
to get the blood flowing.

27
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,650
Then your brain will work better.

28
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,071
So you're not going to college?

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,531
So close!

30
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,409
Did you get shot in the head?

31
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,203
Why would I want more school?

32
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,288
It's your turn.

33
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,168
Move a bit faster.

34
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,669
Don't just sit there!

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,296
Seriously.

36
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,723
Law of reflection.

37
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,769
The angles of incidence
and reflection should be equal.

38
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,397
Angle of incidence, 35 degrees.
Margin of error, three degrees.

39
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,483
Success rate, 90%.

40
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,203
Let's go.

41
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,627
You can't go. It's best of three.

42
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,255
You need to raise your handicap this time.

43
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,302
The result will be the same.

44
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,762
Wow.

45
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,306
Is that so?

46
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,975
You think it'll be the same?

47
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,394
Loser buys everyone Chinese food.

48
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,397
Noodles, pork, stir-fried beef? Your call.

49
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,324
Damn!

50
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,455
You know I went easy on you?

51
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,457
Nope.

52
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,793
I'm so fucking miserable.

53
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,837
Whatever. Let's get some beer.

54
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:57,880
I have to go.

55
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,007
You two go.

56
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,760
Why? It's on me, so let's all go.

57
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,554
I'm behind my schedule because of you.

58
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay, fine.

59
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,266
Take care.

60
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,977
You got lucky today.

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,478
Next time, you're toast.

62
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
Where do we go to drink?

63
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,069
Don't worry about it. Just follow me.

64
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,007
Hey, what happened to your arm?

65
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,220
What do you think?

66
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,473
He got hurt because of you.

67
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,352
What?

68
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,063
Who are you?

69
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,524
It's not important.

70
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,402
Would you mind doing me a favor?

71
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,603
Fuck, why is that jerk here? I'm screwed.

72
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,816
Can I help you findâ€¦

73
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,860
That will be 13,000 won.

74
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,780
Did you pay? I didn't find anything.

75
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,657
Have a nice day.

76
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,618
I'm hungry. Let's go. Thank you!

77
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,001
No way! What's with this rain?

78
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,046
Whoa.

79
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,714
Why is it raining so much?

80
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,299
What? Hey!

81
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,347
I don't have an umbrella.

82
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,061
Walk me home.

83
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,604
Why should I?

84
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,940
Because you have an umbrella, and I don't.

85
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,650
-Do you like tteokbokki?
-No.

86
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,195
Well, you can like it from now on.
I know a good place around here.

87
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,533
It's really spicy!

88
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
Hey.

89
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,248
Can I go now?

90
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,541
Absolutely not.

91
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,253
-Why?
-I don't like eating by myself.

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,591
Why aren't you eating? Too spicy?

93
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,593
Why do you eat it?

94
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,137
I bet you have no friends.

95
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,145
Save my number.

96
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,022
What's your name?

97
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,774
Why?

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,737
ASSHOLE

99
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,030
You're fucking rude,

100
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,781
which is totally my type.

101
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,910
I like guys who are assholes.

102
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,206
Thanks!

103
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,004
See you next time.

104
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,756
Sorry about the other day.

105
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm on my way.

106
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,178
Got it. I'll hurry.

107
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,180
Yeah.

108
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,025
Where's Yeong-i?

109
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,235
She's on her way.

110
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,116
-Is Gil-su inside?
-Yeah.

111
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,203
Good job, man.

112
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,248
Some crazy bastard brought his mom's car.

113
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,334
-Fucking lunatic.
-So fucking stupid.

114
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,420
Fucking bastard.

115
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,465
I told you to pick up when I call.

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,842
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,802
Are you?

118
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,639
How do you plan to pay me back?

119
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,227
I'll talk to my mom.

120
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,565
You have three days.

121
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,984
If I don't get my money by then,

122
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,904
I'll fucking kill your mommy and daddy,

123
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,657
and I'll burn your fucking house down.

124
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,334
Is it okay?

125
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,877
Yes.

126
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,880
Good job!

127
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,301
Oh, that fucker.

128
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,096
Beat that fucker for half an hour
before letting him go.

129
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,724
Just stab him if you want.

130
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,664
Oh, what?

131
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,584
I'm first. Hey!

132
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,127
I'm taking it now. Here.

133
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:29,670
Su-ho, a car.

134
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,589
Oh yeah. Get in the car here!

135
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,257
Is that all you got?

136
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,384
Yeah, I'll take that.

137
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,345
-I'll take that.
-No, that's mine.

138
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,679
Yeon Si-eun.

139
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,853
Can we talk for a second?

140
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
There's nothing to talk about.

141
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,734
Hey, what's your problem this time?

142
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,865
It won't take long.

143
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,581
Please help me.

144
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,251
Just meet with my lawyer.

145
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,296
The fentanyl.

146
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,507
Tell them it wasn't mine.

147
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,552
You too, Beom-seok.

148
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,349
It's driving me crazy.

149
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,142
I mean the world to my mom.

150
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,605
Please help.

151
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,441
I could go to juvenile detention!

152
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,487
His fake tears are pathetic.

153
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,615
Si-eun.

154
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,868
Should we just give a statement?

155
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,162
It's no big deal.

156
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:18,821
Hey.

157
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,906
Why are we going down?

158
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,658
Oh, this way is faster.

159
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,078
If you lie, you're dead.

160
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
I'm not lying.

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
Hurry up.

162
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,587
What do you want to eat later?

163
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,046
I have to go study.

164
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,300
Damn! On your own?

165
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,594
Let's have black bean noodles later.

166
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,304
Or go to an Internet cafÃ©.

167
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,972
Don't you have to work tonight?

168
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,474
Do I have a shift today?

169
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,315
I don't think I'll make it.

170
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,656
I called it.

171
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,119
Gentlemen, nice to meet you.

172
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,723
Seok-dae, is this them?

173
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,059
Yes.

174
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,273
Now, as you know,

175
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,025
because of you gentlemen,

176
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,277
Seok-dae was badly hurt.

177
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,448
I mean, he's a poor kid with no insurance,

178
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,617
yet you beat him up.

179
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,244
What do you want?

180
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,497
You have three days.

181
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,292
Bring me 15 million won to settle this.

182
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,463
What's this bullshit?

183
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,090
What's that cast?

184
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,425
I never touched your arm.

185
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,221
You smashed his wrist just like this,

186
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,430
yet you forgot that.

187
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,390
Butâ€¦

188
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,476
do you have any proof?

189
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,235
These guys are fucking ridiculous!

190
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,570
Hey.

191
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,949
I kill people for money.

192
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,160
I maim people too.

193
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,746
You're proud of that at your age?

194
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
You fucker.

195
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,754
Is this a joke to you?

196
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,551
You have three days.

197
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,054
If you can't get the money by then,

198
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,016
you'll need to borrow it from me.

199
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,646
Rude bastard.

200
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,609
Hey, let's go.

201
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,424
Su-ho, are you okay?

202
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,553
-I'm not okay, fuck.
-One sec.

203
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,641
What do we do?

204
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,018
They don't scare me.

205
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,200
Here they come.

206
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,342
If you go, I'll go too.

207
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,927
I'll go over it again at home.

208
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,018
Is that them?

209
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,487
Hello?

210
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,448
Let's meet up.

211
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,308
That guy.

212
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,601
Who is he?

213
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:41,935
Who?

214
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,773
Oh.

215
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,192
Gil-su?

216
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,448
He just gives us work and a place to stay.

217
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,201
-What work?
-Just this and that.

218
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,912
Why do you want to know?

219
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,795
I shouldn't say this, butâ€¦

220
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,675
be careful with him. He's a total scumbag.

221
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,013
He wasn't lying about killing for money.

222
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,059
He's got connections to real gangsters.

223
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,522
He's not human. He's money-hungry trash.

224
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,524
So?

225
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,276
So give him the money.
Even if it's just half.

226
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,945
And if I don't?

227
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,906
Then what?

228
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,455
You're fucked.

229
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,127
You'll be fucked like us.

230
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,595
And if I do?

231
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,014
What?

232
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,102
Will it be over?

233
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,734
Are you okay?

234
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,716
Hey.

235
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,634
What is it?

236
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,344
What?

237
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,306
I'm hungry.

238
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,519
CHEMISTRY LAB

239
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,653
I'll take care of it today.

240
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,573
It's been three days.

241
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,080
Fifteen million won.

242
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,376
Let's pay him and end this.

243
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,712
What is this?

244
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,049
My parents gave it to me.

245
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,884
Are you kidding me?

246
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,762
Your parents gave you 15 million won?

247
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
Where's it from?

248
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,600
Does it matter?

249
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,685
Where is it from?

250
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,437
What is this?

251
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,442
I sold my dad's watch.

252
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,654
He was going to pass it down to me anyway.

253
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,572
This dude is nuts.

254
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,158
Why give him the money?

255
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,743
Just report him to the police.

256
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,415
Take it and get the watch back.

257
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,335
He said the police can't help us.

258
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Beom-seok.

259
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,965
Thank you.

260
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,719
I know what to do,
so don't worry about it.

261
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,429
What do you mean?

262
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,681
Just report it to the police.

263
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,891
Yeah, I will.

264
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,819
That bastard gets runaway kids
to work for him.

265
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,405
PROMISSORY NOTE

266
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,199
You know Free Money? It's all the rage.

267
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,161
What's that?

268
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,537
A gambling site.

269
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:14,333
New members get 50,000 won.
That's why it's called "Free Money."

270
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,211
It's run by Gil-su's overseas partners.

271
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,047
It's all rigged.

272
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,466
The first few rounds, you always win.

273
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,634
You'll earn tens of millions of won

274
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,970
because you win constantly.

275
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:32,100
But at some point, you lose everything.

276
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,020
It's totally rigged.

277
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,606
A moment ago, you had millions.

278
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,524
If it goes back to zero,

279
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,942
you'll lose your mind.

280
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,113
So you keep gambling to get it back.

281
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,785
How can they continue
if they lost all their money?

282
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,707
Because Gil-su has their information.

283
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,126
He offers them a private loan.

284
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:06,051
Since they're kids and can't pay him back,
they give him collateral.

285
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,429
A few days ago,
one kid even used his mom's car.

286
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,142
He uses that to extort money from parents.

287
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,648
He uses the runaway kids' bank accounts
for illegal loan transactions.

288
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,858
He makes them deal drugs.

289
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,569
That's how he gets them involved in crime,

290
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,904
so they can't escape.

291
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,742
I heard he has the ledger, contracts,
and drugs at their place.

292
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,120
We need to take the police there.

293
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,666
How do you know all of this?

294
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,335
Googling?

295
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,508
No, not really.

296
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,763
Now that Si-eun has a good plan,

297
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,474
should we eat before we make our move?

298
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,768
I'm so hungry I could die. Seriously.

299
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,611
Hey, wait.

300
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,575
What is it?

301
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,123
Let me go there before you guys.

302
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,208
What?

303
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,882
If he really has the ledger and drugs
in his office or whatever,

304
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,675
we should get the cops there.

305
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,428
Yeah, I'll call them now.

306
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:35,140
Not yet. The cops need to catch him there.
Photos won't help.

307
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,811
I'll go first and send you the address.

308
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,229
Drag the cops there.

309
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,273
I'll buy us some time.

310
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,358
You can't go there by yourself.

311
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,112
Don't you realize
I'm the boss at this school?

312
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,155
Don't you trust me?

313
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,699
It's fine!

314
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,242
I'm going.

315
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,921
Hey!

316
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,757
Did the three musketeers break up?

317
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,595
Do you need a whole gang to pick up money?

318
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,721
Pathetic assholes.

319
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,890
Stop talking shit.

320
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,266
Hand it over.

321
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,352
Before all that,

322
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,188
let's talk for a moment.

323
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,689
Shit.

324
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,026
No money, then?

325
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,986
Hey.

326
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,906
Don't worry about the money.

327
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,700
That's not it.

328
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,410
Gil-su.

329
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,829
I'm the boss at this school.

330
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,458
About your gambling siteâ€¦

331
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,920
With some tweaks, you'd make more money.

332
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,380
Wait.

333
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,342
How do you know about that?

334
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:56,638
Him.

335
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,432
His cousin is in my class.

336
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,352
He showed me the site once.

337
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,776
You give new users
50,000 won to play with.

338
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,990
But don't do that only once at the start.
Give it out three times max.

339
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,118
You could offer a referral reward too.

340
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,372
That could easily turn the school
into a gambling den.

341
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,542
You must have an office.

342
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,627
Let's have coffee at your place.

343
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,212
Yeah?

344
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,558
This guy has some ambition!

345
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,269
Okay. Get in.

346
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,562
Hey, you drive.

347
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,647
-Yes, sir.
-Sir?

348
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,402
Why don't we wait for the other two?

349
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,695
Just in case.

350
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,033
Sure. Go ahead.

351
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,285
Seong-chan, get in.

352
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,287
The newbie is with me.

353
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:34,986
What are you doing?

354
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,077
Wait a minute.

355
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,414
-Are they going to the office?
-Yeah.

356
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,125
Is he going alone? What about the cops?

357
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,711
We'll catch him there. What's the address?

358
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,422
17-1 Sanggye-ro, Nowon-gu, Seoul.

359
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,591
A house with a blue door.

360
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,260
17-1 SANGGYE, NOWON, SEOUL
HOUSE WITH BLUE DOOR

361
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,187
Over here. Taxi!

362
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,657
SI-EUN: IF THE ADDRESS IS RIGHT,
TEXT ANYTHING BACK

363
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,955
What are you doing?

364
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,792
If I'd given him that money,
it'd be over now.

365
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,752
Why did you let Su-ho go by himself?

366
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,962
You saw those guys.

367
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,798
What if something bad happens to Su-ho?

368
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,636
17-1 Sanggye-ro in Nowon, please.

369
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,526
Yeong-i.

370
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,653
What are you doing?

371
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,078
Trying to send Gil-su to jail. Why?

372
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,204
What?

373
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,708
He's gonna get the cops.

374
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,132
We can't keep living like this.

375
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,469
We'll really fuck up our lives.

376
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,055
You're not happy either, are you?

377
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,197
Wait here, okay?

378
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,114
Sure.

379
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,221
What a lovely house.

380
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,014
A blue door.

381
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,142
Is it cobalt blue?

382
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:14,521
Very pretty.

383
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,820
Let's go.

384
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,929
Have a seat.

385
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,267
This house is nice.

386
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,476
Very vintage.

387
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,228
Anything to drink?

388
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,231
Some water would be great. Thank you.

389
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,066
Water?

390
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,363
Give me your phone.

391
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,452
Why?

392
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,538
For a safe transaction!

393
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,498
This hereâ€¦

394
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,917
I need to see
if you're cooking something up.

395
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:22,797
Oh, but you see, I'm someone who takes
personal information very seriously.

396
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,551
We can't work like this.

397
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,014
Is that so?

398
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,894
Then I don't think this is gonna work out.

399
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,397
Give it here.

400
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,485
Don't you trick me, son of a bitch!

401
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,698
You fucking punk! You piece of shit!

402
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,744
Give me his phone.

403
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,544
SI-EUN: COMING WITH THE POLICE NOW

404
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,421
"Coming with the police"?

405
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,009
What a lovely house. A blue door.

406
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,638
Hey!

407
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,306
What's this?

408
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,517
I expected some backup,

409
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,853
but you called the fuzz, you fucker?

410
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,065
Hey!

411
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,775
Call that fucker Seok-dae.

412
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,611
Everyone, follow me.

413
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,704
Hey, did you come alone?

414
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,249
Yeah. The moneyâ€¦

415
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,837
I want to pay you.

416
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,090
Let my friend go, and it's yours.

417
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,384
Damn it! Are you fucking kidding?

418
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,635
Come here.

419
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,109
But this isn't in our jurisdiction.

420
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,910
Anyone here?

421
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,041
Is anyone home?

422
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,961
Hey, kid. Is this the place?

423
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,379
Yes?

424
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,890
This is a bit tricky.

425
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,353
We'll head back now.
Please come to the station later.

426
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,439
What?

427
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,734
We don't have a warrant.

428
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,862
There's nothing we can do
with just a few photos.

429
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:36,199
I'll pass them on to Violent Crimes.

430
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,659
Come and make a statement later.

431
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,037
Pick up if we call.

432
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,606
AHN SU-HO

433
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,287
There's a room for stashing stolen goods.

434
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,548
The ledger and drugs would be in a safe.

435
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,849
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

436
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,768
We are connecting youâ€¦

437
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,724
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL

438
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,226
ANY SIMILARITY TO REALITY IS COINCIDENTAL

439
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:59,063
