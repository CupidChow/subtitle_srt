1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:18,852
Are the rumors true?

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,520
What rumors?

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,815
That you, Su-ho, and Si-eun
caught some thugs.

4
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,066
The Free Money guys.

5
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,903
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:31,156
Whoa, that's lit.

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,491
My friend lost a lot on that site.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,493
What happened? Tell us everything.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,453
Hurry. Tell us!

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,496
-Add me on Instagram!
-I'm dying to know!

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,384
Did you get home safely that day?

12
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,137
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,181
You?

14
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,058
I got home safely too.

15
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,731
So freaking cool.

16
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:17,827
Let's sit here.

17
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,304
You can eat all that?

18
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,597
I'm gonna get some snacks too.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,599
-Right, Oh Beom?
-Yeah.

20
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,768
-I'll pay, so let's all go.
-You always pay.

21
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,853
Everything is on me today!

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,772
Whatever you want, it's yours.

23
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,775
Are you free this weekend?

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,319
I found a good place to eat. Let's try it.

25
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,946
I'm down for good restaurants.

26
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,031
Let's go.

27
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
You're talking about food while eating?

28
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,126
Well, don't you talk about life
while living?

29
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,175
Did Yeong-i find a job?

30
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,010
She has an interview.

31
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,055
They need someone, so it works out.

32
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,432
Who's Yeong-i?

33
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,017
You know, the girl.

34
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,436
The one who smashed that thug's head.

35
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,981
Oh.

36
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,108
Did you know her from before?

37
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,025
No.

38
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,698
She's staying at Su-ho's.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,491
Should we invite her this weekend?

40
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,205
That's fine. I don't mind.

41
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:23,161
AHN SU-HO

42
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:28,958
AHN SU-HO
FOLLOWING

43
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,635
YEONG-I

44
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:48,895
CHILLING AT HAN RIVER

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,486
DINNER WITH SU-HO'S GRANDMA

46
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,285
SI-EUN SURPRISED US WITH TASTY HAMBURGERS!

47
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,728
How's your dad?

48
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,567
He's busy these days
'cause it's the season.

49
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,656
What are your next steps?

50
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,494
I'm not sure.

51
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,289
It's okay. Take your time to decide.

52
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,916
I'm not worried about you.

53
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,168
You're good at everything.

54
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,215
I'm bad at many things.

55
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,309
Never mind.

56
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,442
Are you done eating?

57
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,902
Let's have coffee to go. I have a meeting.

58
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,325
Yes?

59
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,201
I'm going now.

60
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,204
What should we do for your birthday?

61
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,622
What should we do?

62
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,708
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,251
Let's just have a nice meal.

64
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
We've got to do something.

65
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,131
Something fucking fun!

66
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,633
There's no need, busybody.

67
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,260
Is it your birthday?

68
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,596
Saturday two weeks from now.

69
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,806
Maybe we can rent a party room.

70
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
Yeong-i.

71
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,187
Aren't you saving money?
Weren't you looking for a room to rent?

72
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,153
The menu's big! What should I get?

73
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,323
What are you gonna have?

74
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,034
Iced Americano for me.

75
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,578
I'll have an iced Vienna coffee.

76
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,540
Let's grab a table.

77
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,001
This spot is good.

78
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,089
Sit here.

79
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,342
Would you like to order?

80
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,904
Hey, Si-eun!

81
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,325
Hurry up and sit down!

82
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,036
What's this? Why are you dressed up?

83
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,541
-Did you think I'd like it? Clever boy.
-Where were you?

84
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,628
An appointment.

85
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,839
What kind of appointment?

86
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,925
He's so fucking secretive.

87
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,969
I know where he's been.

88
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,389
Stop tracking me.

89
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,558
No! I'll track you all the way home.

90
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,892
Yeah, track him.

91
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,477
You know WithMap?

92
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,231
Oh Beom, what's up?

93
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:48,926
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

94
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,220
Do you want a drink?

95
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,222
Do you want a drink?

96
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,015
I can come with you.

97
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,350
It's okay. I'll go.

98
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,214
Shit.

99
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,300
What? It's Oh Beom-seok!

100
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,884
Beom-seok! Hey!

101
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,178
Why is Beom-seok here?

102
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,556
-Really!
-That's ridiculous. Don't lie.

103
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,349
-I really saw him.
-Beom-seok!

104
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,394
-Is he ignoring us?
-Where are you, Beom-seok?

105
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,437
Can Beom-seok sing?

106
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
-Beom-seok!
-Hey, call him.

107
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,340
Yeah, we're at karaoke.

108
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,759
What's the room number?

109
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,093
I don't know.

110
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,097
Your friends keep calling!

111
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,102
What are you doing, crazy bitch?

112
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,521
Why the fuck did you answer my phone?

113
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,108
Hey, what's going on?

114
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,402
What? You gonna hit me?

115
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,821
Fuck. Seriously?

116
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,990
Hey, that's enough.

117
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,283
What's this all about?

118
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,912
Beom-seok.

119
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,874
I said that's enough.

120
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,716
Have you gone fucking nuts, asshole?

121
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,760
Move.

122
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,679
Hey!

123
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,932
I'll go after her.

124
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,269
Where are you going?

125
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,817
Are you okay?

126
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,531
Yeah.

127
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,241
I'm okay.

128
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,119
Hey, Beom-seok!

129
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,453
I told you I saw him!

130
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,205
Our little Beom-seok!

131
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,916
How are things?

132
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,336
It's been ages.

133
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,255
We missed you.

134
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,923
Seriously!

135
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,426
What's this?

136
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,886
We're his friends.

137
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,307
We were talking.

138
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,061
We wanted a word, as it's been so long.

139
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,481
Then come back later.

140
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,780
My bad.

141
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,782
See you soon.

142
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,908
We'll call you.

143
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,619
Make sure you answer.

144
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,497
Let's go.

145
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,498
See you!

146
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834
Still a loser.

147
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:36,797
What was that?

148
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
Those kids.

149
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,054
Oh.

150
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,891
It's nothing.

151
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,689
Come on.

152
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,442
Man, seriously.

153
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,323
-He's so good with the tongue.
-He sounds like a dumbass.

154
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,785
-You can do this all day.
-Do that every single day.

155
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,453
Hey.

156
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,542
Hey!

157
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,340
Be quiet.

158
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,846
I said shut the hell up.

159
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
Did you laugh at me?

160
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,399
No, I didn't.

161
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,528
You laughed at me, didn't you?

162
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,446
Do you want to die, cocksucker?

163
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,032
Beom-seok.

164
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:46,951
What's going on?

165
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,414
This bastard's acting cocky
because of his friends.

166
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,332
What?

167
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,460
Hey, move.

168
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,838
What's this? What's going on?

169
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,631
I don't know. He just flipped out.

170
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,383
-Fucking asshole!
-Enough.

171
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,009
Hey, that's enough.

172
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,761
What are you looking at, fucker?

173
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,013
Why are you acting so tough? It's cute.

174
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,849
Si-eun, let's get some snacks.

175
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,436
Stop putting your arm around me.

176
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,481
What?

177
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,951
What's wrong with him?

178
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:55,686
FUCKER 3

179
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,687
15 MISSED CALLS

180
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,105
16 MISSED CALLS

181
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,775
FUCKER 4

182
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,664
17 MISSED CALLS

183
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
How was it?

184
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,536
Isn't it great to work up a sweat
in the morning?

185
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,959
Were you able to speak to Oh Beom?

186
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,338
No.

187
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,882
What's going on there?

188
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
He won't answer.

189
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:09,551
Later on,

190
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,012
we could stop by his place.

191
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,431
Let's do that.

192
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay, stand up!

193
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,814
You said we were only running.
There's more?

194
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,273
I said I'd train you.

195
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
Just the basics.

196
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,781
Feet shoulder width apart.

197
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,367
Feet turned out diagonally.

198
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,452
I don't need this.

199
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,079
You must be tired. Go rest.

200
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,665
Don't worry. I'm not tired. Go ahead.

201
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,046
Always keep your chin tucked.

202
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,590
Arms like this.

203
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,052
Your arms must always protect your chin.

204
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,221
Remember. Your chin.

205
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:55,973
There we go.

206
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,934
Let's say you're facing some punk.

207
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,770
They're trying
to beat the hell out of you.

208
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,898
If that happens,
don't look them in the eyes.

209
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,233
Watch the shoulders.

210
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,861
Now watch.

211
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,407
Watch this shoulder.

212
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,577
When the shoulder is coming at you,

213
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,454
bend at a 90-degree angle.

214
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,291
Now grab their knees and push them down.

215
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,168
One, two, three. Bam.

216
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,504
This is a takedown.

217
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,091
And then you just… you fucking just…

218
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,137
Don't hit them. Run.

219
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,389
Don't look back.

220
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,727
Get out while they're down.

221
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,772
Don't fight and get hurt.

222
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,610
You got it?

223
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,828
Here, right?

224
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,872
Fucking fancy place.

225
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,796
What are you doing here?

226
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,926
Why is your phone always off?

227
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,888
I didn't realize. Come in.

228
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,892
Why did you skip school?

229
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,562
Fucking fancy place.

230
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,815
I'm not feeling well.

231
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
-Wear those.
-Wow.

232
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,361
You're skinny because you live here.

233
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,321
You get a workout from going room to room.

234
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,657
Why is it so big?

235
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,077
Is this a money tree or something?

236
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,664
The tree that's meant to make people rich?

237
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,457
This is crazy.

238
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,669
My whole place could fit in this room.

239
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,295
Are you very sick?

240
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,006
Oh?

241
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,092
No, just a little.

242
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,928
Hey, your mother is really pretty.

243
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,680
Your family looks so happy.

244
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,349
Everyone looks alike.

245
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,351
That's not my family.

246
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,483
My father openly adopted me
when he entered politics.

247
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,277
For his public image.

248
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,034
Would you like a drink?

249
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,545
Is something wrong?

250
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,632
-No, nothing.
-Hey.

251
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,342
What is it?

252
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,386
Tell me what's up.

253
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:42,931
Is it because of…

254
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,394
the kids we saw the other day…

255
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,522
at karaoke?

256
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,440
Karaoke?

257
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,025
What do you mean?

258
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,917
Hey, move it.

259
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,919
Stand at ease.

260
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,380
I said at ease, you fucking mongrel.

261
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,423
Hurry up!

262
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,384
-Did you forget how?
-I said stand up!

263
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,220
-Here it comes
-Go at full power.

264
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,888
Show him!

265
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,889
Nice!

266
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,518
-Are you crying?
-Fucking pleb.

267
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,937
Fuck, you're not hurt.

268
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,854
Beom-seok.

269
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,190
Go snitch to Daddy again.

270
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey, let's go.

271
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,568
Fuck, hitting him is no fun.

272
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,779
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

273
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,494
At my previous school,

274
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,330
I was bullied.

275
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,999
Because of them,

276
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,002
I was hospitalized,

277
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,838
and I had to change schools.

278
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,343
Since seeing them at karaoke,

279
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,053
they keep calling me,

280
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,097
asking me to come out.

281
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,475
Oh fuck.

282
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,687
Why did those fuckers pick you?

283
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,148
What was it?

284
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,818
That's just the way it is.

285
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,195
They form a bond by picking on other kids.

286
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,322
It raises their own status.

287
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,742
I did nothing wrong. I was just there.

288
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,996
It's okay, Beom-seok.

289
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,834
It's not your fault.

290
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,592
Call those fucks.

291
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,806
What?

292
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,935
I'll get you an apology.

293
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,354
Call them.

294
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,947
Hey, that's awful. It's just shit.

295
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,952
DOG BEOM-SEOK

296
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,245
Hey!

297
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,706
Why did you stop it?

298
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,125
Fucking Beom-seok is calling!

299
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,043
Really?

300
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,503
-Shut up a minute.
-Really?

301
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,216
Beom-seok, where are you?

302
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,434
These guys are always singing.
Don't they study?

303
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,561
Look who's talking.

304
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,736
Don't sweat it. I'm with you.

305
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,812
Beom-sucks!

306
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,231
-Hey, Oh Beom.
-Beom-seok!

307
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,816
Did you bring friends?

308
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,735
Fuck, it reeks of cigarettes.

309
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,781
What's this?

310
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,285
Apologize.

311
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,125
I said apologize.

312
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,212
Fucking crazy.

313
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,171
Look at him!

314
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,801
Apologize for what?

315
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,553
For what you did to me.

316
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,930
Hey, Beom-seok.

317
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,182
You apologize

318
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,144
only when you do something wrong.

319
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,896
We're friends.

320
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,398
Right?

321
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,860
We were just playing around.

322
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,654
So what's this?

323
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,577
Hey.

324
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,122
-Apologize properly.
-What?

325
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,915
How many times do we need to say it?

326
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,126
Apologize, or you'll die.

327
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,627
Yeah? Don't mess around.

328
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,716
Beom-seok.

329
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,847
What are you trying to do, fucker?

330
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,478
Do you wanna be friends like before?

331
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,105
Meet up every day?

332
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,862
Are you ignoring me right now?

333
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,240
-Wait!
-Apologize properly.

334
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,909
-Okay, I got it!
-Say it.

335
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,119
I got it. I said I got it, fuck.

336
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,296
Go on. Apologize.

337
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,054
Sorry.

338
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,809
I'm really sorry.

339
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,313
If you're sorry…

340
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,733
let me hit you once.

341
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,069
What?

342
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,198
You're not really sorry,
so let me hit you.

343
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:35,825
Is that so?

344
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,245
One hit. Take it like a man.

345
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:46,086
I said I am really, sincerely
so fucking sorry, Beom-seok.

346
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,426
Crazy bastard!

347
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,723
Are you okay?

348
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,989
Hey!

349
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,742
Hey!

350
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,036
That's enough!

351
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,330
Don't cross the line!

352
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,210
Hey!

353
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:28,962
Don't go too far.

354
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,922
I said let go of me, fucker!

355
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,383
Hey, you fucker!

356
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,970
Let go, you bastard!

357
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,609
You guys.

358
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,820
Don't call Beom-seok again.

359
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,454
You're smothering me.

360
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,789
Okay, man. I'm sorry.

361
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,249
Fuck.

362
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,793
I told you to stop doing that!

363
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,129
Fuck, why do you always drag me around?

364
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,047
What?

365
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,382
Why are you always bossing me around?

366
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,469
Do I have to fucking stop
just because you said so?

367
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:21,514
Do you know what those fuckers did to me?
You have no idea.

368
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,476
When did I boss you around?

369
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,686
You did fucking boss me around!

370
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,521
Do I have to stop because you said so?

371
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,065
Fuck, am I your lackey?

372
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:30,982
Hey.

373
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,694
Did I do something wrong?

374
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,781
I took off from work to help you.

375
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:38,907
So what the fuck?

376
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,909
Hey, that's enough.

377
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,535
You helped me?

378
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,996
What, should I be grateful?

379
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,873
Fuck, should I pay your wages?

380
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,168
Fucking bastard.

381
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,420
Try saying that again.

382
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,257
Watch what you fucking say.

383
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey, let go of him and just talk.

384
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,222
Okay?

385
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,899
Fuck.

386
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,404
Hey, Beom-seok!

387
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,240
Crazy bastard.

388
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,452
I'll go after him.

389
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,007
Beom-seok.

390
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:43,972
What's this all about?

391
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,893
Are you okay?

392
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,024
Yeah, I'm fine.

393
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,987
I'm gonna go.

394
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,138
The number you are calling
cannot be reached…

395
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,598
Motherfucker!

396
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,072
Oh Beom-seok?

397
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,867
What? No glasses today?

398
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,496
Did you come to hang out?

399
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,580
Hey, Beom-seok!

400
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,762
Come with us.

401
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,889
Hey.

402
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
What's this? Mungang High?

403
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,227
Little rich boys?

404
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,940
I said come on.

405
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,608
You fucker.

406
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,654
This Mungang cocksucker
wants to mess with Byuksan?

407
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,280
You want to die?

408
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,700
Fuck, I could use some money.

409
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,410
You're rich, right?

410
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,831
Hey, don't be scared.

411
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,582
Let's have a little chat.

412
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,419
Raise your head, fuck.

413
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,171
Properly, asshole.

414
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,009
-Raise it. You too.
-Stay close.

415
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,053
Why did you fuck with Beom-seok?

416
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,223
Fuck.

417
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,432
Take out your phone.

418
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,769
667502.

419
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,313
1184117.

420
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,357
Lee Jeong-chan.

421
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,777
How much is it?

422
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,029
What the hell?

423
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,490
-They don't have much.
-See you later, fucker.

424
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,705
You fucker, what are you glaring at?

425
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,123
Got something to say?

426
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:17,166
What is it, you piece of shit?

427
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,336
Son of a bitch, fuck you!

428
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,046
He's fucking lost it.

429
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,136
If you're gonna stamp on him, do it right!

430
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,597
Stamp more! That's right!

431
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,140
-Fuck you!
-Do it right!

432
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,767
What did you want to say, fucker?

433
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,231
Shit!

434
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,401
Watch what you fucking say!

435
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,124
Finished? Let's go for a drink.

436
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,045
Yeah.

437
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,644
That girl looked like Su-jin!

438
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,105
-Let's pick up some girls!
-We need a bottle of vodka, then.

439
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,774
-How much do you have?
-Nothing.

440
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,233
What about our loot?

441
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,444
That just covers
what we already have, dumbass.

442
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,405
Forget it! There are six of us,
so it's hard to get girls anyway.

443
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,534
Hey, I'm buying, so get it all.

444
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,869
What's that?

445
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,537
Hey, what's that?

446
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,914
Beom-seok!

447
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,502
-Oh Beom-seok!
-Order something nice.

448
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,295
-Oh Beom-seok!
-Wait a second!

449
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,339
-Get in the shot!
-Hold up the money!

450
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,799
Move in. Hold up the money.

451
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,634
One, two, three!

452
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,178
Cheers!

453
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,183
Hurry up and find some hot girls!

454
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:58,977
It's 500,000 won!

455
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,521
-How's the drink?
-It's good.

456
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,443
Hey, Beom-seok. What's your Instagram?

457
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,362
I'll tag you.

458
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,078
-Follow me, and I'll follow you back.
-Okay.

459
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,664
Done!

460
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,919
-Hey, right there.
-Where?

461
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,215
-Let's go together.
-Go with him!

462
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,676
-I can't do this.
-Fuck, I'll get the girls.

463
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,553
You must succeed!

464
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,806
Hey, they're on it.

465
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,726
-Let's toast!
-Cheers!

466
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,188
Hey, don't drink it all at once!

467
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,485
-You're going to get wasted.
-It's strong.

468
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,907
-Beom-seok!
-Let's get him a girl tonight.

469
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,951
Let's find Beom-seok's type.

470
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,247
She's not hot enough.

471
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,623
Fuck, he's picky.

472
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,751
-You're the weird one.
-Just a sec.

473
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,711
What about that girl?

474
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,924
AHN SU-HO

475
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,468
Hey, you!

476
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,886
Hey, where?

477
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,679
-Thank you!
-Yeah, thanks.

478
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,222
UNFOLLOW

479
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,640
-Where?
-Look!

480
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,268
They're back.

481
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,146
Salute, you loser!

482
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,314
Go kill yourself!

483
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,440
For real?

484
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,318
No. Up close, she wasn't my type at all.

485
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,694
So that's why you did this shit?

486
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,197
-Because she's fucking ugly!
-Whatever.

487
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,075
You didn't even say a word!

488
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,910
Just sit down or go home!

489
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,996
-Pour me another.
-Give me more.

490
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,041
-Hey, I'm a bit drunk.
-No way.

491
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,959
-You can't be drunk.
-I am.

492
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,338
Where's he going?

493
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,964
Where are you going?

494
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,654
Are you having fun?

495
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,701
Drink with us.

496
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,961
-What's he doing?
-Really?

497
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,406
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
