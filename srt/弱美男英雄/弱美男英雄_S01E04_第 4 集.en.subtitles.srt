1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:03,253
Hey, where's the other one?

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,463
Is that fucker coming with the fuzz?

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:10,510
You fucking teenage prick!

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,596
Hey!

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,889
Load it quickly.

6
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,434
-Did you get the documents?
-I got it all.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,393
Load it up!

8
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:34,451
Hey, hurry up!

9
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,831
Come with me! Quick!

10
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,879
Let's go!

11
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,438
KIM GIL-SU

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,318
Hey. My battery is low.

13
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,111
Fuck you.

14
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,197
Where are you?

15
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,036
It's all over, so come to Mangu-dong.

16
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,829
Bring that bitch Yeong-i.

17
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,211
Seong-chan is here.

18
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,339
Come quickly

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,842
before I sell this boy off to someone.

20
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,346
Understood.

21
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,354
What is it? What about Seong-chan?

22
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,612
I'll be back in a bit. Stay here.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,740
Find a room and lie low.

24
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,909
Where are you going?

25
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,579
Don't follow me.

26
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,499
Hey!

27
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,633
ASSHOLE

28
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,182
What's going on?

29
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,059
I'm at the address.

30
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,186
There's no one here.

31
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,902
Those bastards took Su-ho, didn't they?

32
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,197
Add me on WithMap.

33
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,532
What?

34
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,868
Don't you know WithMap?

35
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,788
Download it. Search for WithMap.

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,791
Use it to track my location.

37
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,588
What? Where are you going?

38
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,922
I don't know yet.

39
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,092
Bring the cops with you,

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,678
or we'll die for real.

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:01,598
Got it.

42
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:08,313
Seok-dae!

43
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,150
Take me! Don't go alone.

44
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,320
Let's go together.

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,292
It's fine!

46
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm going.

47
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,255
Why did you let Su-ho go by himself?
What if something bad happens to Su-ho?

48
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,224
YEONG-I
COME TO MANGU-DONG FIRST

49
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,017
YOUR FRIENDS ARE THERE

50
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:15,546
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

51
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,201
I'm tired of it.

52
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,995
Stop following me.

53
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,538
Just shut up!

54
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,687
Su-ho.

55
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,237
Are you okay?

56
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,783
Hey.

57
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,410
How come you're here?

58
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,287
I thought something happened to you.

59
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,164
I was worried.

60
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,084
I came to hand over the money.

61
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,668
So now I'm here.

62
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,800
So heartwarming! Like soup for the soul.

63
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,719
-Hey.
-Actually, I want some soup.

64
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,971
Shut the fuck up, dickheads.

65
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,933
Don't be so harsh.

66
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm miserable enough
being tied up like this.

67
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,188
And quit smoking, asshole. Be healthy.

68
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,737
ASSHOLE

69
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,655
Yeong-i.

70
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,032
What?

71
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,828
Don't do anything.

72
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,913
Don't act up.

73
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,334
You always say that.

74
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,211
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,798
It's my fault we got involved with Gil-su.

76
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,801
This only happened because of me.

77
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,847
Hey!

78
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,684
Do you have a crush on me?

79
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,313
What the hell?

80
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,135
Hello?

81
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,556
I'm the one who called about Mangu-dong.
Are you on your way?

82
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,944
Come here.

83
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,331
Hey, Seok-dae.

84
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,084
Did I do something to upset you?

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,756
I gave you food and shelter.

86
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,175
I even paid you quite well.

87
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,260
Why?

88
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,763
Did you go soft now that you have a gang?

89
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,515
Just beat me up.

90
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,811
I'm just curious.

91
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,067
Just punch me.

92
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,281
All right.

93
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,409
Then I'll hit you, fucker!

94
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
Hey!

95
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:19,058
-Please stop this.
-Was it you, bitch?

96
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,018
You screwed it up.

97
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,356
Hey, get rid of this fucking bitch.

98
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,401
Let go!

99
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,571
Let go of me, you fuckers!

100
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,702
Hey, Seong-chan.

101
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,706
Seong-chan.

102
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,547
You're 14 this year, right?

103
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,757
Yes.

104
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,223
You stabbed those punks.

105
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,691
Don't be scared.

106
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,444
Minors don't go to prison.

107
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,821
It's troubling.

108
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,583
JUNGNANG-GU
YEONG-I

109
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,964
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

110
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,591
Looks like

111
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,927
you areâ€¦ it.

112
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,016
Ding, dong, dang.

113
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,934
Dong.

114
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Hey.

115
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,192
We can talk this through.

116
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,736
Shut the fuck up.

117
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,905
This might sting a little.

118
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,822
Okay?

119
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,913
Fuck.

120
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,249
That's enough, you fucking piece of trash.

121
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,880
Seok-dae!

122
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,717
Don't move, assholes,
or I'll kill you all.

123
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,517
Just you and me, shithead.

124
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,936
If you lose, then fuck off.

125
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,689
Do I look like a fucking pushover?

126
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,860
Son of a bitch!

127
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,864
Fucker!

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,953
Let go, asshole!

129
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,455
Come here. Fuck!

130
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,749
Fucking bastard.

131
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,877
I fed you and gave you a place to stay.

132
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,724
Stop before I beat the shit out of you,
motherfucker.

133
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,451
Hey, Seok-dae.

134
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,036
It's fucking fun, right?

135
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,789
Wanna know why you're such a loser?

136
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,586
You have gotten too damn soft,
you fucking idiot--

137
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,135
-Fucking bitch!
-What the fuck, bitch?

138
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,471
Give me a break, you fuckers!

139
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,430
You bitch--

140
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,182
Don't fucking move!

141
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,770
Help Seok-dae.

142
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,439
Hey, don't move!

143
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,150
-Bitch.
-Fuck! I said don't move!

144
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,238
Wait a minute.

145
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,950
Hey, wait. I'm bleeding.

146
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,328
Fucking bitch!

147
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,371
You bitch!

148
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,916
Die, you bitch.

149
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,838
Seok-dae shouldn't have met you, bitch!

150
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,256
Die!

151
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,182
Boss!

152
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,741
Fuck.

153
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,369
I thought you were a fucking coward.

154
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,539
But you've got some balls, haven't you?

155
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,167
It's over. The cops are coming.

156
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,461
They'll search your car.

157
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,630
Fuck!

158
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,048
Hey, get going.

159
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,220
Are you okay?

160
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,767
Si-eun, what happened?

161
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,769
Sorry I'm late.

162
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,731
Hey, untie us. We almost died.

163
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,862
Gently. My arms hurt.

164
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,029
Let's go. Quickly.

165
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,747
I'm never going to a theme park again.

166
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,210
They're back?

167
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,670
Oh fuck.

168
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:42,965
Hey!

169
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,051
You're so fucking clever.

170
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,053
You fuckers.

171
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,055
You pair made a fool of me!

172
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,515
Fuck.

173
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,726
Grab these fuckers.

174
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,102
Get them!

175
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,770
You fooled me too.

176
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,080
Fuck.

177
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,380
Yeong-i. Let's go.

178
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,257
We need to go now.

179
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,391
The police are here!

180
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,393
-What are you doing?
-Why?

181
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:37,436
-Quickly, go!
-Why?

182
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,354
You kids!

183
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,613
Fucker! You son of a bitch!

184
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,114
Fuckhead!

185
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,618
-Out of the way.
-Fuck!

186
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,167
Did you think

187
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,878
I wouldn't use a knife on a brat?

188
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,255
This is why

189
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,593
you should have just given me the money
and then fucked off.

190
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,887
Isn't that right?

191
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,558
Hands up!

192
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,851
Don't move!

193
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,522
220, this is 43.

194
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,023
Regarding report 2917â€¦

195
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,692
Fuck, I'll get you next time.

196
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,068
I'll kill all of you.

197
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,778
220, this is 43.

198
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,113
About 2917â€¦ Freeze!

199
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,364
What?

200
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,991
It's a misunderstanding.

201
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,117
I have live rounds.

202
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,828
Is that so? I get it.

203
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,622
-You know how it is.
-Yes.

204
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,667
Didn't we play soccer together? Left!

205
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,672
Hey!

206
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,298
Don't move.

207
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,678
Hey!

208
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,179
Hey, Si-eun!

209
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,806
Where are you going?

210
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,383
You scared me.

211
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,013
Fuck, it's this bastard again.

212
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,475
Hey, why are you following me, shithead?

213
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,402
Fucking moron.

214
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,534
You're so fucking annoying.

215
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,340
How should I stab you?

216
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,388
Hey!

217
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,773
There's no other way.

218
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:29,691
You need a good beating.

219
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,445
Why do you keep fucking with me
in pairs today?

220
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,656
Fucking bastards.

221
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,492
Come on.

222
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,082
Nice, fucker.

223
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,542
Well, you're slow.

224
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,146
-Asshole.
-Asshole.

225
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,121
Hey!

226
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,942
Hey!

227
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,611
Are you out of your mind?

228
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,448
Why did you go after him alone?

229
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,701
You came, didn't you?

230
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,205
That's seriously reckless.

231
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,415
You're a total lunatic.

232
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,125
You know that?

233
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,880
Look who's talking.

234
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,426
You always have to have the last word.

235
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,136
If I were you,

236
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,347
I'd just concede.

237
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,515
Fucking lunatic.

238
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
Come here!

239
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,251
What are you doing?

240
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,002
Hey, what are you doing?

241
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,046
You go first.

242
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,923
Don't fuck around. Come out!

243
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,716
Fuck. Just listen to me!

244
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,095
Go!

245
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,805
It's not your fault.

246
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,268
-Yeong-i, let's go.
-Hey!

247
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,604
-Hurry!
-Hey! Fuck!

248
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,815
You're so annoying!

249
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,108
Hey! Jeon Seok-dae!

250
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:18,694
Kid.

251
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,404
Put your hands up.

252
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:22,781
Hands up.

253
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,790
I told you, didn't I? Fuck!

254
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,417
-It's ridiculous!
-Quiet!

255
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,211
What are you fucking doing?

256
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,848
Hey, fucker.

257
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,352
I'll see you when I get out, yeah?

258
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,865
What's going on?

259
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,160
Let's never see each other again, fucker.

260
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, ox knee soup.

261
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,878
I'm seriously so hungry.

262
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,463
Ox knee soup, wow.

263
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,050
Is this guy a bottomless pit?

264
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,844
I can't get ox knee soup out of my head.

265
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,972
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
And radish kimchi.

266
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,307
Oh, there you are.

267
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,934
What's this?

268
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,103
Hey, you're alive!

269
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,814
I thought you died!

270
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,360
When you guys went after him,
I tried to find Si-eun's phone.

271
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,779
It wasn't easy, and it took a while.

272
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,496
The screen cracked a little.

273
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,956
Thanks.

274
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,459
Mr. Yeon Si-eun?

275
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,505
Come with me to the station
to make a statement.

276
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
You guys too.

277
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,599
SEOUL SEOCHO POLICE STATION

278
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,601
Shit, I told you everything!

279
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,104
You're cutting off
the circulation to my wrists! Fuck!

280
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:39,876
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,255
What?

282
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,090
You were right.

283
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,551
Because of me, Su-hoâ€¦

284
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,345
Sorry.

285
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,890
Oh, no.

286
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,350
Well,

287
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,728
you got there late
because I took the taxi alone.

288
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm sorry too.

289
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,253
I talked to the police chief.

290
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,131
They won't be contacting
your family or the school.

291
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,551
You two had nothing to do with this case.

292
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,013
What?

293
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,727
Si-eun, you must not say anything
to your family.

294
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,025
You can leave now.

295
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,421
Wellâ€¦

296
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,385
Besides Kim Gil-su,
the others did nothing wrong.

297
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,680
He extorted and threatened them.

298
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,519
I'd be grateful if you went easy on them.

299
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,568
I see. Now, go on.

300
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,663
Did you keep it a secret from my father?

301
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,498
No.

302
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,042
Let's go as well.

303
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,256
No.

304
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,301
I asked you to keep it a secret.

305
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,429
We should go.

306
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,115
Hey, dumbass.

307
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,746
Let's get some food someday.

308
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,543
You guys just love to eat.

309
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,034
What is it?

310
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,538
How's Seok-dae?

311
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,915
He's being questioned.

312
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,920
He'll be fine.

313
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,884
And the others?

314
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,889
I can't get a hold of them.

315
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,350
Seong-chan went home.

316
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,231
And you?

317
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,122
Hey.

318
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,957
What are you doing?

319
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,383
The assemblyman
wanted you to pay him back.

320
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,343
What?

321
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,929
Hey, this is a police station.

322
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,348
You can't beat me here.

323
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,599
It's fine. Hit him.

324
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,227
I'm okay.

325
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,897
You morons are being fucking ridiculous.

326
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,406
Stay still. Don't move.

327
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,075
Watch carefully.

328
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,704
One, two. Yeah? One, two.

329
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,333
That hurts.

330
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,215
Just imagine he's a punching bag.

331
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,634
Okay. Hit me.

332
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,178
Fuck. Hey, little puppy!

333
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,472
Come fight me like your friends did.

334
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,807
No, I got that wrong.

335
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,727
You're not their friend.
You're just a lackey.

336
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,647
You're a tiny bitch next to those punks.
You son of a--

337
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
Okay, I get it, fucker.

338
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,609
Hey, hit me.

339
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,403
Hit me!

340
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,989
Do it! Hit me!

341
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,186
What?

342
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,110
She wants to apologize.

343
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,154
Hi!

344
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,495
Sheâ€¦ doesn't really sound like
she's apologizing.

345
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:50,830
Sorry!

346
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,877
Fucking idiot.

347
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,712
How did it go?

348
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,299
I don't know if it's good or not.

349
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,426
Beom-seok's family covered it up.

350
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,386
Our names were totally removed.

351
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,222
Gil-su was arrested.

352
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,685
Is Beom-seok's dad a CEO or something?

353
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,981
A secretary or something came
and offered to pay my hospital fees.

354
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:20,109
I said I was good,
but should I have taken it?

355
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,738
He's National Assemblyman Oh Jin-won.

356
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,207
How long are you in here?

357
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,169
It's just a fracture,
so I can leave tomorrow.

358
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,714
Can I crash here tonight?

359
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,132
Whatever you want.

360
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,217
Awesome!

361
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,763
You were fucking awesome back there.

362
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm a badass.

363
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,267
I got fucking goosebumps.

364
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,102
"Hey, you bastards!"

365
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,855
"Give me a break!"

366
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,481
"Everyone, give me a break!"

367
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,526
Lunatic! Why are you copying me?
Did you fall in love?

368
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,194
Give me a break.

369
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,155
Too bad. I'm with Si-eun.

370
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,411
You're dating?

371
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,912
You know that we aren't.

372
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,456
You know that we are.

373
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,667
We always know where the other is.

374
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,754
That's only because of that app.

375
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,048
You two look good together.
Just start dating.

376
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,091
Give me a break.

377
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,678
Seriously! Come on.

378
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,383
What's this?

379
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,264
What is this?

380
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,266
You wanted it.

381
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,025
If I eat at night, I'll get fat!

382
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,485
Hey.

383
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,654
Don't you know what time it is?

384
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,865
You're really inconsiderate.

385
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,785
You seem sincere though.

386
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,036
It looks delicious.

387
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,038
What is this feeling?

388
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,415
I'm getting goosebumps.

389
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,334
What is this?

390
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,755
-What?
-It's just that youâ€¦

391
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,467
You have such a warm heart.

392
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,386
Yeah? Your eyes.

393
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,680
Your behavior. Your words.

394
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,515
Your expression.

395
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,309
It feels strange, bro.

396
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,002
Dig in.

397
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,362
You're a mind reader.

398
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:05,960
I'm not only an assemblyman
but an adult and a father myself,

399
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,714
so it was only natural to be interested
in policies concerning teenagers.

400
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,112
What are you waiting for?

401
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,296
I shouldn't have taken you in.

402
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,715
Youâ€¦

403
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,970
are a bad seed.

404
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,807
You know that.

405
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,805
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL

406
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,348
ANY SIMILARITY TO REALITY IS COINCIDENTAL

407
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:51,185
