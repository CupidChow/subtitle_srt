1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:10,719
Hey, Jun-tae, look.

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,222
Fighting is about getting
the upper hand, no matter what. Okay?

3
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,434
Just one kick like this

4
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,394
will definitely scare your opponent.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,771
Let's give it a try.

6
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,359
Damn it.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,194
Hey, man.

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,780
What's wrong with your body?

9
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,865
That kid…

10
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,034
He can't be helped.

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,120
That coaching sucks.

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,789
Then why don't you teach him?

13
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:40,707
Nope.

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:47,213
I no longer teach anybody how to fight.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,886
You know what?

16
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
Gotak, that bastard.

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,477
He used to be a Tae Kwon Do athlete.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,231
But he got hurt hanging out with me.

19
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,362
He injured his knee and was hospitalized.

20
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,533
"I'm afraid your athlete days are over."

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,619
That's what the doc said

22
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,122
while his mother cried next to him.

23
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,709
I was fucking pissed.

24
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,505
I wanted to kill the assholes
who did that to Gotak.

25
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,808
Much later, I came to realize

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,353
that the hardest part…

27
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,276
was thinking it was all my fault.

28
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,289
Anyway, how did I feel back then?

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,624
Well…

30
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,086
Man, I suddenly forgot the word.
What was it?

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,087
Guilt.

32
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,296
Yeah, that.

33
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,803
I also had a friend like that.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,376
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

35
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,145
Su-ho.

36
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,023
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,244
Did you sleep well?

38
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,296
Hey, you slept for a long time.

39
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,593
I almost died running with you on my back.

40
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,303
Why are you so heavy?

41
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,682
What happened?

42
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,978
Well, Seong-je was unlucky and got caught.

43
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,479
We managed to escape.

44
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:32,897
No problem.

45
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,151
Hey, anyway…

46
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,697
thanks, and I'm sorry.

47
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,703
I'll make sure this never happens again.

48
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,166
Will you go and fight again?

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,754
What?

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,506
If you do…

51
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,469
will it change anything?

52
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,394
This situation will only repeat itself.

53
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,109
In the end, someone will get hurt.

54
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,909
And after that…

55
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,419
Why is Na Baek-jin…

56
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,797
acting that way toward you?

57
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,715
Hit him again.

58
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,383
-Hey, hit him harder!
-Hey!

59
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,052
You assholes!

60
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,720
I said to leave Baek-jin alone.

61
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:46,804
Are you okay?

62
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:48,931
Baku.

63
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:56,898
We're just…

64
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,110
childhood friends.

65
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,748
NA BAEK-JIN

66
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:27,762
Where are you?

67
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,306
Seong-je is at the police station.

68
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,103
I lost, Baek-jin.

69
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,189
What?

70
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,320
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

71
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,784
You don't actually care about Eunjang.

72
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,578
You just wanted me to say I lost.

73
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,456
That I'm the underdog, no?

74
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,004
What I want?

75
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,515
Fine.

76
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,393
I understand.

77
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,785
Man, fuck this.

78
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,751
Hey.

79
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,133
What's with you?

80
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,385
You came to meet me?

81
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,653
Don't you hate this place?

82
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,156
What do you mean?

83
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,244
It's filthy here,

84
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,498
but you're a fucking neat freak.

85
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,753
You bring punks here that don't listen
and then beat them to a pulp.

86
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,048
I bet you'd find a ton of bloodstains.

87
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,265
And it smells like shit here. Fuck.

88
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,150
What did you say to the police?

89
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,072
What?

90
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,493
Our burner bank account.

91
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,330
Only the two of us have access.

92
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:15,846
I just said…

93
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,976
I was taking money from Eunjang punks

94
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,228
and got in a fight.

95
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,646
Happy?

96
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,445
But you haven't fucking asked…

97
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,574
if I'm okay.

98
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,830
That's right.

99
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,667
I wondered why you brought me here.

100
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:51,841
If I fucked up with the police,

101
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,260
were you planning to beat me to death?

102
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,929
Huh?

103
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,056
So what?

104
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,021
We're both assholes,
but I thought we were on the same side.

105
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,776
I'm taking a break from all this.

106
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,779
Don't look for me.

107
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,961
The boss wants to see you. Get in.

108
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,926
I'll reach out to him.

109
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,761
You can leave.

110
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,222
Fucking asshole.

111
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,601
Hey, high schooler.

112
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,313
Have you lost your mind?

113
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,777
You fucking asshole.

114
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,866
You damn punk!

115
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,868
You asshole. Hey!

116
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,753
Fucker.

117
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,216
Fucking asshole.

118
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,639
Fucking piece of shit.

119
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,531
What do you think you're doing?

120
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,076
I'll reach out to him.

121
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,877
Pork belly. Do you want to eat pork belly?

122
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,171
Hey, do you know any good places?

123
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,173
I know an all-you-can-eat place.

124
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,884
-All you can eat?
-For 13,000 won.

125
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,970
Gotak, you're buying
if you can't reach that.

126
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:43,971
For real?

127
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:44,972
Reach what?

128
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,932
-You said you could reach that.
-Hey!

129
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,392
Yeon Si-eun!

130
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,899
Si-eun, I've been waiting forever for you!

131
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:00,946
What's going on?

132
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,366
What do you mean?
We're waiting to walk with you!

133
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,952
You slowpoke! Let's go!

134
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,579
Come on.

135
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,622
Let's go, Si-eun.

136
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,790
Let's go!

137
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,668
-Hurry up!
-Yeah, hurry up.

138
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,805
Let's go.

139
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,681
Let's do it!

140
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,686
At last, we've melted
our dear ice princess.

141
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,064
Princess?

142
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,025
-The value of this function…
-Hi. Hello, my brothers.

143
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,109
Are you studying?

144
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,403
You're bothering Si-eun again, you punk.

145
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,989
Stop bothering Si-eun while he's studying.

146
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,118
Okay, what's this 2XL?
Are you measuring sizes?

147
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,537
Is this a weapon box?

148
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,084
Si-eun-chan, shall we do a snack run?

149
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,627
-Yeah?
-Hey!

150
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,962
It's only first period.

151
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,046
Yes, I know.

152
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,548
But what day is it?

153
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,342
It's the day Gotak treats everyone!

154
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,302
What's this bullshit?

155
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,721
No, you clearly said it was your treat!

156
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,807
-Block Jun-tae!
-Si-eun is under the net.

157
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,016
Over here!

158
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,853
Hey, shoot!

159
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,188
-Damn it.
-Nice job!

160
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,109
Block with your body!

161
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,486
Shoot it!

162
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,572
-Si-eun can't do it.
-Shoot! Let's go!

163
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,284
Hey, see that? You didn't have to block.

164
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,036
No one was blocking you,
and you missed it!

165
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,626
This is nice.

166
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,756
Man, it's almost too peaceful.

167
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,802
Those Union punks

168
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,014
definitely won't just let it go.

169
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,558
I took care of everything.

170
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
So don't worry about it.

171
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,645
Just enjoy the peace.

172
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,065
Did you meet Baek-jin?

173
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,693
No, I didn't, you punk.

174
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:08,073
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about stuff like the Union anymore, okay?

175
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,369
Oh man, this is nice!

176
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,166
What?

177
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,588
Hello?

178
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,634
This is the Yeongdeungpo Police Station.
Are you Mr. Park Jin-cheol's son?

179
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,682
Yes, I understand.

180
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,646
Hey, what's going on?

181
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,022
What?

182
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,607
It's nothing.

183
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,235
Hey, something came up, so I'm gonna go.

184
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,403
-Okay.
-Bye.

185
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,573
What, just like that?

186
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,076
You said it was nothing, you punk!

187
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,162
Hey, Park Hu-min!

188
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,002
The kids have changed their story.

189
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,838
Now they claim Mr. Park
never checked their IDs,

190
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,548
so they won't sign their statements.

191
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,260
So your father lost it, and, well…

192
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,473
It's not okay to beat minors
in a police station.

193
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,392
SEOUL YEONGDEUNGPO POLICE STATION

194
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,219
NA BAEK-JIN

195
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,806
The number you have dialed is unavailable…

196
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,895
BAEK-JIN: JOIN THE UNION.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

197
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,940
THEN I WON'T MESS WITH YOUR FATHER,
HIS BUSINESS, OR YOUR FRIENDS.

198
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,238
That fucking old man slapped me hard.

199
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,906
Fuck. I thought I might die.

200
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,994
How bad can it be?
He fries chicken for a living, dumbass.

201
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,040
Hey, was that Baku just now?

202
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,835
Baku or Fuck-u, what's he going to do?

203
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,746
-Yes?
-Baek-jin.

204
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,165
I heard Park Hu-min
beat up our boys again.

205
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,502
What should I do about that fucker?

206
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,796
Do I send in more guys?

207
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,174
Leave him be.

208
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,009
What?

209
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,011
Just leave him be.

210
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,056
Baku is doing a great job.

211
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,944
Oh yeah!

212
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,202
My turn, bro.

213
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,542
That fucking bastard.

214
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,128
Mr. Choi is here.

215
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,715
Those motherfuckers.

216
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,014
How have you been?

217
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,934
What brings you here?

218
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,524
What brings me here?

219
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,487
Do I need to ask permission

220
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,114
to visit my own business?

221
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,122
Sit.

222
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,684
Any issues?

223
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,854
None.

224
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,863
If there are no issues, why did I get
a call from the police station?

225
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,826
Who was it again?

226
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
Geum Seong-je? Goddamn it.

227
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,920
Do your job right, Baek-jin,

228
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,256
before I step in, okay?

229
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,472
Don't make me come back here.

230
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,579
Sit down.

231
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,587
The bruises on your face,
and you missing cram school.

232
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,548
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

233
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,135
What the hell are you doing
in and out of school?

234
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,184
Get ready to study abroad.

235
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,106
I know that the previous incident
has made it hard to focus.

236
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,775
I've put a lot of thought into this.

237
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,238
Let's just leave Korea and--

238
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,489
I don't want to.

239
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,869
Is it wrong for a mom
to worry about her son?

240
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,170
You will study abroad.

241
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,381
End of discussion.

242
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,304
You can go back…

243
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,933
to living your life
without caring about me.

244
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:58,734
I thought…

245
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,825
what happened at your previous school was…

246
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,497
all because of me.

247
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,630
Because I was a terrible mom.

248
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,597
I can't let something like that happen
to my son again, can I?

249
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,812
Why is it so hard
for you to understand my feelings?

250
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,583
Su-ho.

251
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,295
If you were here…

252
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,342
what would you tell me at this moment?

253
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,554
You…

254
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,308
always knew what to say.

255
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:16,770
My mom.

256
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,731
And you.

257
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,068
And all these situations.

258
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,155
It seems like it's all my fault.

259
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,037
I have no idea

260
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,914
what to do.

261
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,421
I heard your mom will handle
your academic records.

262
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:44,840
Is that right?

263
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,052
High school diplomas
from many international schools

264
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,971
aren't accepted in Korea.

265
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,265
You'll need to study hard.

266
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,519
You'll be in trouble
if you fall in with the wrong crowd again.

267
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,897
-Did you hear?
-What?

268
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,732
Baku got in trouble again.

269
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,650
Again?

270
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,901
Some Union punks.

271
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,904
Baku nearly beat them to death
in front of the police station.

272
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,824
But he just returned
from his last suspension.

273
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,741
I know.

274
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,453
At this rate, it must be Baku's fault,
not the Union's.

275
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,872
What if the fucking Union
comes after us again?

276
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,666
"No fighting," my ass.
Follow your own rules.

277
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:23,962
Man, the peace was nice while it lasted.
It's going to get crazy again.

278
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:29,468
EUNJANG HIGH, NO FIGHTING
-BAKU-

279
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,569
BAEK-JIN: JOIN THE UNION.
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

280
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,614
THEN I WON'T MESS WITH YOUR FATHER,
HIS BUSINESS, OR YOUR FRIENDS.

281
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,166
Are you skipping school again?

282
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,712
I'm not feeling well.

283
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,260
How so?

284
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,725
It's just a cold.

285
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,443
You little punk.

286
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:29,903
Hey, brat.

287
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,822
What will you become when you're older?

288
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,246
That's not for you to say, Dad.

289
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,789
What's that?

290
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,332
You little asshole.

291
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,877
Fine, you punk.

292
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,296
Keep on fighting.

293
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,798
Drop out of school.

294
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,342
Go and earn some money instead.

295
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,094
Do you know

296
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,807
how much it costs
to feed and house a punk like you?

297
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,309
Man, fuck this! Seriously!

298
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,771
You little punk.

299
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,782
Fuck, you have no idea
who I'm doing this for.

300
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,473
What do you want?

301
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,228
I gave you enough time to think.

302
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,480
Decide now.

303
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,232
I won't ask again.

304
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,070
The safety of your dad and friends…

305
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:01,036
The only one who can give you
what you want… is me.

306
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,625
You said you'd do what I want.

307
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,961
I'll do the same in return.

308
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,040
It's not a tough gig.

309
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,377
Some punks from Seoknam High.

310
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,879
Just go and mess them up.

311
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,679
Hey, be quiet.

312
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,389
Don't mess with me.

313
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,556
Shut up, dumbass.

314
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,774
ARE YOU THE SEOKNAM GORILLA?

315
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,527
And who are you?

316
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,328
I asked who you are.

317
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,038
Sorry.

318
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,582
What the fuck are you saying?
You fucking dumbass.

319
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,421
Fucking hilarious!

320
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,715
Fuck, is he serious?

321
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:41,761
Hey.

322
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,722
Motherfucker.

323
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,735
Take it.

324
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,195
NA BAEK-JIN

325
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,115
Hello?

326
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,035
Seoknam is now part of the Union.

327
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,913
Come by my office.

328
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,166
We need to talk.

329
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,127
Put him back on.

330
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,090
He wants you.

331
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,687
Here. Go get some pain relief patches.

332
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,474
Hey, is this right?

333
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,811
Maybe he went to cram school?

334
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,895
Yeah, maybe.

335
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,023
How did you get my address?

336
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,776
Wait. Si--

337
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:24,989
Si-eun… Well, our homeroom teacher
gave me your address--

338
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,242
Hey, that's not important right now.

339
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,119
Yeon Si-eun, come on out!

340
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,247
What?

341
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,706
Hey, come on out!

342
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,124
Let's hang out.

343
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,130
Hey, too strong. Switch.

344
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,967
Now, Si-eun, give it a try.

345
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,099
-Amazing!
-Nice, Si-eun.

346
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,101
-Not bad.
-One more time.

347
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,686
Try it again.

348
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,982
What was that?

349
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,109
-No way!
-Hey, you've been practicing!

350
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,363
Are you studying abroad?

351
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,365
When are you leaving?

352
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,453
I'm not really sure yet.

353
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,373
I might go.

354
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,420
Hey, that sounds good.

355
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,256
I've never even been on a plane.

356
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,097
We haven't known each other long,

357
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,182
but I have…

358
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,519
a lot to be sorry about

359
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,606
and a lot to be thankful for.

360
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,277
So it's a shame, man.

361
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,790
What happened to Hu-min?

362
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,004
I've heard some strange rumors.

363
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,301
This isn't the first time
he's been in a fight.

364
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,053
Don't worry.

365
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,222
When he gets back,
I'll knock some sense into him.

366
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,726
Man, forget it.

367
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,895
We have to play one more game.

368
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,359
Hey, Jun-tae!

369
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,112
-What's up with your body. Seriously?
-I scored three shots.

370
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,072
-Three?
-Yeah.

371
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,824
Good job. Hey, but you're too stiff.

372
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,118
Look at this.

373
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,745
One, two, snap.

374
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,581
-Good, huh?
-Yeah.

375
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,709
Snap it away when your hand is at the top.
Not too hard now.

376
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,336
PARK HU-MIN

377
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,796
One, hold it.

378
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,714
-One, two, smoothly!
-One, two, snap.

379
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,342
Oh, that's a shame.
One more. You can do it.

380
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,052
-One more time?
-You can do it.

381
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,903
HIGH-AND-MIGHTY YEON SI-EUN

382
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,002
Hey, stop dribbling.
You have to make a basket!

383
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:24,919
Where are you?

384
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,758
Nice!

385
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,510
One more time.

386
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,470
-This time, I'll shoot.
-Okay.

387
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,805
None of your business.

388
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,224
-It's 2-1.
-Okay, come on.

389
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,185
Either way, I won't cause you any trouble.

390
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,146
Hey, if you jump like that…

391
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,733
That's not what I meant…

392
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,700
Nice!

393
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,119
-I knew you could score. Nice.
-Nice!

394
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,620
Do it!

395
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,125
Nice. Do it again. Once more.

396
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,877
Try it again! That's it.

397
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,903
We've been waiting for you.

398
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,529
You did well.

399
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:39,952
Welcome,

400
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,704
Baku.

401
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,433
Sky Airlines would like to make
the final boarding call

402
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,395
for flight 9111.

403
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,482
Boarding for Singapore
will be closing soon.

404
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:14,779
Passengers departing for Singapore,
please go to gate 23…

405
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:18,407
I put a ribbon on your suitcase
so it would be easy to find.

406
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,618
Eat this on the flight.

407
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,875
Si-eun.

408
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,460
Let's think positively.

409
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,505
I'll finish up my work and be there soon.

410
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,800
And…

411
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:38,678
thank you

412
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,139
for understanding me.

413
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:57,238
SEO JUN-TAE

414
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,701
Just a minute.

415
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,421
Hey, Jun-tae. What is it?

416
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,924
Hey, Si-eun. What's up?

417
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,095
Not much.

418
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,889
What about you?

419
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,478
Well, I forgot to say this last time.

420
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,444
Baku,

421
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,613
Gotak…

422
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,450
and I,

423
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:47,288
we all know
you visit your friend in the hospital…

424
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,793
and why he's there.

425
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,843
But in my opinion…

426
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,685
it wasn't your fault.

427
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,483
I just wanted to tell you

428
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,569
that it wasn't your fault.

429
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,297
Si-eun, what…

430
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,633
What's wrong?

431
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,554
I don't want to go.

432
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
What?

433
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,607
My friends say

434
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,277
that it wasn't my fault.

435
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,032
