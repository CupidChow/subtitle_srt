1
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,190
Are you friends?

2
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,402
Can you explain what happened again?

3
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,530
So there's this kid, Oh Beom-seok.

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,824
He goes to Byuksan High School.

5
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,159
-Oh Beom-seok?
-Yes.

6
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,411
He called me over to a café.

7
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,079
He wasn't alone--

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,164
Yeong-i.

9
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,500
Are you okay?

10
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,838
Are you okay?

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,423
Where did the others go?

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,052
I was alone.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,889
Young man.

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,932
You can be honest with us.

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,642
Don't worry.

16
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,354
I was alone.

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,148
What are you doing?

18
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,401
Never tell Su-ho

19
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,488
about what happened today.

20
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,073
What?

21
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,577
Hey, Si-eun!

22
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,624
Si-eun!

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,920
Beom-seok.

24
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,425
Yeah.

25
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,053
Stop this. Now.

26
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,141
Leave Su-ho alone.

27
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,982
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

28
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,706
DIVIDING NUMBERS WITH TWO AND THREE DIGITS

29
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,543
I'm just asking what you were doing
when he got hurt.

30
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,836
Is that so wrong?

31
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,588
You think you're the only one who's busy?

32
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,759
Do you think I'm just resting at home
while you're working?

33
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,762
You said that we'd do this together.

34
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,597
That we'd raise him together!

35
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,140
That we should have this child--

36
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,059
I had no idea back then!

37
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,356
I didn't expect him to get hurt
all the time like this.

38
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,491
Si-eun.

39
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,034
Si-eun.

40
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:48,997
Si-eun.

41
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,791
Si-eun, open the door and talk to me.

42
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,086
Si-eun, please open the door.

43
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,714
Si-eun.

44
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,717
Si-eun, please talk to your dad.

45
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,803
Yeon Si-eun.

46
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,682
We weren't fighting. We were just talking.

47
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,599
Si-eun.

48
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,312
Si-eun. Yeon Si-eun.

49
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,938
Si-eun.

50
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:17,775
Si-eun.

51
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,120
It's all right.

52
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,830
Tell me the truth.

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,542
Were these the same guys as before?

54
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,670
It's the truth.

55
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,672
I fell down some stairs.

56
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,175
Be honest with me.

57
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,385
Why were you there?

58
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,555
No reason.

59
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,394
You'll transfer schools.

60
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,563
That's final.

61
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,564
I don't want to.

62
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:57,940
Seriously?

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,485
What's wrong with you?

64
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,945
I'm trying hard to raise you.

65
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,280
Why won't you listen?

66
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,281
Father.

67
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,661
I've been wondering.

68
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,832
Since when have you cared about me
so much?

69
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,585
What?

70
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,511
Never mind.

71
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,645
Yes?

72
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,357
Beom-seok is at home.

73
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,608
How did it go?

74
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,277
I handled the police at Seocho.

75
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,155
I talked to his school principal.

76
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,993
The assemblyman's wife is on Jeju Island,
so stay there and watch him.

77
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,953
We don't know what he might do.

78
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,709
Find a school in the Philippines.
They'll send him soon.

79
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,127
Yes, sir.

80
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,715
How did you know?

81
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,304
From Mr. Park.

82
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,431
He said you'd be in there.

83
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,392
I meant about yesterday.

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,898
The police contacted us.

85
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,066
Yeon Si-eun…

86
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,944
He just wanted to let it go.

87
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,946
He said you were friends.

88
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,995
What were the protestors' demands?

89
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,497
It's important.

90
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:19,999
Hey, wake him up.

91
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,835
-Wake up!
-Su-ho.

92
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,670
Ahn Su-ho.

93
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,881
Where were we?

94
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,718
No answer?

95
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,055
Which page was it?

96
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,933
Page 100. The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876.

97
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,351
I see. In that case…

98
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,563
turn to page 109.

99
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,274
Let's discuss
the Donghak Peasant Revolution.

100
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,069
So, let's continue.

101
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:52,114
In order for us to understand
the Donghak Peasant Revolution…

102
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,163
AHN SU-HO

103
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,798
SOMETHING CAME UP AT HOME
SO I CAN'T COME TO SCHOOL FOR A WHILE

104
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,929
Why didn't you come home?

105
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,889
You ignored my calls.

106
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,224
What?

107
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,606
Is this supposed to be a birthday prank?
Has it ended yet?

108
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,027
Stop it. It's not funny.

109
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,114
It's not a prank.

110
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,324
I'm sorry about yesterday.

111
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,068
FINAL EXAM
IN 1 DAY

112
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,320
-Hey!
-God.

113
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,572
Let's go smoke.

114
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,129
Why isn't Beom-seok here?

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,674
Not sure.

116
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,926
Did you call him?

117
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,054
Aren't you guys close?

118
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,057
His phone was off. Do you know anything?

119
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,601
Tell him to pay for my repairs.

120
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,935
Yeah, okay.

121
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:49,899
What?

122
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,610
What repairs?

123
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,325
It cost me 800,000 won.

124
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,537
If you don't pay, I'll kill you all.

125
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,583
Answer me.

126
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,044
Okay.

127
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:21,389
JEONG-CHAN

128
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,183
The number you have called…

129
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,227
Fuck, Beom-seok! Pick up the phone!

130
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,563
Fuck, we need to take care of Su-ho.

131
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,941
Hey, why isn't Si-eun at school?

132
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,235
He didn't die, did he?

133
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,904
-I mean, Yeong-bin fucking overreacted.
-Hey.

134
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,156
You're the ones overreacting.

135
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,368
If he were dead, we'd be at a funeral now.

136
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,453
Shit.

137
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,813
Wait!

138
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,692
Beom-seok called you at first,

139
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,528
but he took the girl instead
to draw you out

140
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:18,988
because you didn't answer.

141
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,740
What?

142
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,116
You know.

143
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,535
That girl who lives with you.

144
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,122
But Si-eun showed up.

145
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,467
-Keep going.
-Right. Okay.

146
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,554
Beom-seok paid
one of Yeong-bin's friends to beat you up.

147
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,808
Beom-seok did it all.
We were just bystanders.

148
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,455
What is it?

149
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,417
Which hospital is Si-eun in?

150
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,718
He got out today.

151
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,348
I'm sorry I caused this.

152
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:34,980
Hey!

153
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,407
Si-eun didn't want you to find out.

154
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,411
Don't cause any trouble.

155
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,055
Who is it?

156
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,517
Delivery.

157
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,481
What's up?

158
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,150
Why are you asking?

159
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,736
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

160
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:38,961
Hey.

161
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,672
You doing okay?

162
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,676
Yeah.

163
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
What is it?

164
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,430
Nothing.

165
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,015
Just stopping by.

166
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,739
Are you okay?

167
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:11,952
What?

168
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,795
Will you be at school for finals tomorrow?

169
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:25,966
Yeah.

170
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,760
I need to be.

171
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,471
All right. Yeah.

172
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,015
See you then.

173
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,664
He's inside?

174
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,581
Yes.

175
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,877
Are you fucking crazy?

176
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,505
You piece of shit!

177
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,549
You.

178
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,135
I told you not to fucking embarrass me.

179
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
What's wrong?

180
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,180
Hey! What's wrong with you?

181
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,141
Fucking piece of shit.

182
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,226
All you had to do was listen,

183
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,228
do what you were told,

184
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,272
and keep your head down.

185
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,606
Was that hard?

186
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,400
Was that so hard?

187
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:07,985
Son of a bitch!

188
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,487
You fucking idiot!

189
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,574
You fucker!

190
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,284
Hey.

191
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,370
You're going to study abroad.

192
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,750
Do whatever you want. I don't give a shit
if you kill yourself with drugs.

193
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,712
Just don't tell anyone you're my son.

194
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,589
Is that understood?

195
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,340
Hey!

196
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,760
Keep an eye on this punk.

197
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,643
I never asked you to raise me.

198
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,123
Beom-seok.

199
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,334
Let go, fuck.

200
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,420
I said let go.

201
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,388
-Where to?
-Just drive.

202
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:48,544
MISSED CALL: SU-HO, JEONG-CHAN
YEONG-BIN, TAE-HUN

203
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,922
SU-HO
IMAGE

204
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,716
ANSWER THE PHONE,
OR I WILL KILL YOUR FRIENDS

205
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,059
Please, wait.

206
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,603
So then,

207
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,314
go get Beom-seok.

208
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,443
I don't know where he is either.

209
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,154
Honestly! I can't reach him!

210
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,704
Then an eye for an eye.

211
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,389
BEOM-SEOK

212
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,563
Where are you?

213
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,071
Where the fuck are you?

214
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,867
Why?

215
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,161
Oh Beom-seok.

216
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,497
Stop hiding.

217
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,266
Shit!

218
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,572
OH BEOM-SEOK

219
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,662
What's up?

220
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,210
Let's get Ahn Su-ho.

221
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:55,963
I'll pay.

222
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,202
Hello?

223
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,329
Hey.

224
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,582
Have you talked to Su-ho?

225
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:35,961
Yeah.

226
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,671
He came by earlier.

227
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,550
Su-ho knows everything that happened.

228
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,385
What?

229
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,556
He didn't come to work,
and I can't reach him.

230
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,019
Did he say anything to you?

231
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,566
He wouldn't

232
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,610
go after Beom-seok, would he?

233
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,281
I'll try to reach him.

234
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,721
Are you making a movie?

235
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,266
You're fucking crazy.

236
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:32,934
What is this?

237
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,522
Where's Beom-seok?

238
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,071
Long time no see.

239
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:33,995
You should have taken it out on me.

240
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,289
Not on those kids.

241
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,835
They did nothing wrong.

242
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,219
I'm sorry.

243
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,851
For upsetting you.

244
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,025
I apologized.

245
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,864
Now you apologize to Si-eun and Yeong-i.

246
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,452
I don't want to.

247
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,247
I have nothing to apologize for.

248
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,042
Do it, please.

249
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,591
I said no.

250
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,890
Then I'll beat you up

251
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,185
until you come to your senses.

252
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,775
Hey, Ahn Su-ho.

253
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,701
Get in the ring.

254
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,663
You seriously paid this asshole

255
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,374
just to beat me up?

256
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,089
You're so fucking pathetic.

257
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,848
One sec. Let me warm up.

258
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,956
I guess you've been working out.

259
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,416
You almost look like a pro.

260
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,710
Did you forget
I once beat the hell out of you?

261
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,089
Come on, then.

262
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
Well!

263
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,401
The time has come, guys.

264
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,070
I told you I got owned
back in middle school,

265
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,572
so this will be my revenge.

266
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,116
This time, we'll fight
in an official match.

267
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,034
Wish me luck.

268
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,125
-This is it.
-Let's make it exciting.

269
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,668
-Okay?
-Please.

270
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,170
Please, Woo-yeong. You're our only hope.

271
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,463
Cut the crap.

272
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,312
Fuck, that was close!

273
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,443
The old injury's there?

274
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,528
So what if it is, punk?

275
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,204
Behind you!

276
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,332
-Woo-yeong!
-Go, Woo-yeong!

277
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,134
Woo-yeong! Get your revenge!

278
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,803
That's it!

279
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,055
Good job!

280
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,605
Feeling lucky?

281
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,856
Fuck you, asshole.

282
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,197
Kill that son of a bitch!

283
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,878
You fucker!

284
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,047
Hey, fuck you!

285
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,813
Hey, he's fucked up.

286
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,482
Fucker.

287
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,109
Oh shit.

288
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,530
-That fucker.
-That punk was tough.

289
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,626
Hey.

290
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,213
Now who's the pathetic one?

291
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,887
Say it again.

292
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,519
Who do you think you are?

293
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,063
Always looking at me like that.

294
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,149
Looking down on me.

295
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,735
Hey.

296
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,322
Please come to your senses.

297
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,122
Stop blaming others, Beom-seok.

298
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,460
Hey.

299
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,338
Fuck you. Keep my name out of your mouth.

300
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,593
Fucking bastard.

301
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,597
Fuck, let's join in.

302
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,685
-Fucker!
-Bastard!

303
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,228
-You fucker!
-Son of a bitch!

304
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,608
Son of a bitch!

305
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,198
-Asshole!
-Motherfucker!

306
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,450
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

307
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,702
Son of a bitch!

308
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,677
Fucking son of a bitch.

309
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:07,931
Beom-seok.

310
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Oh Beom-seok!

311
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,399
Oh fuck.

312
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,692
Let's go.

313
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,489
Don't touch me.

314
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,783
Come on.

315
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,992
Seriously, let go.

316
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,496
I said let me go, fucking asshole!

317
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,589
Hey, Ahn Su-ho.

318
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,056
Ahn Su-ho.

319
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,439
Hey, he isn't breathing.

320
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,357
What?

321
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,282
Hey, Ahn Su-ho!

322
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,371
Oh fuck!

323
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,296
You two were the last to hit him.

324
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,507
If you leave now, it'll get worse.

325
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,594
I'll fix this, so stay here.

326
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
Su-ho.

327
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,724
Su-ho.

328
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,896
Su-ho.

329
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,069
Su-ho, please look at me.

330
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,740
Let's go.

331
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,952
Stop. Come on.

332
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,245
Beom-seok.

333
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,748
Get him out of here!

334
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,542
Su-ho isn't opening his eyes!

335
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,711
Su-ho isn't…

336
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,302
Wait!

337
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,261
Wait, please.

338
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,771
Si-eun!

339
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:03,815
Where's Su-ho?

340
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,275
He's not here.

341
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,779
He won't answer my calls.

342
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,115
Seriously, where is he?

343
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,885
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL
