1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,713
I asked you.

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,840
I told you to stop.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,811
Don't cross the line, all right?
Know when to stop.

4
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,649
What?

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,778
Me? I'm like your guardian angel
who just woke up from a nap.

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,239
Unconditioned reflex.

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:34,784
If an object suddenly appears,
you instinctively shut your eyes.

8
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,078
It's an innate response to stimuli.

9
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,420
Knock it off, you nutcase,

10
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,589
or you're really going to get hit.

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,720
I said knock it off.

12
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,848
Don't tell me what to do.

13
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,775
What are you doing?

14
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,702
No! Put it down!

15
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,663
What are you doing now?

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,540
Jeez, Teach.

17
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,585
I was trying to stop them from fighting,

18
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,962
and I was almost put in danger.

19
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,339
I am really sorry.

20
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,716
Quick! Apologize!

21
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,180
Now!

22
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:25,645
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 1

23
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,076
JEONGJIN SEOUL HOSPITAL

24
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
Yes.

25
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,747
Yes, we just got to the hospital.

26
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,918
Yes, we'll talk it through.

27
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,004
Don't worry.

28
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,715
I'll let you know.

29
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,801
What were you thinking?

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,221
Ma'am, please calm down.

31
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,723
Why are you alone? Where's your mother?

32
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,060
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,479
I don't need your apology.
Just bring your mom.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,732
I have no mom.

35
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,651
There's always something.

36
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,780
I'll be sending you
to juvenile detention for sure!

37
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,739
Got it?

38
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,831
Yeong-bin made another kid

39
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,417
put this on my neck.

40
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,253
What is that?

41
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,257
-That's--
-A drug.

42
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:18,841
It's a drug.

43
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,470
What's this fucking bullshit?

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:23,972
You have proof?

45
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,349
Fuck, can you prove I did it?

46
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,810
You still don't get it.

47
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,937
This is your bag, right?

48
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:38,069
FENTANYL PATCHES

49
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,079
You do realize this isn't just
a school violence issue now?

50
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:53,209
I think Yeong-bin should transfer
to another school.

51
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,922
If this gets out…

52
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,632
Well…

53
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,969
Let's just let it slide.

54
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,001
Hey, Si-eun!

55
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,920
What's wrong with your hands?

56
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,257
I got hurt in gym class.

57
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,301
Let me see.

58
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,513
Did you pass out again?

59
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,683
No, I don't do that anymore.

60
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,070
Hey, kid.

61
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,573
Now you're fighting with your classmates?

62
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,660
Hey, it's fine.

63
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,246
Men are supposed to fight as they grow up.

64
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,749
I've been there too.

65
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,959
It's not like that.

66
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,506
Did you at least get to throw a punch?

67
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,139
Fine, I get it. Rest up.

68
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,100
Puberty, huh?

69
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,132
Hey, fucker.

70
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,719
See me after class.

71
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,930
You caught me off guard, you bastard.

72
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,808
You're gonna fucking die today.

73
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,649
Let's do it now.

74
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,361
Crazy asshole.

75
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,280
That son of a bitch. Seriously.

76
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,786
-Should we stop them?
-Looks like a fight.

77
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,608
You guys

78
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,528
aren't good at learning, are you?

79
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,738
The fuck you say?

80
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,926
If your memory is bad…

81
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,388
you need to review more.

82
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,441
Pavlov's dogs experiment…

83
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,072
Ring the bell.

84
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,783
Give a treat.

85
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,578
The dog salivates.

86
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,039
Ring the bell.

87
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,001
Give a treat.

88
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,671
The dog salivates.

89
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,761
Only ring the bell.

90
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
Let's stop.

91
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,808
I'm asking you.

92
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,019
Do me

93
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,730
a favor.

94
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,665
He's totally fine and not hurt at all!

95
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,335
Hey, Si-eun, how'd it go?

96
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,670
Did you totally lay out those assholes?

97
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:37,803
Do I know you?

98
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,309
Are we close?

99
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,731
What? Where did everyone go?

100
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,976
I told you to watch yourself.

101
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,690
What is it?

102
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,445
Nice chance for a nose job.

103
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,369
Who was it?

104
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,747
A classmate.

105
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,832
How much will you pay me?

106
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,293
How much do you want?

107
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,379
Fuck, are you rich?

108
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,008
I wish I had your dad.

109
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,223
"Please help me."

110
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,267
"Sir."

111
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,479
Say it.

112
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,731
"Please help me, sir."

113
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,151
Please help me.

114
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,779
Sir.

115
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,385
How come we keep crossing paths?

116
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,554
Were we married in our past lives?

117
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,639
Where are you going?

118
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,308
Home.

119
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,227
What?

120
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,605
Home!

121
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,899
From cram school?

122
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,484
Yeah.

123
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:45,783
I'm sorry.

124
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
Now you're sorry?

125
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,329
If you are, then buy me some food later.

126
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,872
I'm off. See you later!

127
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,106
I'll take these two.

128
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,190
Delivery's here!

129
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,860
Delivery's here!

130
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,458
Delivery is here.

131
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,669
-How about some candy?
-Yes, please.

132
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,463
Keep it quiet, okay?

133
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,746
BYUKSAN HIGH SCHOOL

134
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,456
FACULTY SHOWER ROOM

135
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,015
It's lunch break.

136
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,350
Yeah.

137
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,686
I'm good.

138
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,729
I'm buying.

139
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,696
What's with that look?

140
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,156
I won't eat.

141
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,626
I didn't expect anything fancy,

142
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,879
but I've already paid for my school food.

143
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,381
Then don't eat.

144
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,219
Bon appétit!

145
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,393
So…

146
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,813
why do you sleep at school?

147
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,898
I come here right after work.

148
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,734
If I go home, I'll oversleep.

149
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,989
Grandma says even if I don't make it
into college, I shouldn't skip school.

150
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,952
Do you like listening to music?

151
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,955
You always have earbuds in.

152
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,290
It's rude.

153
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,211
-I get annoyed.
-What?

154
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,631
I wear them so people won't talk to me.

155
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,051
You're fucking weird, man.

156
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,635
Look who's talking.

157
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,939
Hey.

158
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,733
Why's Si-eun not in trouble?

159
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,817
I heard

160
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,487
that Yeong-bin had fucking fentanyl.

161
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,655
-Really?
-You're exaggerating.

162
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,283
It's true. They're gonna cover it up
and move on.

163
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,577
But why are they hanging out together?

164
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,829
I know. They're like best friends now.

165
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,833
Su-ho is a damn MMA master.
I heard he almost became a pro fighter.

166
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,377
His counterpunch is fire.

167
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,046
Yeah, he's freaking good.

168
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:12,716
PURCHASE GAME MONEY

169
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,521
BET

170

173
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,671
That's lit.

174
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,681
CREDITOR: JEON SEOK-DAE
DEBTOR: KIM WON-SEOK

175
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,394
Sweet. It's on.

176
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,311
So,

177
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,231
when will I get the money?

178
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,693
Leave.

179
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
You're late.

180
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,581
Yeah.

181
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,583
Should I be sorry?

182
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,672
They're my crew.

183
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,340
He's my cousin.

184
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,259
A rich fucker.

185
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,387
What?

186
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,849
What are you looking at?

187
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,517
Dickface.

188
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,102
Me?

189
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,021
Fucking harsh.

190
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
Hey.

191
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,863
When is the kid out?

192
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,787
Yeon Si-eun!

193
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:07,998
Yeon Si-eun!

194
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,961
You're not staying to study?

195
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,671
You going to cram school?

196
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:16,757
Yeah.

197
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,675
Which one?

198
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,261
Daemyeong Academy.

199
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,933
I'm thinking of going to a cram school.
How do you like it?

200
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,434
Should I go too?

201
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,527
You don't need to suck up to me.

202
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,572
And I won't accept an apology.

203
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,835
Let's do it quickly!

204
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,176
You spooked me.

205
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,137
What? Class is over?

206
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,181
Yeah.

207
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,767
I feel left out now.
It's really upsetting.

208
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,104
-Couldn't you jerks have woken me up?
-You said not to.

209
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,232
Did I?

210
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,776
Then wake me in ten.

211
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,936
Is this him?

212
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,272
Are you fucking kidding?

213
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,691
Aren't you guys ashamed? This is wrong.

214
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,116
I need to go study.

215
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,868
Nothing personal.

216
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,996
It's just business.

217
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,348
Hey, that's Yeong-bin, right?

218
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,433
-Whoa, scary.
-Fucking savage.

219
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:39,358
Right, that's Yeong-bin's cousin.

220
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,369
Ahn Su-ho.

221
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,705
Ahn Su-ho!

222
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,000
Jeon Yeong-bin,

223
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,585
he's dragging Si-eun off.

224
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,755
Jeon Yeong-bin.

225
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,173
He's dragging Si-eun off.

226
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,132
And?

227
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,009
What?

228
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,677
No, please help.

229
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,262
You have to help.

230
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,264
I heard you know martial arts.

231
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,850
We aren't that close.

232
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,979
How close do you need to be to help?

233
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,898
Go find a teacher.

234
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
I have to work.

235
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,903
I'll pay you.

236
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,659
Double what your job pays.

237
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,212
Thank you, sir. Let's go.

238
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,590
Let's hurry, valued customer!

239
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,097
What's up? Get on.

240
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,067
Look out for him.

241
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,383
Go be the lookout.

242
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,677
Wow.

243
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,347
I'm really fucking bored.

244
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,683
Are you little kids?

245
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,519
Gil-su is calling. End it quickly.

246
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,521
Seriously.

247
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,737
His hand.

248
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,158
Rip off the prick's hand

249
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,785
so that he can't study.

250
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:58,788
Three on the left.

251
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,499
Beat them down quickly.

252
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,669
Two on the right. Conditioned reflex.
Deal with them later if needed.

253
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,388
I need to get the drop on him.

254
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,015
Just end it quickly.

255
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,145
What is this?

256
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,737
Fuck!

257
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,528
Move.

258
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,326
Hey!

259
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:31,673
I'm sorry.

260
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,049
I underestimated you.

261
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,053
Out of the way.

262
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:40,599
Son of a bitch! Fuck you!

263
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,934
Fucking bastard! Dumbass!

264
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:47,856
Dumb piece of shit! Son of a bitch! Fuck!

265
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,609
Hey.

266
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,152
Grab his hands.

267
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,034
Son of a bitch.

268
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,538
You fucker.

269
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,129
Know your fucking place.

270
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,547
Fucking moron.

271
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,396
Hey, you okay?

272
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,106
Who's this punk?

273
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,110
Are you okay?

274
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,032
Don't leave me hanging.

275
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,836
Let's call it a day.

276
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,254
Yeah?

277
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,310
Hey.

278
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,588
Hey, grab that asshole.

279
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,390
Fucker!

280
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,925
Tap out, fucker.

281
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,011
You're going to die.

282
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,904
Hey!

283
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,850
Good job.

284
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,023
Anyways.

285
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,151
Aren't you embarrassed, ganging up on him?

286
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,572
If it were me, I'd die of shame.

287
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,121
Seok-dae.

288
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,040
What are you doing?

289
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Do your job.

290
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,212
Hey.

291
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,634
Looks like he is embarrassed.

292
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,139
That's enough for today.

293
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,184
He's leaving.

294
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,480
Hey, Gil-su called.

295
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,527
Hurry, let's go!

296
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,071
Seriously?

297
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,742
Jeon Yeong-bin.

298
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,161
Stop it.

299
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,459
I said stop.

300
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,177
Let's go.

301
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,647
Let me see. Oh, it's really scraped up.

302
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,117
I really worked up an appetite.

303
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,827
Let's go eat.

304
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,662
I know a good place.

305
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,582
It's on you, right?

306
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,470
What's up? Get on.

307
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,057
-I need to go to cram school.
-Come on, man.

308
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,186
You can't even muster up
a thank you to your saviors?

309
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,397
I said I know a great place.

310
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,215
I'll pay, so eat what you want.

311
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,758
Sorry I'm late.

312
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,593
Oh, Su-ho, you're so late!

313
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,261
-Yes.
-Did you eat?

314
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,056
-Not yet. We'll eat later.
-Oh, that's too bad.

315
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,144
I was late because of you guys,

316
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,104
so help out.

317
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,356
You're Su-ho's friends?

318
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,399
Hello.

319
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,365
It needs to shine!

320
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,370
Where did you learn to wash so well?

321
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,540
Your mother must be so proud.
Such a precious boy!

322
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,798
There's one more box.

323
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,930
You have two jobs?

324
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,643
I do deliveries three times a week.

325
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,728
Not every day.

326
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,606
Isn't it hard?

327
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,861
It is what it is.

328
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,572
I work as a mover on weekends.

329
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,285
Why?

330
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,497
Do you respect me now?

331
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,710
Welcome! Come on in.

332
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,128
Finish this up.

333
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,673
What can I get you? Take your time.

334
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,234
So…

335
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:34,822
about the mock test…

336
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,493
I'm really… sorry.

337
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,704
Yeong-bin threatened me.

338
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,084
And I really didn't know what it was.

339
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:50,922
I know.

340
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,423
It's fine.

341
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,432
Damn, I'm starving.

342
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,200
Is it better that way?

343
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:35,216
-To die for, yeah?
-Oh, it's hot.

344
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,634
So hot!

345
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,309
Okay, then!

346
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,603
Si-eun, one for you too?

347
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,191
Eat it in one big bite
to really taste the meat.

348
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:54,819
You eat it.

349
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,612
Man.

350
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,741
No one's ever regretted listening to me.

351
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,410
Say, "Ah."

352
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:04,370
"Ah!"

353
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,707
Did you wash your hands?

354
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,709
Dammit.

355
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,460
This dude knows nothing.

356
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,921
Hands make the food taste better.

357
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,426
It's fine. "Ah!" Come on.

358
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,304
"Ah."

359
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,517
How is it? To die for, right?

360
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,435
Yeah?

361
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,021
Right?

362
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,401
It's really tasty.

363
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,111
Right? You'll have to come back!

364
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,905
-Can I?
-Yeah.

365
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,622
FATHER: WHERE ARE YOU?
DIDN'T YOU GO TO CRAM SCHOOL?

366
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,565
SU-HO, THAT WAS SO TASTY
LET'S GO AGAIN

367
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:22,657
SU-HO, FOLLOW ME BACK ON INSTAGRAM

368
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,930
If you get a lot of business experience,

369
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:50,101
there are many opportunities
to make money in our country.

370
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,018
DELIVERY ORDER

371
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,187
I'm a real estate agent, but--

372
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,658
Next, I'm going to talk about
indeterminate equations.

373
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:10,204
These are a core part
of high school mathematics,

374
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,000
and it's a concept used
in all areas of mathematics.

375
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,836
We'll take a closer look today.

376
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,879
Now, indeterminate equations.

377
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,924
So why do we call this
an indeterminate equation?

378
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:27,430
It's an equation
that doesn't have a fixed solution.

379
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,223
Why is it like this?

380
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:33,519
There isn't just a single solution,

381
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:37,481
and it's hard to say
that one of them is the answer.

382
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,027
To solve this equation…

383
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:57,877
Fucking bastard.

384
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,838
Who was it?

385
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,714
ALL NAMES, PLACES, AND EVENTS SHOWN
ARE FICTIONAL

386
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:50,299
ANY SIMILARITY TO REALITY IS COINCIDENTAL

387
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,053
