1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,980
So this is the place?

2
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:23,815
Yeah.

3
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,446
Seeing this place in person
makes me nervous.

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,865
Those Union punks

5
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,993
will seriously outnumber us too.

6
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:37,871
Hey, kid.

7
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,915
Why worry when you have me?

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,127
I don't care how many there are.
Those punks are dead meat.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,298
Hey, you fucking idiot.
You can't beat them by yourself.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,259
Let's push the date out.

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,595
What?

12
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,974
We need time to prepare if we want to win.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,438
Who's the person

14
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,525
Na Baek-jin trusts most in the Union?

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,120
Hey.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,914
Back then,

17
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,085
when you fucking stabbed my foot,

18
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,963
I had to get a tetanus shot.

19
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,510
I'm sorry about that.

20
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,015
Aren't you fucking sentimental?

21
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,392
Anyway,

22
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,354
your theory is

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,525
that the Union has a burner account,

24
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,778
and I have access to it.

25
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,864
And you want me to give it to you?

26
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,995
Well, what the fuck do I get out of this?

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,624
You could take the blame for everything.

28
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:09,879
If the Union collapses,
the evidence of their crimes disappears.

29
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,882
Wouldn't that benefit you?

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,180
I knew it when I first saw you.

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,974
You're a fucking lunatic.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,978
Okay.

33
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,647
Deal.

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,324
Where are you going?

35
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,163
I need to study

36
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,666
the Union and Na Baek-jin.

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,555
EUNJANG (UNKNOWN) VS UNION (300 PEOPLE?)
EUNJANG IS OUTNUMBERED, MUST DIVIDE UNION

38
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:10,023
CONVERT INSIDER: CHOI HYO-MAN

39
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,275
Choi Hyo-man.

40
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,278
I need your help.

41
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,658
Here is the evidence I got from Seong-je.

42
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,162
Spread this to the Union members.

43
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,081
NOV 19, BAEK DONG-HA, 3,115,000 WON
NOV 18, KWON HYEOK-JIN, 2,250,000 WON

44
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,999
Look at this.

45
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,126
-We might be fucked.
-What?

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,170
-Na Baek-jin took the money.
-What?

47
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,671
Fucking crazy punks.

48
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,131
Shit.

49
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
Hey, fuck this.

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,300
Is this real?

51
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,135
It's like you said.

52
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,596
The Union is kept together by money.

53
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,931
HE TOOK 100 MIL

54
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,308
Hey, it looks like Baek-jin
took the money and ran.

55
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,392
Let me see, dumbass.

56
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,978
Hey, he took the money and ran.

57
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,605
HYO-MAN:
YOU MORONS

58
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,482
-Man, I'm fucking jealous.
-Fuck my life.

59
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,484
What the fuck is this?

60
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,110
Money brought them together.

61
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,239
Money can easily break them apart.

62
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:01,908
So…

63
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,993
HYO-MAN:
WE COULD GET FUCKED FOR THIS

64
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,495
…do what you're good at.

65
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:29,102
Do you really think jumping rope
will help you get stronger?

66
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,521
You've got bad knees already, man.

67
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,111
I have to do something, you punk.

68
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,324
You think too much, man.

69
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,165
You're the one who thinks too much.

70
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,251
What?

71
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,421
You're worried about him.

72
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,090
Na Baek-jin.

73
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,224
Whoa. Hey, is this your place?

74
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:10,768
Yeah.

75
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,521
Wow. It's freaking huge and fancy.

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,774
My house is a speck of dust next to this.

77
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,113
Hey, a basketball hoop.

78
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,449
You can play, right?

79
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,705
The loser buys drinks.

80
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,708
What are you doing? Hurry up!

81
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,107
The padded jackets you sent for the kids.

82
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:00,985
Thank you.

83
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,988
They were really happy.

84
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,658
I'm glad.

85
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,373
Baek-jin.

86
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:17,960
Every month,

87
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,005
you send gifts and donations.

88
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,801
You don't need to do that.

89
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,929
Until now,

90
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,349
I haven't asked where the money came from.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,685
But I'm starting to get worried.

92
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,780
I'll rest up a bit before I go.

93
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,222
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

94
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,748
Is this everyone?

95
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,084
No idea. Those assholes all bailed.

96
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,714
You know, some of the boys said
our burner account got exposed.

97
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,635
Is everything okay with us?

98
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,391
Yeon Si-eun.

99
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,908
SEONG-JE: THE EVIDENCE AGAINST NA BAEK-JIN
SEEMS TO BE IN THE UNION OFFICE

100
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
LET'S GRAB IT NOW WHILE IT'S EMPTY

101
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,057
Hey, boys!

102
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,150
Hey.

103
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,360
The weather fucking sucks, huh?

104
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,113
You should have checked the weather.

105
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,948
My shoes are getting wet.

106
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,493
Hey, water sports are
always more fun, you punk.

107
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,246
Let's go!

108
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,586
Where's Si-eun?

109
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,754
His phone is busy.

110
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,255
Really?

111
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,425
He must have met up with Baku first.

112
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,556
EUNJANG HIGH, LET'S GO
-BAKU-

113
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,558
Hey! Why didn't you come sooner?

114
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,978
You've got to take this more seriously.

115
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,272
Well…

116
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,861
Are you ready to smash
these Union punks or what?

117
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,781
Seriously, what's your deal?

118
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,159
Last time, you were trying
to sell off Eunjang to the Union.

119
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,537
-Decided to fix your reputation?
-What's this bullshit?

120
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:08,292
The other day, Yeon Si-eun
asked for my help, just this one time.

121
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,003
But I never forgave you.

122
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,175
I won't forgive…

123
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,263
all the wrongs you did to us.

124
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,100
The ways you bullied us.

125
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,394
I don't forgive you.

126
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,941
But right now, we need you.

127
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,160
Let's go.

128
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,454
Damn.

129
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,750
Let's go.

130
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,011
Shit.

131
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,107
What's going on? Why are you so early?

132
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,484
It's not that urgent.

133
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,159
Shit.

134
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,919
This is our burner phone.

135
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,464
All the transactions are on the app here.

136
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,466
This is the original.

137
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,636
You'll need something big like this
to finish Baek-jin.

138
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,770
Why are you trying so hard?

139
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,155
If you don't want anyone else hurt,
you'll have to be the one that does.

140
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,534
Relax.

141
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,870
Relax.

142
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,747
You know, it was weird.

143
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,876
It felt like I became a good guy.

144
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,506
But I just wanna have fun like this.

145
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,404
There's Baku!

146
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,202
You're so eager to fight
that you rushed over.

147
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,166
Thanks a lot for coming.

148
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,884
Where's Si-eun?

149
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,344
What?

150
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,557
His phone was busy,
so I thought he was with you.

151
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,481
YEON SI-EUN:
I'M STOPPING BY THE BOWLING CLUB

152
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,692
Si-eun went to the bowling club.

153
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,952
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message after the…

154
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,412
His phone is off.

155
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,499
Shit. Do you think the Union punks
are pulling something?

156
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,795
I'll go check the bowling club.

157
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,882
You two should stay here.

158
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
I'll do what I can.

159
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:52,725
Please do.

160
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,351
Okay.

161
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,883
Na Baek-jin!

162
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,181
If you lose today,

163
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,059
that's the end of the Union.

164
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,436
Understood?

165
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:24,942
Kill them all.

166
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,993
I'll take care of Na Baek-jin.

167
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,328
You guys handle the rest.

168
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,251
Okay!

169
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,090
Let's go!

170
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,534
Hey, fucker!

171
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,202
You asshole!

172
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,009
How the fuck do I do this?

173
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,139
You fucking…

174
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,397
Well, you're a fun little shit.

175
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,362
Thank you.

176
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,003
Si-eun!

177
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,797
Are you okay?

178
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,675
How did you get here?

179
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,719
Let's get out of here first.

180
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,443
Try that again,
and I'll kill you, you fucking moron!

181
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,570
Son of a bitch!

182
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,697
Hey, you're done, asshole.

183
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,822
Jun-tae, are you okay?

184
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,825
I'm fine.

185
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,828
Hurry. Let's go.

186
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,546
You go first. I'll follow.

187
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,591
-Let's go to a hospital.
-No.

188
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,468
No way. I'm really fine.

189
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,512
You go ahead.

190
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,433
You need to go

191
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,686
and help the kids stop fighting.

192
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,263
Just stay down.

193
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,347
Fuck.

194
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,601
Don't be fucking ridiculous, punk.

195
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,105
Fucking hell.

196
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,811
-Hey!
-Fucking asshole!

197
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,396
Fucking asshole!

198
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,067
Fucker. Really?

199
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,155
You punk. Fucking asshole.

200
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,240
Motherfucker!

201
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,994
You jerk. Fucking asshole.

202
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,913
Come on!

203
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,297
You weak-ass shit!

204
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,840
Stop coming at me!

205
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,385
Hey, Baek-jin.

206
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,429
You've improved a lot.

207
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,850
But this is not why I taught you.

208
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,852
Shit, man.

209
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,688
Let me end this.

210
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,856
It hurts, doesn't it?

211
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,800
Baek-jin.

212
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052
Are you all right?

213
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,816
Hey, why do you get
beaten up all the time?

214
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,947
Hold your fists tightly.

215
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't look away.

216
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,595
Hey!

217
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,598
Na Baek-jin won!

218
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,559
That's enough!

219
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,271
It's all over, you punks!

220
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,025
Fucking stop fighting! Baek-jin won!

221
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,236
Na Baek-jin won!

222
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,499
From now on…

223
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,091
Eunjang is part of the Union.

224
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,346
If you…

225
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,103
cannot accept this decision…

226
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,774
then step forward.

227
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,736
Who's next?

228
00:28:59,028 --> 00:28:59,946
Fuck.

229
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,452
Come out, you fucking assholes!

230
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,957
Oh yeah, you.

231
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,086
Yeon Si-eun.

232
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,681
What's wrong?

233
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,436
You've done a lot of talking.

234
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,564
Are you too scared to actually fight?

235
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,238
Right now, no one here is talking

236
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,532
except for you.

237
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,302
You fucking asshole.

238
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,950
Nice job!

239
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,511
Yeon Si-eun.

240
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,770
You told Baku to go for my arms,
didn't you?

241
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,192
Arms and then legs?

242
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,654
What's your next move?

243
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,243
How wide is the margin of error, asshole?

244
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:08,583
We're in it.

245
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,586
What?

246
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,381
We're in my margin of error.

247
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,094
Your limbs are done.

248
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,027
If you happen to lose,

249
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,321
I'll step in.

250
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,244
Get back up.

251
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,957
I'll hold out until then somehow.

252
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:51,894
-Hey.
-We won.

253
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,617
Baek-jin.

254
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,125
I'm sorry.

255
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,756
But…

256
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,637
you should be sorry too.

257
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,373
The fight

258
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,251
is now over!

259
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,716
Let's go!

260
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,426
-Let's go!
-Nice job!

261
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,735
Hey, that hurts!

262
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,695
Let's go eat!

263
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,531
Do you know who I fought?

264
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,329
So what did I do then?

265
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,332
I did a foot sweep and got him! For real!

266
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,629
For crying out loud, listen to me!

267
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,715
Jun-tae!

268
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,754
We slept like crazy.

269
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,554
It was as if we were
catching up on our sleep.

270
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,893
You can't tease me about basketball now.

271
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,352
Tell him that story.

272
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,562
So embarrassing.

273
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,023
It was just yesterday. Just one mistake.

274
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,024
Hey!

275
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,692
Yeon Si-eun!

276
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,491
You slowpoke.

277
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,786
And we became seniors.

278
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,623
Hey, this photo looks great.

279
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,125
CHOI HYO-MAN FOR STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT
THE TOUGH GUY WHO UNITED EUNJANG

280
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,630
After that,

281
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,383
there were rumors
that Na Baek-jin disappeared.

282
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,679
No one had any idea…

283
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,559
where he had gone.

284
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,563
Will Na Baek-jin…

285
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,526
now get the right answer

286
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,196
to the question he had gotten wrong?

287
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,999
Why are you so lost in thought?

288
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,133
It was nothing.

289
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,265
Man, the weather is nice.

290
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,308
Peaceful.

291
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,810
Why don't you pass it?

292
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,646
That was close!

293
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,237
Nice!

294
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,738
Hello?

295
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:47,708
Go on.

296
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,464
How's it going?

297
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,351
Good.

298
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,359
Who are those guys?

299
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,199
My friends.

300
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,045
That's good to see.

301
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,495
So you're Baek-jin's friend?

302
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:36,877
Yes.

303
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,588
Well, something like that.

304
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,311
We need someone

305
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,688
to replace Baek-jin.

306
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,069
CHEONGANG

307
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,988
Not for children's games
like this bowling club.

308
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,492
Is it fun over there?

309
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,120
Making money isn't fun. It's hard work.

310
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,796
That's not very romantic.

311
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,475
By the way. Baek-jin…

312
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,771
Do you know where he is?

313
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,191
I can't reach that fucking asshole.

314
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,027
I don't know.

315
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,612
I'm curious too.

316
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:59,042
CHEONGANG

317
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:34,870
THE LATE NA BAEK-JIN

318
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:57,924
