1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,260
And who are you?

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,097
I've never seen you before.

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,143
You've got a lot of guts.

4
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,445
Hey, move it. Go on.

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,404
Damn, move.

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,657
Hey, Gotak, are you alive?

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,577
-I'm dead, dumbass.
-You okay?

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,619
Just go.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,662
Go where?

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,542
-Go to him, fucking assholes.
-You should be training with the team.

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,252
What is all this?

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,047
What? Training?

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:51,051
Hey, we can't even compete
in the tournament because of you.

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,261
What are you saying, dumbass?

15
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,056
We can't compete
because you got suspended.

16
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,059
You stupid dumbass. Fuck.

17
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,101
Fuck! Really?

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,811
Are you sure?

19
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,857
Man, I shouldn't have dyed my hair.

20
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,693
-This won't come out for a while.
-You asshole!

21
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,531
What? Are you that happy to see me?
You too?

22
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,991
-My arm!
-Hey, you too?

23
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:18,661
Fucking asshole!

24
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,797
I don't care if you act out
and bully other kids,

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,716
but no fighting
while wearing the Eunjang uniform.

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,803
No fighting, okay?
Repeat after me. No fighting!

27
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,262
No fighting.

28
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,182
That's it! Now beat it. Scram.

29
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,934
Go!

30
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,519
-You started it.
-Let's go. Go on.

31
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,188
-Let's go.
-Hey, you said Hyo-man would win.

32
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,189
I didn't know.

33
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,524
Si-eun, here you go.

34
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608
Are you okay?

35
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,319
Thanks.

36
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,739
Hey, Si-eun.

37
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,914
I think I might have got the wrong idea.

39
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,543
Hey.

40
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,963
You don't sound sincere
when you start with "I think."

41
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,174
I'm sorry! My dear Gotak is very flawed!

42
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,801
-But--
-Let go of me, man, please!

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,219
He's not a bad kid!

44
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,016
Si-eun, where are you going?

45
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,563
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.

46
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,691
Si-eun, you can't just leave.

47
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,570
Oh wow. Such courtesy
is rarely found at Eunjang.

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,073
Hey, dumbass.
Who are you impersonating now?

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,533
My dad. Didn't you get it?

50
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,454
Anyway, that timing was crazy.

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,124
I mean,

52
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,626
if Hu-min hadn't shown up…

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,091
You ruined someone's life.
Don't pretend you're a nice guy.

54
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,928
You fucking hypocrite.

55
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,395
I guess…

56
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,567
you must have felt bad
after Hyun-tak said that weird stuff.

57
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,530
Everyone just likes
to talk behind other people's backs.

58
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,365
Don't worry about the rumor.

59
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,410
It's not a rumor.

60
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,746
What?

61
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,337
That's why I decided never to fight.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,677
Never again.

63
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,622
WEAK HERO:
CLASS 2

64
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,430
11TH GRADE, CLASS 7
09 - PARK HU-MIN

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,895
-Baku!
-Hey there!

66
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,648
Hey, nice to see you! Hello!

67
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,984
Hey, put out that cigarette! You punk.

68
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,277
-Baku!
-Hey there!

69
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,364
How have you been?
I'll see you at the canteen later.

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,408
Hey, what's this? You lost weight!

71
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,660
How's it going?

72
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,712
Everyone, freeze!

73
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:41,841
Baku.

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,511
-Leave these kids alone.
-It's Baku.

75
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,388
Is this the World Cup Stadium?

76
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,808
You kick balls outside.
What are you doing?

77
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,937
You're right. We should be outside.

78
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,022
-Right, guys?
-Yeah.

79
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,857
-We should go outside.
-Right.

80
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,235
Okay! Let's all get along, yeah?

81
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,820
Hey, man, isn't that right?

82
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,988
Go to class now.

83
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,033
Hurry back to the classroom.
Get ready for class. Go on.

84
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,496
Baku!

85
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,338
You son of a bitch. Baku!

86
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,301
Ganghak High doesn't play basketball.
What they do is closer to martial arts!

87
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,721
Why do we have to play a practice game
with those assholes?

88
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,934
There are all kinds of teams out there.

89
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,435
A true master

90
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,396
doesn't care who he plays.

91
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,898
If there are all kinds of teams out there,

92
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,025
then we can play a different team.

93
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,820
Let's avoid causing problems.
If someone gets hurt--

94
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,154
You chicken.

95
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,533
You moron.

96
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,203
You scored 99 on the IQ test.
Are you a monkey?

97
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,081
-Or a dolphin?
-I'll kill you.

98
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,126
I just couldn't finish
the test in time, dumbass.

99
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,378
This punk ran out of time!

100
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,713
You ran out of time, did you now?

101
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,341
Only idiots run out of time on an IQ test.

102
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,885
Mr. Gotak. You're all grown up now.

103
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,887
All grown up? I've always been taller.

104
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,431
I'll kill you, you jerk!

105
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,850
-Hey!
-Hey, you're killing him.

106
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,767
Stop it!

107
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,063
What's this?

108
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,941
Are we under attack?

109
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,488
We're wanted in the teachers' office.

110
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,073
You're right.

111
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,576
That did happen at the underpass.

112
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,245
But that's an exaggeration--

113
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,957
Everyone who hangs out
with Choi Hyo-man is absent today.

114
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,293
Don't you think that's strange?

115
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,880
There were some kids who saw the fight.

116
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,174
That's news to me.

117
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,432
-"That's news to see," dumbass.
-That's news to see, idiot.

118
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,601
Man, you really have an IQ of 99.

119
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,519
-How dumb are you?
-Shut it, dumbass.

120
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,729
-Moron.
-Hey, be quiet.

121
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,814
Take it.

122
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,734
YOUTH CULTURAL VOLUNTEERS WANTED

123
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,777
You're going to do some volunteer work.

124
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,362
And you'll still get demerits.

125
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,781
Hey, this isn't fair.

126
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,075
What about Hyo-man and the others?

127
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,036
They started the fight!

128
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:15,953
Hey!

129
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,623
Does this sound like a debate to you?

130
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,752
You punks.

131
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,504
It's true.

132
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,593
Hyo-man and the others started the fight.
We were just--

133
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,511
Yeon Si-eun.

134
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,055
Did these kids rub off on you?

135
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,974
You punks have got to be kidding me.

136
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,768
We're so sorry, Teach!

137
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,436
We'll work hard volunteering!

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,065
I'll keep the basketball team
out of trouble from now on.

139
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,735
Once again, as team captain,
I sincerely apologize!

140
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,451
Damn, volunteer work?

141
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,787
Aren't you pissed?

142
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,289
Is it okay to let Hyo-man off the hook?

143
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:04,627
When I breathe the air in that office,
I get dizzy. I almost threw up.

144
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,338
And you did get in a fight.
What did I say about fighting?

145
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:11,008
Those punks started it, Baku. Damn.

146
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,093
Hey, friend.

147
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,765
Tell him, Gotak.

148
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,267
Right now?

149
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,851
You should say something.

150
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,272
He sided with you
in the teachers' office, right?

151
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,402
Well,

152
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:31,696
I'm sorry

153
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,781
about yesterday.

154
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,160
For saying weird stuff and getting angry.

155
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,537
I'm sorry too.

156
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,831
What?

157
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,666
For yesterday.

158
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,459
I'm also sorry.

159
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,380
What's this?

160
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,175
It feels like you've made up,
but then again, not really.

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,093
Hey.

162
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,262
I'm not on your team.

163
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,851
And don't touch my head.

164
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
What are you going to do? Huh?

165
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,197
What are you going to do about it?

166
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,326
What now? What will you do?

167
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,493
What the hell?

168
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,247
Dude, what's so annoying about this?

169
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:26,751
Like this, yeah? You can do this to me.

170
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,710
-Hey!
-Like this.

171
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
Baku, what's with you today?

172
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,464
Know when to stop.

173
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,673
-Damn.
-Hey, man.

174
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,635
You try being suspended, kid.
It's fucking boring.

175
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,179
I wanted to eat pizza so bad
that I almost cried.

176
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,474
-Why did you get yourself suspended, then?
-Let's go get pizza!

177
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:46,270
Hey, let's go together, guys.
Gotak is buying today!

178
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,521
-Over there!
-Mark him!

179
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,856
Okay!

180
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,610
-He seems kind of odd, doesn't he?
-Save some energy!

181
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,279
But it's peaceful, thanks to Baku.

182
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,074
Baku protects all of us.

183
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,285
There's this thing.

184
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,704
It's called the Union.

185
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,042
All the schools near ours
belong to this union of delinquents.

186
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,753
There's a rumor that

187
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,006
Na Baek-jin of Yeoil High,

188
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,634
Geum Seong-je of Ganghak High,

189
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,681
Do Seong-mok and Baek Dong-ha
of Yeonsung High,

190
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,978
and many others
have been operating like a real gang.

191
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,693
Choi Hyo-man has been stealing phones
so he can get into the Union.

192
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:39,115
But Hu-min said he wasn't interested
in things like that anymore.

193
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,659
So Eunjang was the only school
that didn't join.

194
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,622
After that, Union kids would go after
anyone in an Eunjang uniform,

195
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,583
picking fights or taking their money.

196
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,880
So Hu-min got pissed off
and beat up everyone in the Union.

197
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,677
I heard the Union members
didn't stand a chance and were smashed.

198
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,141
Baku did that to protect all of us.

199
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,144
As the king of Eunjang.

200
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,982
Anyway,

201
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,192
he fought, didn't he?

202
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,988
Hey, Si-eun! Jun-tae!

203
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,073
Come play with us! Come on!

204
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,992
Hey, dumbass, leave them alone.

205
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,666
I don't want to nag you,

206
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,337
but you should behave
so the teacher doesn't have to call me.

207
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,595
It's not that I don't trust you.

208
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,389
I'm just worried.

209
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,434
What happened before

210
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,021
should never happen again.

211
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,026
Tell me you're not

212
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,154
hanging out with bad kids again.

213
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,255
-Great job.
-Thank you.

214
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,674
-I told you to meet the quota.
-Thank you.

215
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,926
-Good job.
-Thank you.

216
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,095
-How can I face Baek-jin like this?
-Thank you.

217
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,555
-Don't have enough?
-Thank you.

218
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,517
-Make up the rest by stealing, assholes.
-Thank you.

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,476
Sorry, sir!

220
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,692
Hey, move it.

221
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,741
These Eunjang sons of bitches.

222
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,703
We should just kill them all.

223
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,586
Baek-jin wants to see you.

224
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,672
Let's go.

225
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,716
GEUM SEONG-JE

226
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,844
What was his name?

227
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,304
Choi Hyo-man.

228
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,561
That idiot didn't bring in enough cash
and lost all the phones he collected.

229
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,815
I heard he was beaten by Baku.

230
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,902
I shouldn't have trusted that punk
in the first place.

231
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,238
With Baku there, Eunjang is a no-go.

232
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,616
Baek-jin.

233
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,789
I'll do whatever I can to fix this.
Just give me a little more time--

234
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
Shut the fuck up, dumbass!

235
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,960
You got rejected by the Union.

236
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,130
If we gave you more time,
what could you do?

237
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,634
Baek-jin, how should we handle this?

238
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,228
Baek-jin, please.

239
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,731
Don't do this. Baek-jin, please wait.

240
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,983
-Baek-jin, please!
-Hurry up. Let's go.

241
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,569
-Baek-jin!
-Hurry up!

242
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,578
Seong-je.

243
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,248
Let's check up on Park Hu-min.

244
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,543
Baku?

245
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,629
Sounds good.

246
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,256
I could use some action.

247
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,091
Okay.

248
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,138
SEOUL MUSEUM OF HISTORY

249
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,975
-Look over here.
-Smile.

250
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,727
-One, two, three.
-Show your teeth.

251
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,978
How about a peace sign?

252
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:41,398
This king's expression is weird.
I don't like it.

253
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,278
Could you angels give me just one chance?

254
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,158
I've heard there are precious treasures
hidden somewhere in here,

255
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,660
and I think I've found them.

256
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:53,577
They're you!

257
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,788
What? What's with him? Seriously.

258
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,501
Why don't you just let my heart rest?

259
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,795
It's racing.

260
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,758
Stop stuffing your face.
You didn't even work that hard today.

261
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,844
Hey! Listen up.

262
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,346
Hey.

263
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,975
Some girls from Buil Girls' High
gave me their numbers.

264
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,894
Should I ask them out for dinner?

265
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,939
Give me a break.
There's no way they'd go, idiot.

266
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,482
Then how about this?

267
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,193
If I set up dinner with them,

268
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,862
you have to pay for it. Deal?

269
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,908
-Deal! If you fail, dinner is on you.
-It's a deal.

270
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,410
-Okay.
-No take-backs!

271
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,161
-Pick something to eat.
-You're dead.

272
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,288
It'll be expensive. You're dead, man.

273
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,206
Hey, damn.

274
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,002
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

275
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,338
Please check the number and try again.

276
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,718
Cell phone numbers
are usually eight digits, aren't they?

277
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,803
But what's this? One, two, three…

278
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,264
It's nine digits!

279
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,682
Hey, give it back, punk!

280
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,809
"Hey, give it back, punk!" Are you mad?

281
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,312
This seven is a mistake.

282
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,106
She put two sevens instead of one.

283
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,315
-Sure.
-That's it.

284
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,526
-You're really dead now.
-Sure, try again.

285
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,069
You are seriously dead!

286
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,655
-Do it, then. Go ahead.
-I knew it was odd.

287
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,908
No, you jerk. Put it on speakerphone.

288
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
You've reached Seonheung Finance--

289
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,832
I'm sorry. Wrong number.

290
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,461
You've got a mouth on you.

291
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,378
-Hey, man.
-I'll…

292
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,921
I'm really fucking sorry…

293
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,139
Buldak sauce is really hard to get out.

294
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,682
Hey, Jun-tae.

295
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,642
Take the chopsticks from Si-eun.

296
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,479
I heard he stabs people
with chopsticks and stuff.

297
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,148
Si-eun, put it away. It was an accident.

298
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,316
It's not my fault.

299
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,234
I'm going to the restroom.

300
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,682
Are you Baku's friend?

301
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:36,323
You know, you'll screw up your life
if you hang out with the wrong crowd.

302
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,414
Here it is.

303
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,667
Now, look here.

304
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,045
One, two, three.

305
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,759
You have sad eyes, don't you?

306
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,056
Do you know who I am?

307
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,196
Man, this punk…

308
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,619
won't look away.

309
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,642
You're not bad.

310
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,816
What?

311
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,235
You want to bash my skull in?

312
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,365
I just came to say hi today,
so let's stop here.

313
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,784
I'll see you later.

314
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,833
I'll beat the shit out of you next time.

315
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,179
My stomach hurts because of you!

316
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,722
-No way.
-I'm off to the can!

317
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,307
-Go ahead.
-Hear me out.

318
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,350
What's up with him?

319
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,102
How many dumps do you take in a day?

320
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,187
I'm going to die.

321
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,194
What?

322
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,492
Hey, Baku.

323
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,912
What? Are you a fucking woodcutter?

324
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,997
Why are you here?

325
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,583
Why do you think?

326
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,044
I wanted to see how you were.

327
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,966
But I ran across an unfamiliar face,

328
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,677
so I said a little hello.

329
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,053
What?

330
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,855
I'll kill you.

331
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,739
Keep laughing

332
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,325
if you want to die.

333
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,331
You still don't want to join the Union?

334
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,251
Every school is in it
except fucking Eunjang.

335
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,961
Fuck this.

336
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,213
Aren't you tired of this?

337
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,131
I am.

338
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,967
I am tired of this.

339
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,513
But it seems Baek-jin isn't.

340
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,769
Anyway, I get it.

341
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,568
End your lovers' quarrel with Baek-jin
and try to get along.

342
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,082
Hey, are you okay?

343
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,126
Did you meet some weirdo?

344
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
Damn, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

345
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:23,800
What is?

346
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,515
What's your fault?

347
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,604
Nothing. Never mind.

348
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,567
AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC ABILITY

349
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,988
Next, we will present the award
for outstanding student achievement.

350
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,200
This student excelled
in the Academic Evaluation

351
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,702
for the second semester
of the 2023 academic year…

352
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,621
What? Why does he get an award?

353
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,414
What was his score?

354
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:59,169
His score? He only missed number 30
on the math portion. The trick question.

355
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,546
Wow, that's insane.

356
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,592
We hereby present this award
to Na Baek-jin of Yeoil High School.

357
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,917
DONGMYEONG BANK
DEPOSITED: 12,435,000 WON

358
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,669
DEPOSITED: 7,435,000 WON

359
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,008
Baek-jin, we took care of
the collected phones.

360
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,345
As you know, only Eunjang was left out.

361
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,056
But that loser somehow
managed to meet his quota.

362
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,810
And he called and said
he wanted to talk in person.

363
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,943
It's a hassle, but you should meet him.
I'll send the address.

364
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,690
-Hey, what is this? Where is he?
-What?

365
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,774
Find him.

366
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,736
Damn, it's locked.

367
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,862
He's not there?

368
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,530
Where is that son of a bitch?

369
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,616
Are you sure he came this way?

370
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,575
What the fuck?

371
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,328
-Not there?
-Nah.

372
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,788
-Fuck, where did he go?
-What the hell?

373
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,082
-Seriously?
-Shit.

374
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,083
What the…

375
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,336
Hey.

376
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:25,607
What is it?

377
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,734
"What is it"?

378
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,029
Hey.

379
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:36,284
Do you just fucking use people
and toss them when you're done?

380
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,665
I fucking did what you told me to,
you son of a bitch.

381
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,085
Hey, Baek-jin.

382
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,837
I know about you.

383
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,757
I hear all you fucking do is study.

384
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,345
You hide behind Geum Seong-je
because you can't fucking fight.

385
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,597
The only punching you do
is on a calculator.

386
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,892
Are you listening?

387
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:08,316
A petty trickster like you
doesn't deserve to lead the Union.

388
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,818
That's what I'm saying.

389
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,368
A set of brass knuckles. Two steel pipes.
The loudmouth is last.

390
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,330
What are you waiting for? Get him!

391
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,129
You asshole!

392
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,220
Shit!

393
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,045
Hey, you son of a bitch!

394
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,903
Come better prepared next time.

395
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,134
SEONG-JE: NEW FACES APPEARED.
ONE'S A WUSS, AND ONE'S NOT BAD

396
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,469
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

397
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,279
Why did my energy run out so fast?
I'm hungry.

398
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,449
Man, let's go eat! It's on me!

399
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,992
-Yeah!
-Awesome!

400
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,619
Bullshit. He isn't buying.

401
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,204
-He said he would.
-He won't.

402
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,040
Hey, knock it off.
It's a good place. Really good.

403
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,583
-You heard of Michelin?
-Bullshit!

404
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,335
-It's all good!
-He isn't paying.

405
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,754
-He won't pay, really.
-I need to go.

406
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,089
What?

407
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,175
Why? You said you'd eat with us.

408
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,762
I did? When?

409
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,930
No, but…

410
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,726
Oh, he's right.

411
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,771
But you should come. We worked hard today.

412
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,732
I have plans.

413
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,150
I see.

414
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,153
Man, you'll regret it.

415
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,155
You can go, but next time is on you.

416
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,406
Take care!

417
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,490
-Go on.
-See you.

418
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,493
Anyway, he isn't paying.

419
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,787
Seriously, what is going on?

420
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:09,956
Hey, it is my treat!

421
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:13,668
BAKU CHICKEN

422
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,131
This comes out of your allowance.

423
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,133
These are your son's friends. Can't you--

424
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,010
Then you fry the chicken, punk.

425
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,141
Freeloader.

426
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,237
Hey, it's fine. Dig in.

427
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,989
Eat! Jun-tae, have a drumstick.

428
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,491
-Okay.
-Let's eat.

429
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,704
Oh yeah.

430
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,664
What did Jun-tae do?

431
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,582
What?

432
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,042
What happened at school?

433
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,463
Oh, right. You know Hyo-man was
stealing phones and money from the kids.

434
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,756
Then Jun-tae

435
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,512
got it all back and returned everything
to all the kids in school.

436
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,226
Hey, isn't that fucking dope?

437
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,316
Jun-tae, this guy here.

438
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,277
He's got some guts.

439
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,743
Hey, Jun-tae! You're really cool.

440
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,246
Oh no, I just

441
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,748
followed Si-eun's advice.

442
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,291
What? What did he say?

443
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,627
Well, it was…

444
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,172
Do you know Newton's third law?

445
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,049
…Newton's third law.

446
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,176
The law of action and reaction.

447
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,137
For every good action,
a good reaction follows.

448
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,645
Oh! U-turn's law! Yeah!

449
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,148
No idea what that is, but it sounds cool.

450
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,693
-I'm going to use that later.
-Sure.

451
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,864
That Si-eun guy,

452
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,368
I heard he had to transfer to our school
for causing serious trouble.

453
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,954
But he seems all right to me.

454
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,332
When I was getting beaten up
by Hyo-man, Si-eun saved me.

455
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,751
Si-eun is really nice.

456
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,507
Man, that bastard.

457
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,843
I hope he got home okay.

458
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,141
PATIENT'S NAME: AHN SU-HO
VISITOR: YEON SI-EUN

459
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,560
RELATIONSHIP TO PATIENT: FRIEND

460
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,489
Hello?

461
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,200
Yeon Si-eun? It's me, Hu-min.

462
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,330
What's up?

463
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,667
Nothing's up, man. Just checking
to make sure you got home okay.

464
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,545
So, nothing happened, right?

465
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,464
No one followed you or anything?

466
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,344
No, I just went home.

467
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,678
Really?

468
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,681
Hey, anyway,

469
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,352
you know how I was turned down
by those girls today?

470
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,354
Well, it occurred to me

471
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,231
that girls might be
into guys like you these days.

472
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,816
So what do you say?

473
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,570
Why don't we pick up chicks
together next time? Deal?

474
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,367
Why would I do that?

475
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,577
Okay, fine. Asshole.

476
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,885
I did some volunteer work today.

477
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,763
Once I got there,

478
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,808
it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

479
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,354
The weather was nice too.

480
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,190
More than anything,

481
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,319
it took my mind off things
for the first time in a while.

482
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,991
I wondered how that happened.

483
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,996
I think it was
because of the guys I was with.

484
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,360
So that's Ahn Su-ho.

485
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,404
Your friend.

486
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,409
The one whose life you ruined, right?

487
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:04,751
Why are you here?

488
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,169
What?

489
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,337
What are you gonna do?

490
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,602
Come with me for a second.

491
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,482
You shouldn't interrupt
your friend's sleep.

492
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,366
Damn, you have a real punchable face.

493
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,577
Just my type.

494
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,706
Hurry up, you fucking asshole.

495
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,906
