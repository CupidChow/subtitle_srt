1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,680
Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,920
Cool!

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,000
I was looking for more
creative ways to explore the world.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,480
That's when I thought
let's give Discovery a call!

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,320
As the creator
of this show what's your goal?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,240
As your movie director

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,000
I look forward to discovering

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,320
your true intention
behind this program.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,280
In the past few years

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,320
it seems like all
I had in mind was work.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,960
But over time, I began to feel

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,360
that I need to pay attention
to my own life.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,840
I thought I should just go do
what I've always wanted to,

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,240
and enjoy the process.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
Drop me some rope!

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,800
The process was indeed very painful.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,640
Aah.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,160
That's why it hurts.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,120
Whoa!

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
You will face
the extreme challenge of...

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,600
rock climbing.

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you ready?

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,520
Rock climbing is a challenge
both mentally and physically.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,560
Can I make it to the top
is part of the adventure.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,920
Where I reach my limits?

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm excited to find out.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,440
We must need
the courage to challenge it.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,280
This time I've come to
Yangshuo for rock climbing.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,640
It involves many movements,

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,080
and I want to learn
how to climb in a safe manner.

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,960
This time, a Bang is my teacher.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,520
He is a highly-skilled
and impressive rock climber.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,080
Everyone calls me Bang

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,680
I have been climbing for 19 years.

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,800
For this challenge we're taking
Yibo a complete beginner,

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,400
and guiding him
from setting the climbing route

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,280
to complete in the first ascent.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
To naming the route

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,280
is something that may have
never been done before in China,

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,520
and that will be meaningful
to attempt.

41
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,680
Grab it properly
then put your hands together.

42
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,840
I can step here
but I can't step on these.

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,520
One, two, three.
Extend your right hand.

44
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,280
Let's have a try. Come on.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,760
I haven't put
my hands together.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
One two go use
your another foot.

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
Hurry up.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,520
After this, hold this,
and then reach out.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, hold this. Hold this.

50
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,400
See?

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
This requires more
upper body strength.

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,600
And it's not a downward
grip it's a side grip.

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
Yes

54
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,400
Rock climbing targets muscles
that regular workouts might miss.

55
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,880
And that's my weakness.

56
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,240
It's not just leg strength

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,360
it relies also on the upper body
fingers and the core.

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's try something more challenging.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
Have you ever rock climbed before?

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,320
-When I was younger.
-When you are younger.

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,880
But it's just inside
the amusement parks.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,160
And then after
growing up you didn't?

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,920
I have no experience
climbing at all.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,440
Come to feel
how hard the rock it is.

65
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,440
Hang on it and step on it.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
This kind of rock wall
is a little painful to touch.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
-- Hurts your hands?
-- Right

68
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,320
After touching the rock
it feels quite sharp.

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
Wrapping tape around my fingers
seems to add a sense of security.

70
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,320
It makes it more comfortable.

71
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,480
I feel stronger.

72
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
Stronger?
That's just psychological.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
Yes, it's just a feeling.
I feel stronger.

74
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,840
It's really hard to start.

75
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,960
One two go,
step on your right foot steadily.

76
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,200
Step on your toes and undercling.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,000
Your left hand is too high,
go lower, there's a hole.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Undercling to grab the hole.

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,600
-- I can't undercling.
-- You can do this.

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,200
Look inside.

81
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,480
-- Yes, look carefully.
-- I see it.

82
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,000
Lift your right hand
and together with your feet.

83
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
Make sure to breathe.

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
If you don't,
you will feel very tired.

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,560
Ooh!

86
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
Nice.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960
Step back and jump.

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,640
It's okay to step back and jump.

89
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,640
Yay.

90
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,520
Great.

91
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
After one round I know
what kind of strength you lack.

92
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,240
Like the strength
of your core fingers,

93
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,480
upper limbs you need
to improve on them.

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,520
Next, we're going to open
a new climbing route

95
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,080
but we need a lot of
training before that.

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Do some rope operation.

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,600
Because of protection the top rope
will also add climbing.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
But before you go to training.

99
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,440
Let's look at our goals
for this challenge.

100
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Okay.

101
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,720
-- Come on.
-- Let's go.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,760
The sharpness
of the climbing holds on the rock

103
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,280
makes my fingers uncomfortable.

104
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,120
The pain makes me afraid
to grip or apply force.

105
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
I think it's inevitable.

106
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,440
Whether it's rock climbing or dancing
everybody gets the same injuries.

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
Your hands have to go through
blisters before they form calluses.

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
Only then will it stop hurting,

109
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
and you'll be able to
climb better the next time.

110
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
We definitely have
the courage to take on challenges.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,280
It's a given.

112
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,240
I feel that climbing is truly testing
the limits of my body.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,520
Climbing can be painful

114
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,200
because your hands are constantly
rubbing against the rock wall.

115
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,880
The technical preparation
and physical training involved

116
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,760
has challenged me a little bit.

117
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,680
Opening a new climbing route

118
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,280
and making the first ascent
is especially difficult.

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,040
Many climbers wouldn't dare
to even think about this for years.

120
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,760
Trying to do it in the short term
is a big challenge.

121
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,960
We're going to establish a route

122
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,800
on this side of the mountain
going straight up.

123
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
The total height is 110 meters.

124
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
Vertical rock wall.

125
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
Are you ready?

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
I don't know.

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,520
Yangshuo is the birthplace
of rock climbing in China.

128
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,520
Its unique karst landscape creates
a natural environment for climbing,

129
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,040
attracting enthusiasts from all over
the world to climb its terrain.

130
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,880
Oh. What a big platform.

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
-- How do you feel?
-- Comfortable.

132
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,840
-- Isn't it pretty?
-- Sure it is.

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Inside this cave we're mainly
learning top-rope belaying

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,280
lead belaying top-rope climbing
and lead climbing.

135
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,360
I just got introduced
to this equipment last time

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
and did a SRT descent.

137
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,760
I was not familiar
with the equipment.

138
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
When I was about to ascend
the leg loop suddenly came undone.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,040
How could it suddenly come undone?
It felt so tight.

140
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,800
After that, I got even more nervous

141
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,040
probably because I'm still new
to this equipment.

142
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,440
But when it comes to rock climbing
there's a sense of familiarity

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,600
so there isn't as much
mental pressure.

144
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,560
- We need to know.
- Helmet.

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,880
-We have to wear a helmet.
-Hm.

146
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,080
Safety belts,

147
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,280
alongside your chalk bag.

148
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,160
Magnesium powder bag.
Just make sure there's chalk.

149
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,760
The three types
of connections are crucial.

150
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,560
Quickdraw connection,
belay device connection,

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,360
rope connection.

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,200
-- Come on.
-- Let's Go.

153
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,000
This is the first step
for all beginners

154
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,960
top-rope climbing.

155
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,240
Do you think
this difficulty level is about

156
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,800
the same as bouldering
or is it harder?

157
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,960
Uh, actually, it's simple

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,240
but, because you don't know
where to grip

159
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,600
or wherever to step, it feels hard.

160
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,720
I'll climb it once and mark all
the points for you.

161
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,320
So you will know how to climb it.
It will be much easier.

162
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
You're in charge
of controlling the rope.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Tighten it.

164
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
In any case.

165
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,880
With top-roping LIU, there's already
a rope set up on our climbing route.

166
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,200
As you climb you don't need
to clip into quickdraws

167
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,880
you just need to keep climbing
and someone below will belay you.

168
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,880
This spot is okay.
That spot is not easy to hold.

169
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,400
There are a lot of available spots.
Feel free to step on it.

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
You don't have to pull
yourself up so much.

171
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,560
Move sideways.

172
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
It's hard to do these actions.

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,200
This is the top.

174
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,520
Good, now tighten.

175
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,280
When I want to come down,
just lower me slowly.

176
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,640
Right.

177
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,160
You need to put me down
to the ground very slowly.

178
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,600
Keep it at a steady pace.

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah.

180
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,760
Cool.

181
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,360
Footpoints are very important.

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,240
You can take a break
when you find a big hold.

183
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Okay.

184
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,680
All right. Let's go.

185
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,760
You can also hang your feet directly.
Either way.

186
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,080
-- Hang this.
-- Right.

187
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,680
Kick your left feet instead
of stepping on it.

188
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,960
Lift your right foot.
One, two, three.

189
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,800
Next, grab onto the hold above.

190
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I can't see the point.

191
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,080
Can't hang on to it.
I'm letting go.

192
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,160
Yes, it's fine.
You can let go at any time.

193
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,240
A little tired.

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,880
You have to breathe.
You have to remember.

195
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,960
You need to have your
own pace when climbing.

196
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,480
Right.

197
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Look above.

198
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,040
See it? It's easy to grab.

199
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,520
Next, grab this.

200
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Step up high with your right foot,
place it really high.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,040
You can step on this.

202
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,360
Where should I step up high?

203
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,760
Place your left foot
where your knee is then stand up.

204
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,680
Pull on this side,
it has a good hold.

205
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,600
-- Reach up here, right?
-- Yes, yes, go inward.

206
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,480
But make sure your foot
is steady.

207
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,120
Step in, that's it.

208
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,440
Lock it in, nice.

209
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,120
Yes, then position
that foot properly.

210
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,040
Wait.

211
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,400
I'm fine resting like this.

212
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
Go ahead, take a break for now.

213
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,160
My muscles have reached a point
of being pumped and swollen.

214
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,280
I don't have the strength
to grip anymore.

215
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,160
This hold is hard to grasp.

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
I can't hold onto it.

217
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
Breathe.

218
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,600
At that moment, my muscles
couldn't hold on any longer.

219
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,920
I couldn't hold on anymore.

220
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,960
Those climbholds. I don't have
the strength to hold them anymore.

221
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Why is rock climbing so difficult?

222
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Before starting the training...

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,760
...I didn't know
the difficulty of this route.

224
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
But I didn't reach the top,
I probably only made it halfway.

225
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,680
Some parts felt like
I didn't even climb them.

226
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,160
I feel like this task is much harder

227
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
than the previous ones.

228
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,280
When I was climb the snow mountain
after taking 10 steps,

229
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,960
I could rest for five minutes.

230
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,440
Once I recover, I can keep going.
But now my muscles are strained.

231
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,240
I need time to recover.
Otherwise, I don't have any strength.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
I'm starving to death
right now in this mountain.

233
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm going to make
delicious food for you.

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,080
You need to heat the pot first.

235
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,400
You're really good
at playing with fire.

236
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,960
Cut the carrot
and cook them in the pot.

237
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,400
-- Is it right?
-- Right.

238
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Slice the chicken thighs.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,080
The two of us
can't really cook.

240
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
I can tell already.

241
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
-- Really?
-- Yes.

242
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,720
Add more oil.

243
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,800
And then we will grill
the bamboo tube rice

244
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
-and eat it with our chicken thighs.
-Okay.

245
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,280
Add some oil.

246
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,160
With a little more oil,
it won't burn.

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Anyway, I think the chicken
thighs should be delicious.

248
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,480
The pot is burning
it's not a good pot.

249
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
I should have brought
a non-stick pan.

250
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,320
This pot feels like
it's going to be.

251
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,720
We are figuring out
how to cook together.

252
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,280
So who opened
the route we climbed today.

253
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,840
There is a guide book
that records all the information

254
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,880
about the 2,000 routes in Yangshuo.

255
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,160
Like who opened the routes,
where is it, who first ascended...

256
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,160
So next you have to remember.

257
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,240
We don't really create
the climbing routes.

258
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
The routes exist in nature.

259
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,640
We're just here to discover them

260
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,080
and then conquer them.

261
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,080
After we finish breakfast
we will continue.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,880
Today we are starting
lead climbing.

263
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Clipping the quickdraws
as the lead climber go up.

264
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,880
The first three clips
in lead climbing are very risky.

265
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,440
If you miss clipping the first one
falling means hitting the ground.

266
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,720
The belayer can't fully protect you
in those early moves.

267
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,000
I can actually see
the climbhold

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,680
but my current skill level

269
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,920
isn't enough to grip it firmly.

270
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,760
We don't need to grip it.

271
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,080
We can find a way.
You pull the quickdraw.

272
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Just hold onto the quickdraw

273
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,760
and clip it to the next anchor
and you'll be good.

274
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,000
Let me try.

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,560
Pull the quickdraw
and stand up right now.

276
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,800
I'll pull a little bit.
Stand up, and clip it.

277
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,720
Still a little far.
Still a little far.

278
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,600
You need to learn
how to clip the quickdraws.

279
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
Have you hung it.

280
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,880
Okay.

281
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
Yes.

282
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,520
Come on.

283
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,480
This is called a lead fall.

284
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Okay, descend now.

285
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,480
Okay.

286
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
Rappelling doesn't
use up physical strength

287
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,960
it only requires technique.

288
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,920
Yes, and it's one system you need
to get this system sorted out.

289
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,680
Once you have the understand
the sequre, you just go down.

290
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,560
But with rock climbing,
you have to go up

291
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
using your whole body's strength.

292
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
You use muscles that
you don't normally use.

293
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,920
Yes, that strength
has to be build up.

294
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,080
There's no way
I can gain the same strength

295
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,800
as him in just five days.

296
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,000
What kind of journey
does one have to go through

297
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,960
to calmly face the vulnerability
that comes with challenges?

298
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,160
First, I think it's important
to recognize your own abilities

299
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,280
understand yourself
and then plan each step.

300
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,680
Focus on where you can reach.

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,280
I'm not sure if staying
optimistic helps

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,680
but it might bring you
a bit closer to success.

303
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,160
Earlier, we let Yibo
get used to lead climbing.

304
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,520
Next, he'll climb a route

305
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,360
that's close to the difficulty level
of our main challenge.

306
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,800
Hopefully, this will give
him more experience.

307
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,120
This is the route
we're going to climb.

308
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,400
Just clip a quickdraw
to the top and then descend.

309
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes.

310
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,720
First, stand in this position

311
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,680
place your left foot high,
and clip the lower quickdraw first.

312
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
Nice.

313
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,880
The biggest challenge this time

314
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,640
is opening the route
and then making the first ascent.

315
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
Before that,
Yibo needs to learn lead climbing.

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,320
This is quite challenging.

317
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,760
But I believe he can do it.

318
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,040
Stand up first
and clip the quickdraw.

319
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,240
Place your left foot on a better
foothold find a good spot to step.

320
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,880
Rest up...

321
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,880
you're just one move away.

322
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
Keep going!

323
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
Above...

324
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
...bring your hands together,
switch feet.

325
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,320
Yes, switch feet,
bring up your right foot.

326
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,760
Steady your right foot,
just inside there.

327
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
Step securely, combine your hands.

328
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
Bring up your left foot,
reach out with your right hand,

329
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,800
and stand up.

330
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,800
Keep it up!
Right hand, to the right.

331
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,360
You can grab on the right side.

332
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,480
Come on.

333
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Right hand on the right side.

334
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,040
Yes.

335
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Stand up and clip the quickdraw.

336
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Nice.

337
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,160
-Got it clipped?
-Yes.

338
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Whoa!

339
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,320
Awesome.

340
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,280
The view is so good.

341
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,440
I was actually going to
suggest you give it another try

342
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,680
but you nailed it in one go.

343
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,600
All right.

344
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,680
That was genuinely impressive.

345
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,000
This time,
I really enjoyed it, it was fun.

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,400
-- You had fun.
-- Right.

347
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,400
I see your tape is all gone.

348
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,840
It feels like the grip is better.

349
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,480
I completely forgot about the pain.

350
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,200
Right now,
I actually want to climb it again.

351
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
It's really addictive.

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,720
Conquering it conquering
this route even more perfectly.

353
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,720
What I'm looking
forward to most

354
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,880
is reaching the summit
on the last day.

355
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,320
After all, it's a mountain
over 100 meters high

356
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
climbing it all in one go.

357
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,200
I think that sense of accomplishment
will be incredible.

358
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,440
Look, this is our ultimate goal.

359
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
This mountain is called
Monkey Mountain

360
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,680
with a total height of 110 meters
and with a vertical rock face.

361
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
We'll start from the back
of the mountain, and reach the summit

362
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
then create an entirely
new multi-pitch route.

363
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,280
We will climb together,
and if we can first ascent

364
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,320
we will earn naming rights.

365
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,880
For me it's an unknown route.

366
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,200
I don't know what it looks like

367
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,840
or how to approach each move,

368
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,840
so it's a bit of an unknown.

369
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,000
I feel a little nervous
and a bit scared, too.

370
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,680
And also a little bit of fear.

371
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,520
-- I'll belay you first.
-- Yes.

372
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,840
Then, once I reach the top.

373
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,160
I'll call for you
and you can start climbing.

374
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
Wait until
I'm secured before you begin.

375
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,640
Got it.

376
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,040
"I'm secured."

377
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,640
Okay, I'm on it now.

378
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,400
"Okay."

379
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,760
Here?

380
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,200
Here.

381
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,920
It's hard
to get a foothold here.

382
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,400
It's so slippery.

383
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,600
This is really slippery.

384
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,240
"This is the slipperiest
part for us."

385
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,920
Do you have a strong
sense of dependence?

386
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,200
For example, when you are climbing
new issues come up constantly

387
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,160
requiring you to solve them promptly.

388
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,880
Keep it up!

389
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,800
Overall I wouldn't say
I have a strong sense of dependence.

390
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,840
I just firmly believe
I can complete it.

391
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,040
The process of climbing from the back
is not as simple as I imagined.

392
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,840
"Grab the tree, remember hold
onto the tree trunk to come up."

393
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,440
It's very steep and it's been
raining the past few days

394
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,120
so there's a lot of mud
making it hard to step.

395
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,800
This is so slippery.

396
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,840
Yay!

397
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,600
You finally made it up.

398
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,360
That was tough.

399
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,480
Climbing from the back
of the mountain

400
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,800
and it's already very tough
.

401
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,680
Yes, that's true.

402
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,480
-- All right, I'll keep going.
-- Go ahead.

403
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,600
I taught him the knots
how to use them the directions

404
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,040
and he remembers each step.

405
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,000
He's just slowly adapting
to this situation.

406
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,800
I'm at the top.

407
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,920
Okay, I'm coming.

408
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,720
Is it easier to climb this
stretch compared to the one before.

409
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,360
Definitely.

410
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,960
It's hard to climb here.

411
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
Okay.

412
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,480
Okay.

413
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Take up the rope.

414
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,680
Wow. Oh.

415
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,960
High up?

416
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,640
Not too bad.

417
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,240
The view from the top
is actually great

418
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,760
with many rice terraces
you can see people walking around.

419
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,720
Okay, here we go.

420
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,560
Ahh.

421
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,800
Next up we have the drill and hammer.

422
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Good.

423
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,240
Hmm.

424
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,400
Ah, we're on the same rope, right?

425
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes, you're the lead climber
and I'm at the end of the rope.

426
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Now, it's your turn to do the work.

427
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,040
-- Solid.
-- Solid. Do it.

428
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,160
A mountain has lots of cracks
and protruding rocks.

429
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I can climb up using these rocks.

430
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,480
This route I'm setting up.
I'll better footholds...

431
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,720
...so I won't waste as much energy.

432
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Oh!

433
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
It's okay.

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,520
This is fun,
hammering in the pitons.

435
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,000
First, tie the lanyard,
then clip in.

436
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,880
My back is about to break.

437
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,520
When establishing the route,
we have to hang there

438
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,600
which cuts off circulation
making our legs and waist feel sore.

439
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,240
So we have to keep changing positions

440
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,160
to let certain muscles relax.

441
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,480
The first section
of your route is done.

442
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
The route isn't really
about difficulty

443
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,280
it's about the scenery behind it.

444
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
Look behind.

445
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,680
Next, a talent showcase.

446
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,320
We don't have enough time
to complete the entire route today.

447
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,360
We'll rest on the rock wall overnight
and also give Yibo a chance

448
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,640
to experience sleeping
in a portaledge.

449
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
Keep it up!

450
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,360
Aah.

451
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,840
Done.

452
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,680
I need a break because I feel dizzy.

453
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,400
Just stand on it.

454
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,240
It's sturdy. Don't worry.

455
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Today, we set up the upper section.

456
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,600
Tomorrow, we'll continue down
to finish the route.

457
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,360
Then we'll rest below,

458
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,240
and when we're ready,
we'll start climbing the first pitch.

459
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,120
The sun
was pretty intense today.

460
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,960
Yeah, the sun was
definitely strong today.

461
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,520
They also said it might
rain tomorrow. Right?

462
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
Hopefully it won't so we can complete
the climb smoothly.

463
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,800
I got bitten by bugs a lot at night
and woke up once or twice.

464
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,920
My clothes were damp
from being packed away

465
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,040
and when I took them
out to cover myself

466
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,640
they were wet and uncomfortable.

467
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,200
Are your hands sore
and swollen?

468
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,120
Not too bad, not too sore.

469
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Let's keep descending.

470
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,680
Okay.

471
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,800
After Yibo
and I finished bolting the route

472
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,920
we took a break
before officially ascending.

473
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,120
This route has five pitches
and we take turns lead climbing.

474
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,320
From afar, it's a mountain
up close, it's an absolute challenge.

475
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,960
This is it.

476
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,960
How do you tap into your physical
and mental strength

477
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,880
to truly reach your limits?

478
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,360
At that time,
I hadn't really figured out

479
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,800
where my limits were.

480
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,720
Maybe because I started dancing
in elementary school

481
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,000
my body coordination is pretty good.

482
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,560
I also have some fitness experience

483
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,760
so my muscle endurance,

484
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,040
and coordination
are relatively strong.

485
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,800
Maybe I haven't hit my limit yet.

486
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm not sure.

487
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
The goal is to make
the first ascent of this mountain

488
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
opening the hardest route.

489
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,200
If you complete it
you get to name it.

490
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,280
That's our ultimate purpose.

491
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,680
Ready?

492
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,640
- Let's go, bring it on.
- Let's go.

493
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,240
New routes have lots of loose rocks.

494
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,600
This one's unstable.

495
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,200
This is lead climbing.

496
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,640
Anyway, the holds marked
with chalk are good to grab.

497
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,480
I've reached the top
of the first pitch

498
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
and secured the anchor.

499
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,640
- Okay, I'm ready to go.
- Okay.

500
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,480
Let me have a look.

501
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,960
Pull the quickdraw and stand up.

502
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,120
The first pitch is actually
quite challenging

503
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,760
especially those initial spots
they're not easy to grip.

504
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,800
I remember feeling like
I was about to fall twice.

505
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,880
Use your toes more
trust that your toes can hold.

506
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,240
I don't have full confidence
in each foothold and handhold.

507
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,720
Sometimes, when I step up

508
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,320
I feel a bit nervous
not knowing if it will hold.

509
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
Keep going.

510
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,000
Nice!

511
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,760
It's sturdy, don't worry.

512
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Yay.

513
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,440
Use your knee, press with your knee.

514
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,720
Oh.

515
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,640
Though I'm taking it
one step at a time.

516
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,600
I hadn't set a goal to finish it
there's still a belief inside me

517
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,680
that I must complete this section.

518
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,280
Okay, the hardest part is done.

519
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,760
-- Aah.
-- Yes!

520
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,480
Awesome.

521
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,120
Is it difficult?

522
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,760
This section is a bit tiring.

523
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,080
Next is lead climbing
with quickdraws.

524
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,880
Right.

525
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,640
Oh, now it's my turn.

526
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,480
Okay.

527
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,560
-- Go ahead.
-- I'm going.

528
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,800
Step outward.

529
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,360
Be careful.

530
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,720
There's a section
that goes up.

531
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,280
I stepped on loose rocks twice,
and they fell.

532
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,600
Even the handhold was loose,

533
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,280
and after that,
I started to feel a bit scared.

534
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,720
Since it's lead climbing a lead fall
could be somewhat dangerous.

535
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,440
Feeling scared, my hands tensed up.

536
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Halfway through my hands
felt noticeably sore,

537
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,880
like, I couldn't grip well.

538
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,280
Woo!

539
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,440
Awesome.

540
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,160
He kept cheering me from below.

541
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,880
Nice, nice, nice! Keep going!

542
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,960
Toe on the foothold.

543
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,840
I didn't respond because
I'm very focused on what I'm doing.

544
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,080
I didn't want to fall.

545
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,120
But I heard everything
and I think it was really helpful.

546
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,040
Just one more move!

547
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,040
Keep going!

548
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,960
Okay.

549
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,600
Woo!

550
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,440
I told you,
you can on-sight this.

551
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,400
-Are you secure?
-Secure.

552
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,400
All right,
I'm taking off the belay.

553
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,360
Okay.

554
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,680
On-sight means

555
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:36,120
whether you're lead climbing
or following you complete the climb

556
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,880
without taking both hands off
the wall succeeding in one go.

557
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,360
That's what the term means.

558
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,640
Okay, take the rope.

559
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,400
I think he might be the fastest
learner I've ever taught.

560
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,840
This section
was pretty tough, actually.

561
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,440
I thought you
were going to fall.

562
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
There was a spot
where I almost did.

563
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,960
That's how multi-pitch climbing
is you just on-sighted it.

564
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,760
Truly a climber now.
It is still a bit slippery.

565
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
Outstanding.

566
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,720
-Yes!
-Yeah!

567
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,480
Quick, quick.

568
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,320
This one has a good grip.

569
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,280
This route is a bit tough.

570
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,400
Oh, yeah.

571
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,320
This pitch is quite long.

572
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,760
Not bad.

573
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,360
It's raining.

574
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,360
Let it rain,
it's all about the thrill.

575
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,360
Okay, I'm secured.

576
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
It's really coming down.

577
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh, my goodness.

578
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,160
Welcome to Yangshuo.

579
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,760
My whole body is a bit cold.

580
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,040
I don't know if I can finish.

581
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,640
You can do it.

582
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
I believe in you.

583
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,560
At that moment,
I thought it was over.

584
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,120
How are we supposed
to handle this rain?

585
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,640
Can we still finish?

586
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,760
Although we have an instinct
to avoid challenges

587
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,200
at critical moments
we must face them head-on.

588
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:32,440
In life I think I have a
preference for challenges.

589
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,880
For example, racing
is also a kind of challenge

590
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,600
pushing myself bit-by-bit.

591
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,920
I'm willing to gradually
push my limits.

592
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,640
The rain has eased up.

593
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Let's go.

594
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,680
We're already here
so let's not give up.

595
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,760
Remember to step high,
place your foot up and reach up.

596
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,720
It's all doable.
It's a bit rough on the hands.

597
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, reach up and stand up.

598
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,320
Keep going.

599
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,480
That's it.

600
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Beautiful.

601
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,080
Oh, nice!

602
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,800
Step over.

603
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,520
That's it.

604
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,640
This is the hardest
part of the route.

605
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,240
Come on, that's it
next hold, step high.

606
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,800
Toes on the foothold get up,
push, and stand up.

607
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Keep your foot stable.

608
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,360
Grab the tree.

609
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,960
Grab the tree.

610
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,640
Nice!

611
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,080
Yeah!

612
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,880
This is definitely the most
extreme climb I've ever done.

613
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,720
It's really exciting
my first time climbing a multi-pitch.

614
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,040
And in a crazy storm.

615
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,120
Yes, and I haven't tried
the routes before.

616
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,640
Going straight up
and lead climbing too.

617
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm leaving,
are you securely belayed?

618
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,240
Yes, I've tightened up.

619
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,280
I'm off.- Okay, go ahead.

620
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,120
See you at
the top of the mountain.

621
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,040
I'm safe.
You can remove your protection.

622
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
Grab the trunk and come up.

623
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,880
Right.

624
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,440
There's a chalk mark on top
of your head do you see it?

625
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,240
Tighten the rope.

626
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,440
Touch the rock face.

627
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,560
Come on.

628
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,200
Come to my side.

629
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,080
My legs are already shaking.

630
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,720
Really, I don't think I can do it.

631
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,640
Am I still lead climbing
for the last pitch?

632
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,200
You must take the lead.

633
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,960
I don't know if I have
the confidence to make it up there.

634
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,880
Take a break first.

635
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,240
How did you
feel at that moment?

636
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,280
Abang is incredibly determined
but for me.

637
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,600
I had only learned climbing
for three days.

638
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,600
Then I was climbing outdoors
on a route I'd never tried before

639
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,560
and it rained
so I felt really uncertain.

640
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Do you believe in me?

641
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,720
-- I trust you.
-- Okay.

642
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,160
Countless failures lead
to a single success.

643
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,320
Okay.

644
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,000
Keep going, keep going!

645
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,720
Along the way, he kept worrying
and fearing about falling

646
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,440
and getting hurt.

647
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,160
But he's forgotten
the pain by now

648
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,440
because he knows
he has to finish this.

649
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,600
Keep going!

650
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,960
Keep going climb up.

651
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,400
Yes, keep going!

652
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
Breathe.

653
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,400
Abang's encouragement
gave me a lot of courage.

654
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,360
One more move
almost at the summit.

655
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,760
This is a process
of mutual support and trust.

656
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,640
Keep going.

657
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,400
Ah!

658
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
Wow!

659
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,120
Whoa!

660
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,480
Did you clip the top?

661
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,040
Not yet.

662
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Okay.

663
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,600
Yes!

664
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,360
-Are you secure?
-I'm secure.

665
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,080
Awesome, all in one go.

666
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,920
You had me a bit nervous.

667
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,360
It's really slippery.

668
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,520
Whoa! Whoa!

669
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,440
-Oh.
-Yeah.

670
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,320
Yes.

671
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,000
Let's name it "Against All Odds."

672
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,840
"Against All Odds," perfect!

673
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,080
The first route on this mountain
is now complete.

674
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,840
Against all odds.

675
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,720
I love this feeling.

676
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,680
The feeling of conquering
this mountain.

677
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,640
I was prepared for the worst.

678
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,800
I didn't expect it.

679
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,440
But to my surprise, he overcame...

680
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,480
...and finished
in the best possible way.

681
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,040
Whether it's a form of progress

682
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,960
or growth it's visible
to the naked eye.

683
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,480
It's because all the preparation
and accumulation

684
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,360
has led to this moment.

685
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,680
Human potential is limitless

686
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,880
as long as you want
to accomplish something.

687
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,160
You can try and get as close
to the goal as possible.

688
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,480
I think at that moment
when he reached the summit.

689
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,960
I could feel the joy within him.

690
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,880
The look in his eyes told me
he was glad he didn't give up.

691
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,920
Against all odds.

692
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,840
Let's go, I want to go home.

693
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,160
I didn't think
I would finish today

694
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,080
in such a theatrical manner.

695
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,360
Looking back,
it's actually quite incredible.
