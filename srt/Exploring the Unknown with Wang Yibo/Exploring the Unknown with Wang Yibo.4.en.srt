1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,040
Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Cool!

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,000
I was looking for more
creative ways to explore the world.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,480
That's when I thought,
let's give Discovery a call

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,600
As the creator
of this show, what's your goal?

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,480
As your movie director,

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,520
I look forward to discovering your
true intention behind this program.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,440
Over the past few years,

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,480
it seems like work's been
the only thing on my mind.

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,120
But over time,

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,480
I began to feel that I need
to pay attention to my own life.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,880
I thought I should just go do
what I've always wanted to do

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,320
and enjoy the process.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,120
Drop me some rope!

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,720
The process was indeed very painful.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,560
That's why it hurts!

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,000
Whoa!

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,600
What's the first thing

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,320
that comes to your mind
when you think of ocean?

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,280
The ocean is mysterious and vast.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,160
I sense fear and loneliness.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,520
When I dive into the deep waters,
will I feel isolated?

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,880
Or free?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,520
Was it the first time
you realize that loneliness

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,120
is a big part of growing up?

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,560
Now, my ears hurt...

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,320
...and my head, too.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,760
Because you can't
equalize your ears properly.

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,960
-Headache.
-Try not to force it next time.

31
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,560
I wanted to learn diving,

32
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,000
because I wanted to pick up
a new skill, one more extreme sport.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,200
I like water.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,560
But I am a little nervous
about going into the deep sea.

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,880
Maybe I do need to learn some
new skills before I can do that.

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
I know that Paupau
is a very skilled diving expert.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,880
I'd like to learn how to dive,

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,720
and learn more about
the ocean from Paupau.

39
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,880
And to meet
some of the sea creatures.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,640
Good morning, Yibo!

41
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
-Good morning!
-Morning!

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,160
"My name is Zhou Fang,
but people call me Paupau.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,080
I want to share my connection
with the ocean,

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,480
including my experiences
and feelings towards the sea.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,320
I hope to guide Yibo
in exploring this underwater world,

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,400
helping him discover a part
of himself he has yet to uncover."

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,800
Have you brought everything with you?

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes.

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,640
I've lugged all the diving
and underwater photography gear

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,760
-onto the boat.
-Cool.

51
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,880
-If you are good, we can go.
-Let's go.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,240
-Okay, let's go.
-Go.

53
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,160
Be careful.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,960
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Okay.

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,320
At our first stop today
we can do some free diving exercises.

56
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,040
Mm. Is free diving difficult?

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,840
To be honest,
I think free diving is not easy.

58
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,600
The deeper you get
the more fear you feel.

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,720
That's right.

60
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,160
I hope you can complete
this new challenge with me this time.

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,080
You'll see lots of corals on
the ocean floor that glow at night.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,080
We will free dive at night
to document these glowing corals.

63
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,360
This season is also the best time
for night diving photography.

64
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,800
We need to take advantage
of this opportunity.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm really looking forward
to this new extreme sport.

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,040
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
when you think of the ocean?

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,000
It's mysterious.

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
It's vast lonely and intimidating.

70
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,480
Maybe I haven't been
to the ocean much

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,640
when I do go there once in a while

72
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,960
I do feel very pleasant
during the day

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,480
but when I walk on the beach at night

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,800
the darkness feels
very oppressive and scary.

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,040
What do you know about
extreme sports like diving?

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,120
Although I love extreme sports,

77
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,320
I think this time,
it's going to be a bigger challenge.

78
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
Let me carry it.

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,280
This landscape is quite peculiar.

80
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,080
Yeah.

81
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
You can see a lake from afar,

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,160
it used to be a mine.

83
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,040
After it's abandoned,
it became a man-made lake.

84
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,760
We'll get into the water
from here in a while.

85
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
Okay.

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,080
I'm excited.

87
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,240
I've always loved water
since I was a kid.

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,160
I like rowing the boat
in the park and swimming.

89
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,880
It makes me feel
very free and relaxed.

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,240
Is it okay?

91
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,200
-- Okay.
-- Good.

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,400
We will use this buoy
as our marker.

93
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Let's begin with our
first training session.

94
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,040
Okay.

95
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,000
You'll follow this rope down

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,520
it's about four to five meters deep.

97
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,840
The main goal was to see

98
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,680
if I can equalize
my ears during the dive.

99
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,960
Ear pressure equalization
is a big challenge

100
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,320
to most free diving beginners.

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,840
Next, a very important
thing that you need to learn

102
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
is how to equalize ear pressure.

103
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,480
Take a breath first.
Then immediately hold your breath.

104
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,240
You will find that this part
of your throat is like a valve.

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Then push your tongue
upwards to seal off your epiglottis

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
with the tip of your tongue.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
You are not doing it right.
Look at me.

108
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,440
There's not enough pressure.

109
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Getting better, but the force
is not strong enough.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,360
It is bulging on and off.

111
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
It's hard.

112
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,880
I don't think I'm getting it.

113
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,320
Actually, once you get underwater,
it's okay even if you can't master.

114
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,120
The Frenzel equalization technique,

115
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,200
when you can get down
to a certain depth,

116
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,320
you can level your body horizontally

117
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,480
and equalize your ears
through your diaphragm,

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,840
your abdomen, nose or, by swallowing.

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,520
Then when your ears don't hurt
anymore you try to go deeper.

120
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,680
After we get into the water,
we will equalize our ears per normal.

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,880
The way we get into the water
is called the duck dive.

122
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,040
We fold our body forward
keep our feet straight up

123
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,320
then use the weight of my body
to get under water.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,640
-- Okay.
-- Good.

125
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
I can't get down.

126
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Do you feel that you're not
actually going down vertically?

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,880
You've been somersaulting
in the water.

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,640
When Yibo first started free diving

129
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,840
I sensed that,

130
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,000
he was trying hard to prove himself.

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,480
It was really difficult
to duck dive

132
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,480
but I never once thought
about giving up.

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,240
It just takes more practice
and eventually you can get it.

134
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,120
-- You did it!
-- Whoa-hoo-hoo!

135
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,280
You went under water.

136
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,600
I need a break.
My heart is beating a bit fast.

137
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,920
You are tired.

138
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,680
Now, my ears hurt...

139
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,680
...and my head too.

140
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,080
When you're on an island
with no cell phone signal.

141
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,200
Your phone is just like a brick
when it's turned off.

142
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
Do you get anxious?

143
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,840
I don't think
I'm as anxious as I used to be.

144
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
There is a lot of information
online nowadays.

145
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,560
Some are true and some are fake.

146
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Proportionately, information
that is effective and helpful

147
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
is becoming less and less.

148
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,640
Yeah, so I'm also
consciously restraining myself

149
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
and try to use my cell phone less.

150
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,880
What do you do
with the spare time you have

151
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,040
when you are not on your phone?

152
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,400
-Exercising. Yeah.
-Exercising

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Or watching movies.

154
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,960
Or go camping in the wild.

155
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
I think that's great.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,560
My head is a bit warm.

157
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
Do you still feel pain in the ears?

158
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,360
-Pain around the temples here.
-Mm.

159
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,240
While learning
how to equalize my ears,

160
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
I wasn't able to
find the right position

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,480
so my ears hurt soon
after I went under water.

162
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,280
When you can't
equalize your ear pressure,

163
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:20,160
your eardrums swell and you'll feel
pain in your sinuses and your eyes.

164
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,040
-Will this go away with time?
-Yeah, you need to rest.

165
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,760
Go up, and rest first.

166
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
I can go another round.

167
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,520
Compared to my kids I feel
that Yibo expects more from himself.

168
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,920
Even when he isn't feeling
well physically

169
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
he is determined to accomplish
what he sets out to do.

170
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,360
I just chased after a fish,
and almost touched it.

171
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,400
-- Did you touch it?
-- No, almost.

172
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,520
It's much more agile than us.

173
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,760
Right. I'm obsessed.
Anything I see.

174
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,320
-- You want to go after it.
-- Yeah.

175
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,080
Do you want
to go after this big catfish?

176
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,640
Go.

177
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,680
We had bad weather
in our first training session.

178
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
Its fine underwater,

179
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,560
it's actually more dangerous
on the water surface.

180
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,960
We were caught in bad weather.

181
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,640
When you were
on that island and diving

182
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,480
how did you feel
when confronted with nature?

183
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
The sea surface is indeed...

184
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
endless.

185
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,360
There's a sense of loneliness.

186
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,960
Couple years before,
after a busy day filming,

187
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,520
I went back to my room
and was suddenly hit

188
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,080
with this inexplicable
sense of loneliness.

189
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,680
Ironically, when I left home
for the first time to Beijing

190
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
I didn't feel lonely at all.

191
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,320
Instead, I was pretty happy.

192
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,000
I personally think
that being able to face loneliness

193
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,800
is a big part of growing up.

194
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,400
To be honest, I haven't experienced
absolute loneliness so far.

195
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,360
I quite enjoy the loneliness
I feel sometimes.

196
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,920
We just learned free diving
in confined water.

197
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,680
But our final night dive
will be in the open sea.

198
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Yibo still needs more practice
in the open water.

199
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,000
So next, we're going to
a small island for training.

200
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,520
-Look, it's the land up there.
-The one ahead?

201
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, that beach.

202
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
-We're almost there.
-Yeah.

203
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,080
There's still daylight.

204
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,840
-We have time to pitch the tent.
-Right.

205
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,800
This will be...

206
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,040
-This shows Yibo's creativity.
-A light stand.

207
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,080
Huh.

208
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,320
A nature program series.

209
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,160
Since our first practice
it's been more than four hours.

210
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,560
Yeah, I can't wait.

211
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,800
I felt like
I could go straight down.

212
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,840
That's good.

213
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,240
I saw some big sea urchins.
Their spines are very long.

214
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,280
Those don't taste good,
they are not fleshy.

215
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,640
The sea urchin we usually eat
are the kinds with short spines.

216
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
They are white.

217
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,760
They are called
horse-sung sea uechin.

218
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,680
You can dive down
and have a look first.

219
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Then we will grab
our tools to get them.

220
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
They will be at about
eight meters deep.

221
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
You go down and look for them first.

222
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,360
Compared to the training
in the fresh water,

223
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,920
I can equalize my ears
much better today.

224
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,680
After I was able to do it once,
I let go of my hands.

225
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,840
Ooh.

226
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,320
Very happy and excited.

227
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,240
Oh!

228
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,680
It's amazing.

229
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,840
I said to let you go down
and look for them first.

230
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,120
You just went straight ahead
and grabbed them.

231
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,280
So, that depth
was about eight meters?

232
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,080
Right.

233
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,160
Is this edible?
Is there a lot of flesh in there?

234
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,600
This one is pretty meaty.

235
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,560
-But the spines are venomous.
-Venomous?

236
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,000
The spines
are definitely venomous.

237
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Then I'd better
let it go first.

238
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,880
-What about this?
-Put it in here.

239
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,720
Whoo!

240
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,680
Can't let it get away.

241
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
This is so much fun.

242
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,320
Oh, I feel...

243
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,080
...free underwater.

244
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,920
I also feel the urgency
to go explore.

245
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,960
I dove to the deepest depth
I had ever been in my life.

246
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,840
I love it.

247
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,280
The second one.

248
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,440
I found
some sea snails just now.

249
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,280
You won't let any of them go.

250
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
Whenever you see one,
you have to pick it.

251
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,880
Right, this is so much fun.

252
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,960
I don't really want to
come out of the water.

253
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,160
Wow.

254
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,240
Yay!

255
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,720
-- Look at today's harvest.
-- That's a lot.

256
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,320
-- It's time to make dinner.
-- Yes.

257
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,080
Our entire life might seem long.

258
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,080
But there are only a few key
defining moments.

259
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,640
I think,
when I chose to come to Beijing

260
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,520
to become a singer,
that might be my first turning point.

261
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,960
The choice you made
when you were 12 or 13

262
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,040
actually put you on a narrow path...

263
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,480
a path that most
would not want to be on.

264
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,560
You gave up on the other options
and chose this path on your own.

265
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,160
I can imagine that
kind of loneliness.

266
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
It's exhausting.

267
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,400
There's one more.

268
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,200
Then while on this narrow path,

269
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,600
you had an enlightenment and became
the Wang Yibo you are today.

270
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,280
Because there were
fewer people on this path

271
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,920
it led you to a wider
and more open area.

272
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,080
Fortunately,
our efforts were not in vain.

273
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,920
Yeah.

274
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,880
There are lots to eat.

275
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,520
My glove...

276
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Before I knew it,
I am sweating again.

277
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
-It's really humid here.
-Yeah.

278
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,000
This is really handy, isn't it?

279
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,520
This tree branch
it's like it's built just for us.

280
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,760
We can just open up
the sea urchin because it's fresh.

281
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,560
Okay.

282
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,520
Looks quite tricky to open it.

283
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,480
It's opened.

284
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,160
Get rid of all the entrails.

285
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,600
The only part

286
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,520
-we will actually eat is the roe.
-Right?

287
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
So all these in the middle
can be tossed we don't want it.

288
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,280
-Ah, this one is a lot fatter.
-Yeah.

289
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,240
It smells so good.

290
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,400
Mm.

291
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,960
Mmm!

292
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
-- Which one tastes better?
-- Sea urchin omelet.

293
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,680
It's because
you caught it yourself,

294
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,080
so it tastes especially good.

295
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
Are you tired?

296
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,760
I was quite tired
after the dive.

297
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,520
Right.
Free diving can be quite strenuous.

298
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,080
Our challenge tomorrow

299
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,200
will be finding
the fluorescent corals at night

300
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,520
and we'll free dive to do
some underwater photography.

301
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,960
If I'm mentally prepared
my body should do just fine.

302
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm not sure what it's like at night.

303
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,880
Relaxation is the essence
of this sport

304
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,160
to set your body and mind free.

305
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,560
I think that's basically
what you could do

306
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,800
to be psychologically prepared.

307
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,240
-You can do it.
-Okay.

308
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,280
-Looking forward to tomorrow night.
-Me too.

309
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,440
Do you know that
the monkeys attacked us this morning?

310
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,440
I didn't know.

311
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,880
You slept through
all those noises, impressive.

312
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,000
The monkeys were barking wildly.

313
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,920
Because we had some leftover food
and eggs out there from last night.

314
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,280
The monkeys finished them all.

315
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,240
Huh?

316
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,720
And then they were fighting.

317
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,960
Probably about eight or nine of them.
There's still one at the back.

318
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,760
I had an upset stomach
and woke up at about five.

319
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,960
I heard you get up that's why
I was asking if you were feeling bad.

320
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,560
Can you taste
the difference in this coffee?

321
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,320
As long as you think
there is, it'll be there.

322
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,480
Then if you think
about the glowing corals today

323
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
-they'll be there.
-They'll be there.

324
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
I was about to
say don't forget our tree.

325
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
Bye-bye, monkey!

326
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,680
Our animal friend
who has kept us company.

327
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,480
Yeah.

328
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,200
Judging from
how you are bulging your nose

329
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,960
I can tell that you have grasped
the breathing technique.

330
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,200
It won't stand in your way anymore

331
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,680
-as a psychological burden.
-Yeah.

332
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,680
That's great!

333
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,480
The most profound encounter
I had with the sea was...

334
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,440
I was on a plane
and when it was landing

335
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,760
it flew so closely to the ocean

336
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,480
almost touching the water.

337
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,640
I could see the white foamy bubbles
emerging from the dark blue water

338
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,000
as if the sea is ready
to devour everything.

339
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
If this had taken place in the night

340
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,120
it'd be quite terrifying.

341
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,080
For your night dive, would you be
doing any preparation beforehand?

342
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,920
Paupau told me that

343
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,840
free diving requires
some imagination.

344
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,040
I feel that my senses
are pretty heightened

345
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,440
especially when I'm in nature.

346
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,280
This helps me prepare
for the challenge.

347
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,040
What's the difference between this
and the camera you normally use?

348
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
It's big and heavy.

349
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,480
Yeah,
it will be fine in the water.

350
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,920
Because all the empty spaces
inside this shell are buoyant.

351
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,280
Just like how we photograph on land

352
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,600
besides framing and calibrating
our camera settings

353
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,640
we also have to handle lighting
when underwater.

354
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,720
-There's an even bigger challenge.
-There's also diving.

355
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,360
Yes, you have to free dive.

356
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,520
It would be
quite challenging for you.

357
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,800
Okay, you can try adjusting
this light now.

358
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,920
Press and hold the plus sign
for three seconds

359
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,480
it will turn blue.

360
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,040
This is the light setting
we need at night.

361
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Blue light can help us capture
those glowing creatures in the ocean.

362
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,400
Many living organisms
have fluorescent proteins on them.

363
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,920
The fluorescent proteins

364
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,400
can be induced by blue
or purple light waves.

365
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,320
That's why we need the blue light
to find the glowing creatures.

366
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,320
My stomach is upset again.

367
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,200
He started having
a stomachache last night

368
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
and wasn't feeling well.

369
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,120
And he's not feeling
well this morning.

370
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,840
So I'm a bit worried.
But he insisted he keep going.

371
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,640
I have to keep a close eye on him.

372
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,560
Give me both cameras.
I'll hold them.

373
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,040
The waves are a bit strong,
aren't they?

374
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,560
Yeah,
the waves are quite strong.

375
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
I caught a small fish on camera.

376
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,320
It's blue.

377
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,040
I tailed it for quite
a while now I'm tired.

378
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,480
The last dive was 49 seconds.

379
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,920
The sea is choppy, the surges
underwater are also quite strong.

380
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,440
The waves would push me away
from the target that I'm looking for.

381
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,520
-- Are you tired? A little?
-- Very tired.

382
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,760
With the camera you're
carrying additional weight too.

383
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,120
-Because it's quite heavy.
-It's a little heavy.

384
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,200
Because the waves
are big strong waves indeed.

385
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,240
The camera is very heavy

386
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,360
it takes a lot of energy
to dive with it.

387
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,600
It's so tiring, really tiring.

388
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,560
Why did you decide
to do something like this

389
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,720
in the first place?

390
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,000
It's obviously not easy.

391
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,760
Compared to your day-to-day
work this is hardship.

392
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,600
I think it depends on
how we define "hardship."

393
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:27,920
If I am doing what I like I probably
won't see it as a hardship.

394
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,440
Plus we don't really know
maybe I'll get more out of it

395
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
and really achieve
a great sense of satisfaction.

396
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,240
I didn't have the stamina
to dive any more

397
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,560
and I couldn't hold
my breath any longer.

398
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Take a break.

399
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,040
The waves are too high.

400
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
The waves
are indeed too high.

401
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,720
-Do you feel dizzy?
-I'm all right. Just tired.

402
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,040
And I'm still having trouble
with that tube it's hindering me

403
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,720
because seawater kept
getting into the snorkel.

404
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,160
-- Right.
-- That's why my breaths

405
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,520
had been short and fast.

406
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,240
I couldn't dive as calmly
as I did yesterday.

407
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,520
It will be harder
to dive at night.

408
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,720
You aren't in your best state today.

409
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,000
You have an upset stomach
and diarrhea.

410
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,480
Take it off quickly.

411
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,280
Because it's strangling your neck
and making you uncomfortable.

412
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,280
Just by having something
in your hand takes it up a level.

413
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,200
This step up is too big.
It's hard to adapt.

414
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,720
-We are progressing a bit too fast.
-Yeah.

415
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,600
Can you accept failure?

416
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,520
I think I can face it...

417
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
...but I don't like failing.

418
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,280
We are getting to
one of the most important topics,

419
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,640
-your fundamental principles.
-Based on these principles

420
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,160
perhaps every choice
can be the right one.

421
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,880
What are your
fundamental principles?

422
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,960
Everything I do and say
comes genuinely from my heart.

423
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,120
That's why you can face your choices
with peace of mind.

424
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
Right

425
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,120
So, do you
still want to try it tonight?

426
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,080
I can take a flashlight
and go down to have a look.

427
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,840
But if I take the camera

428
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,360
I think I'll have a hard time
controlling my body.

429
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,760
I started the day feeling unwell

430
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,880
-and now I feel physically exhausted.
-Yeah.

431
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,720
Mm. It's delicious.

432
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
You feel alive now?

433
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,240
Yea, I feel alive again.

434
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,000
I can do it again later.

435
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:19,040
You can do it anytime.
But really don't force it.

436
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,080
I'm actually still a little worried
about the night dive.

437
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,040
It's very windy and the sea
is quite rough here.

438
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,360
Yeah, the water is quite rough.

439
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,280
-Let's take just one camera down.
-I'll handle lighting.

440
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,480
Yup, I'll take the camera
and you take the light.

441
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,720
When we are done,
we can get ready for the night dive.

442
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,400
How do you
confront challenges?

443
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,840
I don't panic easily.

444
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:54,520
-I can deal with problems calmly.
-Calmly. Right.

445
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Acting is also a challenge.

446
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,280
So yeah, I think I have the courage
to confront challenges.

447
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
Especially if it's something I like.

448
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,800
Hopefully I won't get water
going up my nose

449
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,680
when I get into the water.

450
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,280
I didn't think he's afraid
of the night dive

451
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,120
he really wanted to see

452
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,240
what the bottom of the sea
is like in the dark.

453
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,920
And surprisingly, he actually
really enjoyed the night dive.

454
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,960
It feels like "Finding Nemo."
I saw some corals.

455
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,240
I enjoyed every single
moment underwater.

456
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
To be able to see all
that in front of me

457
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,840
I feel like
I'm the only person in the world.

458
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,480
You look a lot better
than you were in the afternoon.

459
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
-- Yeah, because...
-- You had meat.

460
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,960
I had meat.

461
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,480
Or maybe because I didn't have
to handle as much.

462
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,240
Really, you were
not afraid of the dark at all.

463
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah, it's not as dark as I thought.

464
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,440
Probably because of the light.

465
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,800
Just like, usually
when you go the beach at night,

466
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,960
there's no light you'd think
that it's really dark down there.

467
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,520
-The fear came from the unknown.
-Right.

468
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,280
The underwater world is silent.

469
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,120
It's just me looking
at the sea creatures.

470
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,440
And I'm not paying attention
to anyone else at all.

471
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,400
That feeling is very freeing.

472
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,800
The core of the sport
of free diving is freedom.

473
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
You can treat it as a very selfish,
very self-oriented sport.

474
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,720
Just follow your heart.

475
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,720
All the time down there
is your own time.

476
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,280
It allows me to
feel my soul being alive.

477
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,680
I think it's very important
for people to be able to quiet down,

478
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,640
and being able to be truly alone.

479
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,840
Yes, I have also realized
in the last couple of years

480
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,240
that my attitude towards being along
has changed quite a bit.

481
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,160
I used to think that
I could enjoy solitude while filming,

482
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,120
but when I went back home to Beijing
I was afraid to be alone.

483
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,520
Probably because of age
and experience,

484
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,240
now, I feel that being alone
at home is like replenishing energy.

485
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,600
Sometimes solitude can be sad,

486
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
sometimes it can be enjoyable.

487
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,880
I think maybe loneliness...

488
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,200
will stay with me for a lifetime.

489
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,880
The boat is coming,
let's pack up and go.

490
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,080
Goodbye, ocean.

491
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,960
See you next time.

492
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,520
It rained on the first day
and again on the last day.

493
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,800
That's because you like rain.

494
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,040
Yeah, we all love rain.
