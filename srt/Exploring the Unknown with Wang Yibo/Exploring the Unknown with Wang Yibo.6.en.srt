1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,400
Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,040
Cool!

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,560
I've been to the rainforest,
to the ocean,

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,640
to the snow mountains,
met situations I least expected.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,960
Is there any other
deeply memorable experience

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,720
that stands out in your memory?

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,280
The first time I experienced
severe altitude sickness,

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,560
it was the closest
I've ever been to death.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,840
I experienced many
different perspectives on life.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,920
Those unique firsts
were very meaningful to me.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,240
In episode six,
you'll be thrown into the desert

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
and face real adversity,
it's going to be a lonely journey.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,440
What will it be like on my own?

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Will I be able to navigate my way
and embrace the solo journey?

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm almost here, right?

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,720
This program is more
about sharing the experiences

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,800
of a young person's growth
with the viewers.

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,880
I am in Badain Jaran Desert,
Inner Mongolia.

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,760
I have never been to a desert before,
the vast emptiness here amazes me.

20
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
The desert here is quite different.

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,400
There are sand dunes
in other deserts as well,

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
but they're not as steep or as high.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,880
My final assignment is to reach
the peak of a desert dune on my own.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,200
I'll have to navigate and find
the way on my own using maps.

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,080
I think the desert poses
many risks sun overexposure,

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,760
water scarcity, and heatstroke.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I don't really know what
the actual experience will be like,

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,680
but no one is completely
unafraid of danger.

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,280
Wu Xinlei, our expert
in this episode is very impressive.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,080
He is a former
French Foreign Legion paratrooper

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,560
and special forces soldier.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
My name is Wu Xinlei.
I spent 15 years in the military.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
When I was serving
in the French army,

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,960
we often went on missions
in the desert.

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,120
The previous episodes
have equipped him

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,240
with some basic wilderness skills.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,840
In this final episode, he'll need to
complete a very challenging route

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,960
on his own in the desert.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,920
What do you know about deserts?

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,240
Have you ever been to one?

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,320
The heat could kill you,
there's no drinking water,

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
and I've never been
to the desert before.

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
Maybe that's a good thing.

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
You'll be in an environment
that you've never been in

45
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
and trying to survive on your own.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Each journey you go through
has its own meaning.

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm willing to challenge my limits

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,560
and try new things.

49
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,120
A lot of times when you do things,

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,480
the starting point is simply
the desire to do it, the meaning lies

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,280
in the things that may happen
along the way.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay, let's stop here
and deflate the tires.

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
All right.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
Have you done this before?

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,080
No, but I know that
when we drive in in places

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,720
with soft terrain, like the desert,
we need to deflate the tires.

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,760
Yes, use this tool first.

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,440
We'll deflate them
to just above 0.8.

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,120
We're going to head
in a different direction now.

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,520
The first map that we are going
to refer to is a satellite image.

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,160
I haven't marked north,
south, east, or west on it.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,080
Can you tell
which direction is north?

63
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,400
If the sun is in the east,

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,080
and the wind is coming
from the northwest,

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,080
where do you think north
is on this map?

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,600
-- This is north.
-- Yes, exactly.

67
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
I need to first find the line

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,480
-where we started from, right?
-Yes.

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
This is where we started from,

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,520
right here.

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,560
The smaller the distance
between the contour lines

72
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
or the closer the lines
are, indicate...

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,720
The steeper the slope.

74
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,200
So when you are planning your route,

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,520
you should consider not only
the altitude, but also the steepness.

76
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Paper maps help us
remember the route better

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,120
with digital navigation
we get over reliant on them.

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,960
It's like we've been
on this route before,

79
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
but we haven't truly experienced it.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,280
We'll try to reach
the red line before it gets dark.

81
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Let's see if we can make it up there.

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,880
This is when the car
might start to tilt.

83
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Reverse.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,760
Stop.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,200
Okay, we're out.

86
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,880
All the way down to the bottom,

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,520
then accelerate
and charge up the hill.

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,160
Let's not take this path any more.

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,600
The sand has been
loosened by the car's tires.

90
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Let's go this way.

91
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,000
When we first tried going up,
I was a little nervous,

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,640
especially when
the car started tilting,

93
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,000
I was worried that
it might roll over.

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
It's fine, floor it.

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,440
It's okay, it's flat up top.

96
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,920
Don't ease off gas pedal. Go!

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,440
Go! Go on! Go!

98
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,840
Go! Stop! Okay, let's go.

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,520
Keep going. Nice!

100
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,120
I can't really see the road.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah, the sunlight

102
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
-flattens everything out.
-Right.

103
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,120
It's hard to

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,280
-see any bumps and holes.
-Right.

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,040
The sand dunes
are so high and uneven,

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,760
and there are so many pits,
it's really quite dangerous.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
The car is stuck.

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,400
It can't get out.

109
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,680
Hold on, stop digging into the sand.

110
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
It's stuck, the car is stuck.

111
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
Is it because we didn't
go fast enough?

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,640
It's because you weren't
going fast enough.

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,840
You hesitated
and didn't go right through.

114
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,760
So now the sand ridge
below is horizontal,

115
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,960
and our car is positioned like this,
so our undercarriage is stuck.

116
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,240
This is quite normal.

117
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,200
Before getting out of the car,

118
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,000
we've started shifting
into reverse gear, to back up.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
But when we did that,

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,920
the car started digging
into the sand.

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,440
If we were to keep going,
we might get stuck even deeper.

122
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,600
The tires
aren't digging deep enough.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah, they're not in the middle.

124
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,320
No, the tires
are just spinning.

125
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,160
They are completely lifted up
and off the ground.

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
The front tires are still spinning.

127
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
The rear tires aren't moving.

128
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Keep going.

129
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
Keep going. Stop.

130
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
Keep going, try again. Okay.

131
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Almost there. They're already up.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
I see the front tires are up.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Keep going, It's about to go down.

134
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,720
Bounce it a bit more,
just like before.

135
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,640
Bounce the rear wheel.

136
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,120
The car is moving little by little,
a couple of centimeters each time.

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
You need to speed up, then stop.

138
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Speed up, then stop.

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Nice! Go down, down.

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,240
Watch your direction. Look at me.

141
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,840
-- Nice!
-- Yeah, great.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,400
The flat ground area ahead is a lake

143
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,160
is this a fresh or saltwater lake?
Take a guess.

144
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,000
-Freshwater.
-Yes.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,240
Because I saw birds.

146
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Birds are here
because of the fish.

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,840
Oh.

148
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,360
Next, we've got to
replenish supplies.

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,960
We did bring enough food,

150
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
but we should get some more
in case anything happens.

151
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,920
-- Just in case...
-- Additional stockpiles.

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,600
It's also a good opportunity
for you to experience

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,880
the desert's natural environment.

154
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,000
I didn't expect to see
such a beautiful scene in the desert.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,960
Deep blue sky, bright yellow sand,
and lush green plants.

156
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
It's truly stunning.

157
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,520
Be extra careful when
you walk into wild grasses like this,

158
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:52,360
watch out for insects,
and signs of snakes and scorpions.

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,200
Yeah, scorpions
are found in the deserts.

160
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
Yeah.

161
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,160
This is camel hair.

162
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,200
Wow! It can be used as tinder.

163
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
Oh! What do you
usually use to light a fire?

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Flammable materials,
I also use a flint.

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,440
So you do have
some outdoor survival skills.

166
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,480
I've seen a lot,

167
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
but haven't had much
hands-on experience.

168
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,200
Let's take
a look at our tools.

169
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,040
This is a fishing net,
and this is a life-saving wristband,

170
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,920
which you wear on
your wrist like a watch.

171
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
It's for safety.

172
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't think
survival necessarily requires

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,320
using materials from the wild
or weave something like a fish trap.

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,520
We can use lighter, more specialized,
and more efficient tools.

175
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,680
You can assign the tasks.

176
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,640
What would you like me
to help you with?

177
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
I think I should
unfold it first

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,240
to see how long it is,
and how to lay it out.

179
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
Be careful not to get it snagged.

180
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,960
Should we use a stick
or something similar

181
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
to hold it up on both sides,

182
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,200
-and place it in deeper water?
-Yes, that's right.

183
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,840
Look, we have a small
flagpole on the car.

184
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,960
Yeah, we can use that flagpole.

185
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,760
Whoa!

186
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,960
This is a big area to cover.

187
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,240
It feels like the net.

188
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Isn't long enough, right?

189
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,480
I think it's probably not enough.

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
I'll get the rope out.

191
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,760
It might be better
to extend it from your end.

192
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,680
That way, we can place
fishing net in deeper area.

193
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,360
Okay, you can go that way.

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,400
It's getting deeper.

195
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,720
Okay, our net size is limited.

196
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,040
Fish might not swim upstream
in shallow water.

197
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,400
All right, I'll place it here.

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,400
Mr. Wu's teaching
is actually very interesting

199
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,840
he doesn't tell you how to do it
he makes you think first,

200
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,680
then encourages you to think
about how to use the things around.

201
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,600
When you figure it out yourself
you'll remember it better.

202
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,240
I think we've rested enough.

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah.

204
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,320
What's next?

205
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,120
Should we collect water first
or check out our catch?

206
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
You decide.

207
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,200
Get water first,
then go collect our catch.

208
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Okay! But our kayak
doesn't come with oars.

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
What should you do?

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Do you have anything
that you can use?

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
Flip-flops.

212
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
-- Just scoop up the water.
-- Okay.

213
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,800
-The more, the better.
-Good.

214
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay, we can
go collect the net now.

215
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,560
-- Do I need to herd the fish?
-- Yes.

216
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
Pull it diagonally, pull it that way.

217
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,680
We should try to sweep
this last section up as well.

218
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,520
Okay.

219
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,880
-- Good, I see a fish.
-- Yeah, it's small.

220
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,360
-- Do you see it?
-- Yes, it's right here.

221
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,520
I see one here, too.

222
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,840
This one.

223
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,040
-- Is it big?
-- Not that small.

224
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,440
Great.

225
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,040
Good to hear that.

226
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
-Let's lift it up.
-Okay.

227
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,440
Let's pull the entire
fishing net and lay it on the grass.

228
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Ahh! Ahh!

229
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Did you cut your hand?

230
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
-- My feet?
-- Your feet?

231
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
Your flip-flops were used as an oar.

232
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,040
Ahh!

233
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
Quick, desert grass
are spiky and prickly.

234
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,400
There are only two, right?
Three.

235
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Okay.

236
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,080
Regardless of size,

237
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,800
they are crucial for survival.

238
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
The longer we go,
the less food we have.

239
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,480
Right, this is called
saving for a rainy day.

240
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,480
The place we're going
to at night will be barren,

241
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
completely empty,
with nothing at all.

242
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,400
So, we'll need
to bring some firewood with us.

243
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,200
Yeah.

244
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm going to use your socks
to make some ice water for you.

245
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,840
-- Okay.
-- It's all-natural.

246
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,320
It's all-natural.

247
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,520
The temperature will fall
once the car starts moving.

248
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,720
We'll head towards
a different direction now.

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,280
Do you tend
to make preparations in advance

250
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,800
because you're worried
about changes or challenges?

251
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,440
Crossing the desert
on your own is definitely risky.

252
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,520
You'll need to bring enough
food, water, and warm gear.

253
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,920
But once your water runs out,
you'll have to find more on your own.

254
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,480
And if you need to restock food,
how would you do it?

255
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,000
It's probably a good idea
to plan ahead.

256
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,040
So we're going to camp here?

257
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,720
Here, try the ice water.

258
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,680
Let's celebrate
with a sock of ice water.

259
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
Wow.

260
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,520
Very refreshing.

261
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
It's icy cold.

262
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,880
Awesome.

263
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,400
Isn't this a natural shelf?

264
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,040
It should work.

265
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
Perfect.

266
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,760
Is that sturdy enough?

267
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,360
-Or should we use this?
-It's good.

268
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, oh, oh.

269
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
Be careful with this one.

270
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,840
It bubbling,
it's going to boil soon.

271
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Yeah, that's lake water.

272
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,080
Some tree bark
got in the water,

273
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
-but it should be fine.
-It's fine.

274
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,560
Once it's cooked, it's all edible.

275
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,360
Honestly, people aren't as fragile
as we sometimes think.

276
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,400
Right.

277
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,640
-Did you bring the flour?
-Yeah, I brought it.

278
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,560
We need some carbs.

279
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
Boiled dried fish.

280
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Thanks.

281
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,720
How does it taste?

282
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,120
Let's do a food review.

283
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
It tastes just like
the lake water.

284
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,600
Lake water.

285
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,360
Mm.

286
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,080
Really.

287
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,240
There's no meat at all,
just fish skin.

288
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,280
But at least it
proves that this drying method

289
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
can quickly dry certain
types of meat.

290
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,080
Yeah.

291
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
I think overall
it went pretty smoothly today,

292
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,960
let's take it one step at a time.

293
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,520
Good night.

294
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
-- Morning.
-- Morning.

295
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,280
-How did you sleep?
-Pretty good.

296
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,800
You have your coffee,
and I'll explain it to you.

297
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,960
Thank you.

298
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
Once we reach this lake,

299
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,760
we'll be almost ready to
move on to the next map.

300
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,040
Here, you'll use a paraglider to
survey the route to Desert Everest.

301
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
Okay.

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Have you paraglided before?

303
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,760
Yeah, I've tried
paragliding before.

304
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,200
You just float gently,
it's very relaxing and fun.

305
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,360
We've arrived
at our destination today.

306
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,280
-- Okay.
-- This car won't make it.

307
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,880
-We got you a more powerful one.
-Okay.

308
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,480
Two paragliding instructors
will guide you

309
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,480
as you conduct the aerial survey
of the route for tomorrow's summit.

310
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,880
-- All right.
-- Good luck.

311
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,160
Bye, see you later.

312
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,680
Mr. Wu arranged
this paraglider,

313
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,520
so that I can get a better view
of the mountain range.

314
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,200
The paraglider helps him navigate

315
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,560
and get a better sense of the area.

316
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,920
After that, he'll access
his own abilities, resources,

317
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,680
and figure out
the best tactics to use.

318
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,560
Episode six brings
a new perspective,

319
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,880
a fresh starting point.

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,280
The journey you've been on to become

321
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,960
who you are today
is truly significant growth.

322
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,200
Yes, the more you experience,
the bigger the world becomes,

323
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,760
and you realize
how small you really are.

324
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
When it comes to challenges,
I don't stress over them.

325
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
There's nothing you can't overcome.

326
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,640
Being anxious
or frustrated won't help,

327
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,760
you still have to face it,

328
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,640
so why not stay calm
and deal with it.

329
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Hello.

330
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,880
How's the wind direction today?

331
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,000
-- It's perfect now.
-- It's perfect now.

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,600
Perfect, with winds
of three to four meters.

333
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,920
We are facing the wind direction.

334
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,160
Okay, put the helmet on.

335
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,720
I think it's going to be fun.

336
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,080
The wind is a bit weak now.

337
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,240
We need an easterly wind.

338
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,120
Loosen it, let go.

339
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
Woo-hoo! Woo!

340
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,920
-- Do you want to steer it?
-- Okay.

341
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,760
Is there any updraft now?

342
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,880
Is it because the air currents
here are hard to control?

343
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,120
It keeps descending.

344
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,200
Oh, no, we can't get higher,
we can't get up.

345
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,360
Uh, yeah.

346
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,440
It's not working,
let's turn around.

347
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,800
What a shame.

348
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,320
Lift up your feet
when we land.

349
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay.

350
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,640
Yes, lift up your feet,
lift up.

351
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,800
-- Okay.
-- Right.

352
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,880
How do you feel?
Did you see the lake over there?

353
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,880
No.

354
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,160
After you got up in the air.

355
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,400
I didn't get to see anything,
it's kind of a wasted trip.

356
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,280
We flew from here directly
to this peak.

357
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,320
It's the entire side
of that large area

358
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,480
we didn't get to see
the other side of this hill.

359
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
It's okay,
we have another way to scout.

360
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,800
We can go on the UTV
to do a ground survey.

361
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,360
Have you driven one before?

362
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,040
Technically, no.

363
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,440
Okay, let's start
on a relatively flat terrain.

364
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,880
-Sure.
-Get familiar with this vehicle.

365
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,920
We can only get a general sense
of the direction from here.

366
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,520
So the mountain we see
in front of us, isn't the main peak.

367
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
-We can't see it from here.
-It's over there.

368
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Right, maybe
it's covered by the sandstorm.

369
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah, we need...

370
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
To review both the footage
from the paraglider and the map.

371
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
Right.

372
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,440
Let's take
a look at the footage

373
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,560
captured by the paraglider.

374
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,520
It doesn't show the other
side of the mountain,

375
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,280
and we didn't take
the UTV over there either.

376
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
So, this is all we have,

377
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,080
and there's nothing
we can use as a reference.

378
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,360
In the end, we realized have to rely

379
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,480
on the most primitive
navigation tool.

380
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,280
Right.

381
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,680
So far, probably
only a very small number of people

382
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,920
have seen sunrise
from the Desert Everest summit.

383
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,520
It's usually around 5am.

384
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,600
If you are able to witness it,
that would be awesome.

385
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,680
Mm-hmm.

386
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,120
-- See you tomorrow.
-- On the mountain top.

387
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,240
-- Mountain top.
-- Okay.

388
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,560
All right, it's definitely
going to be your mountain top.

389
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,360
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

390
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,480
You can do it.

391
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,200
Make a surprise comeback.

392
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
Were you ready
when you were thrown into the desert

393
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,040
to face true hardship on your own?

394
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,840
I believe I'm ready,

395
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
and I've never witnessed
a sunrise before,

396
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,680
the entire process
of the sun slowly rising.

397
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,600
So, I'm really eager to see it.

398
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,840
In a sense, it's a solitary journey.

399
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,720
To be able to make it out
of this wilderness,

400
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,160
and out of this desert,

401
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,320
this journey holds some significance.

402
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
What's the true meaning of life?

403
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,760
I might not know that now.

404
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,640
Maybe as I experience
more and see more,

405
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
the meaning of life
will naturally reveal itself.

406
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,040
I wanted to reach
the base of the summit

407
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,960
before dark to set up camp,

408
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,800
so I could get some sleep.

409
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,960
Then, at the first light
the next morning,

410
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,840
I'd begin the ascent to the summit.

411
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Let's get ready.

412
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,880
I'd been anxious to set off,

413
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,200
worried about wasting time,

414
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,920
and not reaching
the base of the summit.

415
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Because I had no idea

416
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
how long and how difficult
that stretch of road was.

417
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,800
That hill was pretty steep,
and I got stuck.

418
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,120
Fortunately, my rear wheels
still had traction,

419
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
so I went in reverse,

420
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,640
and tried going forward
again in full force.

421
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,000
But I still couldn't get past

422
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,200
then I decided to find
a more manageable route.

423
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,760
It's stuck.

424
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,000
The sand dunes
were very high and steep,

425
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,560
I needed to really gas it to get up.

426
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,760
Once I got past the difficult stretch
and got to the camp site,

427
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,960
I was confident that
I could complete my journey.

428
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,040
Because I could see it,
it was right in front of me.

429
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,560
All I needed to was to walk up
with my own two feet.

430
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,800
Let me set up the tent first.

431
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
This is the perfect spot to enjoy
the view of the summit.

432
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,840
It got hot all of a sudden,

433
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,040
it was better when it's cloudy.

434
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,840
The sand is too soft, unlike snow

435
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,920
which can be packed down.

436
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,520
I might need to place the tent
pole horizontally in the sand.

437
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,240
Should have borrowed
Mr Wu's ground pegs,

438
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
would have been much easier.

439
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,760
I'm going to look around
for some wood to start a fire

440
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,560
and make a flatbread.

441
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,560
If not,

442
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
I'll have to...

443
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,320
settle for my canned food,
and some instant meals.

444
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,240
But I really want a flatbread.

445
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,720
I'll set up the tent here
and use this as a sunshade.

446
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,400
Perfect.

447
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,160
Looks like if this is set up there,
it can block the sun.

448
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,040
Now, it's not really helping.

449
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
But I get a great view here.

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,680
Let me figure something out.

451
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,840
If I move inside,
I can get away from the sun.

452
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,720
This is good.

453
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,560
All right, since
there's nothing else to do,

454
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,480
I'll go gather some wood.

455
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,480
What kind of bug is this?

456
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,560
It's coming after me.

457
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,480
Is this a dung beetle?

458
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
Another one.

459
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,880
Think I'll use paper.

460
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,640
What's going on today?

461
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,240
It lit up right away the last time.

462
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
I learned how to make
this flatbread from Mr Wu.

463
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:46,640
The idea behind it
is to heat up the sand

464
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,160
and then bake the flatbread
in the hot sand.

465
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,760
But I don't know if the fire
will be big enough,

466
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,160
because there isn't much firewood.

467
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,040
If I can get the fire started,

468
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,640
I can bake it over a low temperature
and it should, should work.

469
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,960
It should taste pretty good,
because I didn't add too much salt.

470
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,240
How much salt should we add?

471
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,200
-- It's up to you.
-- Okay.

472
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,200
Anyway, I am completely choked up

473
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,160
and can't taste any salt
at all It's all on you now.

474
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,040
Okay.

475
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,360
-- It's okay, I like salt.
-- Okay.

476
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,000
It's a bit salty.

477
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,400
I think I might pick up
some interesting recipes

478
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,560
after making this program.

479
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
I've added a bit too much flour,

480
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,200
and there is not much space
to spread it out

481
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,560
the bread might be a bit thick.

482
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,960
Oh!

483
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,440
I accidentally sprinkled
some flour on the fire,

484
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,600
that could be a problem.

485
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
Doesn't feel right.

486
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,080
There's not much firewood.

487
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,040
It's far from being perfect.

488
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
I should have started
the fire at night

489
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
it would been really beautiful.

490
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
Now, the fire has died out.

491
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,360
I think it's going to take a while.

492
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,680
I need to gather some more wood.

493
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,680
Sand got into my eyes,

494
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,440
and there's also the smoke.

495
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,520
The fire below
isn't actually very strong.

496
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,920
Some parts are still raw,

497
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,520
the middle part looks almost done.

498
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,920
I'll let it cool down.

499
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,160
Mm.

500
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,160
The taste is just right.

501
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,960
If the fire were bigger,
then it would be cooked.

502
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,000
Maybe there the dough is too thick.

503
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,240
The bread ended up being too big.

504
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,160
I made myself
a very unappetizing meal.

505
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
This talent attempt was a failure.

506
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,480
My little tent.

507
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
It's not that cold
in my little tent at night,

508
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,560
it's really quite comfortable.

509
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,520
The view tonight
is absolutely stunning.

510
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,320
The lake reflects the sky,

511
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,560
and there's still a hint of twilight.

512
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,720
The stars are starting to come out,

513
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,040
and there are so many of them.

514
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,040
Today, when I was asked

515
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,080
what kind of person
I want to be, I feel that...

516
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
the more I work on this show,

517
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
the more I want
to do meaningful things.

518
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,080
Happiness might be
the most important thing in life,

519
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,840
experiencing more, being happy,
and keep it simple.

520
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,240
I prefer simplicity,

521
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,520
but not lead a simple life, rather,
a meaningful, and fulfilling life.

522
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,280
But I want to be a simple person.

523
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,080
It's 11:30 already,
I'm going to bed now.

524
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,040
Good night.

525
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,040
It's four o'clock
in the morning.

526
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm getting ready to get up and pack

527
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,840
and be ready to head out by 4:30.

528
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
I'll bring a shoe cover,

529
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,080
so I don't have to keep taking off
my shoes to empty out the sand.

530
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,440
I can see the entire mountain range.

531
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,560
I need to find a route.

532
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,640
I need to find
the ridge line along the summit

533
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,920
as quickly as possible.

534
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,640
I hope there's not
too many ups and downs.

535
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Can't believe this is more exhausting
than climbing the snow mountain.

536
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:18,440
I think it's probably

537
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,520
because each step sinks
into the sand so deeply

538
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,080
and it takes a lot of effort to lift
my foot and take the next step.

539
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,440
I need to figure out
a more energy-efficient way

540
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,760
to climb this sand dune.

541
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,400
Just crouch down
like a gorilla.

542
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,200
Okay.

543
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,600
Don't look up,
just look at the ground.

544
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
It's going to be
an extraordinary challenge,

545
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,280
and an immense test
to get out this wilderness,

546
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,520
and out of the desert.

547
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,280
Yes, before we started,
I never expected

548
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,880
that the difficulty would
increase with each episode,

549
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,920
it has become a real challenge.

550
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,400
As I was climbing, I realized the sky
was already starting to brighten.

551
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,600
I was probably only halfway up
or just a bit more,

552
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,440
and I thought,
"I'd better pick up the pace."

553
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,960
But walking on
the sand dunes was tough.

554
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,720
With every step, the sand would
slide down because of the slope.

555
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,080
So you barely cover any distance
with each step.

556
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,360
Sometimes, you had to sprint

557
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,520
because if you didn't,
you'd slide back even more.

558
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,120
It really drained a lot of energy.

559
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,520
Ah.

560
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,240
Finally,
I've gotten up to a ridge.

561
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,320
In 20 minutes, I managed
to cover a quarter of the route.

562
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,520
At this pace,

563
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,080
I should be able
to reach by around six.

564
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,920
It's hard to imagine

565
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,880
how exhausting it would be
to climb under the sun.

566
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,240
Must be so much more exhausting.

567
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
-- Are you out of breath?
-- A little.

568
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,760
Slow down and walk.

569
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,400
Keep your heart rate down.

570
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,000
I feel great, really happy.

571
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,200
First of all, I can see the summit.

572
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,760
Wow.

573
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,920
Wow.

574
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,280
This view is only
something early risers get to see.

575
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Okay.

576
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,360
Looks like...

577
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
I just need to get up...

578
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,080
to this ridge and I can follow it all
the way to reach the summit.

579
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
Amazing.

580
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,520
Oh!

581
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,400
I think I see a sea of clouds.

582
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
Wow.

583
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,520
Let's go.

584
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,440
The sand here is softer,

585
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,440
steeper,

586
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,360
even more exhausting to climb.

587
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,920
I think I've reached
halfway up this peak,

588
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,280
or maybe not.

589
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,720
Feels like I'm halfway through
or maybe not quite there yet.

590
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,920
I need a break.

591
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,360
My handprint.

592
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
This scenery is so therapeutic.

593
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,640
Two handprints.

594
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,040
I thought it would be
easier to walk on this side,

595
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,960
it turned out to be more difficult.

596
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,440
But I feel that this
is a relatively shorter route

597
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,560
so I choose to take this path.

598
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,200
Get up there.

599
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,120
Almost there, right?

600
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,400
Almost to the top.

601
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,240
Take a sip of water

602
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,480
and ready for the final push.

603
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,520
Hundred-meter sprint.

604
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,760
This is just too hard.

605
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm regretting it now.

606
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,560
Oh!

607
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,960
All right, I give up,
this was just blind confidence.

608
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
Didn't expect it to be this tough.

609
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,760
I feel like I need to pick up
the pace, the sun is already out.

610
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Looking back now,
I think I started a bit too late.

611
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,200
I could've started earlier at night,
then I would have more time

612
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,120
to leisurely watch
the sunrise over the summit.

613
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,520
Wow!

614
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,160
It's so beautiful.

615
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,120
Stunning.

616
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
How was it?

617
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,160
So beautiful.

618
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,800
Congratulations!

619
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,080
Let's sit down.

620
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,240
I'm exhausted, but the view
here is truly breathtaking.

621
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,120
Yeah.

622
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,640
A panoramic view of the sand dunes.

623
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,440
I want to stay here forever.

624
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
You can.

625
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
-It's so beautiful.
-Stay a bit longer, soak it in.

626
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,840
Did you ever feel like
giving up along the way?

627
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,800
Not at all,
never thought of quitting.

628
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,400
Because every step
I took was making progress,

629
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,960
and I could see that
I was getting closer to the summit.

630
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,120
I kept thinking that
I was almost there and...

631
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,360
just one more push and I'd make it.

632
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,160
You found your rhythm in the desert.

633
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,320
Yeah, it's great.

634
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,720
Today's sun is all yours.

635
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,560
It belongs to everyone
who summitted.

636
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,800
This kind of memory
can only by earned

637
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,160
-through your own blood and sweat.
-Yes.

638
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,320
When I got here,
I really felt how small humans are.

639
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,280
This is just a tiny part
of the Earth,

640
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,800
but to us, it's a vast desert.

641
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,520
So I think before I die,

642
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,440
I should experience more,
see more beautiful places

643
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,240
so that when the time comes,

644
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,000
I won't have as many regrets.

645
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,720
I think the heart of this
program is about slow, steady growth.

646
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,640
Do you feel that way too?

647
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,400
Before doing this program,
I was probably

648
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,800
just going through
the motions with work.

649
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Back then, I thought the only way

650
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,760
I could really relax
was by being in nature.

651
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,600
But as I visited more places,
explored different environments,

652
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,240
and met different explorers,
I felt my world had expanded too.

653
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,760
Just like in the desert,
I made some wrong choices,

654
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,400
I've faced fears
about making decisions.

655
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,200
But you have to choose,
and you have to explore

656
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,880
life is about learning as you go,

657
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,800
and maybe it's all about constantly
"Exploring the Unknown."
