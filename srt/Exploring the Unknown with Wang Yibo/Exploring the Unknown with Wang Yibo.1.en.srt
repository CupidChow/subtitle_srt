1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,640
Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,960
Cool!

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,720
I was looking
for more creative ways

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,880
to explore the world.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,480
That's when I thought
let's give Discovery a call.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,440
As the creator
of this show what's your goal?

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,400
As your movie director

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,280
I look forward to discovering

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,480
your true intention
behind this program.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,280
In the past few years

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,400
it seems like
all I had in mind was work.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,040
But over time, I began to feel

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,680
that I need to pay attention
to my own life.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,800
I thought I should just go do
what I've always wanted to

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,640
and enjoy the process.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
Drop me some rope!

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,680
The process was indeed very painful.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,200
That's why it hurts.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,160
Whoa!

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,640
What are your thoughts
about rainforests?

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,880
I want to leave
the city life behind.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,520
Go deep into nature
in search of something untamed.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,720
Pure...

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,880
and mysterious.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,240
This program is more
about sharing the experiences

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,280
of a young person's growth
with the viewers.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,760
Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,040
This way.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Okay.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,680
Oh, .

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,640
I thought I was leaving
the concrete jungle behind.

32
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,880
But towering trees here
remind me of tall buildings

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,000
and the hum in the air of traffic.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Whoa.

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,840
This is huge.

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,480
Banyan tree is at least
seven or eight hundred years old.

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
There are more and more aerial roots

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,640
slowly wrapping around the tree.

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,680
Eventually they are going
to suffocate the tree to death.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,880
This is
the forest's natural process.

41
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Let's go this way.

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,480
Plants also compete.

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,360
We're going to hike
through the forest for four days.

44
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
The whole journey
is actually quite long.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,040
It's the first time I'm hiking
with such a heavy backpack.

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
Every step feels heavy.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,880
There's so much stuff
I'm not even sure if I'll use them.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,320
I'm heading to the rainforest.

49
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,680
The rainforest I have in mind
is extremely humid.

50
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,280
Waterproof bags.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
They are essential.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
There are a lot of bugs and snakes

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
I'd better bring along
the insect repellent.

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,560
Sleep wise, I'll go with a hammock
an inflatable mattress

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
and a small pillow.

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,080
Wow, it's really not easy packing
for this trip.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
Our expert this time,

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,120
as I understand it is someone
with strong outdoor survival skills

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,960
and a deep understanding
of the rainforest.

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,400
His name is Lao Xue.

61
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm Ensnow,

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,040
and this time we're on a quest
to find the gibbons.

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,240
But first Yibo has
to become one with the jungle

64
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
and learn its language.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,000
And in Hainan the only tropical
province South of China

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
there's plenty to discover.

67
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,800
This show is not
an adventure program

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,720
it is about a young man

69
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,760
someone we are familiar with

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,960
and how he is like
when confronted by nature.

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
What kind of person they become.

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Actually, a few years ago
it felt like I only wanted

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,680
to become a better version of myself.

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,840
But as I've gotten older

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,360
and with more life experiences
that intensity has lessened

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,000
I feel like I want to explore
and experience things

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
that I haven't seen before.

78
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,440
We're now in the Bawangling
Nature Reserve.

79
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,040
We have to find gibbons

80
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
within this
300 square kilometer area.

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
It's not going to be easy.

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,680
So, you've been
to this reserve before, right?

83
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,240
I've being in there
but I've never seen the gibbons.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,320
In the 1980s,
there were only about 10 left.

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,880
Now, the good news is

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,040
that they have recovered
to seven groups, totaling 42.

87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Curiosity could be
a particular primal motivation.

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,280
Gibbons are the real superstars
of the Hainan's tropical rainforest.

89
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,200
Do you know anything
about gibbons before?

90
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Do you know much about them?

91
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,160
I've read that they are
90 percent similar to humans.

92
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,920
I believe that their world
is actually rather complex too.

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
Nephila.

94
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,640
It's a common spider in this area.

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
It's venomous.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
What kind of fruit is this?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
This is a type of fruit
that gibbons eat.

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,600
The Large Fig.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
You can see that they grow directly
on the tree trunk

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,560
which is also a phenomenon
in tropical rainforests.

101
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
You can use it for hydration.

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Oh.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,560
Tastes good, right?

104
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
-Tastes great. Very refreshing.
-Very refreshing.

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,480
Let's go.

106
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,920
I feel like it'd be easier
to walk over there.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Watch out.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,560
Hold this, Yibo,
that one won't do.

109
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
-Mm-hmm.
-Hold this one.

110
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Oh.

111
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,440
Are you okay?

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm fine.

113
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,440
Be careful, it's very slippery here.

114
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,320
Kept getting tripped by this
can be really frustrating.

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,600
I feel really itchy here.

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,960
Right here,
can you help me take a look?

117
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,240
Wow, what is this?

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,160
-- On my waist?
-- Yes, right here.

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Oh my gosh.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
-- Should I pull it off?
-- Can you get it off me?

121
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
Think it's going to hurt.
It's just.

122
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
Aah-ha-ha-ha.

123
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
Ahhh.

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,920
-- How did it go?
-- I pulled the head off

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
but I don't dare to touch the tail.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Let me do it, where is it?

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,360
Here? Yes.

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,240
Okay.

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,320
This is a leech

130
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,400
also known as mountain leech.

131
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,720
There are also water leeches.
There are plenty of them around.

132
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,840
Whoa!

133
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,360
It's sucking your blood.

134
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
-- I don't feel anything at all.
-- Yeah.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
Pull it off.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,200
I'll pull it off here.

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,760
You can see

138
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,160
-that it has sucked some blood.
-Mm-hmm.

139
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,440
This thing can go without eating
for 200 days

140
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,280
and when it does,
it binges till it's full.

141
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,200
It's high in protein and also used
in Traditional Chinese medicine.

142
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
-Are you saying that it's edible?
-Yeah, it's edible

143
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
and can be quite expensive too.

144
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,160
-Eaten with my blood in it.
-Right.

145
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,680
Can it latch onto scalps?

146
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
-- It's possible.
-- Possible.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Wow, such a big one.

148
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,920
I was wondering
why I felt pain.

149
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,160
On my left leg too.

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,760
Three leeches.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
-Does it hurt?
-No.

152
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,280
I'll pull them off.

153
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Be careful not to leave
any of their mouthparts on you.

154
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,000
Yibo, come take a look at that plant.

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,720
Take a look.

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,680
This is called "Jiu Jie".

157
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,600
They usually grow
where leeches are found

158
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
and can be used to treat leech bites.

159
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,760
They promote blood circulation
and reduce bruising.

160
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,880
You can chew it up

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,680
and apply it
to where you were bitten.

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,080
Hmm.

163
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,240
It's still bleeding, right?

164
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,040
Hmm.

165
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Like this?

166
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,160
Yeah, add a little more saliva.

167
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,720
...your hometown to Beijing
at the age of twelve

168
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,240
and later transitioned
from a singer-dancer

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,280
to becoming an actor.

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,080
What was your mindset like
at that time?

171
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,200
When I was a kid going to school,

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,040
I was pretty independent.

173
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,760
Every day after school,
I would go home

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,200
to an empty house.

175
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,280
I would heat up the food

176
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,560
that my parents had prepared
for me in the microwave

177
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,760
and eat by myself.

178
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,240
When I left my hometown
and came to Beijing,

179
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
I was quite happy

180
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,680
as I started to live
a more communal environment.

181
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,600
Every day, I would cross the street
with my roommates to practice

182
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,760
and I felt, "Ah,
I made it out here, I'm happy"

183
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,880
I didn't miss home at all.

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,800
You see, basically
there's no gap between the trees.

185
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,680
Yes.

186
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,080
We have to figure out
how to tell directions later.

187
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,280
You have to be like
a gibbon in the forest.

188
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,720
You can only learn
about these places on your own.

189
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,000
You need to figure out

190
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,520
how to navigate
and follow their natural patterns.

191
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
This path isn't working.

192
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,120
Let's switch to the other side.

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,880
Even when you get your bearings
in the forest

195
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,760
you end up going in circles.

196
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,280
Yeah,
then you get turned around.

197
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,440
We should.

198
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,360
-If this is the path we came down...
-Mm-hmm.

199
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
...and a river forms
in the middle of the valley...

200
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Mm.

201
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,800
...then we should find a tree

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,560
to get a higher view to see
where the river is.

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,640
We need to find,
where the gibbons habitat is.

204
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Okay, let's go.

205
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,720
All right.

206
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
There might be
a river down there.

207
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Give it a good tug.

208
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,320
Be careful with this.

209
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,080
Let's go.

210
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,920
Hey, Yibo. Yibo, come over here.

211
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,720
There's something.

212
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,120
Slowly, gently.
Gently, do you see it?

213
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
What is it?

214
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,240
There is a snake.

215
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,040
A snake?

216
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
-Where?
-On that tree.

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Oh.

218
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,240
A bamboo pit viper.

219
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
You can see it from here.

220
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
-- But I can't see its head.
-- Here.

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
Can you see it?

222
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Oh.

223
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
It's not the most venomous
but it's the most common snake bite.

224
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
Its eyes are red.

225
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,840
This is the most common
venomous snake around here.

226
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,520
It can sense the heat around it.

227
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,760
It won't be fatal, right?

228
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,240
You'd need to get antivenom
it has hemotoxins.

229
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,920
Because if you move,
the blood flow increases.

230
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,760
Right.

231
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,720
Look, it's coiled up right now

232
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,200
but its striking range
can reach here...

233
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,840
-Mm-hmm.
-...even all the way here.

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,440
So beautiful.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
So, as we walk forward,
we need to watch out for snakes

236
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
here are many of them here.

237
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,360
Let's go.

238
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,520
-- Let's go around from there.
-- Okay.

239
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Wow, what is this?

240
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,080
A Strangler Fig.

241
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
So big, wow.

242
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,200
Gibbons eat
its young leaves and fruits.

243
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,320
The canopy can reach over 20 meters.

244
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm wondering if this tree

245
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
can help us find the right direction.

246
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,120
Should we climb it?

247
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Get to the top.

248
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,840
-- How? With anchors?
-- Yes.

249
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,960
We need to get to that branch

250
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,880
and then move
to the other one from there.

251
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,200
-You mean that branch over there?
-Yes, you can see it.

252
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,800
So, we toss the rope up like this?

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,080
Yes, the goal is
to get the rope over.

254
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,840
-- All right, I'll try.
-- Okay.

255
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
Aw.

256
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,520
You can try it.

257
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,880
Toss it first,
and I'll adjust the rope later.

258
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Aim for that fork
in the tree and toss it over.

259
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,040
-- I lost control of the rope.
-- Yes

260
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
You try exerting your force this way.

261
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,000
Like this.

262
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,560
Yeah, one good toss
and follow through.

263
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
-- That's quite challenging.
-- Try again.

264
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,320
It takes practice not something
you can master instantly.

265
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,960
Not high enough.

266
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
Almost, almost.

267
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,000
You stepped on the rope.

268
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,320
So close.

269
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,960
He tried for almost an hour
even when I said I'd do it

270
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,120
he still insisted on trying.

271
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,680
You just need a little more
force to get it over.

272
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,200
So, far what has been the biggest
setback you've experienced?

273
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,400
Hmm, none so far.

274
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,080
First of all,
I get to do what I love.

275
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,480
That doesn't mean
that everything is smooth-sailing.

276
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
When I started learning hip-hop,

277
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,640
it wasn't regarded

278
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,720
-as something proper.
-Improper.

279
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
My parents were against me
learning it too.

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,080
Eventually,
you convinced your parents

281
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,120
and they became supportive.

282
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,240
When I was eight or nine

283
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,880
I spent the entire summer dancing
from one in the afternoon

284
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
till nine at night.

285
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,920
Mmm.

286
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,640
At that time,
I was very committed to dancing.

287
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,960
If my parents hadn't noticed
my dedication

288
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
and talent in dancing
I wouldn't become who I am today.

289
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,440
I don't believe I couldn't do it.
I knew it's just a matter of time.

290
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,960
Yeah,
and after you kept trying

291
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,640
and finally succeeded,
that feeling is amazing.

292
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,880
Exactly.

293
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,920
First, find the end of the rope

294
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,000
then use the prusik knot to climb up.

295
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,280
Climb up step by step.

296
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,720
Second loop, third loop.

297
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,000
Pull it over
then clip onto your carabiner.

298
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,680
So the first step
is to push up the prusik knot.

299
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,760
Then put your foot into the loop.

300
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,760
Do you need
to tighten this loop with every step?

301
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,040
Yes, basically pull yourself up
then step onto it.

302
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,600
Almost there.

303
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
Can you see me?

304
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
Yes, I can see you.

305
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,480
-- Okay. Okay.
-- I'll go up now.

306
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
You can slow down a bit.

307
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,720
It sways back and forth, right?

308
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,520
Yeah.

309
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
That's okay, take your time.

310
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,760
I'm still a bit hesitant
to let go of the host rope.

311
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Now, you're like a gibbon
slowly climbing up.

312
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,920
How do I control my body
so that I don't lean back?

313
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,080
You can sit down a bit.

314
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,560
Just sit down.

315
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,160
This is it
I kept leaning back earlier.

316
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,120
-- Is it better like this?
-- Yes.

317
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,800
It was quite tiring on the arms...

318
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,200
...rather strenuous.

319
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,120
You're almost there.

320
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,760
Can you touch my hand?

321
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,720
Yay!

322
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,520
I think Yibo tried his best

323
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,360
I couldn't even balance
on the tree on my first climb.

324
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,560
He could maintain his balance
and climb so high over 10 meters.

325
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,360
That's amazing.

326
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
Wow, the view over there looks nice.

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,200
Yes.

328
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,400
So, we should head towards
that direction?

329
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Yes.

330
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,080
We need to keep going
to get to the gibbons' habitat.

331
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,120
Now that we got
our sense of direction

332
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,560
we should head
that way cross the river.

333
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,880
Then go to another mountain range.

334
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,680
Yes.

335
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Safe landing.

336
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
Good.

337
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,400
Safely landed.

338
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,480
-Yay.
-Nice.

339
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,240
Quite thrilling, indeed.

340
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,800
Tomorrow,
we'll head in that direction.

341
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
We'll continue tomorrow.

342
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,560
Let's find a place to set up camp.

343
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,680
This is a relatively flat area.

344
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,240
We can pitch our tent
between these two trees.

345
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,520
It should be able to support one.

346
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,920
Yibo is, well like me.

347
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,040
You see, sometimes I talk a lot,

348
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,000
but it actually takes time
for me to warm up

349
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,720
he is the same he needs time
to open up

350
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,360
to express himself and say it out.

351
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,120
Wow, it smells so good.

352
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Let me have a taste.

353
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,920
Oh.

354
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,600
It is very peppery, very flavorful.

355
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,440
Is that what you
are trying to achieve?

356
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
I think this is it, it's perfect.

357
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,040
It's very good.

358
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,400
-Hmm.
-Mm.

359
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,040
My favorite hometown dishes are

360
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
spicy pepper soup and beef soup.

361
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
When I was a kid,

362
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
we usually had soup for breakfast

363
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,480
before going to school?

364
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,080
I think we started doing
so around sixth grade.

365
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,800
I think we can go back
to Luoyang together.

366
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,680
Sure.

367
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,720
My first time sleeping
in a hammock.

368
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,840
It's actually quite comfortable.

369
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
Today was quite an eventful day
I got to experience...

370
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,720
...many things for the first time.

371
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,240
As we grow older

372
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
these "first" experiences
become fewer and fewer.

373
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,640
Well, I'm going to sleep now,
goodnight.

374
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,720
It was pretty cold yesterday.

375
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,680
Yes, it was really cold.

376
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,120
The temperature dropped
in the latter half of the night.

377
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,880
The cold woke me up.
So I had to put on my jacket.

378
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,600
Waking up from the cold
in a tropical rainforest.

379
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,360
We'll head towards the direction
we identified yesterday.

380
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,680
If we don't get lost

381
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,360
we should be able to reach
the river by late afternoon.

382
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
-Let's set off, it's sunny today.
-Yes.

383
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,160
It will probably be hotter

384
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,200
-than yesterday.
-Yes.

385
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,680
We need to cut through this.

386
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Let me see how can we do it.

387
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,760
I think we need
to make a detour.

388
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,560
Mm.

389
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
We can't get through here.

390
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,320
How much water
do you have left, Yibo?

391
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,120
None, I'm out.

392
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,000
None.

393
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,520
The combination
of high temperature and high humidity

394
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,400
is the biggest issue
in tropical rainforests.

395
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,720
People can get heatstroke
or even heat exhaustion

396
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,120
when the humidity and temperature
reach a certain level.

397
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
This backpack is really heavy.

398
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
We have been walking for four hours

399
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,320
on a difficult terrain
and under the sun.

400
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,840
Wow, there's water.

401
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,720
-This is amazing, feels great!
-Oh.

402
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,920
-There's a waterfall here.
-Whoa.

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,800
-There's no other way.
-Whoa.

404
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
Its cliff is angled
at over 40 degrees

405
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,680
and we can't see the bottom.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
How do we get down?

407
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,400
I think there's only one option...

408
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,800
-Oh.
-...to rappel down the waterfall.

409
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,000
Is it like climbing down a tree?

410
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,720
Do I just slowly feed the rope?

411
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,520
Yes.

412
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,080
-Similar.
-Similar.

413
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,440
Rappel down the waterfall.

414
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,120
-With the backpack on?
-With the backpack on.

415
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
Okay.

416
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,200
First, we need
to find a suitable anchor.

417
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
Like, this tree or these rocks,

418
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,160
see if there's anywhere
we can loop the rope around

419
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
like this one.

420
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,240
Use this as an anchor
and loop the rope around it.

421
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,360
We'll then rappel down this stream.

422
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,880
Let's go.

423
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,000
We need
to toss the rope down

424
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,920
I think the anchor is secure.

425
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
-Good.
-Good.

426
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
-I'll go first.
-Okay.

427
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
-Then you.
-Okay.

428
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,480
In the beginning
I was already at a high position

429
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,280
so I felt a mix of excitement,
exhilaration and fear, all at once.

430
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Are you okay?

431
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,800
Can you manage?

432
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,480
Okay?

433
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,960
-Lao Xue!
-Yes?

434
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm going down!

435
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,520
-I'm here!
-Okay!

436
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,280
Take it slow.

437
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
It's very slippery.

438
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm here to spot you,
don't worry!

439
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Okay!

440
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,480
Go slowly.

441
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,360
It's actually very slippery.

442
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,520
Moving sideways is quite slick.

443
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,440
There's water flowing,

444
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,040
and a slope is
at a semi-diagonal angle.

445
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Step on areas
where there's no moss!

446
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,880
Okay!

447
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,640
How do I get down from here?

448
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,560
Come down from here!

449
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,520
-That side is better?
-Yes.

450
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,560
When changing positions,
my feet have no traction.

451
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,320
Aren't we directly here?

452
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,480
Yes, go this way, this way.
That side is slippery.

453
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,040
-- This side is okay, I think.
-- Okay.

454
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,960
Oh.

455
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,480
Be careful keep coming down.

456
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,720
-- Are you stable?
-- I'm good. Woah.

457
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,520
Try to get rid of the backpack.

458
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,320
Throw it in.

459
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,200
Whoo!

460
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,520
Come further down.
It's safer to jump from here.

461
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,320
Okay.

462
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,120
-- Easy.
-- Easy.

463
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,400
Okay.

464
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,160
Let's go, you first.

465
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,360
This is so enjoyable

466
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,040
so much fun.

467
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,080
This was only 10 meters.

468
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,320
I think it'll be
even more interesting

469
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,560
if it's higher.

470
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,480
If there's an opportunity
in the future.

471
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,880
Definitely, you'll have.

472
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,080
In the next segment of the program
you will face very challenging tests.

473
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,640
Are you ready?

474
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,200
Usually, when I face such challenges

475
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,440
I don't prepare in advance

476
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,560
nor do I feel fear
or make assumptions.

477
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,360
It's more about how I feel
right then and there.

478
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,440
You're brave.

479
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,600
Yes, I believe there's courage
when it comes to doing what you love.

480
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,800
Sometimes, facing challenges calmly.

481
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,360
That's also
a form of mental strength.

482
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,040
Let's rest over there.

483
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,360
Let's dry our things out here.

484
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,880
Yeah, let's sun them.

485
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,200
We should find something to eat.

486
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
Yes, let's look around.

487
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
There should be plenty
to eat around here.

488
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
There's water, right?

489
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,960
I hope we can catch a fish

490
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,560
I've been looking forward
to it all day.

491
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,240
Of course, let's go

492
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,520
Going down into a small lake
to catch a fish

493
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
more like diving in to catch it.

494
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,200
Not just grabbing with hands.

495
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,200
Is there any?

496
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,440
I haven't seen any.

497
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,920
I don't dare to catch it.

498
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,440
Be careful.

499
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,080
I didn't expect it
to be so difficult.

500
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,080
I see a fish.

501
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
Quick, it's getting away.

502
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,920
Wait, wait.

503
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,240
Okay, I'll look again.

504
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
This is huge.

505
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,080
I think it's a loach.

506
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,600
We can pan fry
or roast it over the fire

507
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,280
crisp it.

508
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
Wow, this is wonderful

509
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,800
such a liberating feeling.

510
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
This is my feeling at this moment

511
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,240
I love staring at the fire

512
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,040
zoning out
and not thinking about anything.

513
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
Even though it doesn't
have a story it's just a fire.

514
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,400
The Dai people
in Yunnan likes to cook like this.

515
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,400
Ah, I know this.

516
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,200
Right.

517
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,720
Yeah, they call it
"wrapped and roasted".

518
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,360
The entire banana plant is edible
and its leaves have a great scent.

519
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,360
I think this is it.

520
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
Let me try the fish roe first.

521
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
Mmm.

522
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
How is it?

523
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
It's so flavorful.

524
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,040
I love this creamy texture.

525
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,040
Mm. Mm.

526
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
It's delicious

527
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
like fish fillet pan-fried
over high heat.

528
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,000
Very tender.

529
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,960
-So good.
-It's delicious.

530
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,560
Feels like a perfect day
since I had fish today

531
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,840
and I get to sit by the fire
something I've been wanting to do.

532
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
-And we swam.
-Yeah, and we swam.

533
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,240
Super happy.

534
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,280
Right, we did a lot of the things
that we wanted to do.

535
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,560
Yeah,
but today's hike was exhausting.

536
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,480
It was tiring.

537
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
But the reward in the evening
is so enjoyable.

538
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,400
Yes.

539
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,280
Extremely satisfying.

540
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,160
Feels great.

541
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,520
Keep walking

542
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,200
and we should be
able to see the river

543
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
after passing through that forest.

544
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,440
You have really good stamina.

545
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
-- Me?
-- Yeah, very impressive.

546
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,600
We have reached
the edge of the water.

547
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,840
Yibo, look at that.

548
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,240
Remember we talked
about a highway in the forest?

549
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,360
This is a super highway.

550
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,560
The gibbon's habitat is over there.

551
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,280
You mean the highest point?

552
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,040
Yeah, we need
to get over there in that mountain.

553
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,800
-- Let's go.
-- Let's go.

554
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,680
One, two, three, go.

555
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,080
You take that one I'll take this one.

556
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,720
-- Okay.
-- Let's swim side by side.

557
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,000
Watch out for the plants underwater
don't get tangled in them.

558
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,920
All right.

559
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,680
-- How do you feel now?
-- Pretty good.

560
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
The water is warm and nice.

561
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,160
No problem at all, yes.

562
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,720
But we might
have to swim quite a distance.

563
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,800
It's hard to trek through the forest

564
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,920
let's try to stay in the water
as much as possible.

565
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,200
There's no much resistance, right?

566
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,640
Now, we're turning.

567
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,880
Ha-ha-ha.

568
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,560
How did you learn to swim?

569
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,000
I went to the pool with my dad
when I was little.

570
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,600
And my dad taught me how to swim.

571
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,920
Was he the nurturing type,
or did he just throw you in?

572
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,800
More of the nurturing type.

573
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,400
I think.

574
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,360
That's nice, I was just thrown in.

575
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,560
That's why
I'm not afraid of water.

576
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,280
But this is my first
long-distance swim.

577
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,360
Another first in life.

578
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,960
Before we started filming,
I was so excited

579
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,240
because I was going to places
I'd never been before

580
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,160
and experiencing
things I'd never done before

581
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,880
although it's a bit tiring
and challenging

582
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,360
I got to experience
a lot of new "firsts".

583
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,720
This is what
we meant by "growth".

584
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
This word has been used so often

585
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,120
that it sounds cliche
and even a bit cringey.

586
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,920
But the truth is this is exactly
what growth is for a young person.

587
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,400
How's your bag?

588
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,840
I think it has less air than
when we first got in.

589
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,240
-Less air?
-Mm-hmm.

590
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,560
We can find a way
to inflate it later.

591
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,520
Is it still okay now?

592
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,320
It's okay.

593
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,280
There's still
some buoyancy, right?

594
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,920
Yes, quite a bit.

595
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,920
Comparing hiking
with a heavy backpack.

596
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,240
This is much more comfortable.

597
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,800
The feeling
in the water is better.

598
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,640
Yes.

599
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,960
We're moving quite fast.

600
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,800
-- Is it considered fast?
-- I think it's fast.

601
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,520
I don't feel like we're moving.

602
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,640
Because the water surface
has expanded now.

603
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,320
Right.

604
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,520
Let's go over there.

605
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Now, there's motivation
to keep going.

606
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,720
Okay.

607
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,960
-Ohh.
-Be careful.

608
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,720
Can you step on the wood?

609
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm already sitting on it.

610
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,440
Good for you!

611
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
Some parts are really deep.

612
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,120
Wow, we swam quite a distance.

613
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,240
Quite a distance.

614
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,440
Really far.

615
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,360
We can see it from up here.

616
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,720
-From up here.
-Yes.

617
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,080
We are getting closer
and closer to their habitat.

618
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,400
-Oh.
-Ah.

619
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,360
Woah, it's too heavy.

620
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,960
Let's take a break.

621
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,800
-Then we'll set up camp.
-Okay.

622
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,040
The sunset is so beautiful.

623
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,360
Beautiful.

624
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,600
Did anything get wet?

625
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,640
I saw your bag losing air earlier.

626
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Oh.

627
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,680
Ha-ha.

628
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,960
It's wet.

629
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
No wonder it sank.

630
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,600
Oh, no.

631
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,760
It's soaked.

632
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,040
We can dry it out at the camp later.

633
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,520
My sleeping bag is also wet.

634
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,600
Oh.

635
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,600
I can lend you mine.

636
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,640
The coffee beans are ruined.

637
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,880
It tastes like coffee.

638
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
So sad.

639
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,000
It's full of water
with coffee and tea inside.

640
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,040
The water turned yellow.

641
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,880
We could have just drunk it.

642
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,760
How much heavier
does it feel?

643
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
Twice as heavy.

644
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,720
About that.

645
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,520
Today was really exciting.

646
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,720
Swimming across the river

647
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,120
for the first time is incredible.

648
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,080
We swam for so long
over such a long distance

649
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,640
and now we're

650
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,400
near the gibbon habitat.

651
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,280
So close that

652
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,240
we could hear their calls
in the morning.

653
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,440
So tomorrow we're going to track
the gibbons.

654
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,840
We need to be up
and ready to go by 04:00 a.m.

655
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,720
It's already 01:00 a.m.

656
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,360
I need to get some sleep soon.

657
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,840
Hopefully we'll get to see
the gibbons tomorrow.

658
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,800
All right.

659
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,160
Time for bed, good night.

660
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,880
Slept for an hour or two
since 01:00 a.m.

661
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,640
My brain still hasn't booted up yet.

662
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,760
Hopefully we'll get to see
the gibbons.

663
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,280
We'll take only the small bags.

664
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,520
Why the gibbons
call out right before dawn?

665
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,960
To tell the mountain
who is the boss,

666
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,560
and to warn neighboring groups
not to hurt its young.

667
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,560
There will be fewer paths
like this ahead.

668
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,080
Let's keep our voices down if
we are too loud,

669
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,120
the gibbons will get scared
and run away.

670
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,600
It's about five o'clock now.

671
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,640
We've reached this platform.

672
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,440
Let's rest a bit here.

673
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,200
Gibbons are the earliest risers
in the entire mountain.

674
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,560
What time do they wake up?

675
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,120
They, they should be up soon.

676
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,600
They'll start calling out
before 06:00 a.m.

677
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,120
At any moment,
we will have to switch to.

678
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,280
Parkour mode.

679
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,200
Off-road mode, racing mode.

680
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,840
Engage four-wheel drive.

681
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,680
They're calling.

682
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,360
They're calling?

683
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,720
Didn't hear it.

684
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,680
Oh.

685
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,160
They're beginning
to call as a group.

686
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,600
The whole group calling together.
The group together.

687
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,280
Hear that? That's the first call.

688
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,040
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

689
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
Right? Me too.

690
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,480
That was a male's call just now.

691
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,400
Should we chase them now?

692
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
Hold on. Let's pack up our things.

693
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,480
Okay, ready.

694
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,640
-Let's go
-Let's go.

695
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,880
Right above our heads.

696
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,360
Right above.

697
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,680
They are here.

698
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,000
Feels like
they are right above our heads.

699
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,120
Yeah, they are here.

700
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,640
They are running away.

701
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
-- Just swinging back and forth.
-- Yes.

702
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,960
Over here and over there.

703
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,520
Now, there's one in this tree, too.

704
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,800
Ran away.

705
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,640
Too fast.

706
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,960
Okay.

707
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,680
Look, they are running.

708
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,120
Yeah, they are running.

709
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,640
We might not see
the gibbons this time.

710
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,920
Hmm, I know.

711
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,440
But I still hope
that we get to see the gibbons.

712
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Let's keep going.

713
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,480
Do they run away
as soon as they hear noises?

714
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,280
Yeah.

715
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,680
I saw it.

716
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,280
Do you see
that tree branch moving?

717
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,920
Oh, I see it, a golden one.

718
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,320
Now, there's a black one.

719
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
A tiny one.

720
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,680
It's still there.

721
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,760
Still there.

722
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,560
Very far away.

723
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,240
The focus is a bit off.

724
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
Wow, it's looking at you.

725
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,440
Yeah, right here.

726
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,040
Whoa.

727
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,160
That's a mother.

728
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,920
During the chase earlier,

729
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,080
I was both curious and excited
and my adrenaline was pumping.

730
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,520
We were climbing very steep slopes

731
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,000
and navigating
very difficult terrains.

732
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,360
But the moment we saw them

733
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,040
I felt like
"Wow, I finally got to see them".

734
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,520
One of the gibbons'
defining traits is

735
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,920
their primal
and unpretentious nature.

736
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
You're the same.

737
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,000
I sense that your innocent
authenticity is still present.

738
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Hmm.

739
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,560
How did you manage to do that?

740
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,200
Is it something
you deliberately work on

741
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,920
or is it simply part of who you are?

742
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,320
It's mostly nature,

743
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
but there is also an element
of conscious effort involved.

744
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,480
So you are still a person
who exercises self-restraint.

745
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,880
Yes, I do set high expectations
for myself.

746
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,200
I think it's also part
of my personality.

747
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,880
Even though
we've only spent a few days together

748
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,800
I can tell that he has a sense of
natural curiosity about everything.

749
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,360
I think Yibo is pretty chill
and laid-back.

750
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,320
He doesn't talk much and doesn't
react strongly to many things.

751
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,880
But when he decides on something,
he goes for it

752
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,200
and accomplishes things that

753
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,720
many people lack
the courage to attempt.

754
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,080
That's quite impressive.

755
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,600
The journey
in the tropical rainforest

756
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,800
was full of unknowns.

757
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,640
How did you handle this uncertainty?

758
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,440
When I first starting filming
in the rainforest I was excited.

759
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,720
I love trying new things
that interest me

760
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,560
which is why I enjoy
those first-time experiences.

761
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,320
Having never seen such a vast world

762
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,920
I might think
I can't break the boundaries

763
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,400
as if each experience was something
I could only have once.

764
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,320
But as I broadened my perspective

765
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,560
I realized there was so much more
to explore and discover.

766
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,960
In the end, I found that

767
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,280
there will always be
new first-time experiences

768
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,960
and in the face of nature,
we are truly insignificant.

769
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,640
Wow,
we are finally off the mountain.

770
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,760
What do you want to eat?

771
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,240
What do I want to eat?
So many different things.

772
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,400
Sugary soda.

773
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,080
Sure.
