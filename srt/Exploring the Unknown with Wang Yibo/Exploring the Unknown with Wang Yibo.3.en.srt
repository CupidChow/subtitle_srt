1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,600
Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,000
Cool!

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,880
I was looking for more
creative ways to explore the world.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,400
That's when I thought
let's give Discovery a call.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,480
As the creator
of this show, what's your goal?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,280
As your movie director,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,080
I look forward to discovering

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,600
your true intention
behind this program.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,200
In the past few years

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,400
it seems like
all I had in mind was work.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,080
But over time, I began to feel

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,480
that I need to pay attention
to my own life.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,840
I thought I should just go do
what I've always wanted to

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,320
and enjoy the process.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,920
Drop me some rope!

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,640
The process was indeed very painful.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,240
That's why it hurts.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,160
Whoa!

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Aah.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,640
What do you think of darkness?

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,000
Growing up,
I was always afraid of the dark.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,480
Now, I'm about to confront
my deepest fears

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,120
in a place where no light can reach.

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,120
It's a topic worth discussing.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,520
We have to confront darkness
no matter what.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
It's dark, pitch dark.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,760
I feel like you're going
to absolutely love this cave.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,840
Is it dark?

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, very dark.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,640
And the running streams of water
in there make it even scarier.

31
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,480
For caves to form,
there must be flowing water.

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,120
Because limestone is soluble
in water caves are formed, when--

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,320
The water dissolves
and gradually widens the hole.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,200
That's right.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,040
This time, we have come to
Yangshuo in Guilin to explore a cave.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,800
And I've invited a very skilled
caving expert Mr. Wang Hao.

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
Good.
Let's start descending.

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,800
Entrance of the cave.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
It's amazing.

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,560
Everyone knows
that Yibo is afraid of the dark

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,680
I hope that through
this cave exploration

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
he can acclimatize to the environment
in these few days

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
and that can help him
overcome his fear of darkness.

44
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Yibo's first task is to learn
the rope system in a dry cave.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,800
His second task is to apply
what he has learned

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,400
and lead us through
a water hole as a captain.

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Finally, his third mission is
to go 70 meters down the sinkhole

48
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
as his ultimate test.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,640
Okay, let's go.

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,960
Yibo, have you ever
really experienced darkness?

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
No.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,160
True darkness
is right here.

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Oh.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,240
You can turn on the headlamp.

55
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,640
We'll put our bags here.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,880
Hopefully through
this cave exploration.

57
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,360
Yibo can slowly adapt
to the environment

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,280
as he explores more and more caves

59
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,000
and picks up more and more skills
the unknowns will become knowns

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and then he won't be afraid anymore.

61
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,800
If you look at it from here,
the front looks like a side hole.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Side holes?

63
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, if you encounter
this kind of side hole,

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
you have to look inside.

65
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
How do you feel about the cave?

66
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,600
It's really dark
and full of unknowns.

67
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,600
The fear of dark actually comes more
from the fear of the unknowns.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,040
There's a sense of insecurity.

69
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,080
Actually, when I was a child
was really afraid of the dark.

70
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,240
I was afraid to be alone,

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,080
I don't know if it's because
I didn't get to spend much time

72
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
with my parents back then.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,440
I was scared to be alone
in a dark room...

74
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
when I went to sleep at night.

75
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,760
As soon as I closed my eyes
and darkness set in I was terrified.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
-Now, it's more a feeling...
-Hm.

77
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,280
...of being constrained that
makes me want to get out quickly.

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
First time
in this kind of place

79
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't know if I'll get used to it.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
But so far I don't like it one bit.

81
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,600
What was the reason
you spent less time

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
with your parents as a child?

83
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,080
Why did you spend
less time with them?

84
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Something to do with their work
plus the fact that

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
I went straight to the dance
after school

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
probably contributed to staying less.

87
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
-Let's go explore the main cave.
-Hm.

88
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay. Let's go back there.

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Get out.

90
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,640
It's getting
darker and darker inside.

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
Yes, this cavity is huge.

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
Look, Yibo.

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Oh.

94
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,120
There's a cliff down there.

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,960
Right.

96
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,520
-- That's a lake.
-- Yeah, it's a waterhole.

97
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,560
-- A pool.
-- Hmm.

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
So, what do you think?
Do you have the desire to explore?

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
I like it.

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,120
Feels like this is a lot more fun
than the narrow one below.

101
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
But before the descent

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,760
we need to do some
rope-skill training.

103
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,560
Okay.

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,960
Make an anchor
from here to here.

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Let's get the steps right first.

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,080
At the first cliff.

107
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Yibo needs to learn
Single Rope System.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Then he needs to
bolt an anchor himself

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,920
and rappel down on his own.

110
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,440
Learning by doing is
the most effective way.

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,520
This is the chest ascender
this is the hand ascender

112
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,320
there's one called the cow's tail

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,600
and then there's another one,
the descender.

114
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,520
There are four components in total
and each point

115
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,880
requires different roping.

116
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm going
to climb barehanded right now.

117
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,520
Before we bolt an anchor point

118
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
we need to hammer
the rock a few times

119
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,640
to see if it is solid or not.

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Then use a wrench.

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,600
So we tighten it
so that it will expand inside?

122
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,520
That's right,
after it expands, it won't slip off.

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,720
Be careful when you bolt the anchor
it has to be above the angle.

124
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,760
The rope can withstand vertical
friction from up-and-down movement.

125
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,040
-- Got it.
-- Grinding left and right

126
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,320
is like cutting the rope with a knife

127
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,000
when you tug at it
the rope could just snap.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,080
Ah. Got it.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You need
to have a clear mind as you climb.

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,680
Yibo needs to understand the system
and the sequence of operations.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,680
He needs to be especially
careful not to coil the rope up

132
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
in the wrong direction
on the descender.

133
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
The rope has to be free of kinks.

134
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,560
And as much as possible hang
the cow's tail

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
as a double protection.

136
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,720
Control your descending speed.
Control the speed.

137
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,440
I think I've pretty much
learned the system.

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,720
-- It's practical time.
-- Okay.

139
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,600
For safety the first thing
we need is the primary anchor.

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,600
Hold your horses.

141
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
Look I forgot to
attach the cow's tail.

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
It's too dangerous
to climb like this.

143
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Right.

144
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
-You must absolutely remember this.
-Yes.

145
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,400
-- This is no joke.
-- Yes.

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
-Attach the descender.
-Right.

147
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,920
Now, you're the frontliner.
Hang this on you.

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,120
-- I will help you.
-- Okay.

149
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
-Do I kneel like this?
-Yes.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,320
Okay.

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,080
Feels a lot safer

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,760
now that all the steps are done
I'm ready to descend.

153
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,160
Aah!

154
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
This is so much fun.

155
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,640
So interesting. Woo!

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,840
My legs are numb.

157
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,080
Actually, I think I was
quite calm just now.

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,800
My train of thought was clear.

159
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I just hope to get more
and more familiar

160
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,920
so that I won't fumble
and it won't be so stressful.

161
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
What do you
think your strengths are?

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,880
My coordination is pretty good
so when I pick up new sports

163
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,000
and complex systems like roping
and knots things

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
that require more logical thinking
I can pick them up faster.

165
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,800
Put the bags here.

166
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,400
-We can continue and go in further.
-Okay.

167
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
What kind of bug is this?

168
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,920
Let me see.
This is the Diestrammena japonica.

169
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
Ah!

170
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,480
Look, its antennae are very long.
Cave creatures.

171
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,240
Because they can't see
that's why they need long antennae?

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Right.

173
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Is it the kind
of bug that can jump really high?

174
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,960
Yes, you can see

175
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,480
that its legs are
very well developed.

176
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,640
It jumped.

177
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,040
Seems like cave bugs
typically are transparent.

178
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,280
That's
because they survive in caves

179
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,200
long periods of time

180
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,440
the color pigment on
their body surface faded.

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,240
Mmm.

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,480
It's not a pleasant sight.
Its legs, and its belly.

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,920
I just want to get out now.

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,480
-- You brought a tent too.
-- Yeah.

185
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,400
When we camp in the cave

186
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,120
we generally
just lay it on the ground.

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,440
Because it's
my first time camping in the cave.

188
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,000
Mmm.
You feel a bit insecure.

189
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,640
Yes.

190
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
To you, setting up
a tent in a cave seems fastidious?

191
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,560
I get it.

192
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,480
No, you can call me fastidious.

193
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,880
Wow. It smells so good.

194
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,720
We can't light firewood
when we camp in caves.

195
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,120
It'll get too smokey
and might affect the cave creatures.

196
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,800
Why do you like outdoor activities?

197
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,040
Camping is kind of dirty and tiring.

198
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
I like to experience
different things

199
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,360
and meet people that I usually
don't get to know through this show.

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah.

201
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,960
It sounds like work
but it's actually fun for me.

202
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
This smells amazing.

203
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,160
-- Are you full?
-- Full.

204
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,720
Let's move on.

205
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,040
We should take
a photo of this lake.

206
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,880
Hmm.

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,360
-- Whoa!
-- Whoa! It's beautiful.

208
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,480
Yes, this blue
is so fantastical.

209
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
Let's keep going.

210
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,280
This tunnel seems to be
formed by stalactites.

211
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, a lot of calcification's.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Hmm.

213
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,160
This is the first time
I've seen terraces.

214
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
The environment there
is so beautiful.

215
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,360
It's a different world
very dream-like.

216
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,200
-This one is like a jellyfish.
-Jellyfish.

217
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,480
I think that means
we have finished exploring...

218
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
-Mmm.
-...the side where we rappelled down.

219
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,880
-There is another side.
-Right.

220
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,680
Ha-ya.

221
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,640
What is this white bug here?

222
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,560
This bug is so pretty.

223
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,040
What I remember more is.
It's called Malu worm.

224
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,320
Cave Malu worms are white
and it's beautiful.

225
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
-- Is it big?
-- It's very small, look.

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,720
-- Banding Malu.
-- Banding Malu, so pretty.

227
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,320
From another perspective
everything comes from darkness.

228
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,640
As you can imagine
everything is conceived and nurtured

229
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,040
out of the absolute darkness.

230
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,520
Without darkness,
there will be nothing.

231
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,360
Mm.

232
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,440
Do you feel anything other
than fear towards darkness?

233
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,000
Occasionally it gives me
a very pleasant feeling.

234
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,840
It's a cliff
and there's a crack here.

235
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,880
This is also a cliff.

236
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,480
-I can see the way out from here.
-Mm.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,280
We got to the opposite
side of our descent.

238
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,480
I plan to build a system
to get across.

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,640
You want in?

240
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
Sure, how far is it?

241
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,080
-- About 30 meters, I think.
-- More than 30 meters.

242
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,720
Okay.

243
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
So later,
one of us needs to go down first

244
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,400
to get the rope over there

245
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,160
and bring it up.

246
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
Then we will
use it to form a bridge

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,640
-with the anchor point on this side.
-That's right.

248
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,040
-- Okay, I'll go down now.
-- Okay.

249
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,480
You can get to the bag
with the ropes.

250
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
"Okay."

251
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,720
"Do I need to bring the bag up too?"

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,680
"Yes, bring it up."

253
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,880
-Okay, Yibo you can climb up now.
-Okay.

254
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,360
How?

255
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,720
Whoa!

256
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
When I was preparing
to put on my chest ascender

257
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,080
and my hand ascender
and ready to step on it

258
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,560
that's when I just exerted force
on the chest ascender.

259
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,400
Suddenly, one of my legs came loose
the harness on my leg was loose

260
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,880
I made sure I looped it around
but it still came loose.

261
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Luckily it happened
when I was still on the ground.

262
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,760
If it happened in mid-air
it would be so much scarier.

263
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm mostly still nervous
about my leg harness right now

264
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,080
because it suddenly came loose.

265
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
Don't worry, Yibo.

266
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,640
Even if the leg harness came loose
there's still the waist harness.

267
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,640
I've been watching on my way up
to see if it's loose.

268
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,360
I'm still fearful that it'd happen.

269
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
Traversing is an outdoors
rope-bridge rescue system.

270
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,920
Next, Yibo will crawl across
on a rope at a height of 20 meters.

271
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,080
This experience will help him

272
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,240
as he explores deeper
and more complex caves...

273
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,520
tighten.

274
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,920
Just follow
my instructions next, Yibo.

275
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,960
Your leg can be like this.

276
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,160
What does he have in his bag?

277
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
Oh!

278
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,920
-Look how fast he is.
-It's still so far away.

279
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,880
Oh.

280
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,520
It's very tiring.

281
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,840
But very exciting.

282
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,560
I was focused on getting
through it as quickly as possible.

283
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,200
Because I feel that the longer
I stay in mid-air the more likely

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,640
things could get dangerous.

285
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
Come on.

286
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,080
Yibo I've gotten over here.

287
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,360
"I can see it."

288
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
On a scale of one to 10,
the tension level is now at a four.

289
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,840
Okay, no more questions
I'm ready to go.

290
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,480
It's truly very tiring.

291
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,680
"Okay, come on. Keep it up."

292
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,000
It's exhausting

293
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,560
I need a break.

294
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,680
"You can take
a short break and relax your legs."

295
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,240
I almost
couldn't take it any more

296
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,760
I was physically very tired
and I'd lost confidence.

297
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
-- "How are you doing?"
-- Pretty good.

298
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Giving up was impossible.

299
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,040
Give up and you'd
just be hanging there.

300
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,640
You can only take a short break.

301
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
You can do it,
just one last step.

302
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,880
Oh, my God, it's so tiring.

303
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,680
Oh, I'm exhausted.

304
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,960
Okay, just a little bit more.

305
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
This uphill climb
is really challenging.

306
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,600
Good.

307
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,320
Once you are out of the darkness,
there'll be light.

308
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,640
It's very tiring.

309
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
The second half
is actually an elevation.

310
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,880
Right it turned upwards.

311
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,280
In the middle it's like this
it becomes a V.

312
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Is it fun?

313
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,120
Sixty percent exhaustion,
40 percent fun.

314
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,120
First of all, I think you
have to enjoy outdoor adventures.

315
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,600
If you don't like it,
it doesn't matter no matter

316
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,720
what conditions you are in.

317
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,400
After falling in love with it
nothing you face will be difficult.

318
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,120
In fact, this trip is
an opportunity for me

319
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,560
to get out of my daily routine
and I think this experience

320
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,080
will make me feel more
motivated towards work.

321
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,080
It's getting dark.
Dinner today is beef.

322
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,160
Charcoal-grilled beef.

323
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,960
How are we going to grill the beef?

324
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,160
Toss it directly into the charcoal

325
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,760
or be a little more civilized
and skewer it?

326
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,280
Whichever way
makes it more aromatic.

327
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,520
-Let's skewer it then.
-Okay.

328
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Let's go,

329
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,200
-and see if there is any bamboo.
-Okay.

330
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,240
Sharpen it into a bamboo skewer.

331
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,320
Have you ever had barbecue
like this before?

332
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Not this primitive.

333
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,160
-- I think it is ready.
-- I'll have the first bite.

334
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,200
It smells so good.

335
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,760
-With a tint of bamboo.
-Hmm. And charcoal.

336
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,040
I first went into the cave
with a flashlight.

337
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,680
As I learned more about
the environment in there

338
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,960
what kind of creatures live in it.

339
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,600
I feel safer to sleep
in there at night.

340
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,200
Gradually, as I become more
aware of the surroundings

341
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm no longer afraid of the dark.

342
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,080
I think it's actually
quite comfortable

343
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,680
to sleep in the cave.

344
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,240
It is quiet, and it's pitch black.

345
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
How did you sleep last night?

346
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
Did you hear any strange sounds?

347
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,680
No, I slept very comfortably.

348
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,920
Mmm.
You are not afraid anymore?

349
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,520
Not at all,

350
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
because there's someone next to me
so I wasn't afraid.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,960
If it were just me,
I'd probably be scared.

352
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,960
After exploring
the Swallow Cave

353
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
I've designed something for you

354
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,880
which should be one
of your favorite activities.

355
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,760
Oh.

356
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,880
Today we might be swimming
in an underground river.

357
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
That's great.

358
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm going to add a few
new pieces of equipment for today.

359
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,240
There are also waterproof clothes.
This is an underwater scooter.

360
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,120
Oh, because there is an
underground river in this cave

361
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,960
with this, you can save
a little energy.

362
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,120
This water is flowing out
from the hole.

363
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:13,960
Ah.

364
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,600
It's beautiful here.

365
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,800
Compared to the Swallow Cave

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
this cave entrance
is much more spectacular.

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Right.

368
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,840
-This is the Fishbone Cave.
-Hmm.

369
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,720
Look at this water flow.
It is a water hole.

370
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,520
-Right. Okay.
-We will be swimming against current.

371
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
Today you can try to be
the team captain.

372
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,640
-Okay.
-Are you confident?

373
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,560
Absolutely.

374
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
Let's go.

375
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,840
After yesterday's training.

376
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,720
Yibo is becoming more familiar
with this rope system.

377
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,160
Starting with Fishbone Cave

378
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,800
he can take the lead
and really enjoy caving.

379
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
I guess
I should go up from there.

380
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,800
Right.

381
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,240
Turn on the headlamp.

382
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,600
-We should keep going. Mmm.
-Let's walk up there.

383
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,600
Okay.

384
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,160
-There's no passage here.
-What are we going to do

385
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,800
at this dead end?

386
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Let me see if I can...

387
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,840
go down without a rope.

388
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,760
It seems to be a bit difficult
to climb this way.

389
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,800
Yes, it's all cliffs here.

390
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Come, let's change
into dry suit first.

391
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Okay.

392
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
We should carry
all our gear down right?

393
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,800
Right.

394
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,440
This is the underwater scooter.

395
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,360
It's like a propeller
that we can hold onto

396
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,400
and it pushes us forward, right?

397
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,560
-- That's right.
-- Okay.

398
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
To be honest,
we have really pushed you

399
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,720
hard to get you out
of your comfort zone.

400
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
How did you eventually do it?

401
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,400
Actually, when it
comes to comfort zones

402
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,680
I think maybe everyone
has a different definition.

403
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
Sometimes
when I'm faced with challenges

404
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,760
I try to simplify them in my head.

405
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,520
I feel that if I'm doing what I love

406
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm actually still
in my comfort zone.

407
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,000
-- I'll go first.
-- Okay.

408
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,080
Because there are
many uncontrollable factors

409
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,520
in underground rivers.

410
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,880
I'd like to go down
and check it out first.

411
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,840
Watch your head here.
You might want to squat down.

412
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,600
It's an overhang.

413
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,040
Step with one foot on it like this
let the body lean back.

414
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
Okay.

415
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,560
-- Did you scrape your hands?
-- No.

416
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,480
Okay.

417
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,720
Okay.

418
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,800
It's hollow beneath the under-hang

419
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,200
it's not going to be
easy to get down.

420
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
-- Is it cold?
-- Not too bad.

421
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,840
-Okay.
-I'll go this way.

422
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,600
Oh-ho.

423
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Get the hang of it first.

424
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,760
I think
water got in, it's not moving.

425
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,800
Try it out,
it can't increase the resistance.

426
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,320
Position your body on it.

427
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,320
Like this.

428
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,280
It's not moving at all.

429
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,920
How should I put it? Feel it out.

430
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,560
If you can, let's just move.

431
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,440
Yea, let's move.
This is awkward.

432
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,040
Mm. Let's move on.

433
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,280
If we can't get over,
let's try using this again.

434
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,520
Now, it's time to swim.

435
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
You need
to kick with your legs.

436
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,160
This thing still comes in handy.

437
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,880
-Yibo.
-Good.

438
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
Have you figured out
how to handle it?

439
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,520
Soon.

440
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,840
Let me get into position first.

441
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,800
Have you noticed
that we just need to? Float on it.

442
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
It'll start propelling forward
with very little resistance.

443
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,040
It's not moving any more, why?

444
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,520
Get as close
to the rock wall as possible.

445
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,280
Kick your legs, keep kicking.
That's right.

446
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,000
Right. Are you getting
the hang of it?

447
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,800
Mmm.

448
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,320
I feel like
I'm a little better off this way.

449
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,320
This is pretty fun.

450
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,600
There's no road ahead.
Let's do this then.

451
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,440
See if you can pitch your tent.

452
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,960
Yeah, here is good.

453
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,040
Cooking sausages
inside the cave.

454
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,120
This smells so good.

455
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,920
Aww!

456
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,080
Rinse it.

457
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,000
Can tell that this meat
is going to be great.

458
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Take a bite.

459
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
I'm going to have a taste.

460
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,800
Mmm. It's smoked.

461
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,240
-Mmm. Delicious.
-Very tasty.

462
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's add
some oil to the hot pan...

463
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,240
-Mmm. Ooh.
-...then saute this pepper.

464
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,560
It looks so pretty
with just some pepper.

465
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,400
Mmm.

466
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,360
Should we remove it
from the heat?

467
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,400
Or put the lid on
and shake it like this?

468
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,040
That's a good idea.

469
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,920
Okay, remove from heat.

470
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,600
All done.

471
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
Let's eat!

472
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,520
Mr Wang Hao gets
the effect of variety shows.

473
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,120
There's should be
some twist and turns, right?

474
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
Right.

475
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,960
Then we can eat.

476
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,280
How did it feel
swimming in the water just now?

477
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,320
Pretty exciting.

478
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,560
Yeah, were you nervous

479
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
in places where the water
current was strong?

480
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,040
Not really.

481
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,200
I still felt quite safe.

482
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
With all the gear.

483
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,200
Yeah, we were very well equipped.

484
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,880
Right,
so if we didn't have those gear

485
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,120
I probably won't go into the water
as long as I can help it.

486
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
So, you're a gear fanatic?

487
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,800
Absolutely.

488
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,920
In fact, I believe that gear is
essential to any outdoor activity.

489
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,600
It's a necessity.

490
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,960
With proper equipment,
you will then have confidence

491
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
and a sense of security.

492
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,760
Be in the tent myself,
and Mr Wang Hao

493
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
I felt pretty comfortable
even in darkness.

494
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,880
Even as I opened my eyes
the next morning

495
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,960
when it was still dark...

496
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,160
I felt like going back to sleep.

497
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,160
It was very comfortable.

498
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,960
The surrounding was beautiful

499
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,960
and in that environment,
I wasn't afraid of darkness.

500
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,280
Today, we'll continue exploring

501
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,280
along the underground river.

502
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,400
The current is a bit strong.

503
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,800
In that case,
I think we should go this way.

504
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,720
-- This way is good too.
-- It's a bit deep over here.

505
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
-Am I right?
-Right.

506
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,520
I think it's
better to go that way.

507
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,360
Okay.

508
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,080
Be careful with this.
Watch out This rock is not stable.

509
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,920
Hmm.

510
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,000
Doesn't look like there's
a way to get down.

511
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,600
Just step over it.
The water is a little shallower here.

512
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,200
-- There's a fork road here.
-- Right.

513
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,080
There's water,
this should be the main cave

514
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,560
-and this is the side cave.
-Right. Right.

515
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
But this side hole
is also very huge

516
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,360
shall we go into this side hole
where there is no water?

517
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,040
You're now
the captain, you decide.

518
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I think it's
a bit difficult to walk in water.

519
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,400
Shall we go and take
a look inside the side hole?

520
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
-- Go and take a look.
-- Okay.

521
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,080
-- I can feel some hot air.
-- Hm.

522
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,880
The sound of the water is
getting quieter and quieter.

523
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,760
Yeah.

524
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,640
If the water flow is big
you'd have seen a waterfall here.

525
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,440
Yeah.

526
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
Now, the water flow
is too weak.

527
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,880
Here's another one. Side holes.

528
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,040
Nature will always
leave humans a way out.

529
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,520
-- Over here.
-- Whoa!

530
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,240
Look, there is
a deep pool down there.

531
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,880
Whoa.

532
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,440
That's kind of interesting.

533
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,680
Left or right?

534
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,200
It feels like
it's easier to walk here.

535
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,680
The terrain is flatter.

536
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,640
-- There's a path here.
-- Have a look.

537
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,040
It should be passable

538
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,520
under such a large rock.

539
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,160
Yeah, we won't be able to see it

540
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,360
with the naked eye from outside.

541
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,520
Can't tell at all.

542
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,800
You can only
find it if you crawl in here.

543
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,840
Do you hear the sound of water?

544
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,680
Yes.

545
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,360
-- The sound of water flowing.
-- It's pretty loud.

546
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,480
-- And air.
-- Yeah.

547
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,800
It has cooled down
out of a sudden.

548
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
Mm.

549
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,480
Do you want
to go down from here?

550
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,360
-- I think it's doable.
-- Yes.

551
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,000
Can you see the river?

552
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,320
I see the river

553
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,480
I feel that the river we saw earlier
is connected to the main cave.

554
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
If you want to be
the first to explore the cave

555
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,760
you should go first.

556
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,320
Okay, I'll go first

557
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
I feel like I need to lie sideways.

558
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,480
Lie on your side for a while.

559
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,720
-- Can you get through?
-- Yes.

560
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,920
Are you enjoying it now?
Is it fun?

561
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,200
I sense that there's
no fear in you any more.

562
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,640
Yeah, no fear at all.

563
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,680
What's wrong?

564
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
I'm out.

565
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,200
Whoa!

566
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,120
How is it outside?

567
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
Very exciting.

568
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,760
It's pretty high, and very steep.

569
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
We got to be careful.
Right.

570
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,080
It's okay.

571
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,600
This time the adventure
in this program is not as extreme

572
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,640
actually, far from it.

573
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,040
How do you define danger?

574
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,360
Actually, when I was
going through these activities

575
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,080
I wasn't thinking about
what could have happened.

576
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,640
I was focused on the process
and working hard to get through them.

577
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,040
Now, Yibo is down there by himself

578
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,560
I'm not sure how he feels.

579
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
I think it's exciting and fun.

580
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Mainly because we were
in a small confined space

581
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,480
and then it suddenly opened up
that really made me felt exhilarated.

582
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,280
Mmm.

583
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,920
Okay.

584
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,680
I was the first to get out

585
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,920
I experienced
a true caving adventure.

586
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,280
Yibo, look.
The cave entrance is right ahead.

587
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,440
Let's go.

588
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,560
This is so beautiful.
This water is so clear.

589
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
Yeah.

590
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,720
How does it feel
coming down from that little hole

591
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,240
and seeing the light?

592
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,160
It feels
like I have explored the cave.

593
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,200
-- Inside out?
-- Yes, inside out.

594
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,640
At this moment
how do you see yourself,

595
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,120
and how you see
the world around you?

596
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,920
It seems
like everything will go smoothly

597
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,560
as if, in my heart that there
is nothing that cannot be done

598
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,720
or can't be achieved.

599
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,080
We can get out from here later.

600
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
-Okay.
-After we get out,

601
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,720
I'll take you to a sinkhole.

602
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,040
-Sinkhole.
-You have to be your own captain

603
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,120
in this sinkhole.

604
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,760
You have go down
and set the anchor yourself.

605
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,160
-- Sure.
-- Okay.

606
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Let's go.

607
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,680
You can see
the sinkhole from here.

608
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,520
Right.

609
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,840
Does this sinkhole match
the sinkhole in your head?

610
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,680
Any difference?

611
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,960
-- I thought it was a--
-- Very small one.

612
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,240
Small ones are called skylights.
The big ones are shafts.

613
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,280
And even bigger ones, for example
holes with lengths and widths

614
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,080
of more than a hundred meters
are called sinkholes.

615
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,920
It'll feel even more stunning

616
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,600
if you stand at
the bottom of the cave...

617
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,560
-Mmm. Mm.
-...and look up.

618
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,440
-Do you dare to descend?
-Sure.

619
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,640
-Then let's go.
-Let's go.

620
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,720
We can see the bottom now.

621
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,400
Put on your gear first.

622
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,600
If you lose the wrench
on the cliff

623
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,720
you can still tie a rope
around yourself.

624
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,440
Okay.

625
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,920
Do not place your hands too close
to the descender.

626
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,800
Mmm. It'll get stuck easily?

627
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,440
Okay. It's still smooth.

628
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,800
I think I might have
a longer reflex arc

629
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,360
or I don't typically react
strongly to sudden events

630
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm relatively calmer
and more rational.

631
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,240
What is the difference

632
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
between making an anchor point here
and in the cave?

633
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,520
It's darker in the cave
and you can't see the bottom.

634
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,960
-Right.
-So visually it's less impactful...

635
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,440
-Right. Right.
-...and relatively not as scary.

636
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,240
When choosing an anchor
point be sure to look behind you

637
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,840
and below you
underneath the descender.

638
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,000
I'll probably
go down from here

639
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,680
but it's going to rub
against this rock, right?

640
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,360
If you want to change
the anchor point and fix it here.

641
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,160
Will that solve the problem?

642
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,520
Like this, yes?

643
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
Hmm. Yes.

644
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
-Let's fix another one here then.
-Right.

645
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,360
Let's do what is needed safety first.

646
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,040
I'll head down then.

647
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
A bit scary now, right?

648
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,800
There is a bit now.

649
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,640
Let me move it little by little.

650
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,680
Kind of exciting.

651
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,320
-- Have you switched?
-- Yes.

652
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,240
I'm coming down then.

653
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,880
Do you feel like crying?

654
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,680
Not crying necessarily
but it's a little scary.

655
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,120
You have to trust
your skills and your ropes.

656
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,880
Any question?

657
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
-- No problem I'll head down.
-- Go on.

658
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,760
You're at that height
and doing this

659
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,000
you're going to be extremely
focused and nervous.

660
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,160
So you will be very careful
and double check everything.

661
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
I think it's okay.

662
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,480
Don't think too much.

663
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,280
It's just like controlling
the gas pedal.

664
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Hanging at 70 meters
above ground

665
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,640
on just two nails and one rope

666
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,760
you don't know if the rope
is going to fall all of a sudden.

667
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,400
I'm ready to descend now.

668
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,360
Three, two, one.

669
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,560
On some levels,
I still don't quite believe in myself

670
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,240
so there will be a mental block.

671
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,480
Whoa.

672
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Oh-oh-oh.

673
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,120
It's pretty high...

674
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,520
...and very thrilling.

675
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,240
Ah.

676
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,800
This time I think I have
really encountered a challenge

677
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,360
a very difficult challenge.

678
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,880
It's very exciting

679
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,240
especially when I was hanging
on the rock wall that feeling

680
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
was really exhilarating.

681
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,680
It's the closest to danger and death

682
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,080
that I've ever felt.

683
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,400
How do you feel
after rappelling down?

684
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,480
It feels great to come down.

685
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
It's so tiring.

686
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,280
My arms are sore.

687
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
It felt really good
to sit there just now.

688
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,080
There was a genuine sense of clearing
your mind and experiencing life.

689
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,120
Because you are
somewhat close to death

690
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,760
you feel this infinite
emptiness and relaxation

691
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,200
yet you feel so alive.

692
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,720
It's a beautiful memory.

693
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,760
I think Yibo is very
self-motivated and an action lover.

694
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,200
He is always curious about the world

695
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,960
and he's full of confidence
throughout the exploration.

696
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,120
He learns and picks up
techniques very quickly

697
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,000
and he has successfully overcame
his life-long fear of darkness

698
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,080
I'm very impressed by him.

699
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,640
I can't wait to go home

700
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,920
and share everything I've experienced
over the past few days

701
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,120
with my children.

702
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,760
Darkness can also be infinite.

703
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,760
Yes.

704
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,160
Your sense
of fear could also be...

705
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,480
I think most people are afraid
of the dark when they're young.

706
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,880
It's really about the unknown

707
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,000
I believe fear comes
from the unknown.

708
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,040
It's only after you've experienced
and understood it

709
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,600
will you stop being afraid of it.

710
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,040
Widen your vision learn more

711
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
explore the unknown.

712
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,240
The more you know, the less you fear.

713
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,360
It's half past six,
I think it's good to have a feast.

714
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,640
-- Let's go.
-- Let's go.
