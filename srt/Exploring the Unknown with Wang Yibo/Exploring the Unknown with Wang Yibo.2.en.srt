1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,640
WANG: Woo-hoo! Woo!

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,040
Cool!

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,920
I was looking for more creative ways
to explore the world.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,440
That's when I thought
let's give Discovery a call.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,520
CHENG ER: As the creator of this show
what's your goal?

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,480
As your movie director

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,320
I look forward to discovering

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,480
your true intention
behind this program.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,400
WANG: In the past few years

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,000
it seems like all I had
in mind was work.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,120
But over time, I began to feel

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,520
that I need to pay attention
to my own life.

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,840
WANG: I thought I should just go do
what I've always wanted to

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,360
and enjoy the process.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,000
Drop me some rope!

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,680
The process was indeed very painful.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,240
That's why it hurts.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,000
BOTH: Woah!

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,240
This time you'll climb up
to a very high altitude.

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,720
Are you ready for the test
of the snow mountain?

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,280
WANG: They say valleys and peaks
mirror life's ups and downs.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,840
I wonder,
is that why mountains are sacred?

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,640
I hope this journey provides space
for reflection and growth.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,000
CHENG ER: This program is more
about sharing the experiences

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of a young man's growth
with the viewers.

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm feeling a little unwell.

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,760
My head felt swollen all the time
and then I felt dizzy.

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,040
ZHOU PENG:
Let's put it here. Put it here.

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,960
The horses will come over in a moment
and they will carry it.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,480
We can just carry our bags and go.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
WANG: Okay.

32
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,880
Every peak, whether in a career
or on a mountain,

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,200
comes with its own challenges.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,440
We are in Gangshika, Qinghai.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,000
I will be climbing
my first 5000-meter peak.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,920
Then snowboard my way back down.

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
ZHOU PENG: Do you feel sick?

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,680
WANG: Just hard to breathe
but my head doesn't hurt.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,680
ZHOU PENG: One of our biggest
problems is the high altitude.

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
WANG: Our expert this time
is Zhou Peng.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,520
I know he is skilled in
mountain climbing and rock climbing.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,920
As well as alpine skiing.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
He is really brilliant.

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,760
So I trust him completely
to follow him

45
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,480
on this snow mountain exploration.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,760
-ZHOU PENG: Hello, Yibo.
-WANG: Hello.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
ZHOU PENG: Very happy to meet you.

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,840
My name is Zhou Peng
and I am a free climber.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,920
My two favorite things
are going out to climb myself

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,840
and teaching others to climb.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,160
It's a pleasure to climb
the mountain with you.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,800
ZHOU PENG:
There are quite a few things for you

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
to pick up over these few days.

54
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,320
First, we will head to
the Seven-Colored Waterfall area

55
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,200
for some rock climbing training

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,600
then we'll continue upward
to the base camp.

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,320
The next day, we'll ski off-piste.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,640
After that, we'll go for the summit
and then descend from there.

59
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
CHENG ER: Are you
a mountain climbing enthusiast?

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,800
I have climbed before but not often.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,480
But I do love mountain climbing.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,400
When you climb to a high place it
offers you a new perspective.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,080
So, how do you view
your own perspective?

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,440
How do you see yourself,

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,000
and how do you see
the world around you?

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,520
I never seemed
to have a specific goal

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,480
of whom I wanted to be
or what my future held

68
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
or what goal I was going to achieve.

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,560
It seems like I was just following
my heart with everything.

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,960
ZHOU PENG: Slow down.

71
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,400
If you're feeling
a little out of breath.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
Just slow down.

73
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,160
WANG: At high altitude,
every step you take

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,320
and every movement you make
requires more effort and more oxygen.

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
So for anyone
going to high altitudes.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
It's best to slow down your movements

77
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,800
calm your mindset

78
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,160
and speak at a slower pace.

79
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
ZHOU PENG:
The weather is a little rough today.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
WANG: Yeah.

81
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,200
But we can learn the basics
of setting up anchor points here.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Then once we are
on the climbing route

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,760
-we will know how to do it properly.
-Okay.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
ZHOU PENG: Okay.

85
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,880
Here we go.

86
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,040
This is our mechanical plug.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,440
We can put the mechanical plug in.

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,680
Now, I need you to get this thing.

89
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,880
WANG: Get it out.

90
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
ZHOU PENG: Good.

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,240
Here's what we're going to do.
We need to get the rope up here.

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
Then we need to use the belay device.

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,480
This is what we call the belay
it's also called the descender.

94
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,680
When I'm climbing, you're going
to protect me from falling.

95
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,880
Tidy up the ropes.
You can try this operation yourself.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
-Okay.
-ZHOU PENG: Good.

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,440
WANG: When we went up the mountain
it started to drizzle

98
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,240
so we started learning rope work
in the light rain.

99
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,320
ZHOU PENG: Right. That's right.
Very good. Just like this.

100
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Okay.

101
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,200
WANG: I like it when it rains.

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,360
So I felt very comfortable
with how our first day went.

103
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,800
And I love learning those things too.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,280
You can release this hand
at any time.

105
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
It's okay to just hold on lightly
with this hand.

106
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,520
That way you can take a breathe.

107
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
WANG: Got it.

108
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,640
When I had gotten the basics down

109
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,000
and was about to start climbing
the rain got heavier and heavier.

110
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,480
ZHOU PENG:
The weather at high altitudes

111
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,360
might be good in the morning
then it gets really rough by noon.

112
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
WANG: The weather is uncontrollable.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
ZHOU PENG: There's already
such a big pool of water here.

114
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,160
It's time to make a decision.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
I think I'll give it a try.
If it doesn't work I'll come down.

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
Okay.

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,360
I am already here
why not give it a go.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,280
CHENG ER: I believe
when you are up on the snow mountain

119
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,000
you will be under quite
a bit of stress.

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Have you experienced any
particularly stressful situations

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,720
in your current work?

122
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,480
I don't really have
that much stress at work.

123
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,840
For me, days without
filming are all good days.

124
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,840
We had a movie that just wrapped.

125
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,280
Two or three days ago.

126
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,840
Like you just said

127
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,480
after that film was wrapped
I felt no stress from work.

128
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,320
ZHOU PENG: The weather
is changing too fast today.

129
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,200
It's now snowing.

130
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,680
In heavy downpours

131
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,280
it will be extremely difficult
to climb up rocks like this

132
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
because they get very slippery,

133
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,320
but with this light snow,
it is still doable.

134
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,680
Okay with you?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,240
-WANG: Okay.
-ZHOU PENG: Here we go.

136
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,240
WANG: Okay.

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,680
As you grip the rocks,
you need to test their stability.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
WANG: Okay.

139
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,800
ZHOU PENG: Focus on your foothold.
Step with your toes.

140
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,360
The lighter your hand grip,
the better.

141
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,000
It's the first time
I see rock climbing on-site.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,320
WANG: It should be fun.

143
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,680
-Loosen the rope a little.
-Okay.

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,440
ZHOU PENG: "Yibo,
you can release the protection."

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,440
WANG: Copy I'm releasing it now.

146
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,640
Before I started climbing
I was quite excited

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
and was looking forward to it.

148
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,760
After only four steps,
I was already tired.

149
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
And then while at it, I realized
that it was very challenging.

150
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
It was so difficult
to remove the plug.

151
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,600
Okay.

152
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,240
This exploration
is really quite a challenge.

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,400
It's high altitude and the snow.

154
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,160
The climbing shoes
were not right either.

155
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,520
It was also my first time,
and it was cold.

156
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,040
I can't step over it.

157
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I've reached the first ledge.

158
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm going to take a break
and then continue.

159
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
ZHOU PENG: That's great.

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,960
It's really hard.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
WANG: Whoa!

162
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, I'm going to proceed
to the next segment.

163
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,240
In the second part of the climb

164
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
the cracks between the rocks
were very narrow

165
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,440
there were no hand crimps.

166
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,280
I was basically rubbing my hands
against the rocks.

167
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
ZHOU PENG:
There are some very decent crimps

168
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,560
towards your left hand.

169
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,840
ZHOU PENG: You should be getting
to the last challenge, right?

170
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,920
WANG: Yes.

171
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,960
ZHOU PENG: Very good.

172
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,840
ZHOU PENG: Wow.

173
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,600
That's great.

174
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
How does it feel?
Your first time.

175
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,800
WANG: It's so exhausting.

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,520
My first climb was on a snowy day
and at high altitude.

177
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
-ZHOU PENG: It's extreme.
-WANG: It's quite challenging.

178
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
Fortunately,
we were able to do it in segments

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,320
-I could take breaks in between.
-ZHOU PENG: Right.

180
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,640
Fortunately, I had your help.

181
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,600
If weren't for you
I wouldn't have made it.

182
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,560
It's so tiring but a lot of fun.

183
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,080
ZHOU PENG:
This is a very high starting point

184
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
for a first-time climber.

185
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay, excellent.

186
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,240
WANG: I'm so hungry,
I want to pitch a tent here.

187
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,200
ZHOU PENG: Okay.
Let's find an appropriate location.

188
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
This is our tent.

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,320
WANG: I've always
wanted to pitch a tent in the snow.

190
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,600
We can finally sit down.

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,400
ZHOU PENG: Let's start cooking.

192
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Or you cook and I'll make coffee.

193
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,240
Sure.

194
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,440
So, what's for dinner?

195
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,760
ZHOU PENG:
It's going to be a surprise.

196
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,240
We have pasta and steak.

197
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
Let's have steak.

198
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
ZHOU PENG: Okay.

199
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,760
That's great.
We even have hand-brewed coffee.

200
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,120
Ha-ha-ha.

201
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,280
ZHOU PENG: Have you ever camped
at such a high altitude?

202
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,400
-WANG: It's a first for me.
-ZHOU PENG: First time.

203
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,840
So many first experiences.

204
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,720
There are a lot of firsts
doing this show.

205
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
The coffee is ready.

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,320
-Thank you.
-WANG: Cheers.

207
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,400
-ZHOU PENG: Enjoy this moment.
-Yes.

208
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,480
Are you a foodie?

209
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,760
Not really, but I did start cooking
at a very young age.

210
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,080
No matter what,
everything tastes great

211
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,160
when you are eating outdoors.

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
Almost ready.

213
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
WANG: Good.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
-ZHOU PENG: How does it taste?
-Wow!

215
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
It's so tasty.

216
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,120
ZHOU PENG: I think it's okay.

217
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,400
It's delicious beyond just okay.
Very tasty.

218
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,200
Mr. Zhou, with all the mountains
that you have climbed

219
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,920
especially the high-altitude

220
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,640
one do you have a most unforgettable
challenging and dangerous moment?

221
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,160
Hmm.

222
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,120
It's hard for me
to answer what is my "most"

223
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,960
because every climb has
its challenges I agree.

224
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,080
ZHOU PENG: We are going to conduct
an avalanche search

225
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,520
and rescue exercise here.

226
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
WANG: Okay.

227
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
It is an essential skill
for every alpine skier.

228
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Next I've already buried a dummy
inside the snow

229
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,920
then the two of us
are going to rescue it.

230
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,720
Okay.

231
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,960
Okay, the current situation is
an avalanche just occurred around us

232
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,400
-and then there is...
-Why do you suddenly start acting?

233
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,760
It's a process that requires
some scenario acting.

234
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,000
It's a very urgent situation.

235
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,160
One of our teammates
was swept away by the avalanche.

236
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,680
-WANG: Mm-hmm.
-We can't see him at all.

237
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,840
We need to find him right away.

238
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,280
Let's go.

239
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,560
-WANG: Now, it's on search mode.
-ZHOU PENG: Yes, it's on search mode.

240
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,960
Okay.

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,600
Walk straight,
following the direction of the arrow.

242
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,280
Put this on the snow
when you are about one meter from it.

243
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Let's walk. 1.5 meter, 1.1 meter.

244
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,200
Okay, you can make a mark here.

245
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,120
And then we will use this probe.

246
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,600
That's right.
Stick the probe into the snow.

247
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,800
Stick it in.

248
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,080
That's right.

249
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,280
Stick it in.

250
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,600
Stick it in.

251
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,960
WANG: Over here.

252
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,160
ZHOU PENG: Here? Good.
Now, put the probe away.

253
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Okay, good.

254
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,040
Let's get ready to start digging.

255
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,640
The distance we have to dig
is 1.5 times the depth of burial.

256
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Okay.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,280
Come. Let's do it together.

258
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,000
The critical window for rescue
is only about three to five minutes.

259
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,720
Okay.

260
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,840
We found it.

261
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
WANG: Okay.

262
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,640
Begin CPR.

263
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,920
ZHOU PENG: We saved him.

264
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,920
You did well.

265
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,160
Look both of us are already
out of breath after just a few digs.

266
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,080
WANG: Yeah.

267
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,080
So when a person is actually buried
about one-meter deep

268
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,520
it's going to very exhausting
digging him out.

269
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,080
-Good. That was perfect.
-WANG: Good.

270
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,400
ZHOU PENG:
Let's keep climbing from here

271
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,560
then we will get to the base camp.

272
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,360
WANG: Okay.

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
It feels like there's
still a long way to go.

274
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,440
ZHOU PENG: It's not that far.

275
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,280
Not too far.

276
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,400
Do you feel stuck in your career
for some reason?

277
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
I think I might have a direction

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,640
but it's not as clear as it
was when I was younger.

279
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,760
For example, when I was a child
my dream was to become a singer.

280
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,560
After achieving that
now I aspire to be a great actor.

281
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,200
But what is a dream?

282
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,160
It seems like
once the first dream is fulfilled.

283
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,120
I haven't found my second dream.

284
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,040
ZHOU PENG:
The mountain climbing process is

285
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,240
a real-life escape game
with life and death consequences.

286
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,320
It's possible that
you might not make it back.

287
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,120
Wang: Mmm.

288
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,520
ZHOU PENG: In the past
I thought incidents like this

289
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
had nothing to do with me.

290
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,080
-These things wouldn't happen to me.
-WANG: Mmm.

291
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,880
ZHOU PENG: I used to feel like I was
the person most favored by God...

292
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,200
...but in reality,
that's not the case.

293
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,000
ZHOU PENG: Yibo.

294
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,400
How do you feel right now?

295
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,040
How bad is your headache now
on a scale of one to ten?

296
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,120
WANG: Between four and five.

297
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
ZHOU PENG: How many times
did you wake up last night?

298
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
WANG:
I think about three or four times.

299
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,920
I had difficulty breathing
and also having headaches.

300
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,520
ZHOU PENG: How do you feel
after a break?

301
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,440
-Let's get up and eat something.
-WANG: Okay.

302
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,840
ZHOU PENG:
Also, we should step outside,

303
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,680
sit or walk around a bit
the air is fresher outside.

304
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,080
WANG: Okay.

305
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,000
So, why are you doing this?

306
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,080
It's a long story.

307
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,880
Why do you like someone?

308
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,520
-Why do you like coffee?
-Just like it no particular reason.

309
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,960
Right.

310
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,840
WANG: In fact, sometimes there
is only one moment in your heart

311
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,560
when you can really feel it.

312
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,480
Yes, often, our purest
form of liking something

313
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,200
is when we don't need to explain
why we like it.

314
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
WANG: Right.

315
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,200
Now, I just feel physically weak
and...

316
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
A little dizzy.

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,040
Why do I feel more dizzy outside?

318
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,360
CHENG ER:
Dancing, as your first dream.

319
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,400
Now, has been achieved
more than you expected.

320
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
After that.

321
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,320
Where is the next critical point
in your life?

322
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,280
The second critical point
could be a shift in identity.

323
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,920
When I became an actor.

324
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,720
Hmm.

325
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,600
The largest primary point.

326
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,480
May be started
from "The Hidden Blade."

327
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,120
That's when I actually stepped
into the realm of films.

328
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,560
The biggest winner in life

329
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,600
is who can bring
their childhood interests

330
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,280
to a profession after growing up.

331
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,080
WANG: Actually, I've always wanted
to do the job I love.

332
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,440
But it seems to have come true
I've always been doing what I love.

333
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,880
His condition in the morning
was getting progressively worse,

334
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,640
which, in terms of altitude sickness
was considered to be a bad sign.

335
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,760
WANG:: Actually,
I was really struggling that day.

336
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,040
After waking up,
the symptoms worsened.

337
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,320
It started with
a headache and dizziness,

338
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,800
but later I began to feel nauseous.

339
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,080
ZHOU PENG: I'm worried
if we can complete the journey.

340
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,680
At this point, I think it'd be best
for him to start descending.

341
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,680
WANG: Pull it a little further up.

342
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,840
ZHOU PENG: Sir,
he's not feeling well right now.

343
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,240
-HOSTLER: I know.
-So please go down a little slower.

344
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,600
-HOSTLER: Okay.
-Slow down.

345
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,760
My expectation this time was that

346
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,200
I would quickly adapt
once I got up there

347
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
and I didn't want to go down.

348
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,000
So when I had to descend
I couldn't help

349
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,800
but feel like my body
was letting me down.

350
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,680
CHENG ER: In what capacity
do you want to retire?

351
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,760
Have you thought about it?

352
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,960
-I haven't thought about it yet.
-CHENG ER: It's too early.

353
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,920
Yes, it's too early,
but maybe at this moment,

354
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,960
I want to do my best as an actor

355
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,280
because I feel that movies
are like a continuation of life.

356
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,640
SUN: How do you feel now?

357
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,160
-Does your head still hurt?
-WANG: Not any more.

358
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I still feel a little weak.

359
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,960
SUN: It's a good thing
that your head doesn't hurt.

360
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,360
And you will have more opportunities
to adapt when we ascend today.

361
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,280
-ZHOU PENG: Hello, Yibo!
-WANG: Hello.

362
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,080
Do you have a headache
or similar symptoms?

363
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,720
No major headaches...

364
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
today.

365
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,800
Just minor ones.

366
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,040
It seems like our plan yesterday
was quite effective.

367
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,840
Yeah.

368
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,760
One of our challenges tomorrow
is that you have to be up early.

369
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,280
No problem.

370
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,120
Our route tomorrow
starts from this place

371
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,440
and then across the gravel slope.

372
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,240
They have created
a very good route here.

373
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,040
WANG: Mmm.

374
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,760
Starting from this point,
we will put on our snowboards

375
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,200
and keep going till
we are nearly at the summit.

376
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,040
When we get to
a few dozen meters away

377
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,840
we will switch to crampons
and begin our final ascent in groups.

378
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,480
Get a good night's rest
and we will go all out tomorrow.

379
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay. Snooze time.

380
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,760
ZHOU PENG: Yibo.

381
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,720
-How did you sleep?
-WANG: Mmm.

382
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,120
It's time to get up.

383
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,720
Have you ever gotten up
so early to do something before?

384
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,200
I think at four o'clock.

385
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,040
-ZHOU PENG: Seldom.
-Yes, seldom.

386
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,720
ZHOU PENG: Getting up early
is a must in mountaineering.

387
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,560
Before we depart,
let's go through the required gear.

388
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,400
-We need the safety belt.
-WANG: Safety belt.

389
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,800
-ZHOU PENG: Crampons.
-WANG: Crampons.

390
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
-The helmet is on the outside.
-Food.

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,480
ZHOU PENG: Sunglasses.

392
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,560
-WANG: Right here.
-ZHOU PENG: Good.

393
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,600
Then we can put the boards on now.

394
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,760
WANG: Good. Perfect.

395
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,520
Let's go.

396
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,600
-It's already very bright.
-ZHOU PENG: Yeah.

397
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
WANG: This snow is all...

398
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,720
-ZHOU PENG: It's all hard.
-WANG: Shiny.

399
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,320
-It's beautiful.
-ZHOU PENG: Yeah.

400
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
If life is this mountain,

401
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,840
then at 27, I'm just starting out
right where I am now.

402
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,560
If the peak is still up high

403
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,920
I believe I will definitely climb
to the top as long as I am able to.

404
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,440
ZHOU PENG: When you feel
like your heart is beating too fast

405
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,280
slow down.

406
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,320
Take deeper breaths.

407
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,720
WANG: Okay, let's go.

408
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,240
ZHOU PENG: We can already
see the mountain from here.

409
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,640
We will follow this gravel slope
towards that direction

410
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,000
where we'll be able
to see the snow line.

411
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
Okay.

412
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,880
ZHOU PENG: Okay.

413
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,920
It's beautiful.

414
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,280
The fresh air is so pleasant.

415
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,280
WANG: You can't be constrained
in one place.

416
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,360
ZHOU PENG: Just like this.
Walk slowly.

417
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,000
WANG: I just want to see
more experience more...

418
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

419
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,120
WANG: ...and create wonderful
memories along the way.

420
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,560
Whoa!

421
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
-ZHOU PENG: Whoa!
-WANG: Whoo-hoo!

422
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,280
CHENG ER: Do you have
any other career plans?

423
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,560
I would like to
become a race car driver.

424
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,480
It seems a bit difficult

425
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,400
to become a tennis player
or a skier at my age.

426
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,600
But being a race car driver
is achievable.

427
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,920
ZHOU PENG: We can put our bags down
and prepare the AT.

428
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,720
WANG: Okay.

429
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,680
Every change of identity
means starting from scratch

430
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
learning and improving.

431
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,680
It could also be compared to

432
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,760
reaching the foot of a mountain
ready to challenge its peak.

433
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,840
There are both proactive
and reactive aspects

434
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,640
but through it all,
you'll learn a lot

435
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,480
and no path is ever wasted.

436
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,840
-Okay.
-ZHOU PENG: Let's go!

437
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,440
-Try not to lift up your feet.
-WANG: Right.

438
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,080
-There's still a long way to go.
-ZHOU PENG: It's Okay.

439
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,000
WANG: I feel more exhausted
on the snow mountain.

440
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,440
It mainly triggers
an extreme physical sensation

441
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,680
pushing your body to its limits.

442
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,880
ZHOU PENG: Take a break.

443
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,920
When I accomplish
something particularly difficult

444
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,240
the emotional impact it
has on me is profound.

445
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,200
ZHOU PENG: The sensation
in my body suddenly becomes

446
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,640
very ethereal.

447
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,440
I think there's a story in there,
a narrative.

448
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,800
ZHOU PENG: When I listened
to other people speaking

449
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,080
I pick up on more details.

450
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,480
And then when I listened to sounds
of insects in the grass

451
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
it suddenly adds a sense of depth.

452
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,240
It's like your hearing
becomes very sensitive

453
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,000
and that brings about
a lot of different emotions.

454
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
ZHOU PENG: Drink some water.

455
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,560
ZHOU PENG: We can remove
the board now.

456
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
Soon we'll be switch to crampons.

457
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,280
How do you feel right now?

458
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,480
BOTH: Besides tired, still tired.

459
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,080
Let me tidy up the ropes.
Then the two of us can form a group.

460
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
WANG: Okay.

461
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,800
CHENG ER: This time you will climb
to a really high altitude.

462
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,400
When you're actually climbing,

463
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,120
you will experience a serious test

464
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,320
physiologically or physically.

465
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,760
-ZHOU PENG: How do you feel now?
-WANG: Pretty good.

466
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,880
-ZHOU PENG: Just follow your pace.
-WANG: Okay.

467
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,200
WANG: Whoa!

468
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,120
-ZHOU PENG: Step on my footprints.
-WANG: Okay.

469
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,760
This is not an easy path.

470
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,360
My calves are getting weak.

471
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,800
ZHOU PENG: Are your calves tired?

472
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,800
Aah!

473
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,040
Why do we work so hard and push
ourselves so hard to do these things?

474
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,440
We are searching for an answer.
Why are we alive?

475
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,760
Do you think life has a meaning?

476
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,040
WANG: Of course there is.

477
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,280
ZHOU PENG: Don't hit that.
There are rocks underneath.

478
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,560
Just hook on it lightly...

479
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,120
...onto the sunken areas
in the rocks.

480
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,760
Actually, the viewpoint
that I prefer now is

481
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,680
that living itself doesn't have
any inherent meaning.

482
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,640
You have to create meanings
for your life.

483
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,480
Right.

484
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,360
ZHOU PENG: Put your body weight
on the rope.

485
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,040
It's okay. Don't overthink.

486
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,760
You can on hold onto that rock.

487
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Right.

488
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,920
The more you see
the more you will notice.

489
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,160
You will start to think differently

490
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,360
and your life becomes
more meaningful.

491
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,280
ZHOU PENG: Cool.

492
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,040
We are not far.

493
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,000
Not far.

494
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,840
It's not enough to just watch.

495
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,040
You have to do it yourself
to truly experience it.

496
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,560
Uh!

497
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,200
Last 10 meters.

498
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Aah!

499
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,760
Okay.

500
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,840
Woo!

501
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Last few meters. Come, you go first.

502
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,760
ZHOU PENG: Okay.

503
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,200
WANG: Whoa!

504
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Woo!

505
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,920
Yeah!

506
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,600
Finally, we have made it to the top.

507
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,800
Whoa!

508
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
WANG: This is amazing.

509
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,240
Whoo-hoo!

510
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,480
Woo!

511
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,760
WANG: The air here is so refreshing.

512
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,680
ZHOU PENG: How do you feel now?

513
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,760
It's totally worth it.

514
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,360
5005 meters, should be your...

515
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,280
First peak.

516
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,920
...your first 5,000-meter
mountain, right?

517
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,840
WANG: Right.

518
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,280
A new height in life.

519
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,920
Actually you can pretty much imagine
the view from the summit

520
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,760
and everybody has a mobile phone
and can look it up.

521
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,560
But it's only when you are
right here, at this moment,

522
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
do you realize that
the photos on a screen

523
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,640
can't truly capture
the awe your eyes take in.

524
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,320
The process of reaching the summit
was really enjoyable

525
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,200
all your pain disappears
once you reach the peak

526
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,240
I think the more pain
you went through

527
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,840
the greater your happiness.

528
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,200
They are in direct proportion.

529
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,640
WANG: How I feel at this moment...

530
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,200
Such a rare opportunity.

531
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,760
We don't have to say anything.
Just enjoy the moment.

532
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,640
ZHOU PENG: Yes.

533
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,880
We're ready to descend.

534
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,080
-You can walk backwards.
-WANG: Okay.

535
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,760
ZHOU PENG: Let's go.

536
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,400
You can put a little force on it
then lean back.

537
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,640
That way it will be much easier.

538
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
Because you are young, successful

539
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,160
famous, and at the peak
of your career

540
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,000
it's only natural for you
to want this peak to last.

541
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,200
CHENG ER: But reality tells us
nothing lasts forever.

542
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,000
ZHOU PENG:
Yes, just boldly walk backwards.

543
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
If there is one day in the future

544
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,960
when the world
is not so noisy and busy

545
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,800
when people stop caring
where you are anymore.

546
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,480
ZHOU PENG: Right.
You just have to lean back.

547
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,880
It's okay, just lean back.

548
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,520
CHENG ER: From a progression
perspective this day will come.

549
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,520
How you will face it?

550
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
I think when you're climbing
the mountain.

551
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
WANG: I should think about this.

552
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,080
If you don't have an answer right now
think it through thoroughly.

553
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,440
WANG: Continue giving the ropes.
Keep giving.

554
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,280
That question made me
suddenly realize

555
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,200
that mountain climbing
is very similar to our lives.

556
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,440
We work very hard
and reach the peak in our lives.

557
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,120
You get to see certain views.

558
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,480
Sometimes we will continue
to challenge ourselves

559
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,360
to climb even higher and to see more.

560
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,040
It's all a challenge. You might fall.

561
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,280
Or you might get to witness
the most beautiful view.

562
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,920
And then you come back down again.

563
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,400
If you descend smoothly
you might also become older.

564
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,200
Yibo, where are you now?
Do you feel safe where you are now?

565
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,600
WANG: Very safe.
I can release it now.

566
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,480
It's hard to say whether
I would be scared at that moment

567
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,800
I hope I can keep a good attitude.

568
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,680
So I think I should
keep an open mind.

569
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,840
Keep those beautiful memories
in my mind

570
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,400
and enjoy the process.

571
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,400
I think I should try my best
to climb more mountains.

572
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,400
Right.

573
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,280
-ZHOU PENG: Okay, let's go.
-WANG: Let's go.

574
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,880
ZHOU PENG: Go.

575
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,800
Okay, go.

576
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,040
WANG: Whoa! Whoa!

577
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah.
