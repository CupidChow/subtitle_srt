1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,390
Grandma wants me to get my memory back quickly.

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,490
Botpleng’s memory should be returning after all.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,980
Pleng.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,460
Who?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,680
If she really wants you to remember things,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,120
why was she trying to stop you from thinking about the past?

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,410
What if it wasn’t for you to remember things

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,530
but for you to forget certain events?

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,180
If it hurts so much that you need to forget,

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,610
then I

11
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,940
don’t want you to remember it.

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,180
15 years ago, Sheriff Petchkla, Botpleng’s dad

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,090
was reported for fraud in a wind power concession.

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,500
But isn’t it possible?

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,500
That Thunphob could have found that out

16
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,050
so he was murdered to silence out.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,110
What if it were me who killed your brother?

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,460
What would you do?

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,490
Hey!

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,580
Hold on!

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,620
Wait up!

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
Who are you?

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,290
I’m Botpleng.

24
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,550
Botpleng.

25
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Botpleng.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
What’s wrong, Pleng?

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,170
A nightmare?

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,490
More like a strange dream.

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,050
It’s good that you’re here.

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,210
I’m kind of tired.

31
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,380
Hey.

32
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,060
Are you trying to energize me?

33
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,760
You said you’re kind of tired.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here.

35
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,130
Some medicines.

36
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,150
I’m sorry.

37
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,420
I forgot that you might have been too worn out.

38
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,810
When did I say so?

39
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,680
You said you’re tired.

40
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,760
It’s not because of last night.

41
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,000
I just feel like.

42
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,170
I’ve been having strange dreams these days.

43
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,850
Dreams can come from many factors.

44
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,240
But for you,

45
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,910
the test says you have multiple identities

46
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,180
hidden within yourself.

47
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,990
It’s hidden so deep that

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
you know it exists,

49
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
but refuse to give anything away.

50
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,780
Why did I become this way?

51
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,340
Someone with multiple identities means

52
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,800
they have more than one self.

53
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,070
They tend to have been through severe
physical and emotional trauma.

54
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,540
Or perhaps it’s been piled up for a long time.

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,800
To the extent that you can’t cope

56
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,920
and created another identity

57
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,990
so that the original identity

58
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,360
wouldn’t have to face that trauma.

59
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,740
It’s the brain’s coping mechanism.

60
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,460
Which identity is my true self?

61
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Is it me

62
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,870
or the other person inside?

63
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,740
You’re sure

64
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,740
that there’s another identity hidden inside.

65
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,550
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have asked

66
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,610
which one is the true self.

67
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,300
The thing is…

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,790
You don’t have to say it.

69
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,100
If you don’t want to.

70
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,720
The thing is, last night…

71
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Tankhun and I…

72
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,820
I felt as if

73
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,150
it was the first time.

74
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,710
With your brother’s lover

75
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
who might have killed your brother as well?

76
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,540
I know what I’m doing.

77
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,540
And I really do love Pleng.

78
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,310
Thun’s probably happy

79
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,240
to know that Pleng is happy.

80
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,010
Are you putting yourself in Thun’s shoes

81
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,980
or are you fooling yourself
to do what you want?

82
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,180
What if Pleng was the one who killed Thun?

83
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,630
I know my brother well.

84
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,430
And I know that Thunphob

85
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,580
can never love a murderer.

86
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,140
Do you not know Thunphob, Jen?

87
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,860
But Botpleng’s identities conflict
with one another.

88
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,160
Just like how he said he never had an affair

89
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,310
when he had one with Thunphob.

90
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,160
If the other identity of Botpleng is the real one,

91
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,380
it means that

92
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,700
your love does not exist in reality for him.

93
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,000
Have you talked to your sister?

94
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
Come here.

95
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Let me help.

96
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,720
I’m sorry

97
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,900
for blurting it out like that.

98
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,620
I just thought of her as a doctor.

99
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,330
I forgot that she’s also your and Thunphob’s sister.

100
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,780
Jennaree is a sister who always understands

101
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,580
both Thunphob and me.

102
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,010
She’s also a doctor.

103
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,700
Then, Mr. Doctor’s Brother,

104
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,180
Please give a diagnosis.

105
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,220
Jennaree can treat you.

106
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,270
Using hypnosis along with it

107
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,600
to find out the truth

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,670
that’s hidden in your other identity.

109
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,390
The truth

110
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,050
that might conflict

111
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,980
with what you are now.

112
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,780
I think I love you enough

113
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,760
that my other identity can realize.

114
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,630
Even if you don’t love me,

115
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,030
I love you enough

116
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,970
for all your identities

117
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,610
to realize.

118
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,620
Don’t worry about the murder case.

119
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,940
I’ve found a way

120
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,990
to lure the real murderer out.

121
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,270
If I succeed,

122
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,750
whether you can remember or not

123
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,870
you and your family

124
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,920
will no longer be the suspects.

125
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,440
How are you going to do it?

126
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,900
We’ve been playing along with
the murderer’s game for too long.

127
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,960
It’s time we take control.

128
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
How do you know it’s going to work?

129
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,740
You know I can read people’s minds.

130
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,510
Have you been secretly reading my mind?

131
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
I wasn’t doing it secretly.

132
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,660
You have to understand,

133
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,190
when you can do it, it goes automatically.

134
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,860
Just like riding a bike.

135
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,340
After you can do it once, it sticks.

136
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
I have my clothes on, but I feel so naked.

137
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,180
Stop staring.

138
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,420
You know what?

139
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,410
Even with just the sound of your breath,

140
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
I can tell

141
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,980
what you’re thinking.

142
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,440
Are you a superhuman?

143
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,380
Your heavy breathing

144
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,440
tells that you’re nervous.

145
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,090
You want my hand to go lower.

146
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,520
I can read your mind, too.

147
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
It’s you

148
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
who wants it.

149
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:45,410
I give up.

150
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,870
You’re so good.

151
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,180
That’s why you have to read
Tanu’s mind with me.

152
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
What?

153
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,000
In this plan,

154
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,240
you’re the most important part.

155
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,730
It is said that,

156
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,710
the luggage serial murder case

157
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,300
has gotten less spotlight from the press.

158
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,780
Is that true, Professor Tankhun?

159
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,290
Yes.

160
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,750
The police have asked for cooperation
from the press

161
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,350
so that the investigation will go smoothly.

162
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,780
That means you’re here today because…

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes.

164
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,390
We have identified the murderer.

165
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:38,250
And the murderer is watching the show now.

166
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,800
Keep an eye on every move in this studio.

167
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,030
Don’t let anything slip.

168
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Yes, boss.

169
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,780
Is the murderer going to come here?

170
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,420
No one knows.

171
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,486
But there are a lot of people here.

172
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,150
We have to block all the risks.

173
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,930
Do your best on your part.

174
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Tankhun.

175
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,700
Is the murderer here?

176
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,260
The murderer is a coward.

177
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,050
He wouldn’t dare be here.

178
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,830
That’s a relief.

179
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,400
But he’s trying to get back at me.

180
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,680
(Still, you choose to appear on this show?)

181
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,620
(Yes.)

182
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,150
(Because I’m sick
of giving him too much spotlight.)

183
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:22,700
It’s me.

184
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,890
(It makes him full of himself.)

185
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,340
He took over my dad’s show

186
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,520
and asked me to watch over you
until he’s back.

187
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,860
(He thinks that he’s a genius murderer)

188
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,580
(and everyone has to watch out.)

189
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,980
Even the press doesn’t dare cover his case.

190
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,580
When in fact,

191
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,040
he’s just a coward.

192
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,180
So I want to give people the right facts.

193
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,580
We have over 200K likes on our live stream.

194
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,080
Press Like, Share, and spread the word

195
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,510
so can deliver the right facts
about the murderer to the people.

196
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,300
What were you saying, Professor?

197
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,350
The murderer is a loser.

198
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,010
A gambling addict loser.

199
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,810
He’s in debt for millions.

200
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,170
Once he’s lost, he has to take revenge

201
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,550
on the people who were at the same table.

202
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,780
Professor Tankhun is acting it out so well.

203
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,060
He’s making a big show in front of the people

204
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,930
his only choice is to catch the murderer.

205
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,860
Otherwise, he has to leave the investigation team

206
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,360
and lose all the trust of the police
for the rest of his life.

207
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,710
The police can’t identify the people

208
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,580
who’ve visited the same casino as the suspect.

209
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,290
I’d like to warn

210
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,040
those who frequent the same place

211
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,090
to be careful.

212
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,490
You can come forward
and request protection from the police.

213
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,340
Don’t you think this will give the suspect
a heads-up

214
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,870
and he will flee to other countries?

215
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,940
Not at all.

216
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
Because the first witness
who discovered the bodies

217
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,040
is able to identify the murderer.

218
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,780
Soon, we will definitely catch the murderer.

219
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,540
Thanks for helping.

220
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
Yeah.

221
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,410
Just catch the murderer.

222
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,770
So you can finally feel relieved.

223
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
I’ll head back.

224
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Okay.

225
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,260
Are you afraid?

226
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,870
You’re here.

227
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
So you make me clean?

228
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Because I can probably stay at this place.

229
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,330
It just needs a little cleaning.

230
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,860
Are you going to move in?

231
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,450
Maybe.

232
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,250
Well…

233
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,440
Though I want to be with my mom,

234
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,970
but I’m probably not okay living with Grandma

235
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,240
who brought a doctor who does things to my brain.

236
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,520
There’s a place

237
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,190
where no one’s going to mess with your brain.

238
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Where?

239
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,180
My house.

240
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,340
It’s already cleaned, too.

241
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,770
You don’t have to worry about dust.

242
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,910
You’re not going to mess with my brain

243
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,700
but you’re going to mess with my body.

244
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,850
Don’t try to trick me, I know it.

245
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,000
You’re telling me not to

246
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,190
but your eyes are all dreamy.

247
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,250
Hmm?

248
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Hmm?

249
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,580
Stop reading my mind.

250
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,610
Because I got it right?

251
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,950
Hmm?

252
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,140
Hmm?

253
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,260
Get up!

254
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,180
Get up?

255
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,190
Get up on you?

256
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,390
Why can’t you read my mind this time?

257
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,430
I mean, stand up!

258
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,070
You’re sitting on something.

259
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Oh.

260
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,980
My dad’s violin.

261
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,260
It’s not broken yet

262
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,140
but the sound is probably off tune.

263
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,070
I think I can do something about it.

264
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Give it to me.

265
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,570
(Botpleng!)

266
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,390
(Botpleng!)

267
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,570
(Where are you, child?)

268
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,570
Pleng.

269
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,860
(Botpleng!)

270
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,900
(Botpleng, where are you, child?)

271
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:47,930
Pleng.

272
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,210
- (Botpleng!)
- Pleng!

273
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,570
I’m Tankhun.

274
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,450
Mom.

275
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,670
What?

276
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,930
When you play the violin just now.

277
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,330
I heard my Mom

278
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,390
saying “Pleng, my child.”

279
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,180
I only heard my mom’s voice.

280
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,380
After that, it’s like my ears are blocked.

281
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,360
Until you touched me.

282
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,240
Then next time we see Jen,

283
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,370
I will play the violin for you.

284
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,580
If it happens again, then Jen can help you.

285
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,020
Yes, Inspector?

286
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Okay, I’ll be there right away.

287
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,190
Something urgent came up.

288
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,860
You can stay here alone, right?

289
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,220
This is my house.

290
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,960
Being here for a while might help me remember something.

291
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,780
You’re under arrest.

292
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,420
Drop your weapon.

293
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,170
Hands over your head.

294
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Go!

295
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,590
You are…

296
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,840
the best of the class indeed.

297
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,610
SUSPECTS.
Use flame to lure the fireflies.

298
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,500
That’s how I’ll lure Tanu and the murderer.

299
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,550
Do you still think there are 2 of them?

300
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,760
Only when there is additional evidence

301
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,520
that I will believe Tanu has DID

302
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,540
and can execute everything on his own.

303
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,300
Cool.

304
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,330
Fair enough.

305
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,670
I’ll light the fire to lure the firefly in.

306
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,900
I’ll stir up the news

307
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,940
that Botpleng could identify the murderer.

308
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,680
And that the police will be able to
arrest the culprit soon.

309
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,760
Tanu and the murderer

310
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,760
must be anxious and jump out
to get Botpleng.

311
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,760
If Kedsara is actually the one who hired them,

312
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,420
she would try to convince Botpleng.

313
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
But if not,

314
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,370
they’d probably try to silence Botpleng out.

315
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,090
That means,

316
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:25,150
you’re going to use Botpleng as bait.

317
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,980
I’ve been waiting.

318
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
Yes.

319
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
Unbelievable.

320
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,140
That’s risky.

321
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,910
Who would let Botpleng be at risk?

322
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,170
Hurry up and head to the car.

323
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,796
The police will take you to the safe house.

324
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,220
No one can know your location.

325
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
You can’t get hurt.

326
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,940
You have to come back to me safely.

327
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
Understood?

328
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Go.

329
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
Wake up.

330
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Wake up.

331
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,110
(The firefly got caught.)

332
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,320
The police are taking Botpleng to his mother’s house.

333
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,730
But I think it’s better for him to stay here.

334
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,690
Because at least there’s you,

335
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,340
someone I somewhat have respect for.

336
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,150
But Botpleng refuses.

337
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,140
He probably has to take care of his mother.

338
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
I see.

339
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,020
Or…

340
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,400
His family’s probably panicking.

341
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,720
So he’s called home immediately.

342
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,690
You still think

343
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,110
the murderer is from Botpleng’s family?

344
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,020
The only one who went to see Botpleng was Tanu, right?

345
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,110
DID is pretty solid.

346
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,870
You got better.

347
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,490
(All good. I’ll take you to see Tanu tomorrow.)

348
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,570
You seem so happy, huh?

349
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,490
While your mom is so sick

350
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,960
that she could die any day.

351
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:06,250
Or is your brain still not functioning like others

352
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,980
that you didn’t realize your mom is sick?

353
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,540
I know full well

354
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,180
that Mom is sick.

355
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,420
Also, my brain would probably function better

356
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,740
if no one has messed with it.

357
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,270
You’re so good, huh?

358
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,590
Have you remembered anything?

359
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Why?

360
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,610
If I could remember,

361
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,000
would you feel uncomfortable?

362
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,530
Huh!

363
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,270
It’s your business

364
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,140
so you’re the one who should be uncomfortable.

365
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,620
I already told you

366
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,436
that I’m not going to get treated by your doctor anymore.

367
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,930
I already have a personal doctor.

368
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,280
That’s your business.

369
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,880
She’s here for me.

370
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,450
Are you unwell?

371
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,870
None of your business.

372
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
Follow me.

373
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Yes, ma’am.

374
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Pleng.

375
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Hey.

376
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,144
You’re here already?

377
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,976
Why are you so late?

378
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,960
I’m here on time.

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,280
Oh, really?

380
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,512
I guess I miss you too much.

381
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,000
I want to meet you quickly

382
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,240
so time passed so slowly.

383
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:11,752
Pleng.

384
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Yes?

385
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,960
Is everything okay?

386
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,192
You seem a bit off.

387
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,032
I’m okay.

388
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,880
I’m Botpleng.

389
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,168
Do you not recognize me?

390
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,736
By the way.

391
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,880
Here’s a sandwich.

392
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,872
The maid made some.

393
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:35,984
No vegetables, no smell.

394
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,704
You like it like that, right?

395
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,184
You don’t like vegetables.

396
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,904
Oh, you didn’t know?

397
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,976
POLICE STATION.

398
00:28:54,016 --> 00:28:55,408
Botpleng’s being weird.

399
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:56,736
He says things he never said.

400
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,272
Do things he never did.

401
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,280
Say, he used to like vegetables

402
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,000
but today he no longer likes it.

403
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,776
Maybe it’s because he confuses his memory

404
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,944
or something affected him.

405
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,392
Then what is it?

406
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,976
I can’t tell from what you just told me.

407
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,496
You have to slowly find out from him.

408
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,424
Otherwise, get him to see me.

409
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:17,600
(Do you have time?)

410
00:29:18,432 --> 00:29:19,496
Not today.

411
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:20,896
I’ll hang up now. Catch you later.

412
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,176
I’m ready.
Shall we go?

413
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,190
Yeah.

414
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,224
Tanu said he’s not the murderer.

415
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,824
He broke into Botpleng’s house

416
00:29:35,848 --> 00:29:37,568
just to steal something.

417
00:29:37,696 --> 00:29:38,712
To steal something?

418
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,264
But he went into his bedroom.

419
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,040
I know.

420
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,576
I’m making the team question him more.

421
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,030
Just in case he slips more out.

422
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:50,512
I have a plan.

423
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
What is it?

424
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,568
Tanu approached Botpleng for something.

425
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,112
Give him what he wants.

426
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,504
Do you mean me?

427
00:30:17,992 --> 00:30:20,848
POLICE STATION.

428
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,440
I’ve already told you everything.

429
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,312
There’s nothing else to say.

430
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Okay.

431
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,100
If you don’t have anything else to say to me

432
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,544
then what about to this person?

433
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,264
Do you have anything to say?

434
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,224
Why did you come to see me?

435
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,360
What did you want?

436
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,616
You know me, right?

437
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,990
I know

438
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,608
that you used to work for my mom.

439
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,010
Either Mom or Grandma asked you to come to me, right?

440
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,976
You can tell me.

441
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:22,090
I won’t tell Mom and Grandma that you said it.

442
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,976
You secret,

443
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,864
I’ll keep it to myself.

444
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,370
Get out.

445
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,648
You have nothing to do with this.

446
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,190
Get out!

447
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,800
Get out!

448
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,480
Get out!

449
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,632
Get out!

450
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Get out!

451
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,136
Get out!
Get out!

452
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:52,984
Get out!

453
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Pleng!

454
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,890
Pleng!

455
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,040
Pleng, are you okay?

456
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,296
It’s getting clearer.

457
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,010
What?

458
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,544
The image of him.

459
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:24,824
I know him.

460
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:54,272
Stay with me.

461
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,160
Don’t leave.

462
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,328
Even if you don’t say it,

463
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,528
I wasn’t going to go anywhere.

464
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,576
Oh, hey!

465
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,232
You hit the gym here, too?

466
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,128
This is your first time.

467
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,232
What?

468
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,672
I’m here often.

469
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:51,800
That wristband

470
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,984
it’s only for new members

471
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,104
so the trainers can take care of you.

472
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,730
I know it because I got one last month.

473
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,872
This is your first day, is it?

474
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,096
Can anyone ever fool you?

475
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,048
At least not you.

476
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,104
What do you want?

477
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,576
I just…

478
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,744
want to ask because
our close persons are dating.

479
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Get to the point.

480
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,872
How’s my friend and your brother doing so far?

481
00:35:19,296 --> 00:35:20,712
If it’s about that

482
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,320
isn’t it better to ask your friend?

483
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,824
Come on.

484
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,136
He’d think I still have feelings for him.

485
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,640
He’s stressed out enough.

486
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,344
I don’t want to give him more stress.

487
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,208
I’m worried about him.

488
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,064
Instead of worrying about Pleng and Tan’s love,

489
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,060
you should worry whether Pleng is going to jail.

490
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,180
What?

491
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,552
Don’t you remember?

492
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,632
What Pleng is afraid of the most

493
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,160
is that he could be the one who killed Thunphob.

494
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,400
If his memory returns

495
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,224
and Pleng is really the one who brought death to Thunphob,

496
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,232
no matter how much Pleng loves Tan,

497
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,560
I’ll throw him in jail.

498
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,930
Hey.

499
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,072
It’s just his fear.

500
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,944
Pleng probably wouldn’t have done such a thing.

501
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:10,810
You can’t just assume with things like this.

502
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,640
You need proof.

503
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,320
If you’re so worried about your friend,

504
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:16,664
then go and find the proof

505
00:36:16,688 --> 00:36:17,688
that Pleng didn’t do it.

506
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:35,648
I normally don’t get interviewed by the press.

507
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:36,872
Please go ahead.

508
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Then, please allow me to record this.

509
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,800
I want to know about the concession project.

510
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,320
This year, we have the concession projects

511
00:36:52,368 --> 00:36:54,960
on transportation and the new expressway.

512
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,160
No, sheriff, I’m talking about

513
00:36:57,192 --> 00:37:00,496
the wind power concession project

514
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,936
15 years ago.

515
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,072
Kissable, isn’t it?

516
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
No.

517
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,744
No, indeed.

518
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,910
Hmm!

519
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,912
Stop eating up my lips.

520
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,744
I want to eat some food.

521
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,656
What do you want to eat?

522
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Umm…

523
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,496
Stir-fried Chinese broccoli with crispy pork.

524
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
Make it spicy, too.

525
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
Really?

526
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,416
Why are you making that face?

527
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,780
Is it too hard?

528
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,184
No.

529
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,712
I’m just happy

530
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,900
to see you have vegetables for the first time.

531
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,420
When did you secretly start planting vegetables?

532
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,544
Since I knew you liked vegetables.

533
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,376
So I asked someone to plant them for you.

534
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,672
Aren’t you going a bit overboard?

535
00:39:11,696 --> 00:39:12,816
This is your house.

536
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,152
Shall we have a puppy?

537
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,336
Or a cat?

538
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,352
Or both?

539
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,940
So they wouldn’t be lonely.

540
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,784
Everything here

541
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
is yours.

542
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,880
I’m yours.

543
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,648
From the day

544
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,464
that you love me.

545
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,380
I…

546
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,776
Will be the second violin

547
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,420
in your Canon in D, always.

548
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,224
So I become a completed melody.

549
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,712
Who are you?

550
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:50,208
And where are you?

551
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:03,970
(My name is…)

552
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:05,872
I think your apartment is a bit too empty.

553
00:41:05,904 --> 00:41:07,688
I’ve never thought of that place as my home.

554
00:41:07,736 --> 00:41:09,248
But I want to make it a home.

555
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,032
Wherever you are

556
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,976
that’s where home is.

557
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,488
Maybe it’s the trigger of the hypnosis.

558
00:41:16,528 --> 00:41:18,464
The strings on your dad’s violin have been changed.

559
00:41:18,488 --> 00:41:20,488
That’s why it doesn’t sound like any other violin.

560
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,968
Right now, you’re 18 years old.

561
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
You were in a long sleep.

562
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:28,152
If that family can make Pleng forget everything,

563
00:41:28,168 --> 00:41:29,192
everything’s over.

564
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,584
I have a lover.

565
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,120
His name is Tankhun.

566
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,080
Tan–.

567
00:41:34,128 --> 00:41:35,872
Die!

568
00:41:35,888 --> 00:41:36,600
Die!
I’m right here, Mom.

569
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,776
That means digging up my dad’s case

570
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,944
was not what triggers the murderer.

571
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,940
So why did they kill my parents’ subordinates?

572
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,944
What if something else was the trigger?

573
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,350
Hey!
