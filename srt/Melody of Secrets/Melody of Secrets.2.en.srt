1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
(My dreams would be far too mysterious beyond anticipation.)

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,888
(Because I lost my memories 10 years ago.)

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,696
(You are back now, Botpleng?)

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,776
(Can we meet?)

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,968
I’m Tankhun, your lover.

6
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:15,008
Are you the murderer?

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,410
What do you think?

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,192
The deceased just sent you a parcel.

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,952
Then a week later,

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,408
you became the one who found his body.

11
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,146
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,816
Are you suspecting me, Officer?

13
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,480
Are you sure he’s not lying?

14
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,030
For sure?

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Sure.

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,766
Coming from the only body language decipherer of the department.

17
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,248
Maybe you want to protect him

18
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:37,456
due to personal reasons.

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,576
You can’t remember me,

20
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,632
but I can.

21
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,744
I can remember who Botpleng’s first love is.

22
00:00:59,456 --> 00:01:00,456
Oh.

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,504
I’ve got your clothes prepared.

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,872
Wash up and get some rest.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,688
You’re right.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,944
When you said I’m not ready yet.

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,688
I’m sorry.

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,904
You don’t have to apologize.

29
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,610
You didn’t do anything wrong.

30
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,744
Also, I’ve waited for 10 years.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,648
Just waiting a little longer

32
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:37,740
can’t hurt, right?

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Then…

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,128
Can I hold your hand and sleep tonight?

35
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,270
I think

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,176
being close to you

37
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:58,050
might make me remember you faster.

38
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,296
I don’t want you to wait too long either.

39
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,976
(He kissed me.)

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,984
(We kissed.)

41
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,792
(We couldn’t get enough.)

42
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,776
(We learned about each other’s bodies.)

43
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,936
(The feeling of touching his skin)

44
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,024
(felt entirely different from my own.)

45
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,600
(So does when he touched me.)

46
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,112
(Tankhun has a long scar on his left wrist.)

47
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,808
(I softly stroked that scar.)

48
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,608
(Hoping that the pain in his heart
would subside.)

49
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,264
(If Tankhun really exists, )

50
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,744
(then you’re probably not Tankhun.)

51
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,968
POLICE STATION

52
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,490
Why are you here?

53
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,280
Got a ticket?

54
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,088
If it’s a ticket, I can afford it.

55
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,184
Why would I be waiting for you?

56
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,544
Then say what you want.

57
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,944
But if you can’t have it

58
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:00,968
then don’t blame me.

59
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,664
I want the details

60
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,208
of the 2 murder and dismemberment cases
that happened yesterday.

61
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,176
To serve it to your journalist?

62
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,368
As a criminologist,

63
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,352
I want to solve this case.

64
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,872
As a police officer,

65
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,576
I think you’re being weird.

66
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,160
Not as weird as finding 2 bodies

67
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,160
in 2 luggage on the same day.

68
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,620
The murderer is planning something

69
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,464
And it won’t stop here.

70
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,192
Don’t you think so?

71
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,432
Let’s talk inside.

72
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,976
I want to help Botpleng.

73
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:49,640
If what you’re trying to find

74
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,912
is connected to the fact that Botpleng
used to live here,

75
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,420
then I’ll help you find out the truth.

76
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,568
Also,

77
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,820
you’ve just moved here, right?

78
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:59,696
Don’t you have to put out achievements?

79
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,192
Wouldn’t it be better

80
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,660
to have me help you think?

81
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,832
I have nothing against you helping.

82
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:09,660
But if the result shows that

83
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:12,960
Botpleng or people close to him
is the suspect,

84
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,912
would you be okay with that?

85
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,152
I don’t mix personal and work matters.

86
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,152
One more thing,

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,888
I’m sure

88
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,568
that Pleng is not the culprit.

89
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Then welcome to the team.

90
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,904
Adviser Tankhun.

91
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,460
But let me ruin your confidence a little.

92
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,928
The link between the victims in both cases

93
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,192
is that they both worked for Botpleng’s family.

94
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,976
The first victim

95
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,648
took care of the Thayadon house.

96
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,224
While the second victim

97
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,984
used to work for Botpleng’s father.

98
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,896
I hope you

99
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,992
will be able to separate
work and personal matters.

100
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,528
Thank you for the coffee.

101
00:08:45,768 --> 00:08:47,770
Is Korat your backyard?

102
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,072
What if I say

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I didn’t go back?

104
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,776
Not you acting all weird, too.

105
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,056
I’m stressed out enough.

106
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Hold on.

107
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,256
Did you sleep with him?

108
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,728
Are you out of your mind?

109
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Well…

110
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,984
You only came back in the morning.

111
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,960
Unless you guys happened to hook up

112
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,500
what else is there to be stressed out about?

113
00:09:21,272 --> 00:09:23,270
Do you think scars can go away?

114
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Is it deep?

115
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,020
Nowadays, laser treatments can fix it for you.

116
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Hey!

117
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,992
Was it so rough that you hurt yourself?

118
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:36,632
Damn you!
That’s not it!

119
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Oh?

120
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,032
I’m stressed out

121
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,752
because there wasn’t any scar.

122
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,272
No scar?

123
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,984
What are you talking about?

124
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,664
The diary says Tankhun has
a deep scar on his wrist.

125
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,248
But this Tankhun doesn’t have it.

126
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,224
Then it’s good

127
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:09,536
that you haven’t slept with him.

128
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,456
Because if he’s able to lie to you this well,

129
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,088
when he said he isn’t the murderer,

130
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,448
he could be lying to you then, too.

131
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
What are you on about?

132
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,184
Think carefully.

133
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,968
Isn’t it too much of a coincidence?

134
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,096
That you met Tankhun

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,320
and the body at the same time?

136
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
What if Tankhun were the murderer

137
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,368
and he was using you as a witness?

138
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,072
Also,

139
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,792
when the second body that

140
00:10:46,824 --> 00:10:48,560
died exactly like the first one was found,

141
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,576
Tankhun also has an alibi

142
00:10:51,616 --> 00:10:52,616
which is you.

143
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,104
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

144
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,224
POLICE STATION

145
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,952
For both bodies found in the luggage,

146
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,400
we found a relation

147
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:16,992
that they were done by the same murderer.

148
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,312
Therefore, we can conclude that

149
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,272
the two murder cases

150
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,816
are part of a serial killing case.

151
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,576
So today, we invited the press here
to ask for cooperation

152
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:33,152
to report necessary information only.

153
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:35,584
So as not to impact
the search for the murderer

154
00:11:35,976 --> 00:11:37,980
who murdered the victims professionally.

155
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,270
Excuse me.

156
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,656
Are you saying that we, the press,

157
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,920
are obstructing the search for the murderer?

158
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,912
Don’t you think that’s blaming the press

159
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:51,144
more than necessary?

160
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,192
I understand

161
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:56,136
that the press has its ethics to uphold.

162
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,416
Still, the police confirm that
this is not blaming

163
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:02,248
but asking for cooperation.

164
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,048
So that no other fatal incidents will occur.

165
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,416
This method has been discussed

166
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:10,080
with our criminologist.

167
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,992
Professor Tankhun.

168
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:30,896
Hello, I’m Tankhun.

169
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,320
Criminologist on criminal psychology
and criminal behavior.

170
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,616
The adviser of this case.

171
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
The autopsy confirms that

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,800
both bodies died in the same manner.

173
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,728
That is strangling with garrote knots.

174
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,200
The bodies are then dismembered.

175
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,096
The murder was done professionally.

176
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,224
Everything was done decisively.

177
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,256
No hesitation.

178
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,568
The relation between the two bodies

179
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,920
are that both of them

180
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:01,656
used to work for the Thayadon family.

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Yes.

182
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,768
The Thayadon family.

183
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,472
And both victims are locals of the same area.

184
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,304
A lot of murderers

185
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,960
choose their victims
from the same province or hometown.

186
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,984
But there can also be other reasons

187
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:17,632
which we still don’t know about.

188
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,176
Then what do you think was the motive?

189
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,020
This is a murder with purpose.

190
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,888
But we have to figure out the killing motive.

191
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,520
Whether it’s revenge,

192
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:30,552
cover up,

193
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,376
or just for pleasure.

194
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:34,740
But for a murderer this skilled,

195
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,296
they must have been paid to kill.

196
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,720
The strange thing is putting both bodies out

197
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,024
to expose them.

198
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,780
As if to mock the police’s authority.

199
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:43,888
That’s right.

200
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,424
It’s so crazy.

201
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:47,384
Putting the bodies out in the open,

202
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,024
as if they wanted us to find them.

203
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Then what do we do next?

204
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,576
The press already knew about the bodies.

205
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,240
We have to control the press first.

206
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,784
(Based on the discussion

207
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,984
with Professor Tankhun, )

208
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,184
We realize that this murderer is daring,

209
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
fearless

210
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,568
and enjoy mocking the police’s authority.

211
00:14:08,624 --> 00:14:10,632
So I ask the press for cooperation

212
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:12,576
in reporting this case
only as much as necessary.

213
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,896
You can report the discovery of the bodies

214
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,728
but I hope you would avoid

215
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,840
the mention of the serial murder.

216
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,408
Since it would bring pleasure to the murderer

217
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:26,110
and make them commit the crime again.

218
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,272
You want us to hide it from the people

219
00:14:28,288 --> 00:14:30,432
that there is a murderer in the area?

220
00:14:30,472 --> 00:14:33,176
I’ll say it one last time.

221
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,624
That this is the best way

222
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:38,620
to handle this murderer.

223
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,920
Thank you all in advance,

224
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,088
for your cooperation.

225
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,728
Have a safe journey back.

226
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,232
Oh?

227
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,856
We haven’t got any news.

228
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,432
We didn’t get anything out of it.

229
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:55,456
Yeah.

230
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,248
POLICE STATION

231
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,472
So damn weird.

232
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,328
Asking for cooperation

233
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,976
but not telling us anything.

234
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,272
Only the excuse of

235
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,952
“protection, protection”.

236
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,976
As if they’re trying to shut the press up.

237
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,776
Is that even acceptable?

238
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,780
Hey!

239
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,230
Pleng!

240
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,128
That bastard Pleng.

241
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Where did he go?

242
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,030
Inspector.

243
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,544
I have something to ask.

244
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:38,020
Didn’t you understand the word
“one last time”?

245
00:15:38,048 --> 00:15:40,020
You can keep quiet if you want

246
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,704
but if you’re trying to shut the press up,

247
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,984
and keeping the people in the dark
about the serial killer,

248
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,008
that’s unacceptable.

249
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,968
Then, if the murderer can’t be arrested.

250
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,112
The people are in more danger.

251
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:55,176
Would you, Mr. Press,
be able to handle the consequences?

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,704
So that means you already knew

253
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,592
who the murderer is, right?

254
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:11,152
Urgh!

255
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:12,512
That’s you!

256
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,920
You’re causing more people to die.

257
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,776
What are you guys doing?

258
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,952
It’s true what you said.

259
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,344
Some people won’t agree with us

260
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,432
and try to get in the way.

261
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,770
Come with me.

262
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
Are you aware

263
00:16:42,928 --> 00:16:44,584
that what you did

264
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,040
was threatening Inspector Dao?

265
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,800
And you know what?

266
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,336
The police are threatening the press, too.

267
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,808
Don’t the people have the right
to know what’s going on?

268
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,784
Especially about a serial killer
which is lurking among us.

269
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,190
The police should inform everyone
to stay alert.

270
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
You’re right.

271
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,008
It should be that way,

272
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,832
if the murderer killed and hid the bodies

273
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:07,848
like in the other cases.

274
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,056
But this murderer wanted to show off
the bodies of the victims.

275
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:13,160
If you make this case blow up,

276
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,152
and encourage the murderer to kill more,

277
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,064
can you handle the consequences?

278
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,584
I didn’t know it’d be that bad.

279
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,580
I’m sorry.

280
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
The one you should apologize to

281
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,776
is Inspector Dao, not me.

282
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,352
But you’re angry too.

283
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,784
Your brows are tied together.

284
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,088
I’m not angry.

285
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,260
If you’re not angry,

286
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,416
then would you go somewhere with me?

287
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,930
Yeah.

288
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,380
Fine.

289
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,512
I’ll go

290
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,904
if it’s interesting enough.

291
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,552
I guarantee

292
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,540
it’s somewhere that will get you in the mood.

293
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,848
Interesting enough?

294
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,176
My mom used to say,

295
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,910
desserts can get you in a good mood.

296
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,008
Eat a lot.

297
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,330
So you won’t be angry at me anymore.

298
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Oh?

299
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:44,832
So sour.

300
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,448
I thought you would like it.

301
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,992
(Tankhun had star fruit for the first time.)

302
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,592
(He loved it.)

303
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,544
I remember your mom said

304
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,880
you like chocolate cake.

305
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,112
That’s what mom says.

306
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,568
But the more I have it,

307
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,344
I think I like fruit cakes.

308
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,200
It’s refreshing.

309
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:13,640
But just as people say.

310
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,368
Our preferences probably change with age.

311
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,784
You used to love star fruits.

312
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,780
Anything else you’ve changed
from 10 years ago?

313
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Oh!

314
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Argh!

315
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:48,832
Botpleng!

316
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,490
Urgh.

317
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Come here.

318
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,830
Hey!

319
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,784
What are you going to do?

320
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,288
Dress that hot water burn.

321
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,580
What’s wrong?

322
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,472
Does it hurt?

323
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,490
No.

324
00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:41,360
Just thinking that you’re so nice.

325
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,376
Why are you messing around
with that vacation house?

326
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Hm?

327
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,280
How did you know?

328
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,048
Why wouldn’t I know?

329
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,848
That’s my daughter’s house.

330
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Then…

331
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,672
You should have known

332
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,280
that the one who watched over the house
was murdered.

333
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,790
I think it’s a very strange case.

334
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,192
Since we’re the owners of the house,

335
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:18,816
shouldn’t we help them out?

336
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,208
What are you on about?

337
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,424
The owner of that house is my daughter

338
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
not you.

339
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,840
Don’t you stick your nose in
and try to help anyone.

340
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,184
Your only responsibility

341
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,128
is to make that mother of yours,

342
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:33,712
who’s lying in bed all sick,

343
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,440
feel at ease, and that’s it.

344
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,304
Never go back to that house again.

345
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,136
You must have forgotten.

346
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,600
My normal life is being a journalist.

347
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,070
And the fact that I’m covering a murder case

348
00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:48,848
should be a normal sight, isn’t it, Grandma?

349
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,010
Also,

350
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:53,140
Mom should actually be glad

351
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,660
that I’m covering the news about
the one who watched over her house.

352
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,696
Don’t act like you know

353
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,856
what my daughter thinks.

354
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,880
Stop seeking trouble.

355
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,976
And stop getting involved with that case.

356
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Never go back to that house ever again.

357
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,400
That house belongs to Mom.

358
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,016
So there’s only one person
who can stop me from going there.

359
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,080
And that’s Mom.

360
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,184
I don’t understand my grandma.

361
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,500
Why is she trying to stop me
from getting involved in the case?

362
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,424
Because she’s worried
on your mom’s behalf.

363
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,830
Your mom cherishes you
like the apple of her eyes.

364
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
She even drove you back and forth
during university.

365
00:22:45,176 --> 00:22:47,180
But Grandma never cares about me.

366
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,432
Even Tankhun cares about me more.

367
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,792
What are you thinking?

368
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:56,540
Maybe scars can go away.

369
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,408
What the hell are you thinking?

370
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,784
It’s as strange as it is.

371
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,048
If I’m a little more superstitious,

372
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,216
I would think you’re bewitched.

373
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,856
Then tell me,

374
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,328
what is there for him to fool me for?

375
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,400
What do I have for him to fool me?

376
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,960
And now he’s the only one who protects me

377
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
and tries to trace back my memory.

378
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,976
Listen to me.

379
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,672
I’ll find out that answer for you.

380
00:23:26,688 --> 00:23:28,432
About why he’s being nice to you.

381
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,064
And I’ll prove it to you.

382
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:33,920
That this Tankhun is not the real one.

383
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,064
And he’s approaching you for something

384
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,992
and it’s not love.

385
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
Go ahead.

386
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,360
I’ll prove it too.

387
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,376
That this Tankhun is the real one.

388
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,648
And what’s happening between us

389
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,152
is love, indeed.

390
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,408
Would you like to relive the past?

391
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,472
Can you remember

392
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,560
what we did here?

393
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,090
Hey!

394
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,096
What are you doing?

395
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,360
Reliving the past.

396
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,152
You and I

397
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,224
we did it here?

398
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,744
What are you thinking?

399
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Pervert.

400
00:26:23,392 --> 00:26:24,392
You got it?

401
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Almost.

402
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,800
Reminds me of when we were 17.

403
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,624
I stole a potato from the farm nearby

404
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,648
not a sweet potato bought
from a supermarket like today.

405
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,832
I said I wanted grilled potatoes

406
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,040
so you made a campfire for me.

407
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,520
Took you so long to light it up.

408
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,390
It didn’t even taste good in the end.

409
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,728
Because it was a cassava.

410
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,696
And I was so unlucky that I got caught.

411
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,072
When I got back,

412
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,984
my ears were full of my mom’s scolds.

413
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,072
You can remember now?

414
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,176
I remember from the diary.

415
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,960
Actually, I still can’t remember a thing.

416
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,376
You have me, Pleng.

417
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,448
I will help you recall your memory.

418
00:27:36,592 --> 00:27:37,592
A-hem.

419
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,192
Though a grilled cassava doesn’t taste good,

420
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
it could ease your grumbling belly, Pleng.

421
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,088
Though we don’t have the cassava,

422
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,912
I will eat up all the grilled sweet potatoes.

423
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,590
By the way,

424
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,168
will you light up the fire now?

425
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,104
I think if we wait until the fire is lit up,

426
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:04,672
you would be starving to death, Pleng.

427
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,544
I’ve prepared some sandwiches in the car.

428
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,592
Have that for now.

429
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,112
I’ll get it for you.

430
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,152
HORROR!! FISHING LINE
BODY JAMMED INSIDE A LUGGAGE

431
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,632
(The autopsy confirms that)

432
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,752
(both bodies died in the same manner.)

433
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,008
(That is strangling with garrote knots.)

434
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Pleng!

435
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,776
Leave this place.

436
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,272
Unless you want to die.

437
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,430
Hey!

438
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,910
Argh!

439
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Urgh!

440
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Urgh!

441
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Urgh!

442
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,740
Pleng!

443
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,210
Pleng!

444
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
Pleng!

445
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,730
Pleng!

446
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Pleng!

447
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,064
Pleng.

448
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,370
Breathe slowly.

449
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:22,248
Breathe slowly.

450
00:30:22,272 --> 00:30:23,272
I’m here.

451
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,912
Pleng, breathe slowly.

452
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:25,792
Breathe slowly.

453
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:26,816
I’m here.

454
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,410
Pleng.

455
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,680
I’m Tankhun.

456
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,328
Your lover.

457
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,330
Tan.

458
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,416
Don’t ever leave me again.

459
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
It’s alright.

460
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,600
I’m here.

461
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,904
No one can hurt you.

462
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,896
I’ll protect you.

463
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,816
Thank you so much, doctor,

464
00:31:17,848 --> 00:31:19,820
for accepting our interview.

465
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,056
I’ve heard that

466
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,608
NewsDay Deeply likes to
interview people of different occupations.

467
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,000
But I didn’t know

468
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,776
the owner himself would be interviewing me.

469
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,168
Um… the thing is

470
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,776
I only interview those I’m interested in.

471
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,944
Let’s not waste time

472
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,448
and jump right to the point.

473
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,712
I would like to know about your background

474
00:31:40,736 --> 00:31:43,184
before starting Jennaree Podcast

475
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:45,832
until you become Gen Z’s favorite
psychiatrist.

476
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,608
It started because I studied in the UK
since I was young,

477
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,610
I almost didn’t have any Thai friends.

478
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,368
I wanted to speak Thai

479
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:55,232
and share knowledge about psychology

480
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:56,088
so I started the podcast–

481
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Um, doctor…

482
00:31:57,792 --> 00:31:59,790
Before we get into the podcast,

483
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,016
the thing is,

484
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,176
I want some new information.

485
00:32:03,216 --> 00:32:05,952
The fresh interview that

486
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,950
you’ve never done anywhere before.

487
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,312
How?

488
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,664
Exclusive.

489
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,620
Diving deep into your personal matters.

490
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,144
I believe your fans

491
00:32:18,168 --> 00:32:20,072
would want to get to know you

492
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,592
on a deeper aspect.

493
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:22,928
For example...

494
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,912
What sort of family did you grow up in?

495
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,512
How many siblings?

496
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,664
Are you close to your siblings?

497
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Things like that.

498
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,232
I think my fans

499
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,352
probably wouldn’t be curious

500
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,608
about my personal matters.

501
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,720
They’re more interested in

502
00:32:41,744 --> 00:32:44,104
the ways I can heal their hearts.

503
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,104
Let’s continue talking about my career.

504
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,184
Um…

505
00:32:48,208 --> 00:32:52,016
But doctor, personal matters
is a good resource to draw attention.

506
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,048
For the psychological matters,

507
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:57,050
I think one can just listen to your podcast.

508
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,360
Today, I’d like to ask you
about your personal matters.

509
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
Or…

510
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,584
Do you not want to talk about your family?

511
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,520
Is there any secrets?

512
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:18,660
Your behavior, Mr. Muenmile,

513
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,376
is actually of someone with secrets.

514
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:23,060
You didn’t really want to interview me.

515
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,504
What exactly do you want?

516
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,392
Even if I can’t remember the time
I had a lover 10 years ago,

517
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,928
but now I know

518
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,944
how good it feels to have a lover
taking care of me

519
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Then you had better get used to it.

520
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,344
Because you will be
taken good care of like this

521
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:07,368
for a long time.

522
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,590
No wonder why

523
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,984
I seem head over heels for you in my diary.

524
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,616
Because you’re this nice.

525
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,016
You got hurt because of me.

526
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,248
I’m okay.

527
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,416
But from now on

528
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:36,180
you might become the murderer’s target.

529
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,112
That means

530
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,552
the person I met today was the murderer?

531
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,816
I’m just speculating.

532
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,650
You might know the real identity
of the murderer

533
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,072
that’s why he’s threatening you.

534
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,224
You should stop covering this case.

535
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,816
He might do worse.

536
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
Please stop covering this case, Pleng.

537
00:35:13,872 --> 00:35:15,870
I thought you would understand me more.

538
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:20,160
I’m saying this

539
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,072
because I care about you.

540
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,570
You know what?

541
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,584
Ever since I lost my memory,

542
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,840
I’m so sick of the word “care”.

543
00:35:31,016 --> 00:35:33,020
Mom, Grandma, and my friend.

544
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,584
No one lets me do what I want for once.

545
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,784
Because of the word “care”.

546
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,248
Because they want the best for you.

547
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,088
I know.

548
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,728
But don’t you think I also care about myself?

549
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,520
What I’m doing now

550
00:35:52,544 --> 00:35:53,864
is my own choice.

551
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,984
Also, it’s my life, isn’t it?

552
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,712
Why does everyone act like my life is theirs?

553
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:03,300
Is it hard to just support me?

554
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,510
Pleng.

555
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,720
Can you not leave just yet?

556
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,410
I’m sorry.

557
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,040
Let me be on my own for a bit.

558
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,832
How is it going?

559
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,984
Did you get anything from the CCTV?

560
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,192
There was no bike without a plate
like you described.

561
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,896
You have to understand,

562
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,184
this is in the countryside,

563
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,760
there aren’t many CCTVs.

564
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:41,192
The place you went to
was also very deserted.

565
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,712
Then what are you going to do next?

566
00:36:46,192 --> 00:36:48,432
Are you going to let the witness
be the target like this?

567
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,216
You want me to send some officers
to protect Botpleng, right?

568
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,072
Isn’t that the police’s duty?

569
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,112
If I weren’t there that day,

570
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,024
Botpleng could have been a victim.

571
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,144
I know you care about him

572
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,160
but he’s not weak and fragile like you think.

573
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
See?

574
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,552
He’s so strong.

575
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,160
Even without you, he can protect himself.

576
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,120
But why, on that day,

577
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,250
he didn’t seem to be able to protect himself?

578
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,280
Maybe because you were there.

579
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,656
So he wanted to be weak

580
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:32,056
to have you take care of him.

581
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,120
Just pulling your legs.

582
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,584
Still, a criminal is more threatening than I am.

583
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,392
I’ll get the protective police sorted.

584
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,688
But Botpleng is quite odd.

585
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,272
After being threatened in person like that,

586
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:48,856
other people would have been scared.

587
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,584
But he still wants to cover the case.

588
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,580
Don’t you think that’s pretty fearless?

589
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:03,792
(Yes, I’m also curious)

590
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:06,544
(what your true self is like.)

591
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,740
Tankhun.

592
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,920
What are you doing here?

593
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,712
I miss you.

594
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,980
What if you came and I wasn’t here?

595
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,550
Well…

596
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,208
Probably staring at your roof instead?

597
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
So you’re all the way here

598
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,580
to stare at my roof?

599
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,192
To make it up to you.

600
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,576
Forgive me, Pleng.

601
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,752
With a cassava?

602
00:38:58,768 --> 00:38:59,648
Seriously?

603
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Well…

604
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,576
You said you wanted to relive the past.

605
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,920
You’re making it up to me
with something that doesn’t taste good?

606
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,250
What is it now?

607
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,736
It’s hard to swallow.

608
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,310
Got to wash it down with some water.

609
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,620
Is this what you call romantic?

610
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,370
Have some.

611
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,384
Our memory

612
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,136
doesn’t taste good at all.

613
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,176
Then let’s create new memories.

614
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Get washed up and hurry home.

615
00:40:59,432 --> 00:41:00,608
My grandma will be back soon.

616
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,904
Am I your secret now?

617
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,496
I’d rather you be the truth.

618
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,648
The truth that no one can take you away from me.

619
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,664
The link between the two is

620
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,472
they both used to work for the Thayadon family.

621
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,768
I’m taking up the case because of you.

622
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,112
LIKE.

623
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,904
Who would ever let their first love

624
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:20,448
go through such a dreadful case alone?

625
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,400
Look for infamous news about Botpleng’s father.

626
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Dig deep.

627
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,576
Tonight…

628
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,216
Can I sleep with you?

629
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,272
I just want to

630
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,960
relive the memory.

631
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,488
You’re looking for your older brother, right?

632
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:44,816
The one who’s with you now

633
00:41:44,856 --> 00:41:46,192
is not Tankhun.

634
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,984
That’s why you can’t remember him.

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,416
Even if I don’t have the memory of 10 years ago,

636
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:53,864
I think I have made new memories now.

637
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
I like you.

638
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,990
Will you please never be gone again?
