1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,656
Which identity is my true self?

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:04,868
Pleng!

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:08,928
I know him.

4
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:12,844
(My name is Botpleng Thayadon.)

5
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:15,897
(The only child of my parents.)

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,285
How is it going, Tanu?

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,328
Hello, Mrs. Kan.

8
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:22,700
Hello, Mr. Petch.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,810
GRANDMA.

10
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,210
He was in a deep hypnosis.

11
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,597
But after the phone rang,
he got out of it.

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,404
There must be something
about this ringtone.

13
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:52,948
Okay, I’ll head back right away.

14
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:55,099
The ringtone?

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,370
What was the ringtone song?

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,117
Probably Canon.

17
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:05,902
Canon in D.

18
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:45,325
Grandma set this ringtone for me.

19
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:48,946
Why?

20
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,699
I never asked.

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,251
I thought

22
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,499
she just did it.

23
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,197
There’s something to it, right?

24
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:01,601
You react to this melody.

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,247
Which is from your dad’s old violin

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,300
and also your ringtone.

27
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:08,945
Maybe it’s the trigger of a hypnosis.

28
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,180
Can you check on this?

29
00:03:13,722 --> 00:03:15,477
We’ll probably have to
check on everything.

30
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,051
Just like how they’re checking on us.

31
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:24,995
Is anything wrong?

32
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,800
I think I saw a shadow
in front of your house

33
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:30,134
before your grandma called.

34
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,998
What did your grandma say?

35
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:36,453
She just told me to hurry home.

36
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,865
If someone’s watching,

37
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,497
this place might not be safe anymore.

38
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:50,197
Let’s take this back to Bangkok.

39
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:51,903
I also have a patient to attend to.

40
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,275
But…

41
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:58,251
Can I stay here for now?

42
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,072
But we’re about to find out the truth.

43
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,847
You saw that house,

44
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:06,453
a new information you’ve never known
during the time you lost your memory.

45
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,900
Not to mention that Canon in D song.

46
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:13,634
Jen.

47
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:16,525
You can head back.

48
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,251
I’ll stay with Pleng.

49
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,029
Tan.

50
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,096
Pleng is not just a suspect.

51
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,551
He’s also my lover.

52
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,708
Pleng’s family doesn’t want him
to remember

53
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,471
because they don’t want him to get hurt.

54
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,180
Hypnotizing him to remember

55
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,731
is like forcing him
towards his most fragile memories.

56
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,497
Jen.

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,346
The truth

58
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,579
is not so important that
we have to corner someone in.

59
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,699
I’m sorry.

60
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,100
Why were you gone for so long?

61
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,847
Did I...

62
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,370
make you and Doc Jen fight?

63
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,900
I was just grabbing my violin.

64
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:45,988
This is yours?

65
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,247
Thun was very attached to me.

66
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,448
He refused to study or do anything

67
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,626
if I didn’t do it too.

68
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,171
Sometimes being Thun’s brother

69
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:03,400
brought me closer to
being this family’s son.

70
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:08,896
I never enjoyed playing the violin.

71
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:13,447
But I love it so much.

72
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,734
Since it’s the only thing my dad loves.

73
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,268
To the point that I don’t know now

74
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,583
whether my dad’s violin still stands for
the love my family has for me.

75
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,045
I’m afraid.

76
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:34,299
I’m afraid that if I know the truth,

77
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:37,580
everything won’t be the same.

78
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:51,302
I didn’t enjoy playing the violin either.

79
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,069
Until I met you.

80
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,179
That’s when I understand

81
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,038
when a musician wants to play
the most beautiful melody

82
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,795
for someone he loves

83
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,397
and what it feels like.

84
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,453
I want the sound of the violin

85
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,045
to be the sound of love,
like it used to be.

86
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,896
The love

87
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,801
between you

88
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,102
and I.

89
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,167
Daisy.

00:08:01,305 --> 00:08:03,025

on the seat

101
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:52,001
of a bicycle built for two.

102
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,102
The house I saw in my dreams

103
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,402
used to be here.

104
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,746
Even your memory

105
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,201
can be erased.

106
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,497
So does an entire house.

107
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:41,005
The house can’t be brought back

108
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:43,656
but my memory can.

109
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:46,995
The one who wants to make me forget
made a mistake.

110
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,100
For letting the housekeeper
send me the diary.

111
00:09:53,777 --> 00:09:54,429
That’s right.

112
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,197
Or I wouldn’t be able
to reach you so easily.

113
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:02,499
But why did he send that diary to you?

114
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,032
Maybe because of Thunphob.

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,597
Hey.

116
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,497
Do you not believe in supernaturals?

117
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,048
But I believe in the power of the mind.

118
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,401
Thunphob’s mind that wanted us
to find the truth.

119
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,352
It’s not the truth,

120
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,152
what Thunphob sent me.

121
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:44,598
It’s you.

122
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,296
Maybe you can hear
the melody of the leaves now.

123
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,151
Since you’re this good at flirting.

124
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,229
You have a point.

125
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,202
I want to try listening
to the sound of the leaves again.

126
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,779
I wonder if Botpleng’s memory returned,

127
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,502
what melody would I hear from the leaves?

128
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,145
Are you ready now?

129
00:11:21,274 --> 00:11:22,296
You can book Doc Jen.

130
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,189
This time, I will turn off my phone

131
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,000
and won’t let anything
wake me up from the truth.

132
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,552
Yes, Jen?

133
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:04,598
Jen.

134
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:05,749
How are you doing?

135
00:12:06,757 --> 00:12:07,710
Nothing big.

136
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,311
I tried to run away
and jumped off the 2nd floor

137
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,451
so I ended up like this.

138
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:14,100
You got chased in a hospital?

139
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,767
And you?

140
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:22,851
Why are you with Doc Jen?

141
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,210
Well, I…

142
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:29,850
I reckon she’s alone, so I help out.

143
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,201
So you and Tankhun can be at ease.

144
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:34,402
Yeah.

145
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,802
You guys are close enough
that you can call him over now?

146
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,336
Well…

147
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,503
I’m hitting on him.

148
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:46,251
Alright?

149
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:47,671
Jen!

150
00:12:47,705 --> 00:12:49,703
Shouldn’t I call him over when I get hurt?

151
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:53,099
Sympathy is a good chance for love.

152
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:57,699
Okay.

153
00:12:58,114 --> 00:12:59,103
I see what it is now.

154
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,004
I won’t ask you anything anymore.

155
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,099
Good.

156
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,099
Can we get to the point now?

157
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,971
Tanu is already arrested.

158
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,537
Why is this happening to Jen?

159
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:32,102
Jennaree tries to recover Botpleng’s memory
that has been locked away.

160
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,383
Botpleng’s memory
that has been locked away

161
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,878
might have something to do
with the corruption.

162
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:40,602
Botpleng was made to forget

163
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:44,700
while the others involved were killed.

164
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,302
SUSPECT.

165
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:52,650
Why do I feel like

166
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,254
there are missing puzzles.

167
00:13:59,155 --> 00:14:00,496
Are the puzzles missing

168
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,699
or do you refuse to piece them together?

169
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,202
Right now, what you’re supposed to do is

170
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,798
find evidence
to arrest Botpleng’s family.

171
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,499
Or would you like to wait
until Jennaree is gone, too?

172
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,248
It’s time

173
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:18,102
that you look for the culprit

174
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,702
not a lover.

175
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,065
I’ve talked to the governor.

176
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:27,897
There’s a recording too.

177
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,346
In case you want to listen to it yourself.

178
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:34,783
I became a journalist

179
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,253
to set my dad’s record straight.

180
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:39,296
But from the cases that happened,

181
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,610
I’m so close to believing that
my dad’s guilty.

182
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:45,054
But suddenly, you’re saying that
my dad’s not guilty?

183
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,198
Hey, I’m not saying that.

184
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,300
Actually, I didn’t even think about that.

185
00:14:52,503 --> 00:14:54,099
I’m just helping you investigate

186
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,598
in case we can find the real culprit.

187
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:00,896
Whether it’s your mom, your grandma,

188
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,905
or others who are involved.

189
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,651
But after listening
to the governor’s words,

190
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:09,500
I’m at a dead end.

191
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:19,103
(What did you find out?)

192
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,065
(If you’re putting it like that)

193
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,600
(it must mean there’s something
I could find out)

194
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,201
But you’re just unsure
if I know it, right?

195
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:32,198
Being a journalist doesn’t mean
you can threaten or cross anyone.

196
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,330
I’m sorry if you misunderstood
my intention.

197
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,503
I heard that 15 years ago,

198
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:43,533
you and Sheriff Petchkla
were the pioneers of wind power

199
00:15:43,554 --> 00:15:44,801
in the lower north-eastern region

200
00:15:46,564 --> 00:15:49,801
before you guys were
investigated for fraud.

201
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:54,404
Then everything ended
because Sheriff Petchkla died.

202
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,552
You know what?

203
00:15:56,454 --> 00:15:58,930
The saddest part for me
was not Petchkla’s death

204
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,598
but the fact that he died
before the result came through.

205
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,782
(He conducted his duty honestly.)

206
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,200
(He never cheated on anyone.)

207
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:10,780
(Let alone cheating on the country.)

208
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,604
Then…

209
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:22,502
If my dad’s never cheated on anyone,

210
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,968
all our hypothesis is down the drain.

211
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:32,703
That means digging up my dad’s case
was not what triggered the murderer.

212
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,499
Then why did they kill
my parents’ subordinates?

213
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:40,604
What if they killed

214
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,702
because something else was the trigger?

215
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,029
Such as you.

216
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:53,697
Someone died at that house
since the first day you stepped into it.

217
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,500
The only one who tries
to ward you off that house

218
00:16:57,994 --> 00:16:59,004
is our grandmother.

219
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:01,925
Isn’t that suspicious?

220
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:06,601
You’re trying to say that

221
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,217
my grandma is behind all this

222
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,703
including framing my dad?

223
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:13,405
Yeah.

224
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:17,802
Didn’t you say it yourself that
your grandma doesn’t love you

225
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,004
and doesn’t like your dad.

226
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:21,245
Isn’t it suspicious?

227
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,831
I will feed the fish, too.

228
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:33,579
Grandma.

229
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,731
Would you like to make merit
for Dad with us?

230
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,343
It’ll probably have an adverse effect.

231
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,859
If you were to make merit,
it should be done with full intention.

232
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,531
And if I want to do it,
I can be at it on my own.

233
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,201
I don’t need your invitation.

234
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,497
Grandma is not so fond of Dad.

235
00:17:58,331 --> 00:18:01,100
She thinks that your dad stole
her daughter and made me struggle.

236
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:03,195
But that’s not true.

237
00:18:04,045 --> 00:18:06,401
When I’m with your dad and have you,

238
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:08,032
I’m so happy.

239
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:12,202
It’s okay if you and I
are the only ones who like Dad.

240
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:14,300
If Grandma doesn’t, then just let her be.

241
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:17,109
This is it.

242
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,797
A chance for you to prove
your dad’s innocence.

243
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,000
Narrowing down the culprit
from anyone in your family

244
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:29,979
to just your grandma?

245
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,001
What do you think?

246
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,051
I don’t know.

247
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,099
At this point, I don’t want
to believe anything anymore.

248
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,496
Hey!

249
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:49,604
Tankhun!

250
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,204
He’s probably hungry.

251
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,099
Are you okay?

252
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,604
I’m okay.

253
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,604
I should ask you.

254
00:19:15,017 --> 00:19:15,682
Are you okay?

255
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:17,986
I learned martial arts.

256
00:19:18,388 --> 00:19:19,503
This won’t–

257
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,872
Ouch! Ouch!

258
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:25,250
And you’re saying you’re okay?
Ow!

259
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,340
Why did you touch it? It hurts!

260
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,151
Right there. That’s it.

261
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,720
But you said you’re okay.

262
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:40,780
Hey, this is accidental and age-incited.

263
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:41,700
Can’t help it.

264
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:46,082
Thank you.

265
00:19:55,688 --> 00:19:56,863
So what are you going to do?

266
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:01,102
Well… you’ll have to…

267
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:04,702
Take care of me

268
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,979
at my apartment.

269
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,302
Why?

270
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,047
Do you not want to go?

271
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:12,303
No.

272
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:17,802
But I meant to say

273
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,066
I think your apartment is a bit too empty.

274
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,200
I’ve never thought of
that place as my home.

275
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:27,571
I was staying there just
to investigate Thunphob’s case.

276
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,648
But I want to make it a home.

277
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:37,708
Just having you there,

278
00:20:38,574 --> 00:20:39,580
that’s when it becomes a home.

279
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,506
Good.

280
00:20:43,925 --> 00:20:45,164
Then just give them to me.

281
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,626
Both the one in Khao Yai
and your apartment too.

282
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:48,284
Okay?

283
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:49,531
Okay.

284
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,585
And I’ll give you one more thing.

285
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:54,096
What is it?

286
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,795
Last name.

287
00:20:58,536 --> 00:20:59,158
Tan!

288
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:02,666
People will see us!

289
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:04,208
There’s no one.
Put it on properly.

290
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,663
-Just a bit?
-Hmm!

291
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:14,373
I’m bored.

292
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,702
Are you going to finish it today?

293
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:17,979
There’s no rush.

294
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:24,699
I don’t know.

295
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:27,896
I think we need to hurry.

296
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:41,402
Whether my memory returns or not,

297
00:21:43,318 --> 00:21:45,579
I will find the last piece of the puzzle.

298
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,100
We will investigate, along with hypnosis.

299
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,463
I won’t let anyone be the next victim.

300
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,850
GRANDMA.

301
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,546
What?!

302
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:15,000
Mom!

303
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,779
Yes?

304
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,002
Why can’t Mom speak, Grandma?

305
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,561
Her muscles haven’t recovered.

306
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:44,801
It will take some time.

307
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:49,601
It’s alright, Mom.

308
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,774
Just having you wake up to me,

309
00:22:53,634 --> 00:22:54,850
it already makes me so happy.

310
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,595
I’ll take care of you, Mom.

311
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,364
I’ll see if you can do what you say.

312
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,800
Not just running around for people
who would destroy this family and your mom.

313
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,499
Don’t be afraid, Mom.

314
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,699
I will protect you.

315
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:37,680
Why did you let Botpleng go home?

316
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,801
You know full well

317
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,466
that the most suspicious person
is Pleng’s Grandma.

318
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,552
That’s right.

319
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,425
But Pleng insisted
that he has to protect his mother.

320
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:49,296
Why?

321
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:51,703
Aren’t you afraid that Pleng
would be in danger?

322
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,499
If Madame were to hurt Pleng,

323
00:23:55,262 --> 00:23:56,296
she would have done it long ago.

324
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,819
When I say ‘in danger’,
I’m not talking about Pleng’s life.

325
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:04,696
I’m talking about his memory.

326
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:07,903
If they can make Pleng forget everything,

327
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,053
it’s over.

328
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,995
(I sent you something.
Look forward to it.)

329
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,601
What did you get me?

330
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,576
I got myself delivered.

331
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:55,402
What do you think?
Do you like it?

332
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,700
What are you doing?

333
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,757
Someone will notice you.

334
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:04,903
Come over here.

335
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,232
It’s really risky, you know?

336
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,111
What would I do
if you got hurt like Doc Jen?

337
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,453
You don’t have to do anything.

338
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:21,850
I’ll run away in time anyway.

339
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,096
Do you think I’m being reckless?

340
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:38,900
You haven’t read my mind for a while now
that you’re so eager to do it?

341
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,567
I’m not here to read your mind.

342
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:43,370
I’m here because I want to see you.

343
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:15,198
I’m so close to knowing the truth.

344
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,404
Not too long

345
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,503
and I’ll be there for you
to read my mind every day.

346
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,654
I’m worried about you.

347
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,100
Don’t worry.

348
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,002
This is my house.

349
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,160
I can get away.

350
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:49,001
Oh.

351
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,010
By the way.

352
00:27:51,472 --> 00:27:52,997
I think I found something odd.

353
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,200
Have a look.

354
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:55,880
Here.

355
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,401
What’s this?

356
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:01,171
See?

357
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,300
There’s no picture of Grandma.

358
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:06,731
I think

359
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,872
I have to look for more evidences

360
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,260
while waiting for Mom to get better.

361
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,647
You won’t forget me again, right?

362
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,601
Never.

363
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,028
While you were asleep,

364
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,795
I have so many things
I wanted to tell you.

365
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:52,783
But this one

366
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,450
is what you’d probably
want to know the most.

367
00:28:57,863 --> 00:28:59,198
I have a lover now, Mom.

368
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,842
His name is Tankhun.

369
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,800
He’s Thunphob’s older brother.

370
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,447
Do you know Thunphob, Mom?

371
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,302
You might know him as Tankhun

372
00:29:22,016 --> 00:29:23,598
but he’s actually Thunphob.

373
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,447
He used Tankhun’s name
when he got to know me.

374
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,456
Tan…

375
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:32,337
Khun…
Mom!

376
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:35,299
Thun–

377
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:36,954
Thun–

378
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,797
Thunphob…

379
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,450
Mom!

380
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,490
Die!

381
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:46,029
Mom!

382
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:47,955
-Die!
-Mom!

383
00:29:48,577 --> 00:29:49,051
Mom!
Mom!

384
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,148
Mom!

385
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,945
-Die!
-I’m here, Mom.

386
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:54,680
Die!
Mom!

387
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:56,066
What are you doing?

388
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:57,998
What have you done to your mom?

389
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:58,903
Huh?

390
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,404
I just told her about Tankhun.

391
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,091
That’s enough.
Be on your way!

392
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:06,610
Kan! Kan! Kan!

393
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:07,294
Kan!

394
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:08,371
Thun…

395
00:30:09,703 --> 00:30:10,111
Mom!

396
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:16,253
Mom.

397
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,552
Go! I’ll take care of my daughter.

398
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,318
Go!

399
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,700
Go!

400
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:22,850
Go!

401
00:30:36,924 --> 00:30:38,151
(I think my mom)

402
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,197
(knows what happened to Thunphob.)

403
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,198
Botpleng Thayadon.

404
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,930
Where are you right now?

405
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,047
I’m at an old wooden house.

406
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:03,696
No.

407
00:31:05,094 --> 00:31:06,921
Right now, you’re 18.

408
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:10,300
You were in a long sleep.

409
00:31:11,576 --> 00:31:13,702
Then you wake up to see your mom.

410
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,099
What do you see?

411
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:19,173
Mom.

412
00:31:20,654 --> 00:31:22,351
She asks me how I’m doing.

413
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,370
Good.

414
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,851
Hello?

415
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,927
(I’m having a meal.)

416
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:52,549
(Do you have anything to say?)

417
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,200
If not, I’ll hang up.

418
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,152
I have to take care of my mom.

419
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:03,804
Pleng got hypnotized by that family.

420
00:32:35,348 --> 00:32:37,500
Someone harmed the person
who tried to take Botpleng

421
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,797
away from his mom and grandma.

422
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:42,527
Do you know who?

423
00:32:44,597 --> 00:32:45,226
Here.

424
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:48,699
Someone who used to work
for Kedsara’s husband.

425
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,398
Now you know

426
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,601
that the mastermind behind all this
is the Thayadon family.

427
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,251
I have nothing to do
with the Thayadon family.

428
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:08,303
But you do for Thunphob’s death, right?

429
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,752
This is yours, right?

430
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:35,902
I have another good news for you.

431
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:40,002
Khitakan, your old boss, is conscious now.

432
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:44,502
If she knows that you’re arrested,

433
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,998
how can she be sure
that you won’t spill anything?

434
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,327
She might

435
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,853
knock you out entirely.

436
00:34:03,331 --> 00:34:04,000
Tanu.

437
00:34:05,979 --> 00:34:08,751
Right now, your time is counting down.

438
00:34:11,205 --> 00:34:12,604
Stop protecting others.

439
00:34:13,714 --> 00:34:16,997
Your life is in your hands.

440
00:34:19,962 --> 00:34:23,980
Pick a smarter choice and let
the Thayadon face their karma.

441
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:29,897
I’ll come clean.

442
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:41,500
You have to thank me for many more things.

443
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:45,502
Because I’ll do so much more for you.

444
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,382
You’re boasting.

445
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:47,546
I’m not!

446
00:34:47,847 --> 00:34:48,758
I’m being serious.

447
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:52,997
It’s like we’re taking turns
being stuck in bed.

448
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:57,149
Have a bite.

449
00:34:58,102 --> 00:34:59,447
It’s your favorite.

450
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:04,699
I’m not sure if it’s good.

451
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:07,182
But if you want to have a delicious one

452
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,702
then you should quickly recover
and make one yourself.

453
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,798
It’s really good.

454
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,401
Someone’s tasting it for you, right?

455
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:23,980
No.

456
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,251
I only have you, Mom.

457
00:35:38,382 --> 00:35:41,982
Bless you.

458
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:49,099
How are you doing?

459
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,099
Feeling more at ease now?

460
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:54,499
Ever since Pleng became
the same Pleng,

461
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,598
I’m no longer worried.

462
00:35:57,924 --> 00:35:59,598
Thank you so much, Mom.

463
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,536
I’m always a trouble for you.

464
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:04,100
It’s alright.

465
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,500
I hope you can really stop worrying.

466
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:10,903
He keeps bringing trouble

467
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:13,001
while his mom is sick.

468
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:19,402
I think everything’s about to get better.

469
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,429
5 years that I’ve been sick,
it felt like being dead, though I’m alive.

470
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,600
Heaven must have seen

471
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:32,198
that I’ve already repaid
all the sins I did to Thunphob.

472
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:45,940
This is a special bugging device.

473
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:47,797
Inspector Dao gave it to me.

474
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,672
Definitely better than the one you have.

475
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,398
Thank you.

476
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,786
I think

477
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:01,601
Grandma will probably hypnotize me

478
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,576
so that I’ll only remember things about me

479
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:05,801
and forget about you and the murder cases.

480
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:07,499
I also think that

481
00:37:08,668 --> 00:37:10,998
she probably does this to my mom, too.

482
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,499
Yeah.

483
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:19,804
Hey.

484
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,002
Aren’t you worried about me anymore?

485
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:24,520
I told you

486
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,202
it’s not dangerous.

487
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,601
You’re right.

488
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,001
It even surprises me

489
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,145
how your grandma could do all this alone.

490
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:36,696
Just a little more

491
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:39,398
and we’ll get to know the truth.

492
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,949
Just a little more

493
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,228
and we’ll get to be together.

494
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:00,204
(Heaven must have seen)

495
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,899
(that I’ve already repaid all the sins
I did to Thunphob.)

496
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,202
(Tankhun, I’m sorry.)

497
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,700
(My mom’s the one who killed Thunphob.)

498
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,582
Thank you, Mom.

499
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:36,554
Well, here.

500
00:38:37,377 --> 00:38:38,377
No, you should do it yourself.

501
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,234
Look, he’s all grown up now.

502
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:43,300
You don’t have to be so accommodating.

503
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,010
I want to make up for lost time
that I wasn’t there for him.

504
00:38:48,546 --> 00:38:49,081
Hmm.

505
00:38:53,746 --> 00:38:54,297
Pleng!

506
00:39:01,191 --> 00:39:01,863
Pleng, son.

507
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:03,351
Pleng!

508
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,482
It’s late.

509
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:06,659
Where are you going?

510
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:13,103
I’m getting out of here.

511
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:14,697
Why?

512
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,100
You and Mom can’t fool me anymore.

513
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:35,979
My mom has come back to her senses now.

514
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,296
-I have to go.
-Wait.

515
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,530
The strings on your dad’s violin
have been changed.

516
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:43,299
That’s why it doesn’t sound like
any other violins.

517
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,952
Your ringtone is also Canon in D

518
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:47,666
which is recorded from that violin.

519
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:49,970
It’s the trigger of a hypnosis.

520
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:54,946
Then…

521
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,552
There must be a way to counter it, right?

522
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,201
(You can play a podcast or any sound)

523
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,930
(just so that there’s another
disrupting sound.)

524
00:40:05,022 --> 00:40:07,053
(Or you can recite
the multiplication table )

525
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:10,094
(so that there are multiple sound waves
working unconstantly.)

526
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:15,349
I knew it.

527
00:40:16,194 --> 00:40:17,792
You’re all about ruining this family!

528
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:19,368
The ones who destroy this family–

529
00:40:19,431 --> 00:40:20,102
That’s you!

530
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:21,579
It’s you and Mom!

531
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,300
That’s not true!

532
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,231
And you guys didn’t just
destroy our family.

533
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,746
You also destroy the other’s family, too!

534
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,601
That’s not true!

535
00:40:30,082 --> 00:40:31,007
That’s not true, honey.
That’s not true.

536
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:32,748
That’s not true.
Pleng.

537
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:35,983
That’s not it, son.

538
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:36,896
Pleng.

539
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:38,560
That’s not it.

540
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,545
I love you.

541
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,320
That’s not what it is, Pleng.

542
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:54,395
But I hate

543
00:40:58,485 --> 00:40:59,983
I hate murderers like you guys.

544
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,605
I hate this family.

545
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:06,742
That’s not what it is, Pleng.

546
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:07,968
Pleng!

547
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,205
Pleng!

548
00:41:09,623 --> 00:41:10,534
Pleng!

549
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:15,770
Pleng!

550
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,977
Please don’t cry alone again, Pleng.

551
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,271
There’s only your heart

552
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:46,899
that makes me feel safe.

553
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,629
I want to make it our home.

554
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:49,980
Got you!

555
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:52,899
Keep one with you at all times.

556
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,297
You should keep one as well

557
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:56,097
so that I can find you too.

558
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,604
You don’t know that
I started buying things in pairs

559
00:43:59,077 --> 00:44:00,260
since the first time I met you.
