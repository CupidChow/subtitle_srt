1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,256
I will prove to you

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,560
that this Tankhun is a fake one.

3
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:05,984
And approached you because he wants something.

4
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:08,584
Why does everyone act like my life is theirs?

5
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,792
Oh, Tankhun.

6
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,090
You’re up?

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,740
Hey.

8
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,416
Don’t make a face as if I defiled you.

9
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,424
It’s you who invaded my sleeping space.

10
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,610
So…

11
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,650
Are you feeling better now?

12
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,472
Why do I feel weird?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Tankhun!

14
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,330
Tankhun!

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,376
Here you go. Some medicines.

16
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,176
Are you sure

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,900
you don’t have to go to the doctor?

18
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
Yeah.

19
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,260
I should be okay after some antihistamines.

20
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,056
You’re allergic to cassava?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,552
Uncooked cassava is naturally toxic.

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,624
I was in a hurry to see you

23
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:56,808
so I might now have cooked it through.

24
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,472
If you don’t believe me,

25
00:01:58,504 --> 00:01:59,808
you can get me a cooked one.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
I’ll eat it and show you

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,344
so you know that I’m fine.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,880
I thought you were allergic,
so I threw them all out.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,320
You haven’t had water, right?

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,528
The antihistamine I have at home

31
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,056
makes you sleepy.

32
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,888
I don’t want to fall asleep here.

33
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,712
The antihistamine you have at home

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
is strong indeed.

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,008
You’re lucky

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,184
that no one is home

37
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,032
so you could stay the night.

38
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:40,704
Hey.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,728
Get washed up already.

40
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,728
Before my grandmother comes.

41
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,176
Am I your secret now?

42
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:55,810
I’d rather you be my truth.

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,768
The truth that no one
can take you away from me.

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,528
Yeah?

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,864
(We need to talk.)

46
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:44,904
(I’ll call you back.)

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,632
You’re with him, right?

48
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:48,856
Yeah, why?

49
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:50,512
Kick him out.

50
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,488
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,700
Just hurry up and say what you want to say.

52
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,792
(The person who’s with you now)

53
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:57,856
(is not Tankhun.)

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
(He’s Thunphob.)

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,272
Tankhun’s younger brother.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,928
(That’s why you couldn’t recognize him.)

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
How did you know?

58
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,488
Who are you talking to, Pleng?

59
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,910
(Pleng!)

60
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,420
(Pleng!)

61
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:16,784
Something about work.

62
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,808
I see.

63
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,072
Is this mine?

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
No.

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,456
Not yours.

66
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,968
When you invited me for tea

67
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I didn’t think it would be this serious.

68
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,208
My mom likes it.

69
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,060
I’ve been making her one every day.

70
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,120
She even sulked at me when I didn’t.

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,152
It’s tough being an only child.

72
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,688
That’s why I want a sibling.

73
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,976
So my mom can put it on someone else.

74
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,248
What about you?

75
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,048
Do you have any siblings?

76
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I do.

77
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,752
But we haven’t talked in a while.

78
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,344
Are you guys not close?

79
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,512
You can tell me.

80
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,810
I want to know how it feels to have siblings.

81
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,176
Just kids who grew up together.

82
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,504
Nothing interesting.

83
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,136
Your tea

84
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,104
is even more interesting.

85
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,880
Try it.

86
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:30,180
See if it deserves your interest.

87
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,968
My family’s ritual.

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,104
You have to have tea with cookies.

89
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,952
(Just knew that Tankhun has
a mild allergy to nuts.)

90
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,980
(He will throw up if he has one.)

91
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,430
Pleng.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes?

93
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,368
If you weren’t a journalist

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,184
you could open up a tea cafe.

95
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:25,216
It’s really good.

96
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,472
(You’re really not Tankhun?)

97
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,510
Pleng!

98
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
The cookie…

99
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,432
Are there nuts in it?

100
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
Uh…

101
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,416
I don’t know.

102
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:48,464
Why?

103
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,240
I’m allergic to nuts.

104
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:51,712
This one’s real. I’m not pretending.

105
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
Tankhun!

106
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,416
Yes!

107
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:02,592
Oh!

108
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,030
Tankhun!

109
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,120
(I don’t know where you get your info)

110
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,616
(but I’m sure he’s the real Tankhun.)

111
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,490
Are you okay?

112
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,500
Do you need to go to the hospital?

113
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,420
It’s alright.

114
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,616
I already had some antihistamine.

115
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,168
I guess it’s still working.

116
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,790
Come here.

117
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,400
Shall I call a doctor in?

118
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,160
It’s okay.

119
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:56,392
I’m not that sick.

120
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,390
Look.

121
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,824
Don’t make me feel like

122
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,560
you’d always be unlucky around me.

123
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,210
I’m actually lucky to have you.

124
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
Thank you.

125
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,568
For caring so much about me.

126
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:22,712
Then…

127
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,224
Shall we have the doctor examine you?

128
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,970
In case there’s anything bad.

129
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Hey!

130
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,928
I’m not your doctor.

131
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,704
You’re quite cheeky.

132
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,184
I actually

133
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:44,720
have a personal doctor.

134
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,640
Why do you need a personal doctor?

135
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,768
That’s my secret.

136
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,992
Mom is the only one

137
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,632
who knows about my secrets

138
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:16,752
and our relationship.

139
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,750
But she has been in a coma for a long time.

140
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Then I…

141
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,552
I’m your secret, indeed.

142
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yes.

143
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,728
You’re a secret.

144
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,504
But a secret I want to unravel.

145
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,872
I lost you along with my memory.

146
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,872
But I will find it.

147
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,416
Then hurry up and find me.

148
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
You know what?

149
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,960
During university,

150
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
my mom would drive me around every day.

151
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,504
My friends even called me a mama boy.

152
00:12:18,528 --> 00:12:20,500
I was so embarrassed.

153
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,304
I wanted to look up “new mom near me”.

154
00:12:26,888 --> 00:12:28,890
But after mom got into an accident

155
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,656
and fall into a coma like this…

156
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,936
I’d rather she’s not sick

157
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,380
and drive me around for the rest of my life.

158
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,480
Your mom probably loves you dearly.

159
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:48,424
Can you believe it?

160
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,248
I’ve never gone clubbing.

161
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
Mom was always with me wherever I went.

162
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,712
Don’t know why she’d be so worried.

163
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,576
Then do you want to go with me?

164
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,320
Do you mean now?

165
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,550
Yeah.

166
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,680
Right here, right now.

167
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,008
(What sort of power does he possess?)

168
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:46,460
(It makes my body feel so light.)

169
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,696
(As if I can fly.)

170
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,584
(If I can wish anything from god, )

171
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,312
(apart from mom’s recovery)

172
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,768
(I wish I could remember Tankhun forever.)

173
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,608
(Never forget him again.)

174
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
I feel like

175
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,792
my heart is beating so hard.

176
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,288
Your cheeks are so red.

177
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,712
Are you allergic to anything?

178
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,312
I just found what I’m allergic to.

179
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
It’s you.

180
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,530
Yeah?

181
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,568
Well then…

182
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,856
You’ll have to use me as an antihistamine.

183
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,432
Even if I can’t remember
what happened 10 years ago,

184
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,970
But I think

185
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
I’ve made new memories.

186
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,632
I think

187
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:41,696
I like you.

188
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,376
Will you please never be gone again?

189
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,380
Um…

190
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,856
I’m sorry once again

191
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,176
about the cookie with nuts.

192
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:10,904
It’s alright.

193
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,136
You didn’t know.

194
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:13,456
If you did and still do it,

195
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
that’s when I should be angry.

196
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,696
Still, it’s a cookie from my house.

197
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,440
I should have asked you first.

198
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,376
It won’t happen again.

199
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:29,496
I promise.

200
00:16:31,808 --> 00:16:33,810
(Because you are actually Tankhun.)

201
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,376
Tankhun was allergic to nuts like the diary said

202
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,810
so you just believed him?

203
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,264
With that face,

204
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,880
you probably don’t trust me.

205
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,984
Being allergic to nuts is not a great secret.

206
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,112
If he’s really Tankhun’s younger brother

207
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,540
pretending to be him,

208
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,560
then he should have known it.

209
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:07,980
But you believe the undercover plot, huh?

210
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,192
Because there’s a sound reason

211
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,880
that Thunphob is pretending to be Tankhun.

212
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
What are you on about?

213
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,248
Check this out.

214
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,896
Jennaree Rongsomphong.

215
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,128
I’ve just interviewed her

216
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,540
and sneakily asked about her family.

217
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,944
But she wouldn’t talk about it

218
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,050
and even avoided answering the question.

219
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,200
That’s so suspicious.

220
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,430
Looked like she’s keeping a secret, too.

221
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,650
Maybe she just didn’t want your nose
in her personal life.

222
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,888
Then have a read by yourself.

223
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:56,032
Perhaps you can see light.

224
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,128
“Wish fulfilled.”

225
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,872
“The Rongsomphong family thrilled”

226
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,600
“when Thunphob Rongsomphong”

227
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,832
“is accepted into the criminology department”

228
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:12,984
“at the University of Staffordshire. ”

229
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
“He’s preparing to be a criminologist
following his father’s footsteps.”

230
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,136
“While Tankhun Rongsomphong”

231
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,576
“made it into the faculty of medicine
at University College London.”

232
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,088
“Looking forward to finding out”

233
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,976
“which brother Jennaree,
the youngest daughter, will resemble.”

234
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,496
If you still don’t believe me,

235
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,010
you’ll have to find out the answer yourself.

236
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,976
VICTIMS.

237
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,384
The link between the two victims is

238
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,920
both used to work for the Thayadon family.

239
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,220
One worked for Botpleng’s mom.

240
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
One worked for Botpleng’s dad.

241
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
What do you think?

242
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,128
The murderer picked the victims

243
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,146
who have worked for the Thayadon family.

244
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:04,912
Reasons?

245
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:07,180
From the fact that the bodies were shown off,

246
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,568
there could be 4 main reasons.

247
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,304
One, for revenge or to humiliate the victims.

248
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,648
Two, for attention.

249
00:19:13,672 --> 00:19:14,992
Projecting power to the public.

250
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,952
Three, to tear the victim’s dignity and worth.

251
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,032
Four, for fame.

252
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,072
Then I’ll start with the grudge.

253
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,568
I’ll dig into what sort of work
the Thayadons do

254
00:19:26,592 --> 00:19:28,570
that could make the murderer feel vengeful.

255
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,984
Just the Thayadon family?

256
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,640
You think Botpleng discovering the body

257
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:37,848
was a coincidence?

258
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,648
There has been news about the Thayadons
in the past

259
00:19:41,672 --> 00:19:44,528
But it would be impossible to find out now

260
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,944
because Petchkla Thayadon, Botpleng’s dad,

261
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,136
is now dead.

262
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,184
Khitakan Thayadon is unwell now.

263
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,368
She’s in a coma.

264
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,904
There’s only the heir left.

265
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
What about that?

266
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,504
Or would you…

267
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,248
Sneakily ask your boyfriend about it?

268
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,016
There’s no point trying to ask him.

269
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,632
Botpleng lost his memory.

270
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,980
You’re not even denying the boyfriend part.

271
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,352
DISTRUST.

272
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,400
FEARFUL / BRAVE / IMPATIENT / CHEERFUL

273
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:33,904
PANIC / SENSITIVE

274
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,168
MULTI-PERSONALITY / MEMORY LOSS

275
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,384
DISTRUST.

276
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,016
I think

277
00:20:41,912 --> 00:20:43,160
I like you.

278
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,784
LIKE.

279
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:48,808
MULTI-PERSONALITY / MEMORY LOSS /
PANIC / SENSITIVE

280
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,170
Inspector.

281
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,230
Well.

282
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,448
I’m here to apologize.

283
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,000
What happened the other day,

284
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:09,400
I think I crossed the line.

285
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
Only caring about the journalist’s role

286
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,384
that I forgot the police
have their responsibility too.

287
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:17,976
I’m sorry.

288
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,096
Did Tankhun ask you to come?

289
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,296
Why do you think so?

290
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,544
Because you left with Tankhun that day.

291
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,690
He was part of what made me realize.

292
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,176
But I’m here today

293
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,224
because I personally want to apologize.

294
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,530
Then I’ll accept your apology.

295
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,776
Let’s do our best in each of
our responsibilities from now on.

296
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,640
We owe each other nothing now.

297
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
That’s not all why you’re here, is it?

298
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,784
I want to ask you about Tankhun.

299
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,648
Can you spare some time?

300
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,160
Sorry,

301
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
for making Mr. Preppy have a hard time.

302
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,944
I’m not having a hard time.

303
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,200
And I’m not preppy.

304
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,824
You don’t have to downplay it.

305
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,140
Your last name screams wealth.

306
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,560
So why did you become a journalist?

307
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,290
You enjoy it?

308
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,792
More than just enjoying it.

309
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:34,990
I feel the need to become a journalist

310
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:36,544
to clear the bad news about my dad.

311
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,592
But don’t you have my information already?

312
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:43,740
You probably knew my dad is infamous.

313
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,688
But I believe my dad didn’t do that.

314
00:22:49,032 --> 00:22:51,030
I will definitely clear the bad news for him.

315
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,430
Yeah.

316
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,032
You’re a journalist now.

317
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,296
Why don’t you fix it?

318
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,840
Or do you not have any proof?

319
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,992
I just can’t find them yet.

320
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,080
If you can’t find them yet,

321
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,264
don’t blame yourself.

322
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,376
As far as I have dealt with the cases,

323
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,336
even the person we love

324
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,232
and no matter how much we trust them.

325
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:21,100
They still can do things you never imagined.

326
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,410
Sorry.

327
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,368
Did I make you feel discouraged?

328
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,496
Let’s talk about your topic instead.

329
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
What did you want to know about Tankhun?

330
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,504
I want to know

331
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,784
how Tankhun became involved

332
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:45,488
in the case that I found the body.

333
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
(Inspector Dao said Tankhun is good.)

334
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,360
(He was at the right place at the right time.)

335
00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:59,144
(So she invited him to join the case.)

336
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:00,688
(She wouldn’t slip out anything else.)

337
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,380
(What are you going to do next?)

338
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
(Keep going.)

339
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,430
Hey!

340
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,672
Don’t die yet.

341
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:15,464
You haven’t set your dad’s reputation right.

342
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,872
To cross the street in this country,

343
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:19,568
just checking the red light is not enough.

344
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,608
Even the drivers don’t bat an eye.

345
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:23,312
Watch out next time.

346
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,130
Yes.

347
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,392
Thank you, inspector.

348
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,776
Then please excuse me.

349
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,448
Hello, Lt. Nim?

350
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,376
I told you to find out about Botpleng’s dad.

351
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
How is it going?

352
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,160
Then dig up more about his infamous news.

353
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,728
Dig deep.

354
00:24:50,296 --> 00:24:51,584
Be as detailed as possible.

355
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,550
Yeah.

356
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Yeah.

357
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,752
Let’s talk later.

358
00:25:05,776 --> 00:25:06,816
I have to go.

359
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,408
Surprised?

360
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,104
I feel like dining with you

361
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
so I came.

362
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,176
I’ll be your chef today.

363
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,560
Is it okay?

364
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,770
I didn’t let you know the time beforehand.

365
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
It’s alright.

366
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,712
I have something to ask you.

367
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Yes?

368
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,432
Why did you ask Inspector Dao about me?

369
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,392
I just wanted to know about you

370
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:55,952
from the other’s perspective.

371
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,672
So what did you find out?

372
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,232
You’ve already talked to Inspector Dao.

373
00:26:04,248 --> 00:26:05,408
Why bother asking me?

374
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,928
I’m curious, so I’m asking you.

375
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,120
Or do you want me to ask
the people around you instead?

376
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,150
Nice sarcasm.

377
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,656
Inspector Dao only said that

378
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,264
you got to handle my case

379
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,288
because you’re good, that’s it.

380
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah.

381
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,470
I’m good.

382
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,952
I took up the case because of you.

383
00:26:33,632 --> 00:26:35,630
Mainly because I wanted to help you.

384
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,728
One more thing.

385
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,632
Who would ever let their first love

386
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,896
go through such a dreadful case alone?

387
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,210
You’re such a talker.

388
00:26:57,456 --> 00:26:57,832
Here.

389
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Urgh!

390
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,736
Hey! Sorry.

391
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:01,752
Ouch!

392
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,232
Open your mouth.
Ouch!

393
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,320
Open your mouth, I will blow it for you.

394
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,016
Open your mouth.

395
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,760
Feeling better?

396
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,296
Drink up so it will stop burning.

397
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,952
That’s a sauce.

398
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:34,728
Here.

399
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,830
Look.

400
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,928
Can I ask for a favor?

401
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,050
What is it?

402
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Tonight

403
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,360
can I sleep with you?

404
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,120
I just want to

405
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,976
relive the memory.

406
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Hey.

407
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,424
Just in case you misunderstood.

408
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,880
By asking to sleep with you

409
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:59,528
I meant holding hands to sleep like that day.

410
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:04,270
What if I say no?

411
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,460
Just kidding.

412
00:29:37,168 --> 00:29:39,170
I won’t do anything without your consent.

413
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,312
If you want to hold hands to sleep,

414
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,600
I will hold your hand all night.

415
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:05,320
I won’t let go of you.

416
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,528
Aren’t you sleepy?

417
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,336
I’m a night owl.

418
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,700
If you’re sleepy, then just go on and sleep.

419
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,912
I won’t let go.

420
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,720
I’m the one holding your hand.

421
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,790
It’s you who’s only holding the book.

422
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,648
Now I’m holding you only.

423
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,248
Satisfied?

424
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
What about this?

425
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,930
Do you like it?

426
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,700
You like it when someone rubs it.

427
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
You remember?

428
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,616
I could remember from the diary.

429
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,616
Don’t know if you still like it like 10 years ago.

430
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:41,370
I might like it even more.

431
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,152
POLICE STATION

432
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,160
The information about the Thayadon family.

433
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,310
Thanks.

434
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,680
What about the CCTV footage I asked for?

435
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,232
Found anything?

436
00:32:58,272 --> 00:32:59,904
Already on the hard disk.

437
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,280
Actually…

438
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:03,072
With just a bike running the red light,

439
00:33:03,096 --> 00:33:04,664
I could just look into it for you.

440
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:06,384
It’s alright.

441
00:33:06,448 --> 00:33:07,608
You can go back to your work.

442
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,770
Tankhun.

443
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,720
Tankhun.

444
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:02,192
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.
I’LL BE RIGHT BACK.

445
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,736
What’s your plan?

446
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,150
I will make him trust me

447
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,000
and get the secrets out of him.

448
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,536
Get it right.

449
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,528
Don’t forget he could be the fake one

450
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:22,776
and is trying to use you.

451
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,730
Doctor Jen.

452
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,352
I have something to say to you.

453
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
I’m not available.

454
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,896
If you really want to talk,

455
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,304
please make a reservation

456
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,744
and don’t sneak up on me like this.

457
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,540
You’re looking for your older brother, right?

458
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,344
I know

459
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:30,272
where Thunphob is.

460
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,936
There’s no way you would know.

461
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,976
And stop following me.

462
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,296
Otherwise, I’ll call the police.

463
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,184
(Mrs. Ounjai Kiawmana, age 75)

464
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,592
(wearing a blue patient robe)

465
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,590
(is missing from the patient room.)

466
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,288
(If you see her,
please notify the staff immediately.)

467
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,352
(Thank you.)

468
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,992
Are you lost, Grandma?

469
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,096
Not every old person is lost and forgetful.

470
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,000
That means you’re not lost,

471
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,760
but you ran away?

472
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,992
Everyone inside is busy looking for you.

473
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,120
Why bother looking for me?

474
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:33,984
It’s good that I’m gone.

475
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:37,488
So that my kids wouldn’t fight.

476
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,280
When my parents were gone,

477
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,184
I never thought it was good, Grandma.

478
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,096
Your parents…

479
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,664
It’s been many years ago.

480
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,024
I still miss them every day.

481
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,000
And I believe that your kids miss you, too.

482
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,480
It’s better to solve problems together

483
00:37:00,832 --> 00:37:02,830
than avoiding it and being alone, Grandma.

484
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,560
You can trust someone who’s been alone
for a long time like me!

485
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,940
Then I’ll go check on them.

486
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,480
See if they still fight.

487
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,568
People only fight

488
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,200
over something important.

489
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,408
Then I am important?

490
00:37:19,432 --> 00:37:20,432
Yes.

491
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,568
You should quickly get a girlfriend.

492
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,720
So you won’t be lonely.

493
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
Yes, Grandma.

494
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,368
(Here you are, Grandma.)

495
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,072
(We’ve been looking everywhere for you.)

496
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,450
Let’s go. Be careful on your steps.

497
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,552
Were you eavesdropping on me?

498
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:45,152
Well, you were loud enough.

499
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,736
But still…

500
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:50,752
I’m sorry about your parents.

501
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,144
Rest assured.

502
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,080
My parents are alive and kicking.

503
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
You…

504
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,440
You lied to the grandma?

505
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,544
It’s called a tactic

506
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,680
to make people realize stuff.

507
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,136
But about Thunphob,

508
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,760
I’m telling the truth.

509
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,848
Canon in D.

510
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,856
Tankhun.

511
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:25,384
THUNPHOB.

512
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,760
I couldn’t remember you

513
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,632
because you’re not Tankhun.

514
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,976
You’re Thunphob, right?

515
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,704
Why did you pretend to be Tankhun?

516
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,576
I didn’t pretend to be Tankhun.

517
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,980
What about this?

518
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
What’s this?

519
00:41:05,568 --> 00:41:07,570
Why does the present you were to give me

520
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:09,344
include Thunphob’s watch?

521
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,090
Pleng.

522
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,392
Listen to me.

523
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,768
It’s not like that.

524
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,184
You are Thunphob, right?

525
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,504
Answer me.

526
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,072
You are Thunphob, right?

527
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,752
Pleng, listen to me.

528
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,720
What are you going to lie to me next?

529
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,768
Actually…

530
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:42,128
Here is Thunphob

531
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,672
your brother.

532
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,030
No.

533
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,048
That’s Tankhun.

534
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,112
You’re Botpleng, right?

535
00:41:58,136 --> 00:41:59,136
Jen.

536
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,456
He deserves to know the truth.

537
00:42:01,496 --> 00:42:02,600
What truth?

538
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,752
Huh?

539
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:07,048
What truth?

540
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,090
Your lover

541
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:19,848
is Thunphob.

542
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,620
Not me.

543
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,700
That bracelet.

544
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,056
Thunphob really had it made for you.

545
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,000
Before he died.

546
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:52,784
Botpleng.

547
00:42:55,944 --> 00:42:56,944
I’m sorry.

548
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,360
This is Thunphob.

549
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,832
When we took the picture,

550
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:08,336
he said he was going
to meet you in Thailand.

551
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,968
Thunphob always told us

552
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,728
that he fell in love with you here.

553
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:15,180
You guys were each other’s first love.

554
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,048
(I saw him)

555
00:43:19,072 --> 00:43:20,896
(after following the sound of the violin)

556
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,592
(all the way to that tree.)

557
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:23,616
Uh…

558
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:25,790
Hi.

559
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
(He said his name was “Tankhun”.)

560
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,088
(We met in winter when we were 17.)

561
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,600
(Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.)

562
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,408
(Just like getting to know love
for the first time.)

563
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,016
He has always been here,

564
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,320
while you were with me?

565
00:44:28,944 --> 00:44:30,940
Your sister said he loved me dearly.

566
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:35,450
Yes.

567
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,368
What Thunphob did wrong

568
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,184
was using my name

569
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,130
while he was in love with you.

570
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:00,688
So what you did for me

571
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,224
was because of Thunphob?

572
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,220
I’m sorry.

573
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,070
Considering what you have done for me,

574
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,816
he probably loved me dearly.

575
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:45,930
You know what?

576
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,096
I’m not angry that you fooled me.

577
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,616
But I’m angry right now

578
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,584
because you made me love you.

579
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,730
Do you really not feel anything at all?

580
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,768
What I did was disgusting.

581
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,200
If what you did was pretending to be Thunphob–

582
00:46:36,232 --> 00:46:37,416
I love Thunphob.

583
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,440
Can I still do anything to make it right?

584
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:41,440
What’s my body language telling you?
