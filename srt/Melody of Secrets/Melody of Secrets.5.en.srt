1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,624
You meant to–

2
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:01,720
I just love you.

3
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,448
You’re my best friend.

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,768
And that will never change.

5
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:06,968
What I did was disgusting.

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,912
If it’s disgusting, then both of us are disgusting.

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Yes?

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,392
I’ve checked the CCTV as you asked

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,584
and got the bike that ran you over in it.

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,280
(Already forwarded to you.)

11
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,310
(You can check it out.)

12
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,336
Okay.

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,776
(You’ve seen it, right?)

14
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,570
(Yeah.)

15
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,376
You’re with Botpleng now, right?

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,070
(If yes, )

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,368
(don’t say anything.)

18
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,560
(Don’t let him know)

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,840
(that you know that guy is Tanu)

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,584
(who used to work for Khitakarn, his mom.)

21
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,168
Thanks for the ride.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,784
Are you not going in with me?

23
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,980
Inspector Dao pretended not to know

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,896
about me pretending to be Thunphob

25
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,096
out of my request.

26
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,992
The one who should feel most guilty

27
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,790
should be me, who tricked you.

28
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,384
That’s not what it is, Tankhun.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,360
It’s not that I don’t want to meet
Inspector Dao because of you.

30
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,392
I’m just afraid.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,000
I’m afraid that the more the truth is unveiled,

32
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,544
there would be more things
that make me regret what I’m doing now.

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
You should get going.

34
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:32,670
I should head to the office now.

35
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,136
SUSPECT.
VICTIM.

36
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:46,140
The first victim of the murder was found

37
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,856
where Botpleng asked you to meet.

38
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,488
As for the second case,

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,016
there’s a relation in the means of murder

40
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,576
and the weapon used.

41
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,168
The latest one.

42
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,240
Your assault case.

43
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,736
I’ve looked into it and found that

44
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,448
the attacker was Tanu

45
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:12,696
who used to work for Khitakan,
Botpleng’s mom.

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,960
You’re saying that the link between the cases

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
is that they’re related to Botpleng?

48
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,392
I wouldn’t think so

49
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,336
if I hadn’t found additional information

50
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:29,672
that the second victim was a clerk
when Botpleng’s dad was a sheriff.

51
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:41,968
Not to mention Thunphob, Botpleng’s lover.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,888
That’s enough.

53
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,400
SUSPECT.

54
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,744
If you were to suspect.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,512
VICTIM.

56
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,510
You should be suspecting that
Botpleng’s a victim.

57
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,330
I saw Tanu attacking Pleng.

58
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,176
Are there any other reasons
for you to protect him?

59
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,072
Botpleng is your brother’s lover

60
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,168
not yours, isn’t that right?

61
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,370
Where did you get your scholarship from?

62
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,168
When we studied criminal behavior analysis
in the UK,

63
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,888
where we met.

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,920
The scholarship grantee would be so upset

65
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:26,920
if you’ve forgotten something so basic.

66
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,432
Tell me,

67
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,568
why would Tanu,
who could kill so cold-bloodedly

68
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,688
and so organized in his murder

69
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,032
would do something so reckless

70
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,904
like attacking Botpleng and me

71
00:05:39,928 --> 00:05:41,520
and got caught by the camera?

72
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,330
Well.

73
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,656
It’s DID.

74
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,568
You still fail to pass the second test.

75
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,576
Wanting to win so much

76
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,856
that you leave the citizen in danger.

77
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,696
Even if Tanu really had DID,

78
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,160
it doesn’t provide the answer that.

79
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:05,496
Botpleng’s family is behind this

80
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,224
and that Botpleng wouldn’t be in danger.

81
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,608
You didn’t let me tell Botpleng about Tanu.

82
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,888
Can you still remember what you said?

83
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,808
If Botpleng is in danger,

84
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,912
will you be able to handle the responsibility?

85
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,712
But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.

86
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,160
If this is what you need to know.

87
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,712
(If Botpleng is in danger, )

88
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,392
(will you be able to handle the responsibility?)

89
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,784
(But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.)

90
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,784
I have both you and Tankhun
who care about me.

91
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,568
Are you really okay?

92
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,250
I don’t know.

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,688
I’ve been looking for my first love for so long

94
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,400
just to find out that.

95
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,856
I’ve fallen for this brother.

96
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,664
While the first love I’ve been looking for

97
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,100
died while he was looking for me.

98
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,248
I just want to be happy.

99
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,536
I want to be as happy
as my current memory allows.

100
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,264
Because I don’t know

101
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,760
what the memory that’s about to return

102
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:55,760
will bring to me.

103
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,550
Why are you following me?

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Are you okay?

105
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:29,824
Hey!

106
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:30,848
Pleng!

107
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Are you okay?

108
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
I’m okay.

109
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,152
Are you okay?

110
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,104
The cut didn’t hurt.

111
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,368
The tetanus shot hurts more.

112
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,520
Don’t wander around alone next time.

113
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,696
It’s so…

114
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,064
dangerous out there these days, isn’t it?

115
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,152
You can send it to me.

116
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,070
Okay.

117
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,752
(If Botpleng is in danger, )

118
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,640
(will you be able to handle the responsibility?)

119
00:11:29,664 --> 00:11:32,952
(But I won’t let Botpleng be in danger.)

120
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,608
I can put charges on you.

121
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,170
Go ahead.

122
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,272
You knew I wouldn’t dare do it.

123
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,112
That’s not it, Tankhun.

124
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,152
I did it because of Muenmile.

125
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,016
If I didn’t trust you,

126
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,208
we wouldn’t have come this far.

127
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,136
One more thing,

128
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,832
you’re even the brother of my lover.

129
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,344
But Muen is also someone important to me.

130
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,680
Ever since my mother fell into a coma,

131
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,224
there was only he who stayed beside me.

132
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,856
Being my only friend.

133
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,544
I just…

134
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,104
I just have enough confidence in you

135
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
to prove to my friend that.

136
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,408
I’ve trusted the right person.

137
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,224
You really knew I wouldn’t dare do it.

138
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,928
When you met Tanu last time

139
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,720
you had a panic attack, too, right?

140
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Yes.

141
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,944
Any other symptoms?

142
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
I was afraid.

143
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,512
But it was controllable

144
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,088
unlike the first time.

145
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Afraid?

146
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
But…

147
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
I wasn’t afraid that he would attack me.

148
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,560
It was fear that came from my gut.

149
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,920
It was like…

150
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,120
It wasn’t the first time I’ve seen him.

151
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,544
You’ve met Tanu before?

152
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,688
I can’t remember.

153
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,168
I don’t know or believe I’ve ever met

154
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:07,620
both the person in the picture and you.

155
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,184
The police said he used to work for Mom

156
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,032
so I thought you could know him.

157
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,136
That means you’re investigating something

158
00:14:15,184 --> 00:14:17,688
that involves my family?

159
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,040
There’s nothing much.

160
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,704
He’s just a suspect in a normal crime case.

161
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,700
We just want some additional information.

162
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,448
But you’re not a police officer, aren’t you?

163
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,080
Though my husband passed away,

164
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:37,736
our family still has disciples
and those who work closely with us.

165
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,520
I don’t like people doing things
that are not their jobs

166
00:14:40,544 --> 00:14:42,968
and use the name of the police
just to ruin their reputation.

167
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,400
My apologies.

168
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,848
I just happened to be investigating
how Thunphob,

169
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,592
Botpleng’s lover and my brother, had died.

170
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,272
So I asked him to bring me to you.

171
00:15:00,744 --> 00:15:02,792
My real question is

172
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,192
do you know Thunphob?

173
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,336
I have no obligations

174
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,976
to answer this question.

175
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,440
Send your lover’s brother on his way.

176
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,560
Don’t forget your doctor’s appointment.

177
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:20,904
Don’t make me remind you.

178
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,568
You really knew my lover.

179
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,696
Why didn’t you or Mom mention him before?

180
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:33,896
Even you can’t remember

181
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,520
who would fancy helping you remember?

182
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,990
Grandma was really hiding Thunphob from me.

183
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,592
But your grandma wasn’t lying.

184
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,272
Both about not knowing Tanu

185
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,472
and about Thunphob.

186
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,784
So that means

187
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,000
my family is really not involved in this.

188
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:02,384
Or your grandma was lying flawlessly.

189
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,512
I thought you would take my side.

190
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,250
The way you did when talking to Inspector Dao.

191
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,256
A human’s heart is beyond fathom.

192
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,560
Just one behavior can’t tell everything.

193
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,936
I’m just trying to read into all the conflicts

194
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,264
and all the possibilities.

195
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,016
If you say so,

196
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:25,688
then you must think my family’s involved.

197
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,928
Aren’t you afraid I’d kill you in the woods?

198
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,672
I’m saying this

199
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,488
because I care about you.

200
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,864
Your grandma looks so unkind to you
that it worries me.

201
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,520
If you’re wondering
whether Grandma could hurt me,

202
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,552
I would say she could, without Mom.

203
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,688
Grandma loves Mom dearly

204
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,688
that it extended to me.

205
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:52,064
Though we never talk nicely,

206
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,136
she always cares about my treatment.

207
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,824
The doctor you mean is…

208
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,744
A psychiatrist.

209
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,480
Grandma wants me to get my memory back quickly.

210
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,000
I need your help.

211
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:25,712
Are you back already, Mom?

212
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,150
Mom!

213
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,376
If you’re feeling alright,

214
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,536
slowly tell me what you saw in your dream.

215
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,464
It seemed so real this time.

216
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,370
It was…

217
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,060
It was like it’s my memory.

218
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,448
It didn’t seem like a dream.

219
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:06,720
I was in a small, old house.

220
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,392
I was lighting up a charcoal stove.

221
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
And…

222
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Mom.

223
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,560
Didn’t seem like her, but she was walking in.

224
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,104
It could be a lucid dream.

225
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,312
A dream when you’re conscious,

226
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:28,952
but it feels so real.

227
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,328
You had a memory loss

228
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:33,088
so you might get confused.

229
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:36,220
Theoretically speaking,

230
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,120
this kind of dream will lower your sleeping quality

231
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,008
and could be dangerous in the long run.

232
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,584
Then, I’ll give you some prescriptions.

233
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,512
Yes.

234
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,464
It seems like Mr. Pleng’s memory
is coming back.

235
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:14,488
Is that so?

236
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,336
Botpleng’s memory should be returning after all.

237
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Boss!

238
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,328
What is it?

239
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:01,330
Someone asked to see you.

240
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,168
Who is it?

241
00:20:05,408 --> 00:20:06,560
Hello.

242
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,384
I’m here to interview you.

243
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,936
I brought you some centella juice.

244
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,232
It’s pretty hard to find.

245
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,320
Is there any subtext in giving me this?

246
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,288
Just testing out the water.

247
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,290
See how you’re healing after a heartbreak.

248
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:40,600
Just say what you have to say.

249
00:20:42,336 --> 00:20:44,240
Tan couldn’t contact Botpleng.

250
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,336
He wanted to come himself

251
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,136
but he sent me because he knew

252
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,590
that you won’t do anything.

253
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:52,780
I’m not the type to attack anyone.

254
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,696
Also, Pleng and I are done.

255
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,304
We - are - friends.

256
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,576
Then you can tell us where Botpleng is.

257
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:06,112
No.

258
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,096
Nothing to it, though.

259
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,320
The reason I look confused

260
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,376
is because I thought Pleng
was with your brother.

261
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,776
I couldn’t contact him for 2 days now.

262
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,488
Are you really going to do this, Tan?

263
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Yeah.

264
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,240
There’s no other way.

265
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,810
Pleng.

266
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Pleng.

267
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,570
Who?

268
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
(Then you took him out of the house so easily?)

269
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,336
(There was barely anyone there.)

270
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,870
(Isn’t that strange?)

271
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,768
(I only know that Pleng’s Grandma
doesn’t want anyone in her house.)

272
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:40,544
(I didn’t know she would go this far.)

273
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,128
(There’s no one on guard.)

274
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,720
(The other day, when I was on a lookout, )

275
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:45,280
(I saw some housekeepers)

276
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,360
(and a nurse who came and left on the same day.)

277
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,520
(I was surprised too.)

278
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,744
Pleng.

279
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:54,688
Are you awake now?

280
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,950
How are you feeling?

281
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,580
You keep making that dumbfounded face.

282
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:01,872
Can you remember me?

283
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,792
What the hell are you doing here?

284
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
And…

285
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,984
What happened to me last night?

286
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,096
Why do I feel so confused?

287
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,664
Um… let me do some initial testing.

288
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,920
Everything’s normal now.

289
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,176
Pleng said he’s just going to call his grandma

290
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:42,840
just to prevent any trouble.

291
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Normal?

292
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,090
Really?

293
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,736
Why does he seem like he can’t remember
his conversation with me?

294
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,776
The human brain has a complex structure.

295
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:56,192
Pleng lost his memory in an accident
many years ago.

296
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:59,800
That could leave a chronic illness

297
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,968
or other factors that prevent the memory from returning.

298
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,960
Normally, a human brain might work 100%

299
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,760
but Pleng’s brain might only work at 80%.

300
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,696
Then, when he lacks sleep

301
00:24:10,728 --> 00:24:12,608
or when other things are affecting him,

302
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,944
it could cause a temporary symptom too.

303
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,624
The forgetting things part might be normal

304
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,768
but going unavailable doesn’t seem normal.

305
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,368
Grandma wanted me to go live abroad

306
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,584
but I refused, so we fought.

307
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,650
Then…

308
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,072
I took some pills to help me sleep

309
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,104
then I was slipping in and out of sleep

310
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,880
and dreamt about things when I was young.

311
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,856
Slipping in and out of sleep?

312
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,850
Can you remember when you were awake?

313
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,392
I can’t.

314
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,984
I knew I was awake, but it was always blurry.

315
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,376
What kind of pill did you take?

316
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:06,970
I don’t know.

317
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,272
I only know it made me very sleepy.

318
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,416
Did you see the doctor?

319
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,384
I didn’t.

320
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,330
Are you suspecting something, Jen?

321
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,864
It seems like part of a hypnotizing process.

322
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,768
Some use it to bring back memories.

323
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,416
To help you bring back your memory.

324
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,392
If she really wanted me to remember things,

325
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,432
why did she not tell me anything
about the house in Korat?

326
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,672
She never took me there

327
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,896
and didn’t even let me go there.

328
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,648
You’re right.

329
00:25:47,616 --> 00:25:49,620
It really seems conflicting.

330
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,912
If she really wants you to remember things,

331
00:25:54,368 --> 00:25:56,728
why was she trying to stop you
from thinking about the past?

332
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,632
So what were you seeing the doctor for?

333
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:08,170
What if it wasn’t for you to remember things

334
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,368
but for you to forget certain events?

335
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,328
Jen, is this possible?

336
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,184
It is.

337
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,128
Even making you forget the triggering factor,

338
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,660
that missing memory,

339
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:30,700
how important could it have been?

340
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,510
What are you thinking about?

341
00:27:06,248 --> 00:27:08,104
About the missing memories.

342
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,968
I’m curious.

343
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,288
What kind of memories was it?

344
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,700
Why does no one want me to remember it?

345
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,624
Can you believe it?

346
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,288
Before Mom fell into a coma,

347
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,544
I was so happy.

348
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,368
Mom used to say

349
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
it’s okay for me not to remember anything.

350
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,792
I only realized it now

351
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,784
that she never wanted me to remember.

352
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,208
If Thunphob were here.

353
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,176
I think he would want you to remember.

354
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:07,176
What about you?

355
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,424
Do you want me to remember?

356
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,784
The me now

357
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,976
is probably the same as your mom.

358
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,888
If it hurts so much that you need to forget,

359
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
then I

360
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,968
don’t want you to remember it.

361
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,120
Yes, Inspector?

362
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,568
(I found the link between the serial murders
and Thunphob’s case.)

363
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,592
I’m fine with you protecting your brother’s lover

364
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,720
but bringing him along to listen to all this information,

365
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:36,984
I think it’s too far.

366
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,016
It’s wrong, Tankhun.

367
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:45,320
I promise I won’t tell anyone.

368
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,832
Also, I’m not here today as a journalist.

369
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,040
I’m here today as someone who’s involved in this case.

370
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,584
I know

371
00:29:56,696 --> 00:29:58,896
that all the cases involve me as the link between them.

372
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,512
I want nothing but the truth.

373
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,632
Even if it has to be squeezed out from
the truth everyone wanted me to forget,

374
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I will do it.

375
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,728
Then if there’s anything wrong with this case,

376
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
you can go and bear the shame

377
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,336
along with your being the best of the class
all this time.

378
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,856
The mechanic found this attached to the wheel hub when they detached it.

379
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,832
After examining it,

380
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:40,696
it’s the same as the weapon of murder in
the first and second cases.

381
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,536
So can we now conclude

382
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,792
that the murderer has DID

383
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,704
and the prime suspect is Tanu?

384
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,360
Or the behavior might not have been conflicting.

385
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,600
Leave.

386
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,192
Unless you want to die.

387
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:04,576
Are you okay?

388
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,728
Because Tanu never hurt me.

389
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,488
Even when he got a chance, he didn’t do it.

390
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:19,632
Tanu is the suspect in Thunphob’s case
and the other two cases.

391
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,352
All of them are part of Botpleng’s family.

392
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,312
Tanu doesn’t harm Botpleng

393
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,456
but also doesn’t want him involved.

394
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,520
This resonates with what Madame Ked is trying to do.

395
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,304
Why do they all do that?

396
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,488
Maybe it’s to protect

397
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:47,340
something that’s in your memory.

398
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:51,400
Maybe there’s something they didn’t want anyone to know.

399
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,760
If we could access that secret

400
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,880
maybe we don’t have to force Pleng to remember.

401
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,176
Then you’re lucky, Tankhun.

402
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,216
FILE
WIND POWER CONCESSION.

403
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,120
15 years ago,

404
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,448
Sheriff Petchkla, Botpleng’s dad

405
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,896
was reported for fraud in a wind power concession.

406
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,552
The two victims of the murder cases
were part of the fraud.

407
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,152
I might be making too complicated a hypothesis here.

408
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,920
But isn’t it possible?

409
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,232
That Thunphob could have found that out

410
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,672
so he was murdered to silence out.

411
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:47,280
Surely, the memory of your own family

412
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:48,592
killing your lover

413
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,960
is probably not something
anyone would want you to remember.

414
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,808
I’ve never thought that one day.

415
00:33:22,832 --> 00:33:24,800
I’d think I’m lucky to have lost my memory.

416
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,064
It was just a hypothesis.

417
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,056
That’s what I’m afraid of.

418
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,600
I’m afraid it’d be even worse.

419
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Pleng.

420
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,328
I agree with your Grandma.

421
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,184
You should live abroad for a while.

422
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,872
MADAME KEDSARA.

423
00:34:11,896 --> 00:34:14,088
Hello, Inspector Darakorn speaking.

424
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,792
(I’m Kedsara.)

425
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,000
Do anything to stop the police

426
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,984
(from digging up the wind power concession case.)

427
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,112
Yes, Madame.

428
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Wait up.

429
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,192
Here. Help me out.

430
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,300
Do you want me to file it away?

431
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,704
FILE
WIND POWER CONCESSION.

432
00:34:58,728 --> 00:34:59,768
File what away?

433
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
I’m going to dig up this case

434
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,144
and you have to help me gather the information

435
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,936
so that I can bring it to the superintendent

436
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,872
then set up a special investigation team.

437
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Here.

438
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
What’s wrong?

439
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
You’re my idol.

440
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,570
What?

441
00:35:22,544 --> 00:35:23,696
I’m right on it!

442
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:36,704
Your hair is so soft.

443
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,696
I always have my hair washed at the salon.

444
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,072
Whatever they used there,

445
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:43,104
That was probably it.

446
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:46,290
Then you’d better have it washed at the salon.

447
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,370
It’s not like your place makes it easy for me
to wash it for you.

448
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
It does.

449
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,160
Because I have you with me now.

450
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,032
One more thing,

451
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,592
I don’t want you to be alone.

452
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I know now

453
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,070
why Thunphob wanted to be you so badly.

454
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,712
Because your heart is so big and warm.

455
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,872
Are you going to pretend to be me, too?

456
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,040
I can’t have it anymore.

457
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,408
No.

458
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,104
I just want to be in it.

459
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,630
You’ve always been in there.

460
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,464
Hey, Tankhun.

461
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:58,488
Let’s eat.

462
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,896
You know how to cook?

463
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,000
I never knew it either.

464
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,744
But after I could light up the charcoal stove,

465
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,840
I wanted to try.

466
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,528
Turns out I knew how to do it all.

467
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,168
Thun told me you don’t like vegetables,
just like him.

468
00:37:29,608 --> 00:37:31,610
He didn’t like it because he hated chewing it.

469
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,208
While you don’t like it because it’s bitter.

470
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,670
I don’t know about that.

471
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,392
I now like both chewing it

472
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,864
and the taste of it.

473
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Is there anything?

474
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:10,700
I’m memorizing this Botpleng.

475
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,528
The one who likes vegetables.

476
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,560
Knows how to light a fire.

477
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,184
Likes green tea.

478
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,952
Who couldn’t understand how leaves

479
00:38:23,464 --> 00:38:24,624
can sound like a melody.

480
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,288
I’m scared you will forget.

481
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,960
It’s not bitter at all.

482
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,528
I definitely won’t forget.

483
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,840
Why are you writing on it
when it’s about to be removed?

484
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:24,584
Because you’re removing it soon.

485
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,800
If I wrote it from the start

486
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:30,152
and the ink seeps into the cast and ruins it,

487
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,184
your arm could be infected.

488
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,872
Alright, I got it.

489
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,248
Mr. Tankhun.

490
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:45,376
Please come right this way.

491
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,420
I’ll be right back.

492
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,410
Good luck.

493
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:14,520
Um, excuse me.

494
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,660
Could you take a picture of the cast for me?

495
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:18,624
Before you remove it,

496
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:20,072
I want to see what he has written.

497
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Sure.

498
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:27,550
Here you go.

499
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,630
Thank you.

500
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,264
(Good luck.)

501
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,536
(Love you.)

502
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,110
(Goodbye.)

503
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,848
(I don’t want to be everyone’s Botpleng anymore.)

504
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,170
Put that down.

505
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,200
That’s twice now.

506
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,560
That you snuck into my house.

507
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,150
For you.

508
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,208
Both times.

509
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,232
I’ve decided to never see you again.

510
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:24,528
Don’t bother me.

511
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,190
Why?

512
00:42:54,296 --> 00:42:55,552
Because I’m not him.

513
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,680
I’m not Botpleng, who likes vegetables.

514
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,760
Who can light up a fire.

515
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,048
Who can forget Thunphob

516
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:23,888
and love you.

517
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,890
It’s not just about how we can fall in love.

518
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,264
But how can I live?

519
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,600
If I have to hide my true self?

520
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,368
I can’t even remember
what happened in the past.

521
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,352
I told you.

522
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,528
I will make you remember.

523
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,120
No matter what your memory holds,

524
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,160
I will be with you.

525
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,930
What if it were me who killed Thunphob?

526
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,400
What if it were me who killed your brother?

527
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,248
What would you do?

528
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,928
I will hold you like this.

529
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,400
Whatever you ask.

530
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,400
I will do it for you.

531
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,600
If you want to remember,

532
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:05,120
I will help you remember.

533
00:46:07,656 --> 00:46:09,104
Even if you can remember things

534
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,000
and forget about me,

535
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,784
I will remember you.

536
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:33,928
No matter

537
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,496
what your memory holds,

538
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,960
I will love you.

539
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,880
In the past.

540
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,160
In the present.

541
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:52,980
Or in the future.

542
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:16,240
Who are you?

543
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:17,840
Where are you?

544
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,984
Which identity is my true self?

545
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,550
Pleng!

546
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:24,730
I know him.

547
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,648
I think I love you enough

548
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,840
for my other identity to realize.

549
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:33,568
I will always be the second violin in your Canon in D.

550
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,152
So I became Botpleng.
