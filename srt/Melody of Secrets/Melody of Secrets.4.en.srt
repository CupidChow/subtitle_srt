1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,393
I lost you along with my memory.

2
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:04,310
But I will find it.

3
00:00:04,513 --> 00:00:06,016
Then hurry up and find me.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,610
Your lover is Thunphob.

5
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:14,123
Not me.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,616
What Thunphob did wrong was using my name

7
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:21,013
when he’s in love with you.

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,623
I’m not mad that you fooled me.

9
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:25,336
But I’m angry right now

10
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:26,923
because you made me love you.

11
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:36,336
If anyone asks anything

12
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,923
just say I’m unwell, okay?

13
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,083
Look.

14
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:42,916
Don’t you think Dad will find out?

15
00:00:44,023 --> 00:00:45,623
If you don’t say it, Dad won’t find out.

16
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:49,440
Come on, Tan.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,516
No one’s going to bother a sickly boy.

18
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,710
Or if I ever get caught,

19
00:00:54,303 --> 00:00:55,590
I’ll just say my name’s Tankhun.

20
00:00:57,537 --> 00:00:58,537
I’ll get going.

21
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,176
Wait.

22
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:02,343
Let me really ask you

23
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,466
When you leave home every day,

24
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,043
where do you go?

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,116
To find my beautiful melody.

26
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:10,789
I’ll get going.

27
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,737
You have to come again next year.

28
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:20,903
Come again every year.

29
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:23,513
On Christmas day,

30
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,390
we’ll meet here.

31
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,043
But after that year,

32
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:42,543
Thunphob couldn’t contact you ever again.

33
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:53,316
It was probably
when I got into an accident

34
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,203
and lost my memory.

35
00:01:59,623 --> 00:02:01,213
But he never stopped looking for you.

36
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,603
He came back to Thailand 5 years ago.

37
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:09,690
He wanted to look for you.

38
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:12,717
To live with you.

39
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:18,110
I thought he would be happy.

40
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:22,463
But in the end…

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,010
I found him dead.

42
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,643
1 MONTH AGO.

43
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,256
There’s a trace of contusion.

44
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,746
There’s a contusion mark
on the occipital area.

45
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,996
Seems like he’s been hit
by something solid.

46
00:02:56,703 --> 00:03:00,436
I can’t tell if it’s from getting attacked
or from a car accident.

47
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:02,906
If it were a normal accident,

48
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,103
the contusion would be in the front

49
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,130
or on the top of the head

50
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:09,850
when the car runs into the water.

51
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:12,110
But there’s only one mark

52
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:13,530
on the occipital area.

53
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,423
I’m not sure if it’s a contusion

54
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,510
caused by a natural trajectory
of an accident.

55
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,403
The car doesn’t have any dents or marks.

56
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,883
It doesn’t seem like a normal accident.

57
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,223
I suspect that

58
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:40,910
someone might have staged this.

59
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,983
We found this with the remains of the car.

60
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,816
Someone brought his death to him.

61
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:16,943
And I

62
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,870
will find that person.

63
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:04,163
Thunphob.

64
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,177
Thank you.

65
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,990
Sorry.

66
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:21,657
Best of luck.

67
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:26,417
Goodbye.

68
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,250
How long have you been close
with Muenmile?

69
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:37,303
Why?

70
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:40,310
Are you suspecting him?

71
00:07:42,057 --> 00:07:43,190
I’m not suspecting anyone.

72
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:46,110
But from all the cases I’ve dealt with,

73
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,616
the one who seems least suspicious

74
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,056
tends to be hiding something.

75
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,023
Do you not trust me either?

76
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,056
The people close to you,

77
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,190
the more you trust them,

78
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:06,837
the more you have to watch out.

79
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,363
Does “watching out”

80
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,310
mean choosing to be the offender?

81
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,040
I’m just curious.

82
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,216
Just to investigate your brother’s death,

83
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:29,883
did you have to take
our relationship this far?

84
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,613
Thunphob wasn’t just your younger brother.

85
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,289
He was my lover too.

86
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,590
Do you really not feel anything?

87
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,613
For doing that

88
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,956
to your brother’s lover?

89
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:57,043
I…

90
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,216
I have feelings for you.

91
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:03,997
That’s it.

92
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,610
That’s even more disgusting.

93
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,816
Can you answer me now?

94
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,523
Why do you refuse to tell
anyone about Thunphob?

95
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,603
What sort of lie did you tell
my friend this time?

96
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,116
You can actually say it now.

97
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,196
You also think Botpleng didn’t lie.

98
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:51,297
I see.

99
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,603
So you refuse to tell anyone

100
00:09:54,117 --> 00:09:55,957
because you’re on the same
boat as your brother

101
00:09:56,317 --> 00:09:57,703
to approach Pleng, right?

102
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,017
To approach me?

103
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,110
When you say someone brought
Thunphob’s death to him,

104
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,150
you were suspecting me?

105
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:10,923
In every case,

106
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:15,116
the suspect tends to be
the closest person.

107
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,703
So I looked for you.

108
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:21,642
Approached you.

109
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,140
And I’m confident

110
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,116
that you didn’t fake your memory loss.

111
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,710
In your memory,

112
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,503
there’s no Thunphob in there.

113
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,196
I will bring the memory
with Thunphob back.

114
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,650
I’ll join the investigation.

115
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,163
What?

116
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:53,610
Whether as a suspect

117
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,670
or as Thunphob’s lover.

118
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:58,843
Isn’t it me

119
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,630
who knows best about
the truth of this case?

120
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,763
Are you allergic to nuts like Thunphob?

121
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,496
I saw the cookie’s wrapper on the counter

122
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,496
so I knew it contained nuts.

123
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:21,637
So I…

124
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:29,309
I shouldn’t have tried to find faults
in someone like you.

125
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,416
You can still stay here.

126
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,693
In what status?

127
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:54,113
Thunphob’s boyfriend?

128
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,481
Or Tankhun’s?

129
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,778
But probably not Tankhun’s boyfriend.

130
00:13:10,221 --> 00:13:11,448
Because what you did to me

131
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,347
was all because you wanted to find out
the truth about Thunphob.

132
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:21,205
Pleng.

133
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:25,338
I already said it.

134
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,719
They were just lies

135
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,330
that you wanted them
to make me feel better.

136
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,830
And you

137
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,510
don’t feel any better,

138
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:41,183
not even a bit?

139
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:47,516
If what you did was pretending
to be Thunphob,

140
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,376
I love Thunphob.

141
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,912
JEN, I’M NOT GOING BACK TO THE UK ANYMORE.
I’LL BUILD A HOMESTAY HERE WITH BOTPLENG.

142
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:43,943
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DO YOU THINK THIS PLACE IS NICE?

143
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,703
I don’t talk about Thunphob

144
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,703
because we lost our parents

145
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,010
and now there are only 3 of us left.

146
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,543
Then my dearest brother died.

147
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:05,223
Just when he gets to really live
his own life.

148
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:12,210
The police couldn’t find anything.

149
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:14,500
So we came back to Thailand

150
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,730
to investigate Thunphob’s case
by ourselves.

151
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:22,783
Use me.

152
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,030
My memory might help you guys figure out

153
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,910
what happened to Thunphob 5 years ago.

154
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:40,336
(There’s a place I want you to go.)

155
00:15:41,743 --> 00:15:44,523
(Thunphob sent us a postcard saying)

156
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:47,410
(he wanted to build a homestay there
with you.)

157
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:39,643
Have you eaten?

158
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:44,530
Stop exploiting my memory with Thunphob.

159
00:16:45,263 --> 00:16:46,263
I never said

160
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,456
that this is Thunphob’s memory.

161
00:16:58,033 --> 00:16:59,676
It might look like a cassava

162
00:17:01,043 --> 00:17:02,556
but it’s actually a 5-minute cassava.

163
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,816
It’s basically an edible cassava.

164
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:08,996
It might look a bit burnt.

165
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
I’m sorry.

166
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:17,183
What if it’s burnt through and is bitter?

167
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:18,996
What would you do?

168
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:20,277
If it’s so

169
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:23,910
then I’ll find a new way
to grill it next time.

170
00:17:26,063 --> 00:17:27,663
That is, if you give me a chance, Pleng.

171
00:17:31,756 --> 00:17:35,016
Are you sure that it’s safe this time?

172
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,136
RAI YAI YAEM HOMESTAY.

173
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,410
How is it?

174
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,193
Can you remember anything?

175
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,783
Oh, what brings you here?

176
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:26,977
Hello.

177
00:18:27,677 --> 00:18:28,677
Hello, Grandma.

178
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,387
We happen to

179
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:33,110
have something to ask you.

180
00:18:33,556 --> 00:18:34,556
Alright.

181
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:43,110
Do you know the person in the picture?

182
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,316
Thunphob used to stay here
for a long while.

183
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,030
And…

184
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:54,836
You are…

185
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,623
I’m Thun’s older brother.

186
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,090
And this is…

187
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,623
I’m Thunphob’s boyfriend.

188
00:19:04,323 --> 00:19:05,323
You…

189
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,763
Oh, so it’s you.

190
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,863
Thunphob mentioned a lot about you.

191
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,650
Is Thunphob doing well?

192
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,700
Unbelievable.

193
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:31,823
I thought this place had found its owner.

194
00:19:32,523 --> 00:19:33,823
Grandma, what if I want to buy–

195
00:19:33,863 --> 00:19:34,996
Oh, there’s no need.

196
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,097
I’m well off.

197
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:39,103
I’m here because I’m independent.

198
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,410
I like that there’s so much to do here.

199
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:44,016
But a few years ago, when I met Thun,

200
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,030
he said he liked this place

201
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,697
so I was willing to give it to him
even if it is just for 1-2 Baht.

202
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,056
No wonder Thunphob liked it.

203
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,510
Thunphob liked to say that

204
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,103
when the leaves brush against each other,

205
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,403
it sounds like a melody.

206
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,910
At least the person Thunphob wanted
to show this place to is already here.

207
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,450
Grandma, I’m hungry!

208
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,630
Alright, I’ll get the rice cooked.

209
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,950
Let us help you.

210
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,816
Sure, go ahead.

211
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:39,209
I’ll do it.

212
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:34,710
How is it going?

213
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:35,817
Huh?

214
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:39,803
Oh, almost done.

215
00:21:46,503 --> 00:21:47,503
Why are you smiling?

216
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,050
Because you’re smiling.

217
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,616
I wasn’t smiling.
I was laughing at your face.

218
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,130
Move.
If you don’t know how to do it, then move.

219
00:22:15,163 --> 00:22:16,163
Wow.

220
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,190
You’re so good.

221
00:22:19,577 --> 00:22:20,577
I know.

222
00:22:30,437 --> 00:22:31,437
What’s this?

223
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,580
Testing out the water.

224
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,790
See if I can fool around with you now.

225
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:38,497
I’m not your playmate.

226
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,016
What are you up to?

227
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,203
Anything that can make you smile.

228
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,610
What a hassle.

229
00:23:01,936 --> 00:23:02,936
Hey!

230
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,643
I told you.

231
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:18,186
It’s safe this time.

232
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,873
His parents are all dead

233
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,456
so I took him in.

234
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,690
Didn’t you say you were hungry?

235
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:48,506
A man should eat a lot
so he can grow up quickly.

236
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:51,073
When you’re strong,
you can take care of others.

237
00:23:53,937 --> 00:23:54,943
Alright, big bro?

238
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:08,743
Hey.

239
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:12,490
Is that one of the skills
of a criminologist?

240
00:24:18,303 --> 00:24:19,430
It’s an orphan’s skill.

241
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:25,503
I’m an orphan.

242
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:29,923
Thunphob’s dad took me in

243
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,373
so I can give my stem cell to Thunphob.

244
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:36,336
Thunphob and I

245
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:39,983
don’t share the same blood.

246
00:24:42,343 --> 00:24:43,343
But we

247
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,510
gave each other a new life.

248
00:24:54,897 --> 00:24:55,970
It’s not about dad.

249
00:24:58,416 --> 00:24:59,453
Nothing to do with favor.

250
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:02,843
I’m doing this

251
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:05,583
because I want to.

252
00:25:08,103 --> 00:25:09,210
I want you to live.

253
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,910
You will survive.

254
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:47,617
I was lucky

255
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,223
that my cell matches the rich.

256
00:25:51,923 --> 00:25:52,923
While you

257
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:55,277
were unlucky

258
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,950
to have met me.

259
00:26:04,057 --> 00:26:05,593
Thunphob was lucky to have you.

260
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,410
Even though you’re not a very good guy.

261
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,443
But you’re a good older brother.

262
00:26:14,097 --> 00:26:16,030
I want to be a good guy in your eyes too.

263
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:19,977
Is there anything I can still do
to make it right?

264
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,196
What does my body language tell you?

265
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:25,257
I’m so scared.

266
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,176
Scared that it’s just all in my head.

267
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:33,227
What you’re thinking is right.

268
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:41,737
You know what?

269
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,810
Grandma said Thunphob
wanted to buy this for me

270
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,643
because he thought I might like it,

271
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,363
but even up until now,
nothing feels familiar to me.

272
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:17,437
How should I listen to the leaves
for them to resemble a melody?

273
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,810
Even the sound of
that waterfall is louder.

274
00:27:27,577 --> 00:27:28,577
The sound of a waterfall?

275
00:27:41,223 --> 00:27:42,223
You’re right.

276
00:27:43,237 --> 00:27:44,717
It’s really the sound of a waterfall.

277
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:58,923
Now there’s only you

278
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:02,636
that I’m familiar with.

279
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,203
How is Thunphob’s case going?

280
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,216
I’ve checked the information.
Still nothing new.

281
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:38,963
(Mr. Botpleng?)

282
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,213
(Why are you calling?)

283
00:28:41,143 --> 00:28:42,530
(Oh, it’s me, Inspector Dao.)

284
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,936
Excuse me, I’m calling for Tankhun.

285
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:49,566
(Tankhun got clipped by a bike in front
of the police station this morning.)

286
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,176
(He’s at the hospital right now.)

287
00:28:52,245 --> 00:28:53,245
Okay.

288
00:28:53,753 --> 00:28:54,753
Mile.

289
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,063
What is it?

290
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,099
I’m taking half a day off.

291
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,121
Hey! Where are you going?

292
00:28:58,162 --> 00:28:59,162
I’ll be right back.

293
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:00,389
Hey! Pleng!

294
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:16,618
Tankhun!

295
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,632
How are you doing?

296
00:29:22,075 --> 00:29:23,075
Oh.

297
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:24,932
I’m fine.

298
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,195
What happened?

299
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:28,788
Nothing much.

300
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:30,596
I meant to meet Inspector Dao

301
00:29:30,642 --> 00:29:32,610
to discuss the case
at the police station this morning.

302
00:29:32,634 --> 00:29:33,634
I didn’t watch out.

303
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:35,849
I was careless and the bike just–

304
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,015
Hello?

305
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,302
Yeah.

306
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:48,446
I’m here.

307
00:29:49,235 --> 00:29:52,035
The parking lot on the side is full
so I’m parking at the back instead.

308
00:29:54,683 --> 00:29:55,683
Ow!

309
00:29:56,412 --> 00:29:57,412
Ow!

310
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,890
It wasn’t an accident.

311
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:09,004
What did you say?

312
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,720
Oh, nothing.

313
00:30:13,336 --> 00:30:14,336
I’m alright.

314
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,013
The doctor said I can just go home.

315
00:30:20,524 --> 00:30:21,040
Ow!

316
00:30:21,092 --> 00:30:22,104
- Let me help you.
- Ow!

317
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:23,128
Sorry!

318
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,110
Does it hurt a lot?

319
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,146
Sit here.

320
00:30:47,436 --> 00:30:48,436
Thank you.

321
00:31:07,756 --> 00:31:08,756
Give it.

322
00:31:10,924 --> 00:31:12,319
Put that down slowly.

323
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:17,603
From now on, for the things you can’t do,

324
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:18,906
I’ll do it for you.

325
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:26,268
Everything?

326
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,388
Sorry.

327
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:25,982
I reckon there’s only egg and water
in the fridge.

328
00:32:27,391 --> 00:32:29,391
Let me know what you want
to eat for the next meal.

329
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:30,994
I’ll have it delivered for you.

330
00:32:31,346 --> 00:32:32,346
No.

331
00:32:33,834 --> 00:32:35,135
I want to eat the food you make.

332
00:32:41,645 --> 00:32:42,645
I’ll feed you.

333
00:32:49,356 --> 00:32:50,461
I don’t know if it’s good.

334
00:32:59,756 --> 00:33:00,384
Hmm!

335
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:01,651
It’s really good!

336
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:04,667
Let’s see.

337
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:20,803
Do you want some more?

338
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:41,849
Hey! Tankhun!

339
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,148
Ow!

340
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,190
Why didn’t you tell me
you want to use the toilet?

341
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,329
I don’t think you have to
take care of me for this.

342
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,012
The floor could be slippery.

343
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,218
What if you slip and hit your head?

344
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Okay.

345
00:33:58,443 --> 00:33:59,443
Uh…

346
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,508
And are you going to…

347
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:11,305
I know that!

348
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:13,148
I’ll wait outside.

349
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:05,092
Stop exploiting my memory with Thunphob.

350
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:06,835
I never said

351
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,905
that this is Thunphob’s memory.

352
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
What are you up to?

353
00:35:12,788 --> 00:35:13,788
Anything

354
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,562
as long as it can make you smile.

355
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,710
What is it, Mile?

356
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:34,792
He lied to you.

357
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:36,819
Why do you still get involved with him?

358
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,222
Who exactly is lying to me, Mile?

359
00:35:41,999 --> 00:35:43,088
How did you know

360
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:45,266
that this place is Tankhun’s house?

361
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,938
And why are you here now?

362
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:55,658
The one who seems least suspicious

363
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,712
tends to be hiding something.

364
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,167
So can you tell me now?

365
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:04,719
How did you know
that this is Tankhun’s house?

366
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:08,716
You don’t have to know
how I figured it out.

367
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:11,536
Everything I did

368
00:36:12,654 --> 00:36:13,814
was because I care about you.

369
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:16,917
You’d better tell the truth, Mile.

370
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:20,033
You’re the only one who knows I’d be here.

371
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,199
- You meant to–
- I just love you.

372
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:24,859
I just love you.

373
00:36:25,413 --> 00:36:26,494
Is that wrong?

374
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:40,739
Don’t you ever think that by saying that,

375
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,209
I would stop suspecting you.

376
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,736
Or is the reason you’re suspecting me

377
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:51,175
is just because you didn’t want to
believe in what I say?

378
00:36:51,656 --> 00:36:52,656
That I love you?

379
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:57,208
All I did was because

380
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,719
I’m worried about you, Pleng.

381
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:09,205
Listen to me.

382
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,309
I’m okay with having you in my life.

383
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,380
But as a friend.

384
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:25,290
Do you really think that way?

385
00:37:33,863 --> 00:37:35,543
You’re my best friend.

386
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,407
And that will never change.

387
00:37:42,623 --> 00:37:43,645
Thank you so much.

388
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:53,671
You’re–

389
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,120
So mean.

390
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,049
I’m so–

391
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:02,855
I shouldn’t have said that.

392
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:07,036
Why?

393
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:08,655
Are you shy?

394
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:12,973
Stop it.

395
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,105
Fine.

396
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,893
It’s good that you’re smiling now.

397
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,093
But don’t forget.

398
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:23,800
You’re still on my list of suspects.

399
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,087
Fine.

400
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:54,255
He didn’t lie.

401
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:57,435
You saw?

402
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:00,293
I heard the noise.

403
00:39:01,613 --> 00:39:02,613
So I went out to see.

404
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:11,710
He seemed open.

405
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,991
He says what he thinks.

406
00:39:15,752 --> 00:39:16,752
He wasn’t lying.

407
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:19,351
If he were a liar,

408
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:22,477
he would have been a really good liar.

409
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:27,376
But…

410
00:39:28,313 --> 00:39:29,816
You told me to watch out.

411
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,610
If it was because he liked you

412
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:37,883
then that was reasonable.

413
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,121
That’s even worse.

414
00:39:45,665 --> 00:39:46,831
You didn’t like Muenmile?

415
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:50,902
You have the guts to ask?

416
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:54,307
How many times have we kissed?

417
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,863
Aren’t you too attached
to your first love?

418
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,309
Thunphob’s already dead.

419
00:40:00,459 --> 00:40:01,717
How do you want me to put this?

420
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:10,946
What I did

421
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,047
was disgusting.

422
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:41,132
If it’s disgusting,

423
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:45,847
then both of us are disgusting.

424
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:19,188
What if I were the one
who killed your brother?

425
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:21,317
What would you do?

426
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:23,605
I would hold you like this.

427
00:41:24,697 --> 00:41:27,305
If it hurts so much
that you have to forget,

428
00:41:28,048 --> 00:41:29,048
Then I…

429
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:31,126
don’t want you to remember.

430
00:41:32,062 --> 00:41:33,275
That’s what I fear.

431
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,040
I fear that it’d be worse.

432
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
Why are you following me?

433
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:44,706
I won’t let Botpleng get in danger.

434
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:46,912
It felt like

435
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:48,665
it wasn’t the first time I saw him.

436
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,111
You’ve met Tanu before?

437
00:41:51,667 --> 00:41:53,701
Madame, do you know Thunphob?

438
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,906
It’s not my obligation
to answer this question.

439
00:41:57,537 --> 00:41:59,204
You really knew my lover, Grandma.

440
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:01,266
Mom!

441
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,863
It seems like Mr. Pleng’s memories
are about to return.

442
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,272
Pleng!

443
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:07,559
Who?

444
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:09,756
If they want your memory to return,

445
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:12,185
why did they prevent you
from thinking about the past?

446
00:42:12,673 --> 00:42:14,312
What if it’s not to make him remember

447
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,875
but to make him forget
about a certain event?
