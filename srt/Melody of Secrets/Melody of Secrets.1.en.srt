1
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,063
Are you sure

2
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:56,043
that you

3
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:58,553
want all the memories back?

4
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,633
I want the truth

5
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:36,543
I know this song.

6
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:48,113
I can remember now!

7
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:51,103
I can remember now!

8
00:01:58,713 --> 00:01:59,713
Tankhun!

9
00:02:00,013 --> 00:02:01,013
Tankhun!

10
00:02:01,393 --> 00:02:02,403
Tankhun!

11
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,223
Tankhun!

12
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:37,623
Have you ever had the same dream repeatedly?

13
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:43,403
A dream about someone

14
00:03:45,963 --> 00:03:47,063
who was your first love.

15
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:56,383
I met him in winter, the warmest winter.

16
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,023
Tankhun!

17
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:22,763
A nightmare again?

18
00:04:27,273 --> 00:04:28,533
Did I wake you up, Grandma?

19
00:04:30,383 --> 00:04:32,123
Don’t forget to visit the doctor today.

20
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,623
If dreams arise from the subconscious mind,

21
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:59,503
my dreams would be far too mysterious
beyond anticipation.

22
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:03,783
Because I lost my memories 10 years ago.

23
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,263
Botpleng!

24
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:07,733
Botpleng!

25
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:10,163
Botpleng!

26
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:35,023
What happened, Mom?

27
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:51,833
“Recurring dreams”.

28
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,279
A condition of having the same dreams repeatedly.

29
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,843
It can arise from many causes.

30
00:05:56,413 --> 00:05:58,223
Maybe because of stress,

31
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:01,023
unresolved past trauma,

32
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:03,923
or if you think

33
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:06,663
it was your real memory that was lost

34
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:08,363
then that’s also possible.

35
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:11,983
Then… what do I do, Doctor?

36
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:18,353
The human brain is complex.

37
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:24,633
But there’s one thing that links well
with the brain’s functioning.

38
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:28,393
That is us working together
to find the triggering factor.

39
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,823
Can you tell me—

40
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,193
Before you had this dream,

41
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,373
what were you doing

42
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:40,103
or what did you encounter?

43
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:41,723
Yes.

44
00:06:42,013 --> 00:06:44,473
Something triggered my memory.

45
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,423
7 DAYS AGO

46
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:01,553
Boss!
Boss!

47
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,863
We’re getting sued again!

48
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:04,323
Fight back.

49
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,323
Say it’s the freedom of the press.

50
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,263
Hey, I think this picture’s too sensitive.

51
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:10,283
Take that down.

52
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:13,363
O, don’t forget to sensor this time.

53
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:14,253
Got it, Boss!

54
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:15,463
I won’t miss it this time.

55
00:07:18,703 --> 00:07:19,943
I found the word “gosh!”.

56
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,083
Paragraph 3,
you put your emotions in it again.

57
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,183
Fix it now.

58
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:25,363
Oh! But I feel so involved!

59
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:27,213
You’re a journalist

60
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:28,233
not just some people on the internet!

61
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:30,233
Leave the commenting part to the netizens!

62
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:36,993
You’re all worked up
right from the morning.

63
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,973
Just how it goes during quarter transitions.

64
00:07:41,387 --> 00:07:42,387
By the way.

65
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,363
Why did you ask me to come in?

66
00:07:44,747 --> 00:07:46,603
Are you not okay with
the headline I proposed?

67
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,523
No.

68
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,971
I was throwing away some old printing plates

69
00:07:48,995 --> 00:07:50,595
and found a parcel I forgot to give you.

70
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:52,313
A parcel?

71
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,753
Here.

72
00:07:55,263 --> 00:07:56,943
So I won’t forget to give it to you again.

73
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:00,493
I never have anything shipped here, though.

74
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,523
It was addressed to you.

75
00:08:02,547 --> 00:08:04,235
If it’s not yours, then whose could it be?

76
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,863
Here you go.

77
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:07,619
If you’re curious, then open it up.

78
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:08,883
I’m also curious.

79
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:42,003
Mom wants me to learn the violin

80
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:43,515
so that I can be good at it like dad.

81
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:45,451
Mom probably wants to hear

82
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,983
the sound of Dad’s violin again.

83
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:49,555
But I can’t even remember

84
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:51,235
what it sounded like.

85
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:01,955
I’ve heard “Canon in D”
so many times before.

86
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:04,867
But no one could play it the way he did.

87
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:37,219
I saw him

88
00:09:37,563 --> 00:09:39,419
after following the sound of the violin

89
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,043
all the way to that tree.

90
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:53,153
Uh…

91
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,293
Hi.

92
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,563
He said his name was “Tankhun”.

93
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:02,363
We met in winter when we were 17.

94
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:07,179
Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.

95
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:09,987
Just like getting to know love
for the first time.

96
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,147
Did you forget to tell me anything, Pleng?

97
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,743
No.

98
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:21,579
These days, I’ve probably been…

99
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,971
too obsessed with work.

100
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,963
So my head’s chaotic.

101
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:27,491
Then

102
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,419
I’ll give you some stress-relieving pills.

103
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:31,823
Yes.

104
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:36,051
If anything else is disturbing you mentally
in addition to what you told me,

105
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,579
then you have to let me know.

106
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,343
So that we can work it out together.

107
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:42,451
Your mom will probably be happy about it.

108
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,043
Mom.

109
00:11:49,983 --> 00:11:52,539
What happened between Tankhun and me?

110
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:57,331
Why didn’t you tell me anything about it?

111
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,579
If you don’t believe it

112
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,223
then why didn’t you tell
your grandma and doctor about it?

113
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,995
Because if it’s not true,

114
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,507
then what does the sender want?

115
00:12:24,753 --> 00:12:26,227
To work you up.

116
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:28,523
You’re having a wild dream.

117
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:29,627
Let’s see.

118
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,623
Let me see what’s freaking written there

119
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:33,011
that even make you dream about it?

120
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,995
You’re sticking your nose
even in your friend’s business?

121
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:36,635
Damn you.
What?

122
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:38,971
I’m being generous.

123
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,179
Maybe I can help you find more clues.

124
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,579
If you want to stick your nose in

125
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,971
then just say so.

126
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:46,343
So are you going to let me do that?

127
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:48,099
No, I’m not.

128
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,123
My detective skills are just as good as yours.

129
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,627
I already sent an email.

130
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,113
An email?

131
00:12:56,623 --> 00:12:57,563
What email?

132
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,603
Whose email?

133
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:01,023
His email is there in the diary.

134
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,875
The lover I can’t remember.

135
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:05,739
Did he reply?

136
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:21,893
(Hi, Tankhun. Sorry I’ve been missing.)
Are you back now, Botpleng?

137
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,219
Can we meet?

138
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:26,343
Yes.

139
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:29,515
Are you out of your mind?

140
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,627
You don’t even know him.

141
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:32,947
You can’t even remember him.

142
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:36,491
Also, you don’t even believe it’s true.

143
00:13:38,493 --> 00:13:39,579
Then check this out.

144
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:43,753
Look.

145
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:46,771
Then tell me this is not my handwriting.

146
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,515
So what?

147
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,555
It’s been 10 years.

148
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,611
Who in their right mind would have
sent this to you?

149
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:56,467
It might be Tankhun.

150
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,075
Alright, I get it.

151
00:14:04,663 --> 00:14:07,067
I’m meeting him out in the open.

152
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:09,651
(Do you want me to put off my meeting
and go with you?)

153
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:13,303
Damn, do you want the revenue department
to call you in for another year?

154
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:15,131
(You’re really–)

155
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,755
I’m hanging up.

156
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,943
There’s not going to be any signals from here on.

157
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,171
(You remember?)

158
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,903
Yeah.

159
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,763
Of course, I do.

160
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,475
It feels like coming home.

161
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:32,291
I’ve never been here again.

162
00:14:32,983 --> 00:14:35,251
Since the accident 10 years ago.

163
00:14:36,003 --> 00:14:38,363
But among all the memories I’ve lost,

164
00:14:38,943 --> 00:14:40,459
I feel like

165
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,571
there’s a hint of memory about this place.

166
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,443
I feel familiar.

167
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:50,067
Yearning.

168
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:55,187
As if Canon in D is playing in my head all the time.

169
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:12,563
Tankhun.

170
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:36,683
Tankhun.

171
00:15:39,903 --> 00:15:41,227
Is that you?

172
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:47,963
Where are you?

173
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:21,843
Shit!

174
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:35,971
I’m Tankhun.

175
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,651
Your lover.

176
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:45,907
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

177
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:53,843
Are you the murderer?

178
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:57,443
What do you think?

179
00:17:08,593 --> 00:17:09,803
Turn yourself in.

180
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,543
You can’t get away with it.

181
00:17:11,763 --> 00:17:13,195
I’m not the murderer.

182
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,787
I’m also the one who called the police.

183
00:17:16,263 --> 00:17:17,667
They’re just as late as you are.

184
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:21,947
Thai people’s time, I guess.

185
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,051
Yes.

186
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,633
Everything’s according to the manual.

187
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,403
I’ll have to interrogate everyone involved.

188
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:40,823
Inspector.

189
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:43,983
Yes.

190
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:49,659
What have we got, Lt. Nim?

191
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:52,771
He’s the one who watches over the house
of the Thayadon family.

192
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,203
The family of Mr. Botpleng,

193
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,707
the one who discovered the dead body.

194
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,333
Nice.

195
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:03,699
So we won’t have to do much interrogation.

196
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,779
Do you know the deceased?

197
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:36,475
I don’t know him personally.

198
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,403
I only know that my grandma
hired someone to watch over the house.

199
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,155
Then why did he send you a parcel?

200
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,623
What did you say?

201
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,203
2 weeks ago,

202
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,555
a boy from another country,

203
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:49,203
with no friends

204
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:50,899
and no social life,

205
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,963
sent a parcel to Mr. Botpleng Thayadon.

206
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:55,971
Someone who doesn’t even know him.

207
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:07,515
What did he send you?

208
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,033
Well.

209
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:11,979
He sent me a diary.

210
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,435
But I’ve just found out from you

211
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,019
that he was the sender.

212
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:19,139
How did you feel

213
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,267
when you saw the diary?

214
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,193
Pardon?

215
00:19:22,463 --> 00:19:23,947
Were you happy?

216
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,107
Sad?

217
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:27,833
Or did you feel like you were pressured
or blackmailed?

218
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,371
Are you suspecting me, officer?

219
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:36,427
The thing is,

220
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,579
I’m searching for the likelihood here.

221
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:42,483
The deceased just sent you a parcel.

222
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:44,547
Then a week later,

223
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:46,755
you turned out to be the one
who found his body.

224
00:19:48,913 --> 00:19:50,393
Isn’t that too much of a coincidence?

225
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:55,543
I’m here because I have an appointment
with someone.

226
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,613
How can I make him ask me to come here?

227
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,371
If you want evidence, I have it.

228
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:04,307
Then who asked you to come?

229
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,323
Lover.

230
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:17,891
Tankhun.

231
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:21,123
My lover.

232
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,347
Tankhun is your lover?

233
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:32,059
I don’t know.

234
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,723
I can’t remember.

235
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,195
His body language is normal.

236
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:48,915
Open and not hiding anything.

237
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:50,387
Slightly nervous

238
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,075
but still at a normal level.

239
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,627
Are you sure he’s not lying?

240
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,093
For sure?

241
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,343
For sure.

242
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:05,193
Coming from the only body language
decipherer of the department.

243
00:21:10,073 --> 00:21:11,323
The same goes for me.

244
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:13,155
I’m not lying.

245
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,419
You knew?

246
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,075
You’re reading my body language.

247
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,779
I’m just trying it out.

248
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,747
He can’t remember you

249
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,427
but you can remember him.

250
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:28,155
Maybe you want to protect him

251
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:29,563
due to personal reasons.

252
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:34,933
That’s right.

253
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,363
Yeah.

254
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:40,371
What you said is right.

255
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:42,131
I have reasons to do that.

256
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,003
But what about Botpleng?

257
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:46,027
What could be the reasons
for him to kill that man?

258
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:49,499
You can try to figure out the reasons.

259
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,595
But you can’t detain Botpleng like that.

260
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,595
Not just his family,

261
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:55,383
even for me,

262
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,143
I don’t find that acceptable.

263
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:06,347
(Murder with dismemberment of the body.)

264
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:10,195
Oh, hey.

265
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:11,459
How are you doing?

266
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:14,663
I’m okay.

267
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,379
By the way, I got a new headline.

268
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,187
I’ll draft it up and send it to you.

269
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:23,463
You still have the guts for that right now?

270
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:26,411
Well, I’m an early Gen Z

271
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:27,843
who has inherited some Gen Y’s DNA.

272
00:22:29,753 --> 00:22:30,753
By the way,

273
00:22:30,943 --> 00:22:33,563
what about the thing I’ve asked you?

274
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,251
Don’t worry.

275
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,611
They didn’t want your grandma
to know anyway.

276
00:22:37,643 --> 00:22:40,315
They didn’t even want to interrogate you at first.

277
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,219
But the police officer who’s in charge
of the case wouldn’t let it slide.

278
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:44,983
Thanks.

279
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,531
It’s so nice having you as my friend.

280
00:22:47,973 --> 00:22:49,099
How nice.

281
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:51,571
Instead of worrying about your case,

282
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:54,411
you’re more worried about
your grandma finding out about it.

283
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:59,851
Actually, you should just let her know.

284
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,195
So you can go home today.

285
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:03,603
You know full well.

286
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:04,747
If my grandma knows about this,

287
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,371
do you think I’d get to come here today?

288
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:09,763
Also, if they want to interrogate,
then go ahead.

289
00:23:09,795 --> 00:23:10,795
I’m chill about it.

290
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:12,027
I didn’t do anything wrong

291
00:23:12,043 --> 00:23:13,395
and I also got a job done.

292
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:14,419
Here.

293
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,867
Alright, whatever.

294
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:17,307
By the way.

295
00:23:17,693 --> 00:23:19,163
When can you go home?

296
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,499
No idea.

297
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:25,739
You may go home now.

298
00:23:26,403 --> 00:23:29,179
Uh, what about Tankhun?

299
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,683
Then you can just go home with me.

300
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:39,595
Leave your car here and pick it up later.

301
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,453
You can head back first.

302
00:23:55,523 --> 00:23:56,843
You don’t look like

303
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:58,795
someone who has just been interrogated.

304
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:00,587
You’re no longer a suspect.

305
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:02,915
The police didn’t find the weapon

306
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:04,267
nor any linking witness.

307
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,731
The initial hypothesis is that

308
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:08,433
everything was just a coincidence.

309
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,611
Let me ask you for real.

310
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,139
Who really are you?

311
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:26,043
I’m a criminologist

312
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,755
who works at the
Criminal Investigation Department.

313
00:24:30,543 --> 00:24:32,755
Do you cooperate with
the local police station, too?

314
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,187
I knew Inspector Dao

315
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,771
when she was taking a course in the UK.

316
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,107
Because you know Inspector Dao,

317
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:43,195
so you don’t get interrogated?

318
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:44,987
So I was the first to be interrogated.

319
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:48,179
I’m also your only witness

320
00:24:48,227 --> 00:24:50,363
proving that you came according
to my appointment.

321
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:52,555
One more thing.

322
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:59,219
You can’t remember me, but I can.

323
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,803
I can remember who Botpleng’s first love is.

324
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,635
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

325
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,195
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

326
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:12,315
Who Botpleng’s first love is.

327
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:14,763
Are you okay?

328
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:17,443
Hey!

329
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:18,663
Botpleng!

330
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:20,939
I’m fine.

331
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:21,979
I’m okay.

332
00:25:23,363 --> 00:25:25,475
Don’t overlook your symptoms

333
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:26,899
even if it’s something minor.

334
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,179
I’m really alright.

335
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,187
This is not the first time.

336
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:35,423
It’s migraine.

337
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,883
I’ll get going, please excuse me.

338
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,955
I’ll see you.

339
00:25:58,463 --> 00:26:00,099
I wasn’t being your witness

340
00:26:00,139 --> 00:26:01,419
for you to head back to Bangkok.

341
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,211
I’ve waited for you for 10 years, Botpleng.

342
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:20,899
Did the caretaker clean this house at all?

343
00:26:27,933 --> 00:26:29,075
He just passed away.

344
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:30,419
He won’t come to see you.

345
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,003
Who knows?

346
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,107
It’s filled with dust.

347
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:39,587
You can’t stay here.

348
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,013
Let’s go to my house instead.

349
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:42,931
I lost my memories,

350
00:26:43,303 --> 00:26:44,303
but I’m not stupid.

351
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,195
Don’t act as if you can always seduce me.

352
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,835
How can I ever seduce you?

353
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:51,733
If I wanted to,

354
00:26:52,993 --> 00:26:54,393
then I could just do it right here.

355
00:26:55,543 --> 00:26:56,755
Also,

356
00:26:57,563 --> 00:26:58,771
our houses are not far apart.

357
00:27:00,113 --> 00:27:01,113
Not far?

358
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:03,555
How close?

359
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:12,819
Do you want to be reminded?

360
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:53,643
Does it feel familiar?

361
00:27:57,773 --> 00:27:59,003
Have I ever been here before?

362
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,033
No.

363
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:04,123
Finding faults?

364
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,713
What is there for me to do that?

365
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:09,971
I don’t know.

366
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,923
You could think I’m faking my memory loss.

367
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,235
If you faked your memory loss,

368
00:28:18,353 --> 00:28:19,953
you wouldn’t have met up with me, Pleng.

369
00:28:21,463 --> 00:28:22,787
You wouldn’t have come here.

370
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,059
You wouldn’t be here.

371
00:28:46,163 --> 00:28:47,243
You know what?

372
00:28:47,263 --> 00:28:49,587
They say “a lot can happen in a day”,

373
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,291
and I only understand what it means today.

374
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,187
It’s unbelievable.

375
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:02,703
Do you

376
00:29:05,123 --> 00:29:06,467
believe in coincidences?

377
00:29:11,603 --> 00:29:12,603
Maybe?

378
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:14,653
Believe it or not,

379
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,795
ever since I became a journalist,

380
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:19,587
the damn real life is full of coincidences

381
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:20,803
even more than in soap operas.

382
00:29:23,463 --> 00:29:24,987
Did young master Botpleng

383
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:27,603
just say “damn”?

384
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,623
Do I

385
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:38,323
not say that normally?

386
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:42,755
Not a single swear word.

387
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,867
It’s been 10 years.

388
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:52,211
Things can change.

389
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,795
Also, I lost my memories.

390
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,307
I can’t remember my life back then.

391
00:30:02,623 --> 00:30:03,667
People

392
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,539
can really forget about their lives?

393
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:20,371
Is this your goal?

394
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:23,803
Yes.

395
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:30,275
I want Pleng’s memories to return.

396
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,663
Why?

397
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,131
What if I say

398
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,939
because I want back that Botpleng

399
00:30:46,251 --> 00:30:47,723
who was Tankhun’s?

400
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:52,787
What would you say?

401
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:15,571
I haven’t forgotten.

402
00:31:17,993 --> 00:31:19,603
The first time we touched.

403
00:31:36,983 --> 00:31:38,019
The first time

404
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:41,979
I taught you how to play the violin.

405
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:02,963
I can’t remember.

406
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:06,113
Go with the flow of your heart.

407
00:32:09,953 --> 00:32:11,475
I’ll never hurt you.

408
00:32:55,943 --> 00:32:57,483
I saw him

409
00:32:57,507 --> 00:32:59,371
after following the sound of the violin

410
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,979
all the way to that tree.

411
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,173
Uh…

412
00:33:15,947 --> 00:33:17,019
Hi.

413
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,243
He said his name was Tankhun.

414
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,891
We met in winter when we were 17.

415
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:50,987
Tan made me enjoy the violin
for the first time.

416
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,863
Just like getting to know love
for the first time.

417
00:34:47,203 --> 00:34:48,627
I really can’t remember.

418
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:53,243
I’m sorry.

419
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:55,659
It’s totally fine.

420
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:06,235
I can’t even remember myself.

421
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:08,731
So how can I remember him?

422
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,331
If I were to remember myself,

423
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:14,803
will I be able to remember him?

424
00:35:16,623 --> 00:35:18,923
Why do I want to be able
to remember this badly?

425
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,467
On Christmas of 2015,

426
00:35:23,023 --> 00:35:26,147
the christmas songs could be heard
from the village’s office.

427
00:35:26,573 --> 00:35:30,235
I felt familiar with every melody I heard.

428
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:46,819
But in that moment,

429
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:50,931
I felt like I’ve actually become Botpleng

430
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,539
when I’m in his embrace.

431
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:00,563
He was the final melody

432
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:04,733
that completed me.

433
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:13,523
What was your first kiss like?

434
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,595
I lost my memories.

435
00:36:17,353 --> 00:36:18,851
Something felt familiar.

436
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:21,275
While some didn’t.

437
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:30,419
I know I’ve kissed him before.

438
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:34,851
But this kiss,

439
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,547
made me feel like it’s my first kiss.

440
00:36:40,913 --> 00:36:42,571
Nothing felt familiar

441
00:36:43,343 --> 00:36:45,579
but my instinct tells me to keep going.

442
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:59,595
I used to think Tankhun isn’t dangerous.

443
00:37:00,383 --> 00:37:01,795
I was probably wrong.

444
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:37,571
That Christmas night was the coldest night
in winter.

445
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,573
Yet, I was all hot.

446
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:43,555
As if a steam was coming from him and me.

447
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:45,979
We made it up together.

448
00:37:47,983 --> 00:37:49,203
He kissed me.

449
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:51,099
We kissed.

450
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:53,963
We could never get enough.

451
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:57,571
We learned about each other’s bodies.

452
00:37:58,453 --> 00:38:03,195
The feeling of touching his skin
felt entirely different from mine.

453
00:38:04,973 --> 00:38:07,491
So did when he touched me.

454
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:11,395
Our bodies moved like the melody
of a love song.

455
00:38:11,435 --> 00:38:13,899
Moving along the notes beautifully.

456
00:38:14,653 --> 00:38:16,947
Just like the melody of Canon in D.

457
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:21,323
He touched all the parts
I never let anyone touch.

458
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:23,875
We were each other’s first love

459
00:38:23,913 --> 00:38:26,075
and each other’s first time.

460
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,783
But he was the last melody

461
00:38:28,811 --> 00:38:30,783
that completed me.

462
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:40,143
Sorry.

463
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,063
Yeah?

464
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:51,059
(The police found another dead body
died in the same way.)

465
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:03,003
Alright, I’ll be right there.

466
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,883
Where are you going?

467
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,453
The police found a dead body
not far away from here.

468
00:39:14,843 --> 00:39:15,843
When?

469
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,379
An hour ago.

470
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,419
I’m heading there to see.

471
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,203
Are you a criminal journalist?

472
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:24,211
Is your agency trying to report this

473
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:26,371
before the others do?

474
00:39:28,419 --> 00:39:32,099
Can you tell that much
from my body language?

475
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:37,983
If you’re not ready to keep going with me

476
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:39,713
then just say so.

477
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:41,995
I’ll leave.

478
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:44,811
But I want you to have some rest.

479
00:39:45,423 --> 00:39:47,339
Even if you go to the crime scene now,

480
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,819
you wouldn’t get anything out of it.

481
00:39:49,547 --> 00:39:51,543
The police need time to collect the information

482
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:52,771
and do a deep investigation.

483
00:39:53,793 --> 00:39:55,195
You can just keep it short.

484
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,195
I’m worried about you.

485
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:27,459
Hello?

486
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:28,483
(Dude.)

487
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:29,771
Send me your location.

488
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:30,795
I’m going to pick you up.

489
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:34,763
I think we should go tomorrow.

490
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,795
Let the police do their job for now.

491
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,747
You’ve never been this way before.

492
00:40:41,153 --> 00:40:42,153
What’s keeping you up?

493
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:46,115
I’m at Tankhun’s house.

494
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:50,403
Are you hooked on him now?

495
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:53,091
Why so quick on the spark?

496
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:55,043
Keep it down.

497
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:56,795
You should keep it down.

498
00:40:57,363 --> 00:40:59,115
You know this is weird,

499
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,475
so you should be careful.

500
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:02,843
(Don’t trust Tankhun.)

501
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:05,059
(Hurry up and come back already.)

502
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:06,091
Understood?

503
00:41:06,603 --> 00:41:07,307
Yeah.

504
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:08,323
I understand everything.

505
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:10,131
But I can’t leave just yet.

506
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,453
I need to find out more about him.

507
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:14,403
So you’re going to ditch your job?

508
00:41:16,923 --> 00:41:18,923
Don’t say that to me, Mile.

509
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,827
You know full well.

510
00:41:23,235 --> 00:41:25,233
You have local reporters here.

511
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:26,963
And the fact that you’re calling me

512
00:41:27,003 --> 00:41:28,467
is not just because of work, right?

513
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,863
You just don’t want me to be here.

514
00:41:54,613 --> 00:41:57,963
Tankhun has a scar on his left wrist, a long line.

515
00:41:58,003 --> 00:41:59,435
I want to help Botpleng.

516
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,419
I’m confident that he’s not the culprit.

517
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,931
Isn’t it too much of a coincidence

518
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:05,595
that you encounter Tankhun and the dead body at the same time?

519
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:07,235
Then he’s trying to use you as a witness.

520
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:08,987
What do I have for him to use me?

521
00:42:09,011 --> 00:42:11,027
And now he’s the only one who protects me

522
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:12,811
and helps me trace my memories back.

523
00:42:12,835 --> 00:42:15,443
I’m going to prove to you that this Tankhun

524
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:16,363
is not the real one.

525
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:19,819
The autopsy result revealed that both cases died in the same manner.

526
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:21,823
That is strangling with garrote knots.

527
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:24,547
No one can ever hurt you. I’ll protect you.
