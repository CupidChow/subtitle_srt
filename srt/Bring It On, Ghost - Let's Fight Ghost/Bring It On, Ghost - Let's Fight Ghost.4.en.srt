1
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,930
I'm doing all sorts of things.
Am I doing this right?

2
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:45,260


3
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,460
Bong-pal.

4
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,100
How do I look?

5
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,960
- Huh?
- How do I look? Is it okay?

6
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,930
Well... the dress is pretty.

7
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,660
It's pretty.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,300
- Let's go.
- To where?

9
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,030
To work.

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,500
- What?
- It's time to pay your dues.

11
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,860
What? Why are we working
this late at night?

12
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,530
This is a new dress! You expect
me to fight in my new dress?

13
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,960
(Episode 4)

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,130
Yes, sir! Yes, I'll go ahead
and text my account number to you.

15
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,330
Have a good day!

16
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,730
I should send it to those seniors.

17
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,060
What the heck? What's going on?

18
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,560
Yes.

19
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,130
Right now?

20
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, it's possible. Yes.

21
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,530
- Let's go. We got work to do.
- Again?

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,300
- I can't. I am way too tired.
- No, they want us immediately.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
Don't you think this is too much?

24
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,030
I'm so tired that I hit
my head on the door

25
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,060
because I couldn't go through it.

26
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,760
- Let's take it easy today, okay?
- No.

27
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,100
You agreed to help.

28
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,400
I have to feed you and help you study.
Don't you remember our deal?

29
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,360
Still, this is wrong!

30
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,000
You're working me like
a slave because of this

31
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,600
one dress you bought me.

32
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,200
And you said
you're going to tutor me.

33
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,400
When are we going to start studying?

34
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,100
Okay, okay.
Let's study after we're done, okay?

35
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,960
No, I refuse to go.

36
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,830
Where are you going? Let's go.

37
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,700
- I'm tired.
- Hurry up.

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,399
It's completely trashed in here.

39
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,430
When are we going
to clean all this up?

40
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,529
The housing agency is going
to have a fit if they find out.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,330
You're lucky you're still alive and
breathing. You should be grateful.

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,200
I am. I will be forever grateful...

43
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,700
It's time to pray.

44
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,460
Dear God, Buddha, Allah,
thank you so much...

45
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,360
No!

46
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,360
No, I should be thanking
Bong-pal instead!

47
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,060
He may be a jerk, but he
came when I needed him most.

48
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,600
He's a real man.

49
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,159
How do you think
he knew I was in danger?

50
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,630
Well, the thing is...

51
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Hold on.

52
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,830
- Oh, it's Bong-pal.
- He texted you?

53
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,400
Is he asking if
I'm okay or something?

54
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,900
He's cool. He's a pretty decent guy.

55
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,760
- No, it's not that.
- What did he say? Let me see.

56
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,800
Please deposit
the money into my account.

57
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,700
What is he talking about?
What account?

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,600
Bong-pal says he charges
$1,000 per exorcism.

59
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,700
$1,000...

60
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,100
- What? $1,000?
- Yes.

61
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,460
Wait, let me get this straight.

62
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,360
So... Bong…

63
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,330
Mmm... so, Bong-pal really
didn't come to save me.

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,330
- Correct.
- He's horrible.

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,860
- He was here for the money.
- Do you have $1,000?

66
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,630
No, I do not.

67
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,260
What are we going to do then?
He's not going to let this slide.

68
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,060
I don't know, I don't know.
Just ignore him! I don't know.

69
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,760
Ignore him? I...

70
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,960
Is President Choi Chun-sang inside?
I'm from the housing agency.

71
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,830
I know you're in there!

72
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,730
You can't keep ignoring our calls!
It's only more trouble for you!

73
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,360
President! President!

74
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,630
President! President! President!

75
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,100
Oh goodness.

76
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:37,130
How long was I asleep for?
I was so freaking tired.

77
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,260
Bong-pal. Bong-pal.

78
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,100
Bong-pal.

79
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,830
Sorry!

80
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,160
Hey, I didn't see anything.
I swear!

81
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,700
Will you please make some
noise when you roam around?

82
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,030
I'm a ghost.
How am I supposed to do that?

83
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,030
From now on you are not allowed
to burst in whenever you like.

84
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,800
Fine.

85
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,100
You know, you kind of
look different today.

86
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,000
Your clothes look
a bit neater, too.

87
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,660
Did you do something
to your hair as well?

88
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,660
What are you talking about?

89
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,060
Ah, you have class with her today,
don't you? I'm right, aren't I?

90
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,200
What are you talking about?

91
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,530
I'm going to go. Don't follow me.

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,260
Why? So you can have a nice
and cozy class with that girl?

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,230
No, you said
you're tired so rest up.

94
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,100
And do not go in this room or touch
anything without my permission.

95
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,400
See you later.

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Is there anything else
I'm forbidden to do?

97
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,260
See you later.

98
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,500
Bong-pal, let's go to school.

99
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,159
What the heck?
You just said goodbye to me.

100
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,659
When? I never said that.

101
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,630
Aren't you tired of following me?

102
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,100
It's boring alone at home.

103
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,100
And I can't stay home when I'm
wearing a pretty dress like this.

104
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,730
Fine, go ahead. Geez.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,460
(Eviction Notice)

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm going to send you a separate
repair bill. Just know that.

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,830
Understood?

108
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Yes.

109
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,530
Chun-sang! Chun-sang! Chun-sang!
Hold it in! Hold it in! Hold it in!

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,660
Seriously,
what are we going to do now?

111
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,030
How am I supposed to know?

112
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,260
- What?
- Ghost!

113
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,930
What is it? What is it? What is it?

114
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,560
Why are you in such a good mood?

115
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,760
Just because.

116
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,300
Don't I look like
a college student in this dress?

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,530
Oh please.

118
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,100
- Oh, it's Kyung-ja.
- Who?

119
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,960
Bong-pal, there's
someone I need to talk to.

120
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, who are you meeting…

121
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,030
I swear.

122
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,630
Kyung-ja.

123
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
- Hyun-ji!
- What brings you here?

124
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,060
I told you last time that
my honey is at this school.

125
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,460
Hey, your clothes...

126
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,130
- How do I look?
- What do you think?

127
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,030
You look totally pretty.

128
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,130
You were pretty with your uniform,
but now even prettier in this dress.

129
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,200
You're up there in the ranks of
Jeon Ji-hyun and Song Hye-gyo.

130
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,000
Kyung-ja!

131
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,230
You would look perfect with
a pair of high heels on.

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
But who burned this dress for you?

133
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,130
By any chance,
was it that blood sausage?

134
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,300
I'm right, aren't I?

135
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
What the heck?
He kissed you last time and now

136
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,300
he even burned this dress for you?

137
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,860
I think he likes you.

138
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,330
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh my, why not?

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,830
I'm a ghost and I have
feelings for a human.

140
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,300
There's no rule that a human
can't have feelings for a ghost.

141
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,800
That's not the case. I had to
beg him to burn this dress for me.

142
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,230
And Bong-pal likes someone else.

143
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,900
You don't know because
you've never been in a relationship

144
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
with a guy before.

145
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,430
My instincts tell me that
he likes you 100 percent.

146
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,630
No, there's no way.

147
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,660
- Who did you see?
- Just a ghost that I know.

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,830
My instincts tell me that
he likes you 100 percent.

149
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
What's up?
Why are you smiling like that?

150
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,000
It's nothing.

151
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,460
Bong-pal.

152
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,930
Hello.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
- You're here early.
- Yes.

154
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,030
- Let's prepare for class.
- Okay.

155
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,430
I knew it.

156
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,930
How pretty.

157
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,500
I'll take that.

158
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,100
- It's fine. Thanks.
- No, I'll do it.

159
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,100
Oh my, it's Superman.

160
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
Wow, it's written all over
your face that you like her.

161
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,460
What's the point when you
can't even talk to her properly?

162
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,600
- Ah, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,160
There's no need to be embarrassed.

164
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
You guys are here early.

165
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

166
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,330
Thank you for coming out
this early to help me.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,360
- Are those materials for today?
- Yes.

168
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,900
Did you get hurt? Those scratches...

169
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,430
Ah, it's no big deal.

170
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,800
- That looks painful.
- Goodness.

171
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,930
I didn't bring
the materials for class.

172
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,860
- Bong-pal.
- Yeah?

173
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,130
It seemed like
that professor avoided me earlier.

174
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,430
You're being ridiculous.

175
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,260
Did I see wrong?

176
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,400
Why aren't these seniors
responding to my text?

177
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,130
Who?

178
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,100
Ah, you mean that comedic duo?

179
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,330
They looked penniless to me.
There's no way they're paying you.

180
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,030
The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

181
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,800
Seriously, these guys!

182
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,900
What is this?

183
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,730
(Eviction Notice)

184
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,400
What do you think?
They ran away.

185
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,560
How can you say that right now?

186
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,160
If I don't get paid, then you have
no means to pay off your debt.

187
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,630
What?

188
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,600
How dare they run away
with our money!

189
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,860
Hey, call them again. Hurry!

190
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Seriously.

191
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,600
The facility repair fee is $892.

192
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,000
You have until
the 23rd to pay the office.

193
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,900
- What is it?
- Repair bill of $892.

194
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,400
(Park Bong-pal)

195
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,700
- What is it?
- Exorcism fee of $1,000.

196
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,700
- He's really horrible.
- Hey, don't!

197
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,260
$892... how are we going
to secure all this money? Huh?

198
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm having a tough time
as it is just with the monthly

199
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,500
payments on the camera.

200
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,630
It's not like I can call my parents.

201
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,800
- You really have nothing?
- I really have nothing.

202
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,900
Ask someone who has money.
I've spent all of mine.

203
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,300
Then call someone and borrow it.
Are you just going to sit here

204
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,430
and do nothing?

205
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,560
Alright! Okay!

206
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,100
I'm the big brother here!

207
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,160
- Hello?
- In-rang, I'm completely broke.

208
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,830
I'm in a dire situation and
need to borrow some money.

209
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,700
- I'm all you got?
- You're all I got.

210
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,030
You're the only close
friend that I have.

211
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,500
Hyun-joo!

212
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,160
Hey, Seo-yeon.

213
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,100
I didn't see you in class today.

214
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,630
I just had some
business to take care of.

215
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,700
Why do you ask?

216
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,200
We received some materials to
take home from class today.

217
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,630
Just a moment.

218
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,260
- Hello, Professor.
- Hello.

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,230
Na-bi.

220
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
Na-bi, where are you?

221
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,260
Hyun-joo!

222
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,230
This belongs to Professor Ju.

223
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,400
What are you doing?
Are you going to eat lunch?

224
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,330
Do you only ever think about eating?

225
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
- What is this?
- What do you think it is?

226
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,960
You want me to tutor you.

227
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,700
I need to know what your skill
level is so I can plan accordingly.

228
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,100
Okay, you have one hour.

229
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,800
Right now?
I have a bit of a headache today.

230
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,330
Have you no intention
of crossing over?

231
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
You said you need to take
the exams in order to cross over.

232
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, but not now.

233
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,330
You have one hour.

234
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,760
- Ready... begin.
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

235
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,460
Number four?

236
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,930
Number two!

237
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,760
Just skip it if you don't know.

238
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,330
I'm going to solve all of it!

239
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,300
Hey... what's the minimum exam
score for you to cross over?

240
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,530
I would need a good enough score
to attend this school

241
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
in order for me to cross over to
the afterlife without any problems.

242
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,260
Looks like you don't have
a chance of crossing over this year.

243
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,330
Huh?

244
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,460
- 32?
- Yes, 32.

245
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:32,660
At this rate, you won't even get
near the gates to the afterlife.

246
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,100
How do you expect to take
the exam with these scores?

247
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,430
It's my first exam in five years!

248
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,200
5 years or 10 years.
This exam is not that hard.

249
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,500
A junior high kid would
do better than you.

250
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,430
So what? Are you bragging about
how smart you are right now?

251
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,230
Forget it!

252
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,060
You're the one who failed.
Why are you taking it out on me?

253
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,630
It's not like that!
I didn't sleep well yesterday

254
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
so I don't feel very well!

255
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,630
- Then take it again.
- What?

256
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,930
Take what again?
I'm very busy, okay?

257
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,930
Professor.

258
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, Seo-yeon.
What brings you here?

259
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,560
I have something to give you.

260
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,000
Here. I think this belongs to you.

261
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,200
Ah, you're right.

262
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,060
Thank you,
but how do you have this?

263
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,600
It wasn't me.
A student in our class picked it up.

264
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,260
- Who?
- Her name is Noh Hyun-joo.

265
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,830
Ah, Noh Hyun-joo.
The student who missed class today?

266
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,260
- Yes.
- I see.

267
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,560
Anyway, this is great.
I was looking for it. Thank you.

268
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,930
Not at all. You must be
busy so I'll be on my way.

269
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,930
Sure. By the way, is the dog okay?

270
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes, thanks to you.

271
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,200
Call me anytime
if you need anything.

272
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,630
I will, thank you.

273
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,730
Okay, take care.

274
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,000
Take it easy, you quack.

275
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,130
You manage to make a living
when you do it so painfully?

276
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,300
I'm better than you, punk.
Give me your hand.

277
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,660
Ouch, be gentle!

278
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:57,660
Goodness, your pulse is so weak.
I can barely feel it.

279
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,530
- You're hopeless.
- Your skills are hopeless, punk.

280
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,660
Come on.

281
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,900
I'm surprised you're still
alive after all those encounters.

282
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,630
Does Bong-pal know that you're
in this state because of him?

283
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
What for? It doesn't do any good.

284
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
Don't you dare talk
about this to Bong-pal.

285
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,230
And stop saying that
I'm broken. I'm totally fine.

286
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,260
You may look fine on the outside,
but you're a complete mess inside.

287
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,600
Make sure you take it
easy for the time being.

288
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,700
Have you been to that place
where Bong-pal's father resides?

289
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,060
- I hear he left a long time ago.
- Goodness.

290
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,660
It would be nice if he told me
where he's going ahead of time.

291
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,330
That man is chasing
that punk, isn't he?

292
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,730
The evil spirit
that killed his wife.

293
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,300
It seems that way.

294
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,260
Gosh, it's been over 10 years.

295
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,500
There wasn't anything special in
his room except for that picture.

296
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,400
Gosh, why was he in such a hurry?

297
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,330
He even forgot to send
the letter he wrote to his son.

298
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,400
And I hear someone else came
looking for him besides me.

299
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,260
Who?

300
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,300
The owner couldn't get
a good look at his face.

301
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,000
She said he was just
a young and handsome fellow.

302
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,360
- A young and handsome fellow?
- Yes.

303
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,760
Ouch! Hey!

304
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,060
- I don't think I can accept this.
- What?

305
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,730
Why not? I only bought this
two months ago

306
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,330
and there are still
two years left on the warranty.

307
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,300
It looks like something happened
when you tried to force it in.

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,160
If you modify it like this,
the warranty won't cover it.

309
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,800
It's better to buy
a new one than to fix it.

310
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,700
No, I don't think so.
I never forced…

311
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,260
It was you, wasn't it?

312
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,230
You're the one who
messed around with it.

313
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,330
Didn't I tell you not to touch it
and that we won't be covered

314
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,500
by the warranty if it breaks?

315
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,430
I didn't do it.

316
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,800
You know how
I bought this, don't you?

317
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,230
I do. I know you bought it
with your room and board money.

318
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,900
Right. I still have
10 months of payments left

319
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,860
and I lied to my family.

320
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,730
- You did.
- And?

321
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:41,300
Well, I didn't... I didn't do it.
It was these guys. They did it.

322
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,260
Hey, what's wrong? No! No! No!

323
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,030
No! No, don't do it...

324
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,300
He scares the crap out of
me whenever he's like that.

325
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,800
Damn it. Hey, In-rang!

326
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,430
In-rang! Shoo! Shoo!

327
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,130
- Lunch is on me.
- Go away!

328
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,160
In-rang, don't be angry anymore.

329
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,300
Should we order a bottle of soju?

330
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,400
Don't even think about it!
Soju, my butt.

331
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,730
We're broke
and we have no money for soju.

332
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,260
Empty out your pockets.

333
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,900
You wanted to buy soju with this?

334
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,700
There's barely enough
there to pay for our meals

335
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,800
and you wanted to buy soju?

336
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,460
Where are we going to sleep?

337
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,060
- What about you?
- I'm going home.

338
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,960
- Then what about me?
- You can come with me.

339
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,030
Your grandmother hates me.

340
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,600
No, she despises me.

341
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,100
In-rang, why are you
in such a hurry?

342
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,430
I'm in a hurry because we
have to find a place to sleep.

343
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,260
Are you abandoning me?

344
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,260
Wait for me!

345
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,230
I have to read all of this?

346
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,330
This and some more.
This is just the beginning.

347
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,230
There's so much
you have to study for.

348
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,860
Okay, where do you want to start?

349
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,560
Math first.

350
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,030
Not this one.

351
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,730
How about we start
with Korean first?

352
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,160
- Let's start with math first.
- Why ask then?

353
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,130
I can hear you. Sit up straight.

354
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,430
Okay.

355
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,830
Let's see here.

356
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,460
My stomach is killing me.
I need to go to the bathroom.

357
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,230
Ghosts don't need
to go to the bathroom.

358
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,230
Ah, my head hurts so much. Hold on.

359
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,030
Stop stalling.
You're the one who wanted to study.

360
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,160
- Let's do it properly.
- Okay.

361
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,730
This is easy enough.
Go ahead and solve it.

362
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,800
So, if the limit is A to B for
this equation, then GX equals B.

363
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,600
Then GX...

364
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,860
Are you sleeping?

365
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,230
She didn't solve a single problem.

366
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,160
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji. Hey.

367
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,330
Let's just pick a random place.
How far are we going to walk?

368
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,130
This place is willing to give us
50 percent off. We have no choice!

369
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,160
We're almost there.

370
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,500
It's over there!
Over there, over there!

371
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,260
(Bulgama Sauna)

372
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,700
That's the place.

373
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,800
Here you go.

374
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,660
Goodness, why do you
have so much stuff?

375
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,100
I'll keep it in storage
without charging extra.

376
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,300
- Just rest comfortably.
- Thank you!

377
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
Thank you so much!

378
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,630
Sure, let me take that.
Oh my goodness.

379
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,860
- This too.
- This as well?

380
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,930
Sure.

381
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,600
- Please, rest up.
- Thank you.

382
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,060
Wow.

383
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,500
The owner is friendly
and the place is very nice.

384
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,600
But why is there no one here?

385
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,360
It's better for us.

386
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,060
It's all ours.

387
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,560
- Let's go break a sweat!
- Sounds good.

388
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,130
Sounds good,
sounds good, sounds good.

389
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,900
I'm melting. I'm melting.

390
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,530
Hot, hot, it's very hot.

391
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,700
Chun-sang, how much longer
do we need to live like this?

392
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,830
Well, it's about tomorrow, isn't it?

393
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,060
Think about it tomorrow.

394
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,360
Okay.

395
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,600
- Let's sleep.
- Let's do that.

396
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,560
Let's think about it tomorrow.

397
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,060
I wasn't expecting
a text from anybody.

398
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,360
Seniors, if this is how you handle
things, we may have a problem.

399
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,430
- It's from Bong-pal.
- Of course, it's from him.

400
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,730
What did he say?

401
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,860
- He is asking for money.
- Wow, he won't give up, will he?

402
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,800
He's seriously persistent.

403
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,830
- What should we do?
- Give it to me.

404
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,730
- I don't know. Let's sleep.
- I mean...

405
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,230
Then I will sleep, too.
I don't know either.

406
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,060
In-rang...

407
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,400
In-rang!

408
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,000
What is it? What?

409
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,660
Please open the door!

410
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,700
Is this locked?

411
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,960
It's open now.
What was that about?

412
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,360
What is it?

413
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,300
- Are you up?
- Yes.

414
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,930
By the way, why was I sleeping here?

415
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,300
What do you mean?
You fell asleep there.

416
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Did I do that?

417
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,960
Gosh, why didn't you wake me up?

418
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,860
I tried, but you wouldn't wake up.

419
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,900
Then you should've moved
me to the sofa at least.

420
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,000
How could you let
a woman sleep like this?

421
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,630
You're very heavy.

422
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,560
I can't throw my back out
because of you.

423
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Ugh.

424
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,530
Ugh! He's such a jerk!

425
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,230
Wait, it's open.

426
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,560
Bong-pal told me not to go in...

427
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,360
Wow, why is there
so much stuff in here?

428
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,230
Hong Myung-hee?
Who could that be?

429
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,830
Wow, these shoes
may fit me perfectly.

430
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,130
- Hey, what are you doing in here?
- Bong-pal.

431
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,030
Whose shoes are these?
Can you burn them for me?

432
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,830
I told you not to come in here.

433
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,960
Who gave you permission
to touch this stuff?!

434
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,330
- Well, I was just...
- You!

435
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,730
You're a ghost.

436
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,530
So stop acting like a human.

437
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,199
Why is he all mad like that?

438
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,760
What did I do that was so wrong?

439
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,130
Oh my goodness...

440
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,760
Here. Are you okay?

441
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,100
Gosh, I keep seeing ghosts.

442
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,800
Is that because
I'm cursed this year?

443
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,300
Chun-sang, take a look at this.

444
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,260
There was a reason
why that place was cheap.

445
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,400
This man died in there a month ago.

446
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,260
(A Man in His 50s Dies at a Sauna)

447
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,800
That place was known to be haunted.

448
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,000
- You took me to such a place, huh?
- I didn't know that.

449
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,530
Anyway, they performed a very
expensive exorcism there and all.

450
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,300
Gosh, even with an exorcism,
they still have ghosts.

451
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,400
They wasted that money.
They should've just given it to us.

452
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,100
I agree.

453
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,030
Let's find
an empty classroom to sleep in.

454
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,360
- Are you that sleepy?
- Yes.

455
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,100
Gosh, it's still off?

456
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,360
Seriously, guys...

457
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,600
- What is it?
- It's Bong-pal.

458
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,600
Seniors!

459
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,360
Senior In-rang!

460
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,500
It's not that we're trying
not to pay you.

461
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,400
- It may take a little bit of time.
- For how long?

462
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,160
- Two months.
- Two days.

463
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,130
That's right, two days.

464
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,260
How are we supposed to come up
with money like that in two days?

465
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,900
We can pay you back in two days.

466
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,700
- How?
- It's a secret.

467
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,060
How?

468
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,930
I said it was a secret.

469
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,260
Gosh, she might not have had lunch yet.

470
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,930
So hungry...

471
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,500
Bong-pal must be
having lunch by now.

472
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,660
Should I go over to the school?

473
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,460
You are a ghost.

474
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,360
So stop acting like a human.

475
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,330
I already know that I'm a ghost.

476
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,100
(Bulgama Sauna)

477
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,930
Did we really have to
dress up like this?

478
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,900
If we're going to do it,
we should do it right.

479
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,830
Let's go!

480
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,200
(Temporarily Closed)

481
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,600
Are you having a hard time
because of a ghost?

482
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,230
Was your exorcism unsuccessful?

483
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:01,930
We will…
take care of that problem.

484
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,630
Ah, it's Bong-pal.

485
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:39,960
Why didn't you turn the lights on?
Why are you sitting in the dark?

486
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,730
So what if it's dark?

487
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,260
I'm not human, just a ghost.

488
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,060
- Aren't you hungry?
- So what?

489
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,360
It's not like ghosts
can starve to death.

490
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,760
Why does
this pork belly look so good?

491
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,330
Should I make bulgogi
with this meat?

492
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,130
It will be so good...

493
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,130
Wow, I'm full.

494
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,200
I will do the dishes tomorrow.

495
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,100
(Byeolnim Animal Clinic)

496
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,900
I knew it.

497
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,360
Take a look at this. Gosh.

498
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,060
The sale volume is definitely low
compared to his previous clinic.

499
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,860
Wasn't his clinic
in the Gangnam area?

500
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,460
That's correct.

501
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,300
We were very busy then.

502
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,530
It's like a paradise there.

503
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,660
Then why did he start
this clinic all of a sudden?

504
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,660
It isn't doing well in this area.

505
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,630
All of a sudden, he sold
his clinic and came here.

506
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,000
He finally accepted the offer
to become a professor.

507
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Either way, he's so cool
and I like it here.

508
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,630
Come on. Hurry up.

509
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,160
- Good work today.
- Are you going somewhere, sir?

510
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,460
Yes, I need to stop by somewhere.

511
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,660
Wrap things up and go home.

512
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,460
- We will. Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

513
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,160
I'm going to go on ahead.

514
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,100
Hello? Now?

515
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,700
Yum, I enjoyed the meal.

516
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,160
Yeah, I'm full.

517
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,730
- I'm off.
- Are you?

518
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,660
- To where?
- To meet my seniors.

519
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,400
Your seniors?

520
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,160
- Oh, they're going to pay you?
- Yes.

521
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,860
- Shall I come with you?
- Whatever.

522
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,800
Shall we have something to drink
first before we begin?

523
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,460
Here.

524
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:38,130
Bong-pal, drink.

525
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,300
No thanks.

526
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,700
You're not going to pay me in cash.

527
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,000
If I get rid of the ghost there...

528
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,660
You will take $1,500
from the reward money.

529
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:51,960
It's like a win-win situation.

530
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,400
$3,000!

531
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,860
Sit back down first. Have a seat.

532
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:05,200
And you come with me.

533
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,260
What are you doing?

534
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,130
I just wanted to taste it.

535
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,430
- I've always been curious.
- Put it down, will you?

536
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,400
You're not old enough to drink.

537
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,460
Fine.

538
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Hey!

539
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,630
We were promised $4,000 for the job.

540
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,300
If we give him three, we lose money.

541
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,060
Plus, the expenses
to fix the room and camera.

542
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,630
Then what are you going to tell
the owner of the sauna, huh?

543
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,700
Are you going to catch
the ghost yourself?

544
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,400
Do you want me to die?

545
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,900
Do you want me
to get ripped to pieces?

546
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,430
That's what I was saying...

547
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,500
So three?

548
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
Hey.

549
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:55,030
Wow, woo-hoo!

550
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,430
So let's make a deal. $3,000.

551
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,960
Come on.

552
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,530
$3,500 it is then.

553
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,500
- We'll suffer a big loss.
- I agree.

554
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,630
Deal!

555
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,430
What exactly is the job?

556
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,430
So the job is...

557
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,460
(Bulgama Sauna)

558
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,930
You said you're
going to do it tomorrow.

559
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,260
Today... we're doing
a spot inspection only.

560
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,260
We want to be prepared
for tomorrow and all...

561
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:57,060
Then is he the exorcist?

562
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,300
He's not old enough and
just look at the way he's dressed.

563
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,530
Are you a student?

564
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,630
He's not the exorcist.

565
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,100
He's our cute office assistant.

566
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,530
He wanted to see
how our jobs are done.

567
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,530
So we brought him with us today.

568
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,360
- Didn't we, Pal?
- Sure.

569
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:22,200
Then look around and give me a call.

570
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,230
- Please, take care of it.
- We will, sir.

571
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,800
Trust us and let us handle it.

572
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,600
Should we have him
fitted for a suit, too?

573
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,230
It doesn't matter how he dresses.

574
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,660
As long as he
can catch ghosts, right?

575
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,560
I agree.

576
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,030
- He's not in there?
- No, he isn't.

577
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,830
Where did she go?

578
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,430
- I'm here.
- Me too.

579
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,630
Never mind.

580
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,330
Did someone die in here?

581
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,130
He was a man in his fifties.

582
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,800
According to the owner,
he was a regular.

583
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,800
He might have been
a lowlife scumbag.

584
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,160
You know, those who try
to grab women and such.

585
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,030
They try to touch…
you know, a pervert.

586
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,260
What's going on?

587
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,000
Hey, where are you going?

588
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,160
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

589
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,500
There is a ghost.

590
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:50,500
That bastard...

591
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,100
- He's strong.
- Bong-pal!

592
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,530
Why are they going
around and around?

593
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,860
His chest!

594
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,530
Attack his chest!

595
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,030
What took you so long?

596
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,430
Is it over?

597
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,460
Good work.

598
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,030
Hello?

599
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,460
Can you hear me?

600
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,930
Cheer up, baby. Cheer up, baby.

601
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,800
Cheer up a bit.

602
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,760
Bong-pal, watch this, okay?

603
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,130
It's very rare to see a drunk ghost.

604
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,600
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji.

605
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,660
You're drunk.

606
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,730
I'm not drunk.

607
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,330
See? I'm perfectly fine.

608
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,630
My Bong-pal...

609
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,800
Why are you so ugly, huh?

610
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You're so ugly.

611
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,600
What do you mean you're not drunk?
You can't even stand straight.

612
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,330
What? Who can't? Me?

613
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,360
No way.
I can walk just fine like this.

614
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,330
Watch me, okay? Watch me.

615
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,830
I can walk from here to there.

616
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,130
I walk just fine, right?

617
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,760
I can even teleport better now.

618
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,800
Watch me. See?

619
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,060
Ouch. It hurts.

620
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,000
I knew it.

621
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,630
What are you doing? Get up.

622
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,600
Bong-pal, I'm hurt.

623
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,300
- Get up so we can go home.
- I'm not going.

624
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,760
I'm not going home.

625
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,560
Fine then. Stay here all night.

626
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,400
Fine, you bastard.

627
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,230
I will live here from now on.

628
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,960
I'm not going to sleep tonight!

629
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:05,500
Hey, you...

630
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,400
You can't do this to me.

631
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,460
Come here so I can hit you.

632
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,200
You dodged?

633
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,760
Don't you dare move.

634
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,300
Why are you doing this?
Look at you.

635
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,930
How can a ghost
be such a messy drunk?

636
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,960
Why not?

637
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,600
What? Are ghosts not allowed
to be messy drunks?

638
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,960
Are ghosts not allowed
to want to wear pretty things?

639
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:46,760
Ghosts can't act human?!

640
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,760
When I'm just a ghost.

641
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,400
When I'm just a ghost...

642
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:08,600
Don't say that anymore.

643
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,000
Do you think I died
because I wanted to?

644
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,100
I don't even know why I died…

645
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,330
how I died…

646
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,930
I don't like being a ghost either.

647
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,360
I don't like it either.

648
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:49,900
It's not like I became one
because I wanted to.

649
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,500
Ghosts
get their feelings, too, you know.

650
00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,000
You're a bastard.

651
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,130
I don't even know what I'm doing.

652
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,930
- Bong-pal!
- Hey.

653
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,500
Hey!

654
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,600
Oh my, you're so pretty.

655
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:39,230
Gosh, how can a ghost be so heavy?

656
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,230
What? How can I be heavy?

657
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,960
I'm so light. I must be light.

658
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:50,160
I'm as light as a feather.

659
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,530
Let's go home now!

660
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,000
Ms. Noh Hyun-joo.

661
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,960
Who's there?

662
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
Professor Ju.

663
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,760
You're getting home late.

664
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,360
What brings you here?

665
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:37,660
I had something
I wanted to ask you.

666
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,560
What is it?

667
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:54,360
Where did you find this?

668
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:14,830
Wow, this neighborhood
is very quiet.

669
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,060
Not many people are here.

670
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,160
(Bring it on, Ghost)

671
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,960
The best way to have
Bong-pal join our club is…

672
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,100
Blood sausage soup!

673
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,500
I have no idea what you're saying.

674
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,030
- Do you want to do it with me?
- I'd love to.

675
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,500
In front of her,
you even blush and smile.

676
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,800
You know the thumping noise...

677
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,200
So the tenants
downstairs went up there.

678
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:40,960
- Running away...
- From whom?

679
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:44,460
- Master Bong-pal?
- He's very well known in the field.

680
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,700
Bong-pal.

681
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,400
Where do your parents live?

682
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,200
Have you talked
to your father recently?

683
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,000
Why do you ask that?

684
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,130
Where did he get mud on his shoes?

685
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,230
- Hyun-ji.
- Yes?
