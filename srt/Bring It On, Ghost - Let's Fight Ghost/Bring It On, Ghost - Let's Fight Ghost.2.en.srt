1
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,900
I see ghosts and I can beat them up.

2
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,730
Seven girls fainted
not too long ago.

3
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,030
Seoyi Girls' High School.
Can you get rid of a ghost?

4
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,300
- I will pay you $10,000.
- Deal! Deal!

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,030
Let's fight! Ghost!

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,830
Do you want to die, huh?
Do you want to die?

7
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,530
You've never kissed a guy before?

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,330
That was my first kiss, you bastard!

9
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
He used to be in such demand.
What happened to him?

10
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,700
It must be a little kid.

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,930
He's not a teacher!
He's a pervert!

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,030
You perverted bastard!

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,560
- Give me my $10,000!
- I don't have it!

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,930
Don't ever appear before
me again or you're dead!

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,730
You're an elite college student?

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,330
Park Bong-pal.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,360
Mom, over here!

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,729
- Bong-pal!
- Mom!

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,530
Honey!

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,360
Mom.

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
Bong-pal.

22
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,960
Why don't you ever
play with your friends?

23
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,160
You're always playing by
yourself in the corner.

24
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,700
Let's go.

25
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,360
Look.

26
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,360
It's so much fun if you
play with your friends.

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,100
The moogoonghwa flowers
have bloomed!

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,260
The moogoonghwa flowers
have bloomed!

29
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,600
The moogoonghwa flowers
have bloomed!

30
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,360
The moogoonghwa flowers
have bloomed!

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,860
I was wrong! I'm sorry, lady!

32
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,300
Please, forgive me! I'm sorry!

33
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
I'm sorry, lady!
Please, forgive me!

34
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,660
I was wrong! I'm sorry, lady!

35
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,700
Please, forgive me!

36
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,800
What has he been up to all night?
Why is he just coming in?

37
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,600
Hey.

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,560
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for a long time.

39
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,360
What's with you?
How did you know to come here?

40
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,659
Did you forget?
I'm a ghost.

41
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,600
So why did you come here?

42
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:51,130
I just need to confirm one thing
so just hold on, okay?

43
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,960
- What are you doing?
- Just hold still for a second.

44
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,430
- It's too early for these antics!
- Hey!

45
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,660
- What?
- I need to check something, okay?

46
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,360
Give me a break and what's
with that rude tone?

47
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,159
You're obviously
way younger than me.

48
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,430
Thanks for thinking that I'm young,
but I died 5 years ago.

49
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,100
You're just a college sophmore.
I'm clearly older than you.

50
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,460
You're older than me?

51
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,159
Forget it. What could I possibly
talk to you about?

52
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm tired. Go away.

53
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,860
It's true.

54
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,460
Ah, I forgot.

55
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,800
What's this?

56
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,000
Ta-da.

57
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,330
Who said you could come in here?

58
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,760
You could just thank me.

59
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,700
Thank you very much.
Now, please, leave.

60
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,159
You're actually quite
tidier than you look.

61
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,260
Please, go. Go.

62
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,200
So please, do me this favor.

63
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,360
It's not hard to do. All you have
to do is just close your eyes.

64
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,000
Forget it. You're not the only
ghost who has followed

65
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,600
me around like this.

66
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,830
I don't know what you're up to,
but look for someone else.

67
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you want me to introduce
you to someone?

68
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,830
All I need is you.

69
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,860
Help me out just this once!
Please? Please? Come on!

70
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,060
No! No! No!

71
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,800
And you're pretty
shameless for a ghost.

72
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,360
You didn't even pay me my $10,000.

73
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,200
Can't believe you're upset
over a measly $10,000.

74
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,000
A measly... a measly $10,000?

75
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,799
I know I left a talisman that
exorcised ghosts in here somewhere…

76
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,700
Here it is.

77
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,960
Take this!

78
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,860
Don't touch that. Warranty won't
cover it if you break it.

79
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,860
We lost everything else so let's
at least be careful with that.

80
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,960
Should we just
get the warranty to fix it?

81
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,900
Chun-sang!
Chun-sang, I found it! I found it!

82
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,660
Wow! I was right, wasn't I?
He just hit a ghost, right?

83
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,500
- We didn't see wrong, right?
- I think so. I'm not sure.

84
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm right!
That's a ghost right there!

85
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,900
- You saw it, too.
- Right, I did see it.

86
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,000
This guy can really see ghosts.

87
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,960
He threw a solid punch
right to that ghost's face.

88
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,030
Wow, our junior is no joke!

89
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,930
But Chun-sang,
we saw the ghost, too.

90
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,030
What's the matter with you?
That was a silver code!

91
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,460
Oh yeah... silver code?

92
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,600
When a person is in the grips of
terror, they can see the ghost.

93
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,430
The moment where that ghost and you
connect is called the silver code.

94
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,760
- Ah, silver code!
- Are you not going to study?

95
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,400
Are you the vice president
of this club or not?

96
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,900
I am.

97
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,700
The thing is, our junior isn't
seeing ghosts with the silver code.

98
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,600
Look.
He's staring right at the ghost.

99
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,630
That's why he can fight
against the ghosts!

100
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Wow!
Wow, I really want to recruit him.

101
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,460
Hey, does he go to our school?

102
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,000
Hurry up and find him.
We can't lose him! Find him!

103
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,530
- Already?
- Yes.

104
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,200
Sophmore economics major,
Park Bong-pal.

105
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,430
- Hello!
- Hey there!

106
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,830
He's so cool. Now that is what
a man is supposed to look like.

107
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,600
What are you? A squid?

108
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,160
Hey, you should get a dog, too.

109
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,430
What is this? You look sad
and pathetic eating alone.

110
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,900
Dog, my butt.

111
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,830
You're so rude.

112
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,430
It's just how I am.

113
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,730
I love rolled eggs!

114
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,260
Go and buy some for yourself.

115
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,500
Come to think of it, you keep
forgetting that I'm a ghost.

116
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,460
How am I supposed to
buy it? I can't!

117
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,960
Ghosts can only eat food
that is set out for them.

118
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,560
Haven't you done
ancestral rites before?

119
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,960
Oh.

120
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,300
Now that you know, set out
a piece of that egg and rice ball.

121
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,830
Oh, sure. Here. Here you go.

122
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,460
Seriously, it's so good.

123
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,030
- Gosh, you're eating alone again.
- How sad.

124
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,900
Let's formally introduce ourselves.

125
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,100
I'm a junior physical education
major and my name is Choi Chun-sang.

126
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,160
I'm Choi Chun-sang...

127
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,500
And this is...

128
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm a junior computer science
major and my name is Kim In-rang.

129
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,930
- And?
- And...

130
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,300
And…?

131
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,730
Didn't we overcome that terror
together the other day, my brother?

132
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,860
We saw it. We saw your courageous
battle against that ghost!

133
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,160
So...

134
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,230
How about we do this together?

135
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,530
Let's destroy
this darkness together!

136
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,230
I don't want to.

137
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
- He's stubborn.
- He's tough.

138
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,130
That was refreshing.

139
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,430
- You're sweating.
- Am I?

140
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,630
Yes.

141
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,030
Wow, there are
a lot of students in here.

142
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
My attendance list has 22 students,
but I see the waitlisted ones

143
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,000
are here, too.

144
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,300
Yes.

145
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,000
My class won't be fun. I think
your expectations are too high.

146
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,130
I'll introduce myself first.

147
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,860
Due to personal reasons,
Prof. Lee Ji-sung will no longer be

148
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,100
teaching this class,
Animals and Society.

149
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,330
Therefore, I will be taking over
for the rest of the semester.

150
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm Ju Hye-sung, a veterinary
professor at this school.

151
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,200
It's nice to meet you.

152
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,430
Professor, you were
totally cool earlier.

153
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,530
Is your hand okay? It doesn't hurt?

154
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,760
Yes, I'm fine.

155
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,200
I feel like I've become
a celebrity all of a sudden.

156
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,860
It's a bit embarrassing.

157
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,900
Okay, let's start class.

158
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,460
The enrolled students
might be distracted so I must ask

159
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,600
the rest of you to leave please.

160
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,860
I'll see you guys next semester.

161
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,100
Yes, 22 students is the perfect
size for a class, don't you think?

162
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,230
I'm going to take attendance.

163
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,830
- Noh Hyun-joo.
- Here.

164
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,230
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,000
- Park Bong-pal.
- Here.

166
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,030
- Im Seo-yeon.
- Here.

167
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,000
It's nice to meet you.

168
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,660
Jung Shi-ah.

169
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,560
- Here.
- Are you happy?

170
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, she's pretty.

171
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,460
You like girls like Im Seo-yeon?
All gentle and willowy.

172
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,730
Please, go!

173
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,330
- Do you have nowhere to go?
- No, I don't.

174
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,130
You're seriously driving me crazy!

175
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,660
You, over there.

176
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,460
Mr. Park Bong-pal.

177
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,330
- Yes?
- Is there a problem?

178
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,600
No, I'm sorry.

179
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,460
Okay, let's continue.

180
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,560
Na Jin-soo.

181
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,200
Here.

182
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,600
It's nice to meet you.

183
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,760
It's been a week
and the ranking... oh my god!

184
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,930
We're dropping like crazy!
Why is Sadako posting so many

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,960
negative comments?

186
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,930
I don't think we'll even be able
to pay for the maintenance fees.

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,330
You scared me.

188
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,960
What are we to do then? Don't you
know how expensive that thing is?

189
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,200
Is anyone inside?
I'm from the housing agency.

190
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:34,060
I know you're inside. Please, vacate
the room by next week.

191
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,400
If you don't, we'll have no choice
but to break in. Understood?

192
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:53,100
- So what are we going to do now?
- What can we do?

193
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,400
We have to use any means
necessary to recruit Park Bong-pal.

194
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,760
Don't you think that will be tough?

195
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,930
It seems like he's not very
close to his colleagues either.

196
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,300
Is he being ostracized?

197
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,700
I think he's the one
who's ostracizing them.

198
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,500
A lone ranger in this lonely world.
He's definitely the person

199
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,500
we're looking for.

200
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:18,000
Just stick to him like glue
no matter what. He's our savior.

201
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,530
If we keep following,
we might be able to take

202
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,030
a picture of a real ghost.

203
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,630
Once that happens...

204
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,530
The money and fame will
be falling from the skies.

205
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,460
Our popularity will go up.

206
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,360
And we'll have so many new
members joining our club.

207
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,230
- Among those members...
- Tons of them will be girls.

208
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,760
- They cut off the electricity.
- It's so dark.

209
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,060
- First class was great.
- Thank you.

210
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,230
The first class is always hard.

211
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,100
Ah, I hear there is a student that
helps with this class. Who is it?

212
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,860
It's me.

213
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,800
- Im Seo-yeon?
- Yes.

214
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,700
I'm sure it will tough preparing
the lecture by yourself.

215
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,600
Is anyone willing to help out?

216
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,330
Here.

217
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,730
Park Bong-pal?

218
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,230
Then please go ahead
and help Im Seo-yeon out.

219
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,730
See you all next time. Good job.

220
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you.

221
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,730
You're a junior in my department?
Sophmore economics major?

222
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,760
- Yes.
- I don't think you know me…

223
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,060
- although we have the same major.
- He knows you very well!

224
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:00,330
I don't really attend
the department events.

225
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,530
Liar.

226
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm Im Seo-yeon.
Senior economics major.

227
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,260
Yes, it's nice to meet you.

228
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,900
Great, I look forward
to working with you.

229
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,700
Yes.

230
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,560
It's all because of me.
Don't forget it.

231
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,260
You know you like it!

232
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,130
Eat slowly. You eat so well.

233
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,060
You must have been very hungry.

234
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,930
Professor, I was looking for you.

235
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,200
What for?

236
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,360
The previous professor asked
me to take care of this file.

237
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,200
I don't know what to do with it.

238
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,360
You can give it to me,
I'll give it to him.

239
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,160
Thank you.

240
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,930
Hey, eat slowly.

241
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,760
Isn't he the dog that bit your hand?

242
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,930
You're quite famous, aren't you?
You're famous for being evil.

243
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,360
He's so cute.
Are you going to raise him now?

244
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,700
No, I'm keeping him temporarily
until the owner comes for him.

245
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,500
If not, then I'm going to take
him to the hospital tomorrow.

246
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,930
Yes, this is Ju Hye-sung.

247
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,630
Professor, it's two
hours before the seminar.

248
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,900
You're not in the waiting
room. Where are you?

249
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,060
Ah, I'm at the school right now.
I'm sorry, I'll leave right now.

250
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,200
Yes.

251
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm sorry, but if you're free, can
you watch over him until he's done?

252
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,830
There's medicine mixed inside
so he has to eat all of it.

253
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,200
- You just have to watch him.
- Okay.

254
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,860
- Thank you.
- Sure.

255
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,800
You have to eat all of it, okay?

256
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,430
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

257
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,660
No, I took the afternoon off.

258
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,930
I'm going to go see a doctor.

259
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,800
My shoulders feel so stiff.
I might get a physical exam.

260
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:20,100
Honey, your skin is so great!

261
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,500
- Kyung-ja!
- Hyun-ji, what are you doing here?

262
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
- I'm following someone.
- Who?

263
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,030
He's... I'll tell you later.
See you soon.

264
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,860
Bye!

265
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,830
Honey!

266
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,830
Taxi! Taxi! Oh my, honey!

267
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,000
It's crazy hot.
Why are you working out so hard?

268
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,630
You're working really hard
to catch those ghosts…

269
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,000
Shut up and leave!

270
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,730
It's better to work out together.

271
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,160
Who's working out together?

272
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,330
Stop playing and come down.

273
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,630
Gosh, you're pretty weak for a guy.

274
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,960
That's why you're
always getting beaten up.

275
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,360
- Besides, I'm so light.
- Yeah right. Come down!

276
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,200
Hey, aren't you hungry?
I'm hungry.

277
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,500
Let's go down and order some
fried chicken! What do you think?

278
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,900
That sounds so good!
Chicken! Chicken!

279
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,930
Chicken! Chicken! Chicken!

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,900
- Hey!
- Chicken!

281
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,960
Hey!

282
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,500
- Hey!
- Catch me if you can!

283
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,700
- I swear!
- Come and get me!

284
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,400
My goodness, that poor soul.

285
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,560
- What a pity!
- Someone died over there again.

286
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,300
- Where? At Gampo's?
- Yes.

287
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,200
I'm sure he died because of
the ghost that haunts that place!

288
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,260
You know, that girl who came from
the coffee shop a long time ago.

289
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,360
- Eun-shil?
- Yes, Eun-shil!

290
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,530
They discovered her
dead body in the wardrobe.

291
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,960
That wretched husband of
hers beat her to death.

292
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,400
Right, and ever since,
people have been dying there!

293
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,060
Her husband got stabbed
there and died, too.

294
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,800
- It serves him right!
- Exactly.

295
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,130
Oh my gosh! Who are you?

296
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,260
Where is this Gampo place?

297
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,800
That way!

298
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,360
Goodness, you scared me.

299
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,600
- The head is the best part.
- Oh my gosh.

300
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,500
- Who is he?
- I have no idea.

301
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,000
Seriously, who is he?

302
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm telling you it's fine!
What's wrong with all of you?

303
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,600
Goodness, what is going on here?

304
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,260
Goodness, I'm so sorry!

305
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,330
No, it's quite alright.

306
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
- Are you Monk Myung-chul?
- Yes.

307
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:31,060
- I'm Monk Myung-chul.
- What took you so long?

308
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,400
Please, come inside.

309
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Goodness, the energy of this place!

310
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,460
So this is where the person died.

311
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,860
- And it was yesterday?
- Yes, that's correct!

312
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:00,900
How did you know that?
They said you're not what you…

313
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,430
No, you're very admirable.

314
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,330
Anyway, something
always bad happens in there.

315
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,530
Rumors are spreading
and I'm so upset!

316
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,860
Sir, I'll leave it up to you.

317
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,660
I understand. Let's see here.

318
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,430
- What is that?
- Do you see something?

319
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,230
I feel a menacing energy.

320
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,000
I feel a woman's energy.

321
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,700
There's a story, too.

322
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,660
Her name is... Eun-shil?

323
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,930
- Eun-shil?
- Is she in there?

324
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,100
- You can see that, too?
- Hush!

325
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,960
You can take care of this, right?

326
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,430
It's simple.

327
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,730
Just in case, please step back.

328
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Yes.

329
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,530
Lady! Lady, call the shaman!
Call the shaman!

330
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,900
Lady! Lady!

331
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,560
Doctor, you're here.

332
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,830
Oh my, who is this?

333
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,930
He's a new member of the family.
Please give him some vitamins.

334
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,330
You're a little late.

335
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,230
I had to stop by
the school because of him.

336
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,530
- Is the operating room ready?
- Yes.

337
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,100
- I'm going to get changed.
- Okay.

338
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,160
At this rate, we're going to
end up being an animal sanctuary

339
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,730
instead of a veterinary clinic.

340
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,730
We're spending more money on
food than on medical supplies.

341
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,830
What if we're out
of a job at this rate?

342
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,960
I know.

343
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,560
Come here. Goodness.

344
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,030
You're so adorable.
Where did you come from?

345
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,360
Bong-pal, wait for me!

346
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,130
Just that one...

347
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,060
Hey, please, give me one bite!

348
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:10,200
Look at that over there.
It's going fast.

349
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,500
I want to ride that, too.

350
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,730
Can you make kimchi stew
instead of bean paste stew?

351
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,630
I have a knife in my hand
so be quiet.

352
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,360
Kimchi stew and rolled eggs, please?

353
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,800
Can you please, go away?

354
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,200
Can't you go home
and whine there? Why me?

355
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,030
I said I had nowhere to go.

356
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,030
I don't remember my home or my mom.

357
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I don't know why I died, either.

358
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,400
That's why I've been stealing food
from memorial services for others.

359
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,930
Do you know how sad that is?

360
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,330
This one time, I got bitten
by a dog at this house.

361
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,830
Don't you feel bad for me?

362
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,260
Have you changed your strategy?

363
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,700
I don't feel bad for you at all.

364
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,600
Bong-pal.

365
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,100
Now you really need to go.

366
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,030
He may be a useless monk now,
but he used to be really good.

367
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,960
I don't know
what he might do to you.

368
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,630
Gosh.

369
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,430
I thought you'd be away
for a few more days.

370
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,130
Here is a present for you.

371
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
What happened to your face?

372
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,830
Well, I have my reasons.

373
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,430
I may have to stay with you
for a few more days.

374
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,730
I'm sensing a strange energy here.

375
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,560
Oh, it was this…

376
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,600
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

377
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
Sure.

378
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,830
Have a seat.

379
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,430
You're not even a kid.

380
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,260
Why did your face get all beaten up?

381
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,000
This sausage tastes good.

382
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,900
Bong-pal.

383
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,100
I wish you
wouldn't do that… Exorcisms.

384
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,230
It's not something
you should consider lightly.

385
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,159
Then, can you lend me some money?

386
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,330
About $900,000?

387
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,030
Let's just eat.

388
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,630
Can I have some of that, too?

389
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,659
Where are you going
in the middle of dinner?

390
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,659
I want to grill more sausage.

391
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,900
- We have plenty left here.
- It's not for you.

392
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,659
There is a stray cat around here.

393
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,460
What kind of stray cat
comes up to the fourth floor?

394
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,100
There is this naughty stray cat.

395
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,530
Make a lot. A lot.

396
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,330
What shall we eat?
I'm all happy now.

397
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,000
Doctor Ju, we're done for the day.

398
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,830
We will see you tomorrow.

399
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,400
Sure, have a good evening.

400
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,700
I will wrap up here, go on ahead.

401
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,500
- Okay.
- Have a good night.

402
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,360
- Get home safely.
- We will.

403
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's see...

404
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,860
Oh my. You're the one I saw
at school, aren't you?

405
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,430
How can you be this cute?

406
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,530
What brings you here?

407
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,400
I didn't know
this was your animal hospital.

408
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:13,160
- You live nearby, huh?
- Yes.

409
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,600
Ah, thank you for
what you did yesterday.

410
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,830
No problem. It was nothing.

411
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,600
By the way, you haven't
found its owner yet, huh?

412
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,860
Ah...

413
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,760
Not yet.
We have to find him someone nice.

414
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,530
By the way, can you keep this place
a secret from other students?

415
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,500
Sure.

416
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,130
I should get going.

417
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,100
Get home safely.

418
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,430
Gosh, why does he sleep like that?

419
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,560
Oh, this must be him, huh?

420
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,800
These are his parents?

421
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,360
Why does he live alone then?

422
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,160
Wow, he's very frugal.

423
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,830
He's so precise.

424
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,930
This is why
he doesn't give me a chance.

425
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,060
I need a chance to confirm…

426
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,600
A chance?

427
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,800
Okay. They're not lips.

428
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,000
That's blood sausage.
Blood sausage.

429
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Oh my goodness!
You scared me.

430
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,230
What was that?
What did you just do to me?

431
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,500
What do you mean?

432
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,800
You!

433
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,860
- Did you just step on me?
- It was the stray cat.

434
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,230
The stray cat?

435
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,900
The cat must have a lot of karma.

436
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,160
Meow.

437
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,430
Meow.

438
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,060
Oh my, I must have gotten hit badly.

439
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,260
This is going to sting for a while…

440
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,930
Did he check the message or not?

441
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,460
How come he's not responding?

442
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,760
Bong-pal.

443
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,460
Did you read
the last letter from your dad?

444
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,160
What did it say?

445
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,860
- I have no idea.
- Didn't you read it?

446
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,660
Hurry up and read it.

447
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,560
- I threw it away.
- Why did you do that?

448
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,260
You don't care about what
your dad is up to and where he is?

449
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,460
Not really.

450
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,560
That punk... why did he
have to throw it away?

451
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,100
He's just like his dad, seriously.

452
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,130
Excuse me.

453
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,960
What are you doing?

454
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,260
I threw away something by accident.

455
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,560
- You're trying to steal this box!
- No.

456
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,430
The company we have a contract
with is picking this all up.

457
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,000
You can't steal them. They've been
disappearing for a few days now.

458
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,530
I'm not trying to steal them.
I was just looking for…

459
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,300
Mister,
even if it's hard to get by...

460
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,530
you should work to
make a living, not this.

461
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,660
You shouldn't try
to get things for free.

462
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,960
I do work.
Actually, I live in Unit 402.

463
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,260
The boy threw away something
by accident and I'm here to get it.

464
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,060
You keep on lying.

465
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,030
It's been ages since someone
has lived in Unit 402.

466
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,130
This tall good-looking boy
lives in Unit 402.

467
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,760
I've lived in this apartment
building for 10 years!

468
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:46,730
Stop lying. Just leave it and go.

469
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Mister, you keep losing hair because
you like free things so much!

470
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,630
Seriously, my goodness…

471
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,360
Why would you bring
my appearance into this?

472
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,560
- What else should I bring up then?
- You could just say nothing.

473
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,560
Oh my!
I told you to leave it, Mister.

474
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,700
I just need to find this letter.

475
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,260
I know you'll steal the box
while you pretend to do so.

476
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,800
- I'm not stealing!
- That's what you look like!

477
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,700
Leave it here! Oh my.

478
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,260
How dare you hold my hand!
You pervert!

479
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,960
I just lightly pushed you.
Why did you fall back like that?

480
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,960
Who are you?

481
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,430
I'm the president of
this apartment community.

482
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,000
You're the president.

483
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,630
We're trying to separate our trash.
Why get so worked up?

484
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,130
I didn't get all worked up.
I simply said I lived in Unit 402.

485
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,630
- You know the tall boy...
- Did she leave?

486
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,500
I was trying to
find this letter here...

487
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,100
She's nowhere to be seen.

488
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,760
I didn't see it. That's why...

489
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,100
The boy has been
living here for years.

490
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,660
I told him to say hi
to his neighbors and all...

491
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,960
He's been by himself.

492
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,400
Bong-pal.

493
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,130
- Hello.
- Off to a class?

494
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,830
Yes, microeconomics.

495
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,200
It's Professor Kang's class, huh?

496
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,400
It must be tough. Have fun.

497
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,200
- See you in class next week.
- Sure. Bye.

498
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

499
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,660
You're in a good mood, huh?

500
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,700
I was until I saw you.

501
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
What do you mean?
I'm happy to see you.

502
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,500
- How nice for you.
- Of course, it's a good thing.

503
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,000
You even have no shame, huh?

504
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,160
- I'm pretty, too.
- Don't kid yourself.

505
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,130
With your face? Absolutely not.

506
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,830
Go away so I can study.

507
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,460
He's starting to scare me.

508
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:45,530
He's talking to someone, right?

509
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,200
Yes, it seems like
he's talking to a ghost.

510
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,560
Wow.

511
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,060
I said, go away.

512
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,330
Hello.

513
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,830
This is Park Bong-pal.

514
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,160
Sure, I can do that.

515
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,160
Well, why don't I come by
in two hours then?

516
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,300
Okay then.

517
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,430
What is it?
Why are you happy all of a sudden?

518
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,200
I'm going to work now.
Don't follow me.

519
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,030
I'm coming.

520
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,730
Seriously!
I told you not to follow me!

521
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,800
Gosh.

522
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,030
Please, don't follow me.
I'm begging you, please.

523
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,700
Then why don't you
do me a favor first?

524
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Forget I said anything.

525
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,160
Chun-sang, he was just talking
to a ghost again, wasn't he?

526
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,260
I think so...

527
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,030
I got goosebumps all over,
but I like him.

528
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,500
- Let's go.
- Seriously. How does he do that?

529
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,400
Why didn't he fix
this broken washer?

530
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,130
He should fix
the broken doorbell, too.

531
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,130
Why doesn't he fix things? How lazy!

532
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,200
Wait, where did I leave my sword?

533
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,060
Did Bong-pal take it by any chance?

534
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,800
He wouldn't have taken it.

535
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,560
Oh my goodness.

536
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,460
It's there.

537
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,860
He's moving.

538
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,860
Why does he keep coming
to places like this? It's spooky.

539
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:28,130
Should we take one and start?

540
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,130
Shall we?

541
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,300
Well... here it is.

542
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,260
Let's go.

543
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,430
Oh my,
who do we have here? The exorcist?

544
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:45,700
What? Are you the exorcist I called?

545
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,530
- Correct. I'm Park Bong-pal.
- Well...

546
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,630
Aren't you too young
to do this kind of work?

547
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,230
You clearly look like a student.

548
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,030
Are you sure you can do this?

549
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,300
Buy yourself some clothes, will you?

550
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,200
You don't look convincing because
you go around looking like this.

551
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,730
You can trust me.

552
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,930
What if you take off with
the deposit like the monk yesterday?

553
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,900
I will find that monk
and kick his butt.

554
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,230
I'm totally different
from those con artists.

555
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,600
You can pay me after the job
is done so don't worry.

556
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,560
You can wire the money
after you confirm the job is done.

557
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,430
Okay then.
I like the way you do business.

558
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,660
Room One, over there.

559
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,730
I'm counting on you.

560
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,130
Now Ghostnet has returned.

561
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,930
Sorry that we're airing
this without any notice.

562
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,460
This has never been done in Korea.

563
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,230
The live broadcast begins now.

564
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,030
Follow, follow me.

565
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,100
What is this?

566
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,760
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Just keep rolling.

567
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,600
Go now.

568
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,060
Run away now! Hurry!

569
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,600
Want to die, huh?

570
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,930
Get in there, damn it!

571
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,260
Want to die, huh?

572
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,560
Get in there, damn it!

573
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,800
Gosh, it's even
scarier here at night.

574
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,060
What was I thinking?

575
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,230
I'm back here
because I left my sword behind.

576
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,160
Oh my.

577
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,300
Fine. I will come back
when the sun rises tomorrow morning.

578
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,860
He's fighting
with a ghost, isn't he?

579
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,400
It looks that way.

580
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,630
What a show!
Did they hire an actor for this?

581
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:48,600
He might win an Oscar.

582
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
How could they think this is a show?

583
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,200
Please, don't say
we're putting on a show.

584
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,160
We're actually filming a ghost now.

585
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,030
This is a live broadcast
so don't interrupt us.

586
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,200
We're scared to death right now.

587
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,560
What's happening?

588
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,230
Mister, you're dead!

589
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,060
- Are you okay?
- Yes, are you okay?

590
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,200
Yes.

591
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:58,260
I can't give it to you!

592
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,000
Bong-pal, attack his side!

593
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,960
Hey.

594
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:57,860
She was trapped here
because of that jerk earlier.

595
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,760
Bong-pal, you did well today.

596
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,930
You defeated an evil ghost
and sent her to a good place.

597
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,130
Come on, don't be shy.

598
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,960
Let's go.

599
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,230
Why is this here?

600
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:29,130
Hey.

601
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,260
This time and last time...

602
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,960
how did you know
the weaknesses of the ghost so well?

603
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:38,530
- You can see it?
- What if I can?

604
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,900
Do you want me to tell you how?

605
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:44,430
- Yes, please.
- I don't want to.

606
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,600
Hey, why do you keep
following me around?

607
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,730
- Do you like me or something?
- No way.

608
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,200
- Then... draining my energy?
- No way.

609
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,060
Then why do you keep
following me around like a puppy?

610
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,260
- I don't remember my past.
- You don't remember?

611
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,060
Ah, you mentioned you
didn't have memories last time.

612
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:15,400
- Is that true?
- Yes.

613
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,960
I don't remember anything…

614
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,830
why I died, where my home was,
and who my parents were.

615
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,730
But for the 1st time after 5 years,
I got a glimpse of a memory.

616
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,500
When you and I...

617
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,330
- You and I what?
- You know last time...

618
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,600
That's when I remembered…

619
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,760
That's why
I'm trying to do it again...

620
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,430
When and what did we do?

621
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,500
That thing from last time.

622
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,460
- Yeah, so what was it?
- Last time...

623
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,130
Gosh, just forget it.

624
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,700
I will help you with the exorcisms.

625
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,030
If you help me study,
I will pay you that $10,000.

626
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,830
- That's my ID.
- So many negative comments.

627
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,400
No! Don't come any closer!

628
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,160
No!

629
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:05,930
Showing up when you're in danger…

630
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,960
That's being a real man.

631
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,100
$1,000 for every exorcism?

632
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,730
How do you have this, Seo-yeon?

633
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,830
It's not me,
but a student named Noh Hyun-joo.

634
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,030
Of course, I'm happy.
It's my first gift in 5 years.

635
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,760
What's the deal with that monk?

636
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:21,660
He's always around you?

637
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,530
He likes you 100 percent.

638
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,530
Excuse me, ma'am.

639
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:41,660
Gosh, where did I leave that sword?

640
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,500
I can't remember.

641
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,730
Medicine packets…

642
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,560
Did they take it
and commit suicide?

643
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,830
- Who are you?
- He's a monk.

644
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,900
Ah…
