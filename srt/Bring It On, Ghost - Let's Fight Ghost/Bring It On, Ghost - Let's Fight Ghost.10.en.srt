(Bring it on, Ghost)

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,260
I like you.

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:45,600


8
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,600
I don't care what
others think about us.

9
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,400
I like you just
the way you are, Hyun-ji.

(Episode 10)

11
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,530
What brings you here?

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,729
Are you Professor Ju Hye-sung?

13
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,030
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,930
Do you know Bong-pal?
Park Bong-pal.

15
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,259
- Yes.
- Ah.

16
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm like an uncle to him.

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,160
I heard his professor worked here
so I stopped by to say hello.

18
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,759
Is that right?
It's nice to meet you.

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,600
You seem very familiar.
Have we ever met before?

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,100
Come to think of it, I think we saw
each other around the neighborhood.

21
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,730
No.

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,860
It was a very long time ago.

23
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm not sure.

24
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,760
- I don't remember.
- I see.

25
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,400
Hello.

26
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:57,030
- We got lunch.
- Go ahead and eat first.

27
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I see it's lunchtime. Forgive me
for taking so much of your time.

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,630
- Not at all.
- Please enjoy your lunch.

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,130
Please, take good care
of my Bong-pal.

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,660
I will.

31
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,260
Excuse me then.

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh, sir.

33
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,660
- I'll see you around.
- Yes.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,630
- This looks so good.
- Eat slowly.

35
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,360
Don't worry about anything.

36
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,630
Got it?

37
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,030
Monk Myung-chul.

38
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,760
I guess he's not here.

39
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,030
I guess so.

40
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,700
What did he watch again?

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,730
Bong-pal, is this you?
You are so cute!

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
When was it?

43
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,430
Wait, it's the tape
from my graduation.

44
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,860
Why was he watching this
out of the blue?

45
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,500
He kept mentioning
my graduation earlier.

46
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,260
- Come on, let's watch a bit more.
- It's nothing. Forget it.

47
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:23,630
I'm curious about your childhood.

48
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,600
Forget it. Just watch it next time.

49
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,430
When next time?

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,230
Just next time.

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,330
Who recorded this?

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
Oh, my father.

53
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,000
He used to work as
a producer a long time ago.

54
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,460
So it must have been a copy of his.

55
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,860
Did your father record all
those videos in that room, too?

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,830
Yes.

57
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,560
- What did he film?
- I don't know. Random stuff.

58
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,230
I've never watched them.

59
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,830
But…

60
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,500
Why do you live
separately from your dad?

61
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,500
It just... ended up like that.
I'm going to wash up.

62
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,330
Okay.

63
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,000
There's something
suspicious about that punk.

64
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,100
- Is it good?
- It's totally good. Sit down.

65
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:21,730
- Should we go inside?
- No, it's not cold at all.

66
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,760
Goodness, goodness.

67
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,760
Let's turn it off.

68
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,659
- I'm going to bed.
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,860
Good night.

70
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,299
Okay.

71
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,030
Why isn't it turning on?
Why isn't it turning on?

72
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,260
Why aren't the lights turning on?
There we go.

73
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,760
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

74
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,800
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

75
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,760
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

76
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,360
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

77
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,300
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

78
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,160
- One, two, three...
- Hey.

79
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,800
Who are you?

80
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,560
Where is the manager?

81
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,100
What brings you here instead of him?

82
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,260
I saw something.

83
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,960
- I think it was a ghost.
- A ghost, you say?

84
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,860
Ghost. Ghost... G...
G... a ghost, you say?

85
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:12,030
Wait a minute.
You've got bags under your eyes.

86
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay, give me your right hand.
It's okay, it's okay.

87
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,860
His pulse is so weak.

88
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:24,700
You're able to see ghosts because
there's darkness surrounding you!

89
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,530
We can shine light upon you.

90
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Then what do I have to do?

91
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,560
We will take care of everything.

92
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,660
You, sir...

93
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,200
You just have to prepare the cash.

94
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,130
Up front. Yes, over there.

95
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,700
The right side, the right side.

96
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,260
Bong-pal, this ghost was seen
here and there on campus.

97
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,260
But the way it looks
is very peculiar.

98
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,730
Is this the right place?

99
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,500
Bong-pal, do you see something?

100
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,460
No, it's not here.
I think it left this place.

101
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,860
- No.
- What about you? Do you see it?

102
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,230
There's no ghostly energy.

103
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,130
Ah…

104
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,460
What was that?

105
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,930
- Ah, that scared me!
- It's here! It's here!

106
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,460
It's here! Wait for me!

107
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
Can you see?

108
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,660
- Something is strange.
- Yeah.

109
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,330
What the heck!

110
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,260
- Get it! Get it!
- Bong-pal, we caught the ghost!

111
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,500
We caught the ghost!

112
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,830
- I'm not afraid of ghosts!
- I'm not a ghost, I'm a person!

113
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,030
- No, you're not!
- Hold on! Hold on!

114
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,200
Senior Hyun-gyu?
It's you, isn't it?

115
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,630
Senior?

116
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,130
Let go! Let go!

117
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,460
Hyun-gyu…

118
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,960
What... what is this?

119
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,730
Geranium helps with breathing
and strengthens your immunity.

120
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,330
This bracelet is made from geranium.
You can't take it, okay?

121
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,130
I've counted all of them.

122
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,460
What happened to you?

123
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,660
Life is tough…

124
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,630
Senior, that guy earlier.

125
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,730
He must have been hiding
in the school for a very long time.

126
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,860
Yes, it seems that way.

127
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,630
Getting a job must really be hard.

128
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,000
I heard he was a genius
when he was attending school.

129
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,930
What the heck is a geranium pyramid?

130
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,900
He's being chased by
debt collectors because of it.

131
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
What is this?
Why are you carrying this?

132
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,430
This is not... this is not
the exorcism fee, is it?

133
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,930
You catch on real quick!

134
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,460
You know, I was listening
to that senior's story

135
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,360
and this bath mat is
made from natural geranium.

136
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:13,200
It helps with breathing, builds
immunity, and produces endorphins.

137
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,800
I can't stop laughing ever
since I put this bracelet on.

138
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,500
Bong-pal, this geranium
bracelet is for you.

139
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,100
Here, try it on.

140
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,330
You keep all this health stuff.

141
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,200
I want money.
I have to go to class. See you.

142
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
Why did you accept this?

143
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,900
He has no money!
What was I supposed to do?

144
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,600
Ah, how about we give
this to your grandma?

145
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,060
My grand...

146
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,430
What's this?

147
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah, what is this?
Are these mosquito bites?

148
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,900
Hold on...

149
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,100
(Lee Min-soo)

150
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,000
There's nothing to look at.

151
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,100
There was enough alcohol in
his blood to be deemed drunk.

152
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,830
He cracked his skull and broke his
collarbone and femur from the fall.

153
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,930
There's a visible injury
to his head. That's all.

154
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
I see.

155
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,000
He killed the person he loved and
killed himself because of the guilt.

156
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,560
- It's like a novel.
- Let's not go that far.

157
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,930
It's just a suicide.

158
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,100
Yes, sir.

159
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,530
Yes.

160
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,260
This isn't in your jurisdiction.
Why are you so interested?

161
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,560
Someone is making me interested.

162
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,630
Who?

163
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,500
That professor?

164
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,730
- Yes.
- Sir.

165
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,359
The chief wants us to hurry up
and take care of the Woohyun case.

166
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,260
Get going. You must be busy.

167
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,660
Yes, thank you.

168
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,260
Are you going to head
straight up to Seoul?

169
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:24,260
You have the address
of the professor's mother, right?

170
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:25,930
Yes, but why do you ask?

171
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,359
You're not thinking of
going there now, are you?

172
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,760
Get in.

173
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,700
The chief is going to
throw a fit if he finds out.

174
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,060
I'll go by myself then.

175
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,060
Let's go.

176
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,130
No!

177
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,560
Dad, where are you?

178
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,930
He's at it again!
When are you coming back?

179
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,660
Come quickly!
Mom's not home either!

180
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,930
Dad, come quickly!

181
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,230
Hyun-min!

182
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,530
Hyun-min. Hyun-min…

183
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,730
Oh, blood! Oh, no!

184
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
Hyun-min! Hyun-min, wake up!

185
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,300
- Hyun-min!
- Move... Move!

186
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,800
Hyun-min,
what's the matter with you?

187
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,960
Don't do this. You're scaring me.

188
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,160
Hyun-min…

189
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,200
Hyun-min!

190
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,130
- What are you doing?
- Don't!

191
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,000
Hyun-ji, I don't know when
we'll ever meet again...

192
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,560
Now you're writing love letters?

193
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,160
It's going to get wrinkled.
It's going to get wrinkled!

194
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
- Are you okay?
- Did you just hit me?

195
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,030
You shouldn't have
taken it away from me.

196
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,960
Did you just hit me
because of a ghost?

197
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,330
It wasn't intentional.

198
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,800
Let me see. Are you okay?

199
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,300
Are you okay?

200
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,100
My eye.

201
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,030
- I can't see.
- You can't see?

202
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,330
I can't see.
I can't see.

203
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,530
I can't... Shim Chung!
Shim Chung! Shim Chung, where are...

204
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,400
- You can see.
- You're right.

205
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,160
You... You...

206
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm going to
have you committed.

207
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,130
Do it.

208
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,400
Yes, this is Blood Sausage Soup,
your 24-hour exorcism service.

209
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm Choi Chun-sang,
how may I help you?

210
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,830
(Notice: Professor Ju Hye-sung's
lecture is canceled)

211
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,230
(due to personal reasons)

212
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,630
Professor, there's no lecture today.
You're not sick, are you?

213
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,700
- There's no lecture today.
- Perfect! Should we go somewhere?

214
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,460
All you want to do is have fun.

215
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,800
At least I study hard.

216
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,660
(Chun-sang)

217
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,060
Hello. Are you
Professor Ju Hye-sung's mother?

218
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Oh, thank you.

219
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,360
What brings you here from Seoul?

220
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,930
I apologize for the sudden visit.

221
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
We came here to ask you a question.

222
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,130
- Is it about Hye-sung?
- Yes.

223
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,460
Has your son come
to visit you recently?

224
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,700
He does visit often.

225
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,200
Do you remember when that was?

226
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,660
- Excuse me?
- The day he came to visit you.

227
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,460
By any chance, do you remember?

228
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,930
Well...

229
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,630
I don't remember... the exact day.

230
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,100
- What's the matter?
- Sir.

231
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,900
- What?
- Over there.

232
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,330
You traveled quite a distance.
Were you able to confirm everything?

233
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,530
I don't know. You should
ask your mother directly.

234
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Sorry to bother you.

235
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,960
Goodbye, ma'am.

236
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,160
He hasn't returned.
My parents are looking for him,

237
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,230
but it's been over an hour already.

238
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,300
Soo-gyung was looking at me.

239
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,530
- You saw the ghost?
- Yes.

240
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Do you think she'll hurt Hyun-min?

241
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,630
Do you know of a place
where he might be?

242
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,960
My parents probably
already went there and looked.

243
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
What about a place
Soo-gyung would go to?

244
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,460
There.

245
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,430
He probably went here.

246
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,100
He scattered her ashes here.

247
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,130
Over there!

248
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,900
Bong-pal, over there.

249
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,300
- Senior, drive faster.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

250
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,930
Step on it! Step on it more!

251
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,760
Step on it!

252
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,030
We're almost there.

253
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,600
- What the heck?
- What's wrong with this thing?

254
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,900
There's smoke!

255
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,400
I hope it doesn't explode!

256
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,260
I'm going to go on ahead.

257
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Who are you?
What are you doing?

258
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,860
What are you doing? You love him.
Why are you trying to kill him

259
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,860
when you should be saving him?

260
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:05,160
What are you talking about?
Why would I kill Hyun-min?

261
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,230
- I'm trying to save him right now!
- Soo-gyung.

262
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,530
I'll see you soon.

263
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,630
No!

264
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,830
Hyun-min, please, don't do this.

265
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,530
Soo-gyung.

266
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,330
It's brain cancer.

267
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,830
At most, you have
three months to live.

268
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,100
What about surgery?

269
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,660
Surgery is possible,
but there are no guarantees.

270
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,400
I...

271
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,700
That's dangerous.

272
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,830
Who are you?

273
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,400
Ow, that hurts.

274
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,060
Are you determined to kill yourself?

275
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,700
- It not like the world is ending!
- It is for me.

276
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Oh, I see. I didn't know.

277
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,060
Did you think
I was going to say that?

278
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,330
Look, I don't know
what your story is

279
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,730
but why are you giving up
already? You're too young.

280
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,260
No one knows the future. You have
to live each day to its fullest.

281
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,530
Carpe diem. Don't you
know what that means?

282
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,130
Something good might happen.

283
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,800
So be strong, okay?

284
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,800
- Be strong.
- You can do it!

285
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,930
I can do it!

286
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,260
Get home safely.

287
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,600
People follow
traffic signals, got it?

288
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,530
Oh, I have to go now!

289
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,700
- I'd like to buy these, please.
- Yes, sir!

290
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,400
You made the right decision.
Coffee is much better than alcohol.

291
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,660
Here you go. Goodbye...

292
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,830
Wait! Here! Take this.

293
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
You can drink that.

294
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,700
Oh, and...

295
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
Hi!

296
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,230
- You're here.
- Did you wait long?

297
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,300
No... well, I waited
for a really long time.

298
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,660
- Be careful.
- I will.

299
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,730
Be careful!

300
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,630
I need to go somewhere for
several days. I'll be right back.

301
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,460
Alright.

302
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,600
- Don't take too long.
- When I return...

303
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,960
I'll come straight to you.

304
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,560
Okay, have a safe trip.

305
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,360
Doctor.

306
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,130
The surgery will go well, right?

307
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,060
I will do my best.

308
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,000
I...

309
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,360
I want to live.

310
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,800
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.

311
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,230
Oh my, Hyun-min called me.

312
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,030
I'm sorry.

313
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,660
I might not be able
to return to you.

314
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,800
That's why I wanted
to tell you the truth.

315
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,860
The truth is, I...

316
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,460
Soo-gyung, I miss you.

317
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,660
Hyun-min, are you okay?
Are you awake?

318
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,730
I'll go get our parents.

319
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,100
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

320
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,930
Can you answer the phone, please?

321
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Hello?

322
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,630
What did you say?

323
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,600
No... No!

324
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,700
No! No!

325
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,660
Shin Soo-gyung... Soo-gyung.

326
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:08,700
(Shin Soo-gyung)

327
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,700
No...

328
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,160
I'm sorry, Soo-gyung.

329
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:41,860
If I hadn't called you then...

330
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,800
No, it wasn't your fault.

331
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,730
So please,
don't try to kill yourself.

332
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,800
It's because I wanted
to come to you.

333
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,000
Why did I have the surgery done?

334
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,700
So I could be with you
and live with you.

335
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,230
If you die and get to be with me...

336
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,700
I wouldn't like that.

337
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,230
It would make me sadder.

338
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,199
Soo-gyung, please...

339
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:27,500
I was very happy that
I got to spend time with you…

340
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,130
Now, I just want to rest in peace
with our happy memories.

341
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,530
Please.

342
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,600
- Soo-gyung.
- Hyun-min.

343
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:44,560
Please promise me that
you won't hurt yourself again.

344
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,300
You promised me, okay?

345
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,830
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

346
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,860
Take care of yourself.

347
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,530
Soo-gyung...

348
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,330
I'm sorry, Soo-gyung.

349
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,430
He'll be alright, right?

350
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:52,630
He will be okay.

351
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,030
Senior, I will
return the clothes tomorrow.

352
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,230
Sure. You did well today.

353
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,700
Bong-pal, wait a minute.

354
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,400
Well...

355
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,860
Can you give this
to Hyun-ji for me?

356
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,200
Tell her it is from my heart.

357
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,300
- In-rang.
- Yes?

358
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,230
- About Hyun-ji...
- Yes?

359
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,460
Hyun-ji...

360
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,000
She already likes someone.

361
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,160
What?

362
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,400
See you tomorrow.

363
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,600
I don't believe it.

364
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,300
You fool.

365
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,060
What is it?

366
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,560
We will also have to separate
like them someday…

367
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,330
Probably.

368
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,100
So what? What matters
is that I'm happy now.

369
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,960
Worrying about the future
won't change anything.

370
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,730
Hey, you're the one
who told me not to worry.

371
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,430
That's true.

372
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,930
By the way,
In-rang will be okay, right?

373
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,700
He will be okay.

374
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,760
This is why
you should've listened to me.

375
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,130
How can you be in love with a ghost?

376
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,100
I agree.

377
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,400
If I had known it would hurt
this much I wouldn't have started.

378
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:47,400
I wrote this letter for her...

379
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,730
Such a fool.

380
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:07,830
I will let you go, Kim Hyun-ji!

381
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,060
I don't think I can go on, either.

382
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:22,000
I will go see her. I will.

383
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,730
- Hyun-ji, I'm coming to see you!
- Hey!

384
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,760
- Let go of me!
- No!

385
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,530
If you die,
how am I supposed to go on?

386
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,630
I want to see Hyun-ji.

387
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,060
I want to see Hyun-ji.
Chun-sang, I really do.

388
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,960
It really hurts.
It really does, Chun-sang.

389
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,600
What should I do?

390
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,430
(Flower Virgin Shamaness)

391
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,700
Are you sure it was the same man?

392
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,230
I'm not sure,
but I have this bad feeling.

393
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,930
When I shook his hand,
my whole body was in pain.

394
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,460
If you felt such a thing
when you're such a lousy monk,

395
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:09,030
he really must be something else.

396
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,100
By the way,
what brings you here today?

397
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,430
You don't want me to...

398
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,000
No way! I can't
handle a man like that!

399
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,730
It's not my specialty either.

400
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,460
I've seen people go down…

401
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,030
Don't even think about it.

402
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,700
Such a chicken…

403
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,830
- That's not why I came.
- Then what is it?

404
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,200
You know the weapon that I used
on Bong-pal when he was little.

405
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,230
Can you get me
the same weapon again?

406
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,860
- Didn't it break?
- That's what I'm saying.

407
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,030
It's so rare that
it will be hard to find now.

408
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,960
It will at least make me
feel better if I have it.

409
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,400
Can you ask around and see?

410
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,300
I will.

411
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,000
And can you make me a talisman?

412
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,400
I will have Bong-pal carry it.

413
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,700
Although I don't know
how effective it will be…

414
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,730
I'm going to head back.

415
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,330
Do that. It's getting late.

416
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,630
Drive safely.

417
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,330
Are you hurt?

418
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,760
It's not serious.

419
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,530
I'll get going now.

420
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,430
Hey, who was that?

421
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:23,200
Was that your son?
He's very handsome.

422
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,200
He's not my son.

423
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,260
He is...

424
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,460
Is anybody here? Someone fell!

425
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,730
Hye-sung…

426
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,830
- What are you doing?
- Me? Studying.

427
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,530
You're already studying this early?

428
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,860
I have to study hard.
I don't have much time until

429
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,960
the college entrance exams.

430
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,200
- Aren't you going to eat?
- After I finish this.

431
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,360
- Why did you do that?
- I want you to take it easy.

432
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,330
If you work too hard now,
you're going to burnout.

433
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,400
No, don't look.

434
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,960
I already saw them.

435
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,060
- When?
- A while ago.

436
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,600
Let me see them. Come on.

437
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,260
Gosh, you drew all over
on Seo-yeon's face.

438
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,360
What? Give them back
if you're going to tease me.

439
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,900
Gosh, you made her look ugly.

440
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,330
- Are you jealous of her?
- No way. What jealousy?

441
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,430
Then what is this?

442
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,430
If you're going to tease me,
give them back.

443
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,800
I can't even take
a single photo with you.

444
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:42,030
What am I supposed to do?

445
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,000
I don't personally like photos.

446
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,260
I prefer seeing things in person.

447
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,530
It is better to see
you in person like this.

448
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,360
- You're so ugly.
- What did you say?

449
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,860
- Say what?
- Stop it.

450
00:45:10,930 --> 00:45:13,160
- I'm not going to.
- I said stop.

451
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,560
Hey.

452
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,960
- Meh!
- Hey!

453
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,560
Hey, what now?
Hey, it hurts.

454
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,130
- Hey!
- It sounds like Bong-pal...

455
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,430
When did he start
to laugh like that?

456
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,530
Hey, why?

457
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,160
- He didn't even lock the door.
- I'm really sorry. Hey.

458
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,230
- It's so low of me to hit me there.
- Okay, fine.

459
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm late. I have
a class at 11:30 a.m.

460
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,630
- What about breakfast then?
- We can eat at school.

461
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,960
Bong-pal.

462
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,660
Monk Myung-chul.

463
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,100
Who were you talking to just now?

464
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,330
I asked who you
were talking to just now.

465
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,830
By any chance...

466
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,300
are you with that female
ghost from last time?

467
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,430
- Where are you going?
- I want to grill more sausage.

468
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,260
It's not for you.
There is a stray cat around here.

469
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,130
Bong-pal!

470
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,730
What's up with this toothbrush?
Did you buy it for me to use?

471
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,160
Have you been living with that
virgin ghost this whole entire time?

472
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,360
What do we do?

473
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,000
- Don't worry about it.
- What do you think you're doing?

474
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,760
Are you in some kind of love
with that ghost?

475
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,200
- I said don't worry about it.
- Your mom died because of a ghost.

476
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,460
But you're with a ghost?

477
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:52,530
We will fix your ghost-seeing eyes
immediately. I will look into it.

478
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,560
Also, stop going around exorcising!

479
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:58,130
- I will take care of it.
- I don't think so, punk!

480
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,130
- Let's end it right now!
- I don't want to!

481
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,700
By any chance...

482
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,600
do you have feelings for that ghost?

483
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,100
Yes, I do.

484
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,600
- So please stay out of it.
- You punk...

485
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:38,900
Fine. I will stay
out of your business.

486
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,900
Did your mom die
because of a ghost?

487
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,430
You're trying to save money
to fix your eyes?

488
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,600
- Don't worry about what he said.
- It's true, isn't it?

489
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,760
I didn't even know, like a fool.

490
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,030
I said don't worry about it.

491
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,530
Let's go to school.

492
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,600
I will stay home today.
You go ahead.

493
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,060
Okay.

494
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,830
That brat.

495
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:38,730
When we have no idea what's
happened to his dad... Seriously!

496
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,600
Let me see. According to
the lunar calendar, today is...

497
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,400
Oh my goodness.
It's Bong-pal's birthday today.

498
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:35,200
Why do I care about a stubborn
punk who doesn't listen?

499
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,230
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

500
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,560
What am I going to do?
I can't just leave the cake here.

501
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,660
By any chance...

502
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,060
He should've cleaned up the place
a little bit before he left.

503
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,600
I know you're in here.

504
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,530
Don't leave and hear me out.

505
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,560
I don't know why you're stuck here.

506
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,900
Leave Bong-pal.

507
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,400
You don't seem like an evil spirit.

508
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:44,400
Please, leave Bong-pal for his sake.

509
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:49,300
When he was little,

510
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,260
an evil spirit entered his body.

511
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,900
It was all my fault.

512
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,730
If only I had been stronger,
I would've gotten rid of it.

513
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,230
Monk Myung-chul.

514
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,700
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

515
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,530
When the evil spirit came out
of Bong-pal's body

516
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,300
I couldn't finish it off completely.

517
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,630
It is my biggest regret.

518
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,000
That evil spirit got so angry...

519
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:17,760
it killed Bong-pal's mom
right in front of him.

520
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,600
I learned that he started to
see ghosts from that moment on.

521
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:31,630
Energy from that evil spirit
somehow stayed in his eyes.

522
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:39,200
Since then, he's been
suffering from seeing ghosts.

523
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:45,430
He's been an outcast
because of his eyes.

524
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,830
Do you think it's possible for
a ghost and a human to be together?

525
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,860
So please, leave Bong-pal,
for his own sake.

526
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,000
Do you think it's possible for
a ghost and a human to be together?

527
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,230
So please, leave Bong-pal,
for his own sake.

528
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,700
Hyun-ji.

529
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,060
Hyun-ji...

530
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,360
(Happy birthday, Bong-pal)

531
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,400
Hyun-ji.

532
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,400
Yes? You're back?

533
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,460
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm good.

534
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,260
You didn't run into
Monk Myung-chul again, did you?

535
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,460
I saw him briefly, but I was
able to avoid him quickly.

536
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:58,930
- Good.
- It's your birthday today?

537
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,830
Monk Myung-chul
came back with a cake.

538
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,430
Yes, it is.

539
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,100
Why didn't you tell me?
I had no idea.

540
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,100
Actually, I forgot.

541
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,500
- I don't usually celebrate.
- Why not?

542
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,530
I can't buy you anything,

543
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,460
but is there any place
you want to go?

544
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,800
Let's spend your birthday
together today.

545
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:30,000
Wow, it's so pretty.

546
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,300
It is pretty.

547
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,660
It's my first time on a cruise.

548
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,460
I might have been on one
when I was alive, huh?

549
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,330
I also haven't been
on one for a while.

550
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,460
You haven't?

551
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:49,100
But it's nice to be on
a boat with you.

552
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,060
Me too.

553
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,860
It's about to start. Let's go see.

554
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:22,160
- Isn't it better here?
- Yes.

555
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,760
- Bong-pal.
- Yes?

556
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,400
I want you to be happy.

557
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,000
I'm happy now.

558
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,360
To be honest, I've never
celebrated my birthday.

559
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,200
I never liked it either.

560
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,800
But my birthday isn't so bad
because you're here with me now.

561
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,260
I'm sorry.

562
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,930
About what?

563
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,230
- About everything.
- What do you mean?

564
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,060
- I can't do anything for you.
- It's fine.

565
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:22,300
- Happy birthday, Bong-pal.
- Thank you.

566
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,530
Bong-pal, I'm thirsty.

567
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,760
Wait here then.
I will go get some drinks.

568
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,260
Where did she go?

569
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,760
Hyun-ji!

570
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,630
Excuse me.

571
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,300
Hyun-ji.

572
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,230
I'm sorry.

573
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,500
Hyun-ji!

574
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,630
Kim Hyun-ji!

575
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,300
Hyun-ji!

576
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,430
I'm sorry, Bong-pal.

577
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,460
(Bring it on, Ghost)

578
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,030
- Hyun-ji.
- Let go of me.

579
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,400
- Let's go home.
- I said let go of me!

580
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,400
You think you and I make sense?

581
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:06,930
Being with you makes it hard for me.

582
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,300
Where is the stuff
you wanted to give?

583
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,100
I don't know what you're planning.

584
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,460
But it's not going to go your way.

585
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,030
Bong-pal!
