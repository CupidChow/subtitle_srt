21
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,930
Help me up.

22
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,100
Let's see that punk.

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,100
Goodness, this rascal. The gods
have looked kindly upon him.

24
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,300
He's still breathing.

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,260
Goodness, you suffered a lot, too.

26
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,960
You went through a lot.

Good job.

30
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,029
Let's go, Mr. Ju Hye-sung. Let's go.

31
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,060
Monk.

32
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,730
What is going to happen to
Professor Ju Hye-sung now?

33
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,230
In some ways,
he's a victim, too.

34
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,530
In our eyes, yes. But to normal
people, he is just a murderer.

35
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:03,060
An evil spirit took over his body
because he had hatred

36
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,460
in his heart in the beginning.

37
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,630
You can't overlook that crime.

38
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,060
Oh dear Buddha.

39
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,730
I'm going to go home and get
some rest. You take Hyun-ji home.

40
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,460
Yes.

41
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,900
I'll see you later.

42
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,960
Hyun-ji!

43
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,900
Let me look at you! Are you okay?

44
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,659
You're not hurt anywhere?

45
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm okay.

46
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,330
- Dad.
- Let's go inside.

47
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,530
Young man, I clearly told you that
I do not like you seeing Hyun-ji.

48
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,860
She's been in danger twice
already because of you.

49
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,430
- What if she got hurt?
- I'm sorry.

50
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,830
Mom, stop.
Bong-pal did nothing wrong.

51
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,600
Go inside the house with your dad.

52
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,330
Take her inside.

53
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,830
- Mom.
- Honey.

54
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,600
Let's go, Hyun-ji.

55
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,130
We're going to leave here tomorrow.

56
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,830
If you have feelings for
Hyun-ji, then end it here.

57
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,500
It's best for both of you.

58
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,930
I believe you understand me.

59
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,930
Ma'am.

60
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,830
Please give this to Hyun-ji.

61
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,530
Please.

62
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Noh Hyun-joo.

And Ju Jin-myung.

66
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,530
You remember these people, right?

67
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,860
Mr. Ju Hye-sung.

68
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,930
Yes.

69
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,460
I remember.

70
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,330
I killed them.

71
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,260
I...

72
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,900
killed all these people.

73
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,860
Hye-sung.

74
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,660
Hye-sung…

75
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,360
- You're home.
- Yes.

76
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,930
Should you be drinking
when you're injured?

77
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,430
There's no medicine for
getting beaten by a ghost.

78
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,300
Alcohol is the best
to overcome the pain.

79
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
There's no food either.

80
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,360
Just wait a little bit.

81
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,300
Thanks.

82
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,260
Gosh, this looks good.

83
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,700
Wow, you really know how to cook.

84
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,400
Hyun-ji is leaving?

85
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,730
Yes, she's leaving tomorrow.

86
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,100
I see. It's time for everyone
to go back to their normal lives.

87
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,330
You must be sad.

88
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,260
- No, I'm fine.
- Good.

89
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,900
It's not like distance is going
to break you two apart, right?

90
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,960
On days like this,
let's drink up and go to bed.

91
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,630
Oh goodness.

92
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
This is nice.

93
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,560
Why did you do it?
I know it wasn't you.

94
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,700
- Let's talk to the detective again...
- I did it.

95
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
The crimes I committed in
my heart are bigger

96
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,900
than the ones I did physically.

97
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,460
If I didn't have those bad
intentions in my heart back then...

98
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,500
This wouldn't have happened.

99
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,130
My hands...

100
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,600
My heart killed those people.

101
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,400
That fact will never change.

102
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,400
- Hye-sung.
- And...

103
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
don't ever come here again.
If you see my face...

104
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,860
it will only cause you pain.

105
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,000
No, it's not true.

106
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm going to come every day.

107
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,030
I'm going to come and see you.

108
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,560
I'm going to keep coming
until you forgive me.

109
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,800
I'm going to come even
if you refuse to see me.

110
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,600
I'm going to come
every day to see you.

- She's on the phone in her room.

112
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,000
With who?

113
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,460
- I swear.
- Leave her. It's the last time.

114
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,830
I'm leaving today.

115
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,230
Our stuff is all packed
and ready to go.

Bong-pal.

117
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,300
I hope you understand
why my mom did that.

118
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,260
I completely understand.

119
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:09,600
Don't worry about it.

120
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,200
- Thanks.
- Study hard down there.

121
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,260
- So we'll be reunited quickly.
- I will.

122
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,560
Hyun-ji, let's go.

123
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,230
I have to go now.

124
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,730
Hyun-ji, get in.

125
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,530
Okay.

126
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,430
I don't want to go.

127
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,960
I want to be with you.

128
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,930
I don't want to send you off either.

129
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
Why aren't you here to see me?

130
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,300
I don't know when we'll
see each other again.

131
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,830
- Don't you miss me?
- I do miss you.

132
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
But I'm scared I won't be able
to let you go if I see you.

133
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,730
- Bong-pal.
- Hyun-ji.

134
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,930
I want you to get back to your
normal life as soon as possible.

135
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,600
I don't want you to put
anything off because of me.

136
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,860
We'll be apart for now,
but we can always be together

137
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,600
once you come to college.

138
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,160
Once that happens,
let's formally ask for

139
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,430
your mother's permission to date.

140
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,930
I know it'll be hard...
but let's look forward to that day.

141
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,100
Let's be patient and wait.

142
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,930
Okay, I will.

I'm sorry.
I didn't pass the exam.

166
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,600
You didn't get in?

167
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,630
That's okay, you can
just do better next time.

168
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,960
With that score,
you'll pass for sure next time.

169
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:59,300
Still, I wanted to
go to school with you.

170
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
You're graduating this year.

171
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,700
Well, I'll sit this semester out.

172
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,260
Forget it. Don't be ridiculous.

173
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,700
You need to get a job right away.

174
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,500
That way you can start
planning for the future.

175
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,400
That way...

176
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,330
- That way what?
- You know what I'm talking about.

177
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
So what is it?

178
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,400
- You really don't know?
- I don't know.

179
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,200
Is that right? Then you're
going to live alone forever.

180
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,030
Why should I live alone?

181
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,030
I'm going to live with you.

182
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,560
After four years.

183
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,560
Why after four years?

184
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,560
By then, I'll have a stable career.

185
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,160
You'll be graduating about
that time so it's perfect.

186
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,030
What do you think?
It's perfect, isn't it?

187
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,060
Who said I'm going
to live with you, huh?

188
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,160
You're ridiculous.

189
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,560
Ah, when do classes start?

190
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,460
- March fifth.
- That's coming up soon.

191
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,500
You're going to be busy.

192
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,130
How am I going to wait another year?

193
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,100
It'll pass soon enough.

194
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,460
- Come join our club!
- Hello!

195
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,930
An economic analysis
of goods without a price…

196
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,530
is not as simple.

197
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,330
Okay, that's all for class today.

198
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,960
I want you to submit
a group report next week

199
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,860
on resource distribution.

200
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,130
Quiet.

201
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:01,900
Here are the designated groups.
Take a look before you leave.

202
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,460
Good job on your first day of class.

203
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,860
See you next week.

204
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,730
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

205
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,130
Senior Bong-pal.

206
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,860
We're in the same group
and we're counting on you.

207
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,230
(Park Bong-pal)

208
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,860
- Okay, let's do our best.
- Okay!

209
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,660
See you next week.

210
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,700
Hey, Bong-pal!
Bong-pal, Bong-pal, Bong-pal!

211
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,230
- Senior.
- We're in trouble.

212
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
- What's going on?
- We're in trouble. What do we do?

213
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,060
What's wrong?

214
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,460
You'll know once you get there.

215
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,860
Senior! Senior!

216
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,200
(Notice: Due to low signup,
please, vacate by March 31st)

217
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:09,030
In-rang is gone, Seo-yeon is gone,
and not a single willing freshman…

218
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,730
What are we supposed to do now?

219
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,200
Our precious club is in danger
of being shut down again.

220
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,360
- That's too bad, I guess.
- That's... That's too bad, I guess.

221
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,160
We're in a crisis right now.

222
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,400
As co-president,
how can you be so nonchalant?

223
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,400
Who is co-president?

224
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,600
- Me?
- Then who else would it be?

225
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,360
It's just the two of us.
Who else would it be?

226
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,300
You have to be the next
president once I graduate!

227
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,800
I'm not really interested.

228
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,800
So... the tradition and
history we're so proud of...

229
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,860
Are you saying you want to get
rid of our Blood Sausage Soup club?

230
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,660
I have to go to class. See you.

231
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,600
Don't go.

232
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,860
Be strong.

233
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,160
Don't go, Bong-pal. Don't go,
Bong-pal. Bong-pal, Bong-pal!

234
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,800
Bong-pal!

235
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,630
You selfish bastard.

236
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,200
(In-rang)

237
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,800
Hello?

238
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,560
What time is it? Class is over,
get over here. What are you doing?

239
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,700
I'll be right there.
Don't get annoyed.

240
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,730
- Hurry up! Class is over!
- Stop nagging.

241
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,200
- Move it!
- I'm coming!

242
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,430
Exorcism is about getting rid of
ghosts, evil spirits, and monsters

243
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,100
that inhabit humans and places.

244
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,900
It is a scary and dirty job.

245
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,530
Shamans, monks, and the spiritually
gifted have exorcised for years.

246
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,700
In 2018, Blood Sausage Soup
joined them…

247
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Excuse me.

248
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,030
Did you have a question?

249
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,960
I don't know where it began
and how it went wrong…

250
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,800
- but I need to ask now.
- Yes, please go ahead.

251
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,800
Isn't this
a blood sausage soup restaurant?

252
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,560
I wanted a bowl of it to go.

253
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,830
- You want it to go?
- Most restaurants offer now.

254
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,400
No... it's not.

255
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,330
- Yes, we're...
- Gosh, I'm so sorry!

256
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,530
- I must be possessed or something.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

257
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,230
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

258
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
- I'm truly sorry.
- Not at all. I'm sorry.

259
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,000
- I should've been clear. Goodbye.
- Yes, goodbye.

260
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,000
- Goodbye.
- This is not a restaurant.

261
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,330
Did you get work for us? Huh?

262
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,160
Our name is Blood Sausage Soup
so he came for a meal.

263
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,530
What time is it right now?

264
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,130
Why have you been MIA lately?
Did you pass out the flyers?

265
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,830
I did. I did pass the flyers out,

266
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,330
but I think we need to
hire a part-time employee.

267
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,360
It's kind of hard doing
this all by myself.

268
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,030
A part-time employee?

269
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,060
How can that come out
of your mouth so easily?

270
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,030
We haven't had a single gig
since we opened up our business!

271
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,000
And wait a minute.

272
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,860
Look at this.

273
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,930
I see that you ate a special
variety meat set yesterday.

274
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,100
I told you to cut off
meals at $5.50!

275
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,830
$5.50 meals are hard to find.

276
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,630
I just ate one for $5.50!

277
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,560
We will never be able to pay
my grandma back at this rate!

278
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,660
I got this investment
because I believed in you!

279
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,760
You said it'd be a hit!

280
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,500
You said we could pay
it all back in a month.

281
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,260
The thing is, if you look at the way
the economy is doing these days...

282
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,900
What about new freshman recruits?

283
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,430
We're still...

284
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,860
Still?

285
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,360
We received a grant from the school
and we still have no new members?

286
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,800
We're going to jail
if the school finds out.

287
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,760
Look, I'm doing my very best.

288
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,860
- Let's clean this place up.
- Huh?

289
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,160
Let's do some cleaning. Let's clean
the windows and dust the office.

290
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,630
My head hurts
so I'm going to rest a bit.

291
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,830
- Clean?
- Go ahead and start.

292
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,600
You want me to clean?

293
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm the CEO.

294
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,830
I have to do all the dirty work just
because you got the investment.

295
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah, I don't blame you
for rubbing it in my face.

296
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,460
- Do we have coffee?
- Yes, we do.

297
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,960
- How do you want it?
- Just with milk.

298
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,400
- Goodness, it's been a long time.
- Yes, Monk Myung-chul.

299
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,500
I hope I'm not late.

300
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,030
The thing is, I've been
trying to get a hold of you,

301
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,500
but you weren't
answering your phone.

302
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,260
Did something happen?

303
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,730
A shamaness said that your spiritual
energy has no effect at all.

304
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,200
Which shamaness is going around
saying such nonsense about me?

305
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,760
What do you mean nonsense?

306
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,760
Why are you here?

307
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:13,230
Why can't you cross
over to the afterlife?

308
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Believe. Redeem your sorry soul!

309
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,360
Who is this pitiful-looking man?

310
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,060
Get rid of him.

311
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,530
What is this?

312
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,130
She's from Daeryong Mountain.

313
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,060
She calls herself
the 1,000-year-old virgin shamaness.

314
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,860
Virgin shamaness?

315
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,300
Why are there so many?

316
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,800
She's clearly
not a virgin shamaness!

317
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,000
She's just a con artist!

318
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,460
You insolent fool!
Leave immediately!

319
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,060
You have no credentials or pedigree!
How dare you con these good people!

320
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,800
How dare you call me a fraud!

321
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,900
You let this good-for-nothing
monk into the house?!

322
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,260
I'm a great and honorable
monk who catches evil spirits!

323
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,630
Leave if you're done! How dare you
impersonate a shamaness, you fake.

324
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,730
Fake? Fake?

325
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,960
- Oh my.
- What's wrong?

326
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,200
What is going on?

327
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,860
Have you lost your mind?

328
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,900
Goodness, attention!

329
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,400
Congratulations on your promotion.

330
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,400
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

331
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,530
Chief.

332
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,460
Chief!

333
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,530
Why did you push her?

334
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,860
I didn't push her.

335
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,300
This woman couldn't control
her anger, she tripped and fell.

336
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,360
She says she's a virgin shamaness.

337
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,630
Please, check and see.
I think this woman is a fraud.

338
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,000
Why do you keep hitting me, woman?

339
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,900
Stop her! She's attacking me!

340
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:18,130
Calm down!

341
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,260
Have we met before?
You look familiar.

342
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,830
- I go to church.
- Hallelujah?

343
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,330
Amen.

344
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,660
Stop her!

345
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,900
- Senior.
- Senior.

346
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,630
Where are you going?

347
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,530
- I'm going home.
- Don't go home.

348
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
There's the freshman
welcome party today.

349
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,760
Ah.

350
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,460
- I don't really care for those.
- No, you have to go.

351
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,760
You have to be there.

352
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,060
- Please, let's go.
- Let's go together.

353
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,560
Senior, let's go.

354
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,930
Let's go.

355
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:56,160
Are all the drinks poured?

356
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,800
(Economics Department
Freshman Welcome Party)

357
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,130
- Are the drinks poured or not?
- They are!

358
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,900
It's rare to drink with us seniors!

359
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,800
Economics major cheer on
the count of three, got it?

360
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,460
- Yes!
- One, two, three!

361
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,260
- Economics major!
- Economics major!

362
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,600
There is a really pretty freshman
girl who just started this year.

363
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,630
I saw her, too. She's totally hot.

364
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,860
Hello, I'm an economics major,
Kim Ji-eun, class of 2018.

365
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,330
Please, take good care of me.

366
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,030
Hello, I'm an economics major...

367
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,160
- She's so cute.
- Please, take good care of me.

368
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,300
Hello, I'm an economics major,
Lee Dong-min, class of 2018.

369
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,530
It's my goal to become
the Adam Smith of Korea. Thank you.

370
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,500
Hello, Seniors. I'm an economics
major, Kim Hyun-ji, class of 2018.

371
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,000
I'd appreciate your guidance.

372
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,230
Hey, that's her!

373
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,660
- I have a question.
- Yes?

374
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,130
By any chance,
do you have a boyfriend?

375
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,430
Yes, he's here.

376
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,460
He's here?

377
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,700
Why did you lie about not passing?

378
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,830
I did it on purpose
so I could surprise you.

379
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,530
I had no idea. I was wondering how
I was going to wait another year.

380
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,100
You said it'll pass soon enough.

381
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,460
I didn't mean it.

382
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,700
But where are you staying?

383
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,860
At my uncle's.
It's close to your place, too.

384
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,130
Really? Good.

385
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,730
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Of course.

386
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:50,600
From now on, I'm going
to stick to you like glue.

387
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,000
You better be good
to your sis.

388
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,160
- Sis?
- Of course, I'm older than you.

389
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,030
You're one year younger than me.

390
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,200
Sis, my butt.

391
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,360
Let's get this straight
before we continue.

392
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,130
Bong-pal, repeat after me.

393
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,230
Sis.

394
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,600
No.

395
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,560
You better listen to me.
One more time. 'Sis.'

396
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,429
- Forget it.
- Why? Just say it once, okay?

397
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,159
Sis. Sis.

398
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,530
- No, I don't want to!
- Call me Sis!

399
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,699
Just say it this once. Please?

400
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:37,260
- Go on in.
- Okay.

401
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,199
- Good night.
- Good night.

402
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,300
- What's the matter?
- I just like you so much.

403
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,060
I like you a lot, too.

404
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,860
- Go in for real now.
- Alright.

405
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,960
- Sweet dreams.
- You too.

406
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,030
Hi, Monk Myung-chul.

407
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,000
Hello.

408
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
Where is Monk Myung-chul?

409
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,100
Bong-pal.

410
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,830
I'm sorry.

411
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,100
It's not like you're a kid.

412
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,030
Why would you get
yourself into a fight?

413
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,230
In my field, there are
business ethics to follow.

414
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,660
That shamaness didn't have any.

415
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,100
That's why I... taught her a lesson.

416
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,430
- Thank you. I'm leaving now.
- Monk Myung-chul.

417
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,330
- Yes?
- Well...

418
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,200
You're not well and all.

419
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,230
Why don't you stop working?

420
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,060
Stop working and stay with me.

421
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,100
- With you?
- Yes.

422
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,960
Your place on the mountain
isn't very comfortable.

423
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,000
I emptied the spare room.

424
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,900
Move in with me. I know it's
a hassle to commute back and forth.

425
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,000
Bong-pal.

426
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,760
You're the only family
I have left now.

427
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,760
Gosh.

428
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,800
You know how
to make people cry, huh?

429
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,900
Do you have any sausage at home?

430
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,660
On a day like this, it'll be great
to have some soju and sausage.

431
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,500
Let's go.

432
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,060
What's wrong?

433
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,800
Hyun-ji!

434
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,900
Hey, Soo-jin.

435
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,730
Are you free tonight?

436
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,230
What? Why?

437
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,360
Three guys from Business Admin
asked for blind dates.

438
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,000
- Can you please come with us?
- A blind date?

439
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,700
Well, you know I have a boyfriend.

440
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,160
We know that you're going out
with one of our seniors.

441
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,130
Can you keep this from him
and come out with us this once?

442
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,230
We were afraid only
ugly guys would show up.

443
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,800
So we told them the prettiest girl
in our department is coming.

444
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,100
They told me that they'd bring
the handsomest boys. Please!

445
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,660
Come on, me, the prettiest girl?

446
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,630
If Bong-pal finds out,
he will get really mad.

447
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,460
Once people know
you two are going out,

448
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,830
you will never be asked
on a blind date.

449
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,460
You got into college and you're
going to graduate without ever

450
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,260
going on a blind date?

451
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,560
Wow, she is really pretty.

452
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,360
Next to the other two,
she looks even prettier.

453
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:42,330
Hello, I'm a freshman
Business Admin major, Kim Tae-young.

454
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,860
You're as pretty as we've heard.

455
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,730
Really? Thank you.

456
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,530
What is this? Only three boys were
supposed to come meet us.

457
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,260
They all begged me to come along.

458
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,700
We actually turned down a lot more.

459
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,630
Here.

460
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,530
Thank you.

461
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,000
(My Love Bong Bong)

462
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,930
(My Love Bong Bong)

463
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,730
Your call is being redirected...

464
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,330
I'm done with my class.
Where are you?

465
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,560
I'm discussing homework
with my classmates at a cafe.

466
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,800
I will call you later.

467
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,330
Let's break the ice, shall we?

468
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,900
Can we go around
and introduce ourselves first?

469
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,860
- Sure.
- Me first?

470
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,530
What homework all of a sudden?

471
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,360
I guess I'll leave then.

472
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,960
Drink up! Drink up!

473
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,200
Alcohol is coming. Drink up!

474
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,460
It will make you want to dance.

475
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,830
- A knight to the rescue.
- A knight to the rescue.

476
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,130
- No, I can drink this.
- No way.

477
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,760
- I will drink it.
- Come on.

478
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,800
I'm your knight!

479
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,500
(We're on a blind date with girls
from the Economics Dept.)

480
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,860
(They're the best!)

481
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,830
- Hello, In-rang.
- Hi, Pal. Where are you now?

482
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,900
- I'm at home.
- Are you?

483
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,900
Do you happen
to know where Hyun-ji is?

484
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,000
Hyun-ji?

485
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,930
She said she's
at a cafe doing homework.

486
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,160
Ah, she's doing
her homework at a cafe...

487
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,800
Pal, why don't you take a look at
the video I'm sending you now?

488
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,960
Sure.

489
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,460
This is the game that Hyun-ji likes!

490
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,330
Here we go.

491
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,600
They look like a couple.

492
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,230
- Now that you've come to this...
- No.

493
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,260
- Already?
- Gosh.

494
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,560
- Hyun-ji.
- Yes?

495
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,830
It's Senior Bong-pal.

496
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,600
- By the way, who is this?
- Me?

497
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,130
I'm Hyun-ji's boyfriend.

498
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,960
Bong-pal, are you really mad?

499
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,300
I always wanted to
go on a blind date in college.

500
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,500
Can you let it go
just this once, please?

501
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,830
When you have a boyfriend…
you want me to do what now?

502
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,200
You go on a blind date
and you want me to let it go?

503
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,900
- I told them that I had one.
- What?

504
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,360
When we were introducing ourselves,
I told them I had a boyfriend.

505
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,130
If you don't trust me,
go ask them.

506
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,700
I just went because
I wanted to get a feel for it.

507
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,730
- This is why you're in college...
- Yes.

508
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
- Why else?
- Oh my.

509
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,300
I was kidding.

510
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,000
It took me seven years
to become a college student.

511
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,660
I'm just so happy.

512
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,530
I just want to try everything.

513
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,330
So please don't be mad, Bong-pal.

514
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,430
Bong-pal. Bong Bong.

515
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,900
Bong-pal, please...

516
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,060
I'm so sorry
that I'm turning cute...

517
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:30,760
- Gosh.
- You laughed, didn't you?

518
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,760
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

519
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,600
- I did not laugh.
- Come on, you so laughed.

520
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,600
- Hey, you laughed.
- No, I did not.

521
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,430
I hate to say goodbye.

522
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,160
Me too.

523
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,500
Sweetie, where are you?
I'm up in Seoul now.

524
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,800
- Come home early.
- My mom must be here.

525
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,130
- Bong-pal, just go.
- What?

526
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,160
If my mom sees you,
she might say something.

527
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,400
- Get home safe. Bye.
- Hyun-ji.

528
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:16,930
Hey, what are you doing?

529
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,560
Bong-pal, hold on.

530
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,430
Bong-pal.

531
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,660
- Hello.
- Hello...

532
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,730
I heard you came up to Seoul.

533
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,760
I just wanted to
come by and say hello.

534
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,130
Ah, did you?

535
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Why don't you come in?

536
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,160
But what were you two
doing at such a late hour?

537
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,900
Mom, please don't
say anything to him.

538
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,830
Did you come by because you
wanted to tell me something?

539
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,530
It doesn't seem like
you're here to just say hello…

540
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,300
Well, ma'am...

541
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:22,730
Hyun-ji and I'd like to get your
permission to go out officially.

542
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:28,060
I thought you two were
without my permission already.

543
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,160
No, that's not true. We haven't
seen each other even once.

544
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,130
Stay out of it.

545
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,300
Are you sincerely asking
for my permission?

546
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,030
Yes.

547
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,760
Then if I tell you not to see her,

548
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,160
will you never see her again?

549
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,460
Mom!

550
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,330
To be honest, I wasn't
fond of you from the start.

551
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,230
When my daughter came back
from a near-death experience,

552
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,960
you showed up out of nowhere and
followed her, saying you liked her.

553
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,060
How could any parent accept
that without having some doubts?

554
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,030
I understand.

555
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,400
Mom, are you serious?

556
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,800
- You mean it, right?
- Yes.

557
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,430
You got into college
and are all grown up now.

558
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,100
How can I possibly stop you?

559
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,660
Well, he doesn't
seem like a bad kid.

560
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,560
Of course not.
He's a very nice person.

561
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,900
Plus, he does so well in school.

562
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,600
He had a full scholarship
for all four years.

563
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,600
And there isn't a sport he can't do.

564
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,200
- You like him that much?
- Yes, I do like him.

565
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,130
Thank you, mom. I love you, too.

566
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,730
What are you doing?
You're too big for this.

567
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,460
Oh my.

568
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,700
Today, Detective Yang
went out of her way to make this.

569
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,230
Try.

570
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,300
Excuse me, officer.

571
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,400
Thank you.

572
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,760
I made it when
we had time for crafts.

573
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,300
If you don't like it,
you don't have to wear it.

574
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,330
Why wouldn't I?

575
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,560
It's so beautiful

576
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:05,560
It seems that it took us
too long to get to this point.

577
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,560
I'm sorry, Hye-sung.

578
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,630
Don't blame yourself anymore.

579
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:21,430
I am not angry or resentful anymore.

580
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,260
We can't go back,

581
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:36,930
but let's share
what we couldn't before.

582
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:40,500
Let's do that, Hye-sung.

583
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,930
I will.

584
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,230
Mother.

585
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,030
- Then...
- See you later.

586
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,300
Sure, have a good day.

587
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,100
I'm not picking this up.

588
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,560
- I'm here to throw this away.
- I didn't say anything.

589
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,800
I guess you feel guilty
about something.

590
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,100
What? Nothing is bothering me.

591
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,030
Now, that I see your face…

592
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,100
I see you have a face
for good fortune.

593
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,660
Um, do I?

594
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,860
You shouldn't hurt yourself
at your age. Please, be careful.

595
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,500
Thank you.

596
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,560
Oh my goodness.

597
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,030
Oh, come on.
I'm so out of your league.

598
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,630
Well, he has
an eye for beauty, I guess.

599
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,030
Oh my, I'm sorry.

600
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,800
It's okay.

601
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,300
Here.

602
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,860
Haven't we met before?

603
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,800
Do you know me?

604
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,630
Se-ri!

605
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:11,630
- Se-ri.
- Babe, what took you so long?

606
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,600
I've been waiting for so long.

607
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,300
I can't go out with someone
who isn't punctual.

608
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:19,830
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm very sorry.

609
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,700
- Let me carry that for you.
- Honey!

610
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,460
What is this guy doing here again?

611
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:28,930
Honey, I'm sorry.

612
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,930
Please, forgive me, just this once.

613
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,930
Why won't you leave
me alone? So irritating.

614
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,860
I told you that we were done.

615
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,460
What do you think you're doing?

616
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,500
Se-ri doesn't want you.

617
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,730
Because of you, she's changed.

618
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,100
Why did you come onto her, huh?

619
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,100
What do you mean I came on to her?

620
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,660
Be a man and get lost, will you?

621
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,160
- Honey.
- Se-ri.

622
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,760
- Bong-pal.
- Seo-yeon.

623
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,130
- Long time no see.
- It sure has been.

624
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,300
I heard you got a job.

625
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,000
- At a good company, I hear.
- Nah, I'm just an intern.

626
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,300
What brings you back to school?

627
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,060
- I needed some academic records.
- Academic records?

628
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,460
Oppa, what are you doing here?

629
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,900
- You're the one from last time...
- Hi, I'm his girlfriend.

630
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,200
Ah, you have a girlfriend now, huh?

631
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,460
- You two look great together.
- Thank you.

632
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,930
Thank you.

633
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,560
- I'll see you around.
- See you later.

634
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,430
What was that about?

635
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,760
Don't smile like that.
You look like a fool.

636
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,730
I didn't smile.

637
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,300
But can you call me oppa again?

638
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,200
I don't want to.

639
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,200
Hey, please.

640
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,600
Hey, call me oppa again.

641
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:57,000
Aren't you late for your class?

642
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,430
I'm late.
I'm going to get going. Sorry.

643
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,430
Oppa, enjoy your class!

644
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,660
How come there is
so much fat in this pork? I hate it.

645
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,300
I like the stew with tuna in it.

646
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,060
- Kimchi stew is better with pork.
- I agree.

647
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:28,530
That was an insult
to pork kimchi stew.

648
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,100
it's obvious pork kimchi stew
is the best, isn't it?

649
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,300
When the juice from the pork
meets sour and spicy kimchi,

650
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,360
it gives the stew a deep flavor.

651
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,330
- She doesn't know that, huh?
- I agree.

652
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,960
Why would she throw
away such good stuff?

653
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,730
You seem to know
about deep broth flavor, huh?

654
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,960
It's not easy to know that
at our age, don't you think?

655
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,130
I'm Goo Dae-young, a sophomore,
physical education major.

656
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,560
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

657
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:01,100
I haven't seen your pretty face
around here. You must be a freshman.

658
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,760
- I am.
- A freshman, huh?

659
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,900
- Did you join any clubs yet?
- Not yet.

660
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,760
Not yet? Why don't you
join our club then?

661
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:09,900
What kind of club is it?

662
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,330
It's a club where we work
together to learn new flavors.

663
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,000
It's called 'Let's Eat.'

664
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,360
Among the necessities of life,
food, clothing, and shelter,

665
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,700
food means more than
just feeding ourselves.

666
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,230
It not only satisfies
our desire to feed ourselves,

667
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,800
but also helps deal
with stress from social lives

668
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,360
and loneliness from isolation.

669
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:36,730
So our club is sort of promoting
the pleasure of dining together.

670
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,730
So what do you think?
Doesn't it sound fun?

671
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,500
No, not at all.

672
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:43,960
- Hello, senior.
- How dare you?

673
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,300
You just get up in the middle of
trying to sell quack medicine?

674
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:51,560
- I'm sorry.
- Plus, you punk...

675
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,000
You can't recruit people at
a sacred place like the cafeteria.

676
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:57,000
Where are your ethics?

677
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,900
- I'm sorry.
- Go over there and stay.

678
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,160
Hyun-ji here might
get an upset stomach.

679
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,730
I will. Please, enjoy your lunch.

680
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,730
Those who are so smooth
with words are not to be trusted.

681
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,100
You're not going to fall for what
he says and join his club, are you?

682
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,960
- It'll be a disaster.
- Of course not.

683
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,560
In-rang graduated,
but why are you still here?

684
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,230
You can't talk about that so openly.

685
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,460
It's a top secret.

686
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,930
Actually,
do you have time after lunch?

687
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,460
I have something to tell you.

688
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:57,430
(Life and Blood Sausage Soup)

689
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:12,830
You've been given such
a fantastic opportunity to be here.

690
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,900
Now, your life will be divided into

691
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:22,930
before and after
you experienced Blood Sausage Soup.

692
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,600
Kim In-rang.

693
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,700
These are
the light refreshments we prepared.

694
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,900
I hope you enjoy them.

695
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,360
Here we go again.

696
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,130
And Chun-sang
isn't a student, is he?

697
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,100
Isn't he a scam artist?

698
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,860
By promoting
academic-industrial collaboration,

699
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,030
we contribute to
local and national development,

700
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,900
and lead innovative
cultural traditions.

701
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,560
In doing so, we'd like to
contribute to your bright future.

702
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,300
Once you join
our Blood Sausage Soup...

703
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,000
No need to listen anymore. Let's go.

704
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,260
Top-notch multi-communication!

705
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:40,260
We provide speedy
and accurate service!

706
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,230
We provide
24-hour exorcism services!

707
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,730
We can do it all. Where...

708
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:48,000
Hey...

709
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,060
Hey guys.

710
00:57:51,730 --> 00:57:53,330
How could you just leave?

711
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,530
We still have part two.

712
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,160
I'm not going to join any clubs.

713
00:57:57,230 --> 00:58:00,300
- Why not?
- I need to study and graduate.

714
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,660
Gosh, isn't this too harsh?

715
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,000
You don't want to be the president
or even join the club?

716
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,330
Why don't we just
get rid of the club…

717
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,600
and work together?

718
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,530
We couldn't get any gigs
without you two.

719
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,900
Bong-pal, Hyun-ji.
We're begging you this once.

720
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,560
If our business goes bankrupt,

721
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:26,030
I will owe my grandma so much and
she will break his arms and legs.

722
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,560
She will break them.

723
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,930
Please, save my arms and legs.

724
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,160
If we work together,

725
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,830
we could really hit the jackpot.

726
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,430
Chun-sang, it's just that...

727
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:44,200
- I don't need money anymore.
- Me neither.

728
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,700
Guys, it's not
about the money, you know.

729
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,430
You need to keep in mind that

730
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:55,100
we're not doing this
to make money, right?

731
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:04,500
Have you forgotten about
the noble Blood Sausage Soup?

732
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:09,860
Like a pot that is boiling 24 hours
long at a rice soup restaurant,

733
00:59:09,930 --> 00:59:13,460
let's try to help
those who are suffering.

734
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,030
What do you think about that idea?

735
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,900
Did you already forget our promise?

736
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,030
Bong-pal. Hyun-ji.

737
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:26,260
Your power comes
with great responsibilities.

738
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,000
Will you really let
your power go to waste?

739
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:40,300
Do you know how many kids
are waiting to be rescued?

740
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,600
Hold on.

741
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,800
Hello, this is 24-hour exorcism
service, Blood Sausage Soup.

742
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:53,700
I'm your representative,
Kim In-rang. How may I help you?

743
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:00,230
A ghost? A ghost?

744
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,130
Are you hurt? Please, calm down.
Take a big breath.

745
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,500
Where are you at?
I will come right over.

746
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,730
I understand. All right then.

747
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:11,730
Gosh, what do we do?

748
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,500
These people's cries…

749
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:21,530
We can shine some
light on their misery.

750
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,860
Let's do it together.

751
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,060
- Let's go, please.
- Please.

752
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,000
Someone is hurt.

753
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,730
- Bong-pal.
- Yes?

754
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:39,260
What Chun-sang was saying
isn't entirely wrong.

755
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,530
What do you mean?

756
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:46,330
It's hard to see ghosts.

757
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,830
But we can help them
at the same time.

758
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,130
Why would you want to help ghosts?

759
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,100
Aren't they the same as us?

760
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,530
They haven't crossed
over to the other side

761
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,030
and are just lost right now.

762
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,560
Think about it.

763
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,000
Not all ghosts are bad.

764
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:13,600
They have their pain
and sadness just like us.

765
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:38,430
My son. I'm sorry.

766
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,160
- Monk Myung-chul.
- Yes?

767
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,830
Why do you exorcise?

768
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,830
It's a tough job
but doesn't pay much.

769
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,700
I help with the lingering attachment
of the ghosts who can't leave yet.

770
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,960
I help get rid of people's fear.

771
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,830
That way, everybody
finds their way back.

772
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,860
They go back to the places
where they belong.

773
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,260
That's why I do it.

774
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:39,700
Do you think I can do the job?

775
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,760
Bong-pal.

776
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,360
Do you know why I was against

777
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,160
you exorcising when I found out?

778
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,100
Not sure.

779
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,300
It was because your eyes
were full of spite then.

780
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,360
You can't see the world correctly
when you're filled with anger.

781
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,430
You were hurt by ghosts.

782
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,760
But not all ghosts are bad.

783
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:05,700
They may deserve your sympathy.

784
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,500
Are you asking
if you can do the job?

785
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,560
That's up to you.

786
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:17,460
Nothing will make you happier
than making others happy.

787
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:19,800
If your eyes can give
the deceased peace,

788
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,130
that's a gift, not a curse.

789
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,400
Why are you saying all these
nice things? That's not like you.

790
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,200
When do I ever say bad things, punk?

791
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:38,300
- I think this is your first time.
- What?

792
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,000
Eat up.

793
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,000
Ah, it's so good.

794
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,130
- This is really nice.
- Yes.

795
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,700
How long has it been?

796
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,830
Seriously, how long has it been?

797
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,500
I love going together like this!

798
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,160
Hyun-ji. Bong-pal.

799
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,630
Let's do this for
the rest of our lives!

800
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,800
Do this forever!

801
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:10,800
Let's go!

802
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,400
Bong-pal.

803
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,900
Yes?

804
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,860
Why did you change
your mind all of a sudden?

805
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:56,900
- I want to know.
- Know what?

806
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,600
The reason why we can see ghosts.

807
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,560
Let's go.

808
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,900
- Bring it on!
- Bring it on!

809
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,560
- Ghost!
- Ghost!

810
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,960
(Bring it on, Ghost)

811
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,630
(Thank you so much
for tuning into Bring it on, Ghost)
