(Episode 14)

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,760
Hyun-ji, what's wrong?
What happened?

8
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,760
Bong-pal.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,230
What should I do now?

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,560
What I saw at the hospital
wasn't a one-time thing…

11
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,860
I can see ghosts.

12
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:21,830
She's human now.
She deserves to have a normal life.

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,560
You don't know how it will affect
her if she finds out the truth.

14
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,000
- Hyun-ji.
- What should I do now?

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,560
Don't worry.

16
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,630
No matter what happens...

17
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,759
I'll protect you.

18
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,300
Bong-pal.

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,460
Yeah?

20
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,460
What was it like
when you first saw a ghost?

21
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,130
I was scared.

22
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,460
I cried and sobbed.

23
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,000
I even peed my pants.

24
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,660
Back then, like you...
I couldn't think of anything else.

25
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,360
I was frozen in place, trembling.

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,400
But one day...

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,900
I wasn't scared anymore.

28
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Bong-pal.

29
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,030
- Monk Myung-chul.
- It's okay.

30
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,330
It's okay, it's okay.

31
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,000
Look, it's leaving. Right?

32
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,860
All people live with
fear in their hearts.

33
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,830
Running every time you're scared...

34
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,530
You shouldn't do that.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,400
You have to be brave and face it.

36
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,700
What should I do
if I'm a little scared?

37
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,900
It's scary doing it alone.

38
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,100
Why are you alone?

39
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,900
I'm always behind you.

40
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,830
Let's go. Let's go home.

41
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,960
It's okay, it's okay.

42
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,400
You have nothing to be afraid of.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,060
Because I will
always be next to you.

44
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,860
Let's go.

45
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,930
Are you home?

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,330
Yes, I just got home.

47
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,930
Hurry up and go to bed.

48
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,730
I can't fall asleep.

49
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,600
Sleep well.

50
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,200
Bong-pal.

51
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,360
You're still awake?

52
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,760
I have a lot on my mind.
So I can't sleep.

53
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,030
What's that look on your face?
Did something happen?

54
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,430
- Monk Myung-chul.
- What is it?

55
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,060
Hyun-ji... can see ghosts.

56
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,659
Goodness.

57
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,330
Goodness.

58
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,100
That child can see ghosts?

59
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,400
Yes.

60
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,760
My intuition was right.

61
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,700
Is there a solution?

62
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
You said you could
fix my eyes back then.

63
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,230
Help Hyun-ji before me.
I don't want her to live

64
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,530
like me so please, help her.

65
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll do whatever I need to do
to get the money.

66
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,500
Please help her, Monk.

67
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,400
Bong-pal, she's been in
a coma for five years.

68
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,460
It's natural to see scary things
when your memories suddenly return.

69
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,200
Seeing ghosts could be temporary.

70
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,760
Don't worry too much.

71
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,330
- That's probably what it is, right?
- Of course.

72
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,030
I'm sure it will disappear
once her memories fully return.

73
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,500
Until then, make sure you
take good care of her, okay?

74
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,730
Yes.

75
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,030
Did you sleep well?

76
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,600
Yes, what about you?

77
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,760
Yes, I slept well.
What are you doing today?

78
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,360
I have to meet Professor Ju
in the morning.

79
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay, I'll see you
in the afternoon then.

80
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,430
Okay, I'll call you.

81
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,400
I miss you.

82
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,560
Hyun-ji!

83
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,060
Kim Hyun-ji, wake up!

84
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
- I'm late!
- Hyun-ji!

85
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,160
Not a single one. Looks like we're
going back empty-handed today.

86
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,960
Should we go and eat breakfast?

87
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,060
Ben!

88
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Ben, no! Don't do that!

89
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,700
What is it? Stop!
What is it?

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Puppies are scared of their
surroundings when they're born.

91
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,360
You have to take them for walks
so that fear will disappear.

92
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,300
It's important
to ease their anxiety.

93
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,330
So they need to adjust like me.

94
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,730
Of course.

95
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,160
It may not be the case right now,

96
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,960
but your mental trauma
could be huge.

97
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,230
That's why it's important
that you take it easy

98
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,830
and slowly ease back into
your daily activities.

99
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,600
How about you meet more
frequently with Happy from now on?

100
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,330
Ah, I'd like that,
but I feel like I'm bothering you.

101
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,400
Not at all. I'd like it if
you got closer to this rascal.

102
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,830
If you play with dogs frequently

103
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,430
your endorphins will increase
and the anxiety will disappear.

104
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,500
You feel emotionally stable and
it will help you out a great deal.

105
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,200
So come to the hospital
often and play with him.

106
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, I'll do that.

107
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,460
What's wrong?
Did something get in your eye?

108
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,760
Young lady, where is the item
you're supposed to give?

109
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,630
What's wrong?

110
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,530
I think the memories of
my accident have returned.

111
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,160
Don't force yourself to remember.

112
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,260
You'll remember
naturally in due time.

113
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,660
Leave the bad memories behind
and try to remember the good ones.

114
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
There's no need to
remember the bad memories.

115
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,660
Yes, I'll try to do that.

116
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,760
Hello?

117
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,930
How did you meet Bong-pal?

118
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,460
We were just... destined to meet.

119
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:31,430
- You were destined to meet?
- Yes, I think so.

120
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,930
It's hard to explain,
but I keep running into him.

121
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,930
Destiny, huh?

122
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,130
That's nice.

123
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,900
Thank you for dropping me off.
I'll see you next time.

124
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,430
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

125
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,760
You were destined to meet?

126
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,260
Interesting.

127
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,130
Why did we come here?

128
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,000
So I can buy you clothes.
Go and pick what you like.

129
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,930
Exercise clothes?

130
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

131
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,800
It's strange no matter
how much I think about it.

132
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,760
What is?

133
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,030
That monk.

134
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,800
Why did he ask for a favor
like that from us?

135
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,900
Do you by chance
know Professor Ju Hye-sung?

136
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,060
Professor Ju Hye-sung?

137
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,200
Yes, he's a veterinary
professor at our school.

138
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,260
Then can I ask you
to do me a favor?

139
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,160
Make sure you're with
Bong-pal at all times.

140
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Are you giving us permission
to exorcise ghosts with...

141
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,560
Don't be ridiculous!

142
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,700
- Then what is it?
- Stick close to Bong-pal!

143
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,930
If Professor Ju Hye-sung does
anything strange to Bong-pal...

144
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,960
Call me immediately. Got it?

145
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,600
Got it.

146
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,200
No kidding. I wonder
if something is going on

147
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,700
with Professor Ju Hye-sung.

148
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,300
So, he basically wants us
to be Bong-pal's bodyguards.

149
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,400
Bodyguards?

150
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,700
Well, it's true.
I am pretty reliable.

151
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
Where are we going?

152
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:54,500
Bong-pal asked us to do a favor
so I told him to come here.

153
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,730
Okay, I'm a ghost.

154
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
- You?
- Just think of me as a ghost.

155
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,600
When the ghost comes from
behind like this...

156
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,900
How beautiful.
You two look very beautiful.

157
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,560
- What a nice picture.
- You're here.

158
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,400
- Gosh, it's so hot today.
- I know.

159
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,600
I told you to warm up
and here you are cuddling.

160
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,300
You cute lovebirds.

161
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,130
Okay, so you need to
learn from an expert.

162
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,560
You two are nothing but amateurs.

163
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,800
If you just try to copy the moves
on the mats… You rascals…

164
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,900
- You'll get into trouble!
- Ah, he's an expert?

165
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,660
He's a kinesiology major.

166
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,030
Okay, how should we introduce
ourselves to our little lady

167
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,060
who lost her memory?

168
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,530
Did she completely forget our faces?

169
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,900
Go first, Kim In-rang,
and say, 'Nice to meet you.'

170
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,060
Hi, Hyun-ji.

171
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,130
I'm Kim In-rang.

172
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,830
I'm Choi Chun-sang.

173
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,230
I'm the CEO of Blood Sausage Soup

174
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,760
and a master of kumdo,
judo, and jujitsu.

175
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,230
You can say I'm an
expert in all these areas.

176
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,960
Yes, hello.

177
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,130
The self-defense techniques
we'll be learning today

178
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,330
are not to be used on normal people.

179
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Especially not on men. Why?

180
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,230
Because it could be fatal.

181
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,000
Senior... be careful.

182
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,460
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on her.

183
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,700
Okay, practice
as if it's a real situation.

184
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm a pervert right now.

185
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

186
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,830
You're really pretty.

187
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,900
What's your name?

188
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,530
What's your number?

189
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,660
- Senior.
- Chun-Sang.

190
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,300
Senior.

191
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,500
No, no, no, relax! Stay still!

192
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,500
It's okay, it's okay.
He's fine.

193
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,400
I hope I didn't hurt him too much.

194
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,700
Let's take a look.

195
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

196
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,760
Why didn't you mention
you're a black belt in taekwondo?

197
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,600
No wonder you were so good at
fighting when you were a ghost.

198
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,330
By the way, I hope your
memories return soon.

199
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,430
There's no need to rush.

200
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,630
Still, her memories need
to return so we can catch

201
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,300
the person who did this to her.

202
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,160
It's not fair.

203
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,260
I'm sure it will return soon.

204
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,730
I can understand that you don't
remember the accident…

205
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,830
But how could you forget Bong-pal?

206
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,900
It's the same for In-rang.

207
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
He may seem fine on the outside,
but do you know how sad he was?

208
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,200
He was crying
and bawling because of you...

209
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:05,760
Oh look, it's your favorite!
Jeotgal, jeotgal, jeotgal!

210
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,600
- Rice.
- Okay.

211
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,330
- Here.
- But why the sudden self-defense?

212
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,760
I thought it would be
of some help to Hyun-ji.

213
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,830
Working out can't be planned.

214
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,830
You have to make it as natural as
possible so you want to work out.

215
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,130
In Hyun-ji's case, she needs
a workout that stimulates

216
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,530
her mind and intellect.

217
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,100
And what would that be?

218
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,760
Thank you, Ms. Kim Hyun-ji, for
proving and believing that we exist.

219
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,900
It's been a very long time

220
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,660
since our hearts
bounced, bounced, bounced like this.

221
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,300
This song is for you, Hyun-ji.

222
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,500
Can you feel my heartbeat?

223
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,960
That is such an old song.

224
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,200
It's still beating!

225
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,460
And it's beating for you!

226
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,960
Listen to my heartbeat.

227
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,400
I still don't know that it's over.

228
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,230
I don't understand why
I'm acting like this.

229
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,730
- Listen to my heartbeat.
- It's beating for you!

230
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,130
- Listen to my heartbeat.
- It's beating for you!

231
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,830
It still hurts thinking of you.

232
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,530
I think of you
every time my heart beats.

233
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,660
- 50 points!
- We got 50 points!

234
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,830
- Go on in.
- Go home safely.

235
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,930
- I'm back.
- Hyun-ji, you're home.

236
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,130
- He's from the real estate agency.
- Hello.

237
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Yes, hello.
I'll be on my way then.

238
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,030
- Please take good care of us.
- I will.

239
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,530
- Why is he here?
- We put the house up for sale.

240
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,300
- Already?
- What do you mean already?

241
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,630
Your father is all by himself.
We need to get down there now.

242
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,830
- When are we going to leave?
- As soon as the house sells.

243
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,930
Wash up so we can eat.

244
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,130
Okay.

245
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,630
Hello?

246
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,600
- Is this Monk Myung-chul?
- Yes, I'm Myung-chul. Who is this?

247
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,130
I'm Officer Choi from
the Yangju Police Station.

248
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,900
Ah yes, hello! But why
the sudden phone call?

249
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,930
You filed a missing persons report
for Mr. Park Ji-hoon, did you not?

250
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,930
Did you find him?

251
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Yes.

252
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,760
I think so.

253
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,730
I think it'd be best if you could
come and confirm his identity.

254
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Confirm his identity?

255
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,060
Is he Park Ji-hoon?

256
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
Yes.

257
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,900
You poor soul.

258
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,760
Why are you lying here?

259
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,260
What am I supposed to do?

260
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,460
What is our Bong-pal
supposed to do?

261
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,500
Excuse me...

262
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,660
Ah, yes... thank you.

263
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,030
What do you think about
moving the body to Seoul

264
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,300
and getting an autopsy done?

265
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,160
The doctor says that
his neck is broken.

266
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,830
I don't think he died from a fall.

267
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,130
Are you saying he was murdered?

268
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,400
It would be best to get
an autopsy for the exact details.

269
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,330
Here you go.

270
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,300
A dead body was found
buried in Yangju-gun.

271
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,530
The police are stating that
the body was buried two months ago.

272
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,430
The corpse has been
revealed to be a Mr. Park

273
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,200
(Secretly Buried Body
in Yangju-gun Discovered)

274
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,900
who was filed as a missing
person one month ago.

275
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,760
An autopsy is underway to find
the exact cause of death.

276
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,930
Here is the next story.

277
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,100
Monk Myung-chul.

278
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,700
You're home.

279
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,330
- Are you going somewhere?
- To the convenience store.

280
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,230
Go inside.

281
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,730
Bong-pal.

282
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
I found your father.

283
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,830
I see. Okay.

284
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,660
Bong-pal.

285
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,300
Let's go see your father together.

286
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,700
Forget it. Go by yourself.

287
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,930
Bong-pal!

288
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,800
Come with me.

289
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,460
To see your father.

290
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,060
Monk Myung-chul.

291
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,600
Why... is my father here?

292
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,030
Why... is my father here?

293
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,830
(Medical Record: Ju Hye-sung)

294
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,230
Sir.

295
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,160
- What is it?
- Forensics called us.

296
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,830
They received a body who died
the exact same way

297
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,200
as Noh Hyun-joo did.

298
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,800
What?

299
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,000
- Let's go. Quickly.
- Yes, sir!

300
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
The body was
discovered in Gangwondo.

301
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:44,200
It's the same
as Noh Hyun-joo's case.

302
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,300
He died after his neck was broken.

303
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,560
Before that happened,
he must've been in a fight.

304
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,430
His body has bruises all over.

305
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,930
The culprit's DNA should
be on his body then.

306
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,060
We won't know for sure
until an autopsy is done.

307
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,300
- But it's possible.
- When will it be done?

308
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,700
It'll start immediately as soon
as the family gives consent.

309
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,060
(Autopsy Consent Form)

310
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,800
This is the consent form
for your father's autopsy.

311
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,930
The police are saying that
your father's death is suspicious.

312
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,700
They need consent
from the family first.

313
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,860
Think carefully before
you sign your name.

Hey!

322
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,560
What the heck, Bong-pal?
Why aren't you picking up?

323
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,100
What did you say?

324
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,030
Nothing.

325
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,600
You're dead if you
ignore my texts again.

326
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,430
You have 10 minutes.

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,760
Where did he go?

333
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,930
I was thinking about doing
therapy outside the hospital.

334
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,030
What do you think?

335
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,730
- Hyun-ji.
- Yes?

336
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,260
- Is something wrong?
- No.

337
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,060
Where are you thinking about going?

338
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,260
There is a place Happy likes.
It'll take some time though.

339
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:15,060
Hey, Park Bong-pal.
How can you do that?

340
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:18,060
- Hyun-ji?
- Yes.

341
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,560
Who is this?

342
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,330
How is Bong-pal doing?

343
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,100
Oh no, I will be right there.

344
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,400
Thank you.

345
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,100
Bong-pal.

346
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
Hyun-ji.

347
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,460
Why didn't you call me?

348
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,660
Sorry, I've been too busy.

349
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,460
What do you mean you're sorry?

350
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,230
What are you going to do, Bong-pal?

351
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,030
It's okay.

352
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,630
It's time to go.

353
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,630
Okay.

354
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,900
Let's talk later.

355
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,000
- You came.
- Hello.

356
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,030
- You're the monk who called me?
- Correct.

357
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,460
- Thank you for coming.
- No problem.

358
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,100
Monk Myung-chul.

359
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,560
- He's Bong-pal's father, right?
- Yes.

360
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,460
Please help me do well on
the college entrance exams.

361
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,500
I've met him before.

362
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,100
What did you say?

363
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,100
You've met him before?

364
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,930
When and where?

365
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,930
It was at a temple five years ago.

366
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,230
- Young lady, can I ask you a favor?
- Pardon?

367
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,800
Can you take this to my son?
It has his address.

368
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,330
You can't let anyone see it, okay?

369
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,929
- I'm begging you.
- Wait...

370
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,500
He asked me to do him
a favor and gave me something.

371
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,830
He asked me to give it to his son.

372
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,530
He also asked me
not to show it to anyone.

373
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,460
Did you?

374
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,730
Did you see what was inside?

375
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,760
(Park Bong-pal, Daehan Study,
Seokjeong-dong, Seoul)

376
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,760
Park Bong-pal...

377
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,460
Hyun-ji.

378
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,430
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

379
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,060
Do you happen to remember
where you put it?

380
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,460
No, I don't remember anything else.

381
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:23,360
It's okay. Get some rest.

382
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,260
Why don't you stay here and rest?

383
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,630
Hyun-ji.

384
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,730
That is very important to Bong-pal.

385
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,530
If you remember,
please tell me, okay?

386
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,700
- I will.
- Get some rest.

387
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,200
Thank you for coming.

388
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm very sorry for your loss.

389
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,430
You bastard!

390
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,830
What are you doing?

391
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,900
How can you possibly show up here?

392
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,800
I came because I worried
about my student.

393
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,860
- Is that a problem?
- You think I don't know?

394
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,100
I don't know what
you're talking about.

395
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,030
- Please, let go of me.
- 18 years ago.

396
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,430
I can still sense the traces
of that evil spirit within you.

397
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,460
You think I wouldn't have recognized
it if you tried to hide it from me?

398
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,460
The spirit that came out of
Bong-pal is still very much

399
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,530
alive in your eyes.

400
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,900
Can you?

401
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,560
You killed Bong-pal's mother.

402
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,360
As if that wasn't enough,
you killed Bong-pal's father.

403
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,930
How many more do you
have to kill before you stop?

404
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,730
Then why did you kick me
out of Bong-pal's body?

405
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,600
- This is all because of you.
- You!

406
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,530
You're that evil spirit I drove out!

407
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,400
So what can you do now?

408
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,030
I warned you, didn't I?

409
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,600
Too much curiosity can kill you.

410
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,960
- Get the heck out of that body!
- If I leave, this guy will die.

411
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,530
We're one body now.

412
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,330
Do you want someone else to die?

413
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,660
You are mistaken here.

414
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,400
I saved his life.

415
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,630
I saved him from hell.

416
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,960
You're bad luck. Get lost!

417
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,500
Your mom killed your dad.

418
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,500
Murderer.

419
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,730
Let's go.

420
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,330
My mom is not a murderer.
She is not.

421
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,030
- My mom is not a murderer.
- What is he doing?

422
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,360
I'm the one who killed that bastard.

423
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,230
You might want to
stay out of my way.

424
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,900
Bong-pal could get killed this time.

425
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,360
Maybe it's better to have a double
funeral for father and son?

426
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,760
You bastard!

427
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,560
What do you think you're doing?

428
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,360
What do you think? Does this hurt?

429
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,500
This is how you threaten someone.

430
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,030
If you want to hold onto
your pathetic life,

431
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,660
you might want to stay quiet.

432
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,560
I will spare you this time
for old times' sake.

433
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,430
I will snap your neck next time.

434
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,060
Hope everything goes well
with the funeral.

435
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,800
Tell Bong-pal that I came by
to pay my respects.

436
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,030
Monk Myung-chul.

437
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
Monk Myung-chul.

438
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,430
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

439
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,730
It's nothing.

440
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,060
- Sir.
- Yes?

441
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,060
The autopsy results
for Park Ji-hoon.

442
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,930
There were traces of DNA
found under his fingernails.

443
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,460
A male with blood type B.

444
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,100
- What is Ju's blood type?
- It's B.

445
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,100
- We have his DNA. File a warrant.
- I will.

446
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,930
Now we've got you.

447
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,800
Bong-pal, don't go anywhere.
Stay home.

448
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,960
- Pull yourself together.
- Don't worry.

449
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,560
- Thank you.
- Sure.

450
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,460
Hyun-ji, you did well at the funeral.

451
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,760
I didn't do anything.

452
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,100
Hyun-ji.

453
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,200
How do you know Professor Ju?

454
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:55,300
He's helping me with my
psychotherapy. Why do you ask?

455
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,930
By any chance...

456
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,960
It's nothing. Nothing.

457
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,600
Please, take care of him.

458
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,200
- I will.
- Thank you.

459
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,660
Bong-pal.

460
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm okay. Don't worry.

461
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,560
You haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

462
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,930
- Let's go eat something.
- I'm okay.

463
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,560
I'm tired so I'm going to rest.
I will see you later.

464
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,060
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

465
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,130
Get some rest then.

466
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,630
(Park Ji-hoon)

467
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:22,660
(My dear son, Bong-pal.
I wonder how you are...)

468
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,660
(I always think about you)

469
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,730
(I'm so sorry to you.
I hope you can understand me someday)

470
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,600
I'm sorry, Dad.

471
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,930
I'm sorry.

472
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:57,500
I'm sorry, Dad.

473
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,860
I'm sorry.

474
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,800
I'm sorry, Dad.

475
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,430
I'm sorry, Dad.

476
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,930
I'm sorry.

477

(Flower Virgin Shamaness)

478
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,960
So you're saying that the girl
was given the weapon

479
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:44,230
by Bong-pal's father?

480
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,000
Correct.

481
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,730
That's why she got into an accident.

482
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,430
- She doesn't remember where it is.
- Gosh.

483
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,000
It is an ill-fated relationship.

484
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,800
But we should let her
know what's going on at least.

485
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,830
That it was Professor Ju
who hit her with his car.

486
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,260
He's around the girl.

487
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,600
If we tell her and
the evil spirit finds out,

488
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,860
she might be put in more danger.

489
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,300
What about Bong-pal?

490
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:17,160
He should know
who killed his dad at least.

491
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,260
I don't know if I should
tell him or not.

492
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,260
Why is the evil spirit
so obsessed with that weapon?

493
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,760
If it's that powerful, he should
run away. Don't you think?

494
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:31,560
It can threaten his life
so he's trying to get rid of it.

495
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,930
Then what will he do next?

496
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:41,230
He's not after Bong-pal, is he?

497
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,860
Please, keep this here.

498
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,300
- I'm home.
- Are you?

499
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,730
Can you come help?

500
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,130
What are you doing?
Why are you packing already?

501
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,760
Ah, this place has been sold.

502
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:15,860
A newlywed couple
signed the contract yesterday.

503
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,900
Why are you standing there?
Go pack up your room.

504
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,130
The movers are coming
tomorrow morning.

505
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:26,300
Mom, can I stay here?

506
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,060
What are you talking about?

507
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:30,560
Why stay here?
Where would you stay?

508
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:33,260
I can stay at my uncle's.

509
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:38,560
Is this because of Bong-pal?

510
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,330
Hyun-ji, it's only been a month
since you regained consciousness.

511
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,430
You were in a coma for a long time.

512
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,000
That's why you were
drawn to his kind gestures.

513
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,500
But you shouldn't do that.

514
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,800
When you see your old friends
back in our neighborhood,

515
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,830
you will change your mind.

516
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,630
No. I can't leave Bong-pal.

517
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,630
Do you know how hard
things are for him?

518
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,860
I have to be there for him.

519
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:07,130
I can agree to
everything else but this.

520
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,860
You should study hard
and take the GED.

521
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,300
And go to college, too.

522
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,330
I'm not telling you
to break up with him.

523
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,360
If you get into college
after you go home and study hard,

524
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,360
you can see him again then.
Don't you think?

525
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm going out for a bit.

526
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:29,300
Hyun-ji! You...

527
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,900
Bong-pal, you're in there, right?

528
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,430
Open this door, Bong-pal.

529
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,030
I'm leaving tomorrow.

530
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,930
We're moving back to my dad's.

531
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,030
So...

532
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,830
before I leave...

533
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,860
I wanted to see you.

534
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,300
I will come back soon.

535
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,600
Wait for me, Bong-pal.

536
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,600
I will call you.
You need to answer, okay?

537
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:40,060
(Byeolnim Animal Clinic)

538
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,200
Hyun-ji.

539
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,230
Professor Ju.

540
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,300
What brings you here?

541
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,600
You don't look too well.
Is something wrong?

542
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:58,200
- It's nothing.
- Do you want to come in?

543
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,060
You don't look too well.
Come in and have some tea.

544
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:29,600
(Bong-pal, are you sleeping?)

545
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,600
(What are you doing?)

546
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,600
(Park Bong-pal?/Bong-pal.../Hey!)

547
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,600
(You're dead if you
ignore my texts again)

548
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,600
(You have 10 minutes)

549
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,660
(Take care of yourself and call me)

550
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,260
Is anyone home?

551
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:41,600
I'm with the police.

552
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,330
Monk Myung-chul? Park Bong-pal?

553
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:58,800
Please, come in.

554
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:10,000
I realize you just had
to deal with a funeral…

555
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,030
I'm sorry I had to
barge in like this.

556
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,260
It's okay.

557
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,460
Are the autopsy results out yet?

558
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,830
Yes.

559
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:26,560
It appears that
your dad was murdered.

560
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,060
So we have a few questions for you.

561
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,430
Do you know how
your dad knew Professor Ju?

562
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,800
Professor Ju?

563
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,160
Does he have something
to do with my dad's death?

564
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,800
I can't be too sure,
but it's very likely.

565
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,230
So tell me anything you can think of.

566
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,660
It doesn't matter how trivial it is.

567
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,360
Monk Myung-chul, where are you?

568
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,130
Monk Myung-chul.

569
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,830
By chance, did you know?

570
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,060
What do you mean?

571
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,130
The detective came by.

572
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:40,430
He asked me about Professor Ju.

573
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:51,860
Professor Ju has something
to do with my dad's death.

574
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,360
Bong-pal.

575
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,330
Professor Ju is not human.

576
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,930
To be exact…

577
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,360
an inhuman force
is inside his body.

578
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:13,230
An evil spirit.

579
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:20,360
The evil spirit that came out of
your body a long time ago

580
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:25,500
has been hanging
around you and Hyun-ji.

581
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,030
Hyun-ji?

582
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,700
She has what he wants.

583
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,530
What's wrong?

584
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,960
I just feel dizzy.

585
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,930
Excuse me, I'm going to
use the restroom.

586
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,100
(My Love Bong Bong)

587
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,160
The caller you are trying
to reach is unavailable...

588
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,360
(Bring it on, Ghost)

589
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,700
- Is Hyun-ji home?
- Is this your car?

590
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,830
I said just go. Why bother me?

591
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,000
- I have to find Hyun-ji.
- He'll be after you then.

592
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,860
- You will be in danger.
- What about Hyun-ji?

593
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,330
What are you going to do?

594
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,300
I have to finish
what I couldn't 18 years ago.

595
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,630
- Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji!
- If you still can't find her...

596
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,260
If it happened five years ago,
we're at the wrong place.

597
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,000
You're no longer needed.
I will let you rest now.

598
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,130
I will end you today,
you evil spirit!

599
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,330
Monk Myung-chul!
