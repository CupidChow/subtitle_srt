Goodness, where am I?

8
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,530
I went down the wrong path.

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,560
Just who in the world would drag
a corpse here and bury it?

10
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,100
I know. He's a sly bastard.

15
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,500
- Who said you could come in here?
- Huh?

16
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,260
I just... I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.

17
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,730
- Why are you staring at me?
- What?

18
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,400
Just because.

19
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,100
Why the suit all of a sudden?
Are you going somewhere?

20
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,360
- Yes.
- Somewhere nice? I want to go, too!

21
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,060
It won't be any fun
if you follow me. Don't come.

22
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,660
Liar. I know you're
trying to leave me behind.

23
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,329
I'm going to follow you.

24
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,660
Today is the anniversary
of Hong Myung-hee's death.

25
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:38,500
May she rest in peace...

26
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,030
Today is the anniversary
of his mother's death.

27
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,260
Why don't you eat before you go?

28
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,800
That's okay.

29
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,900
You still haven't heard
from your father yet, right?

30
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Why would he call me
when he hasn't called you?

31
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,300
Goodness, why do I feel so strange?

32
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm leaving.

33
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,760
- Sure, I'll see you at home.
- Okay.

34
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,900
Wow, the weather is so hot today.
It must be summer now. Right?

35
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,000
Bong-pal, do you want
to hear something funny?

36
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,460
What do you think is the
loneliest monster in the world?

37
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,060
- What are you doing?
- Come on, guess! What is it?

38
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,430
I don't know.

39

Solo-mon.

40
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,430
What kind of doctor is Dr. Pepper?

41
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,530
- The soda?
- He was a Fizzsician.

42
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,400
He has a doctorate in Fizz-ics!

43
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
- Are you having fun?
- Aren't you?

44
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,530
Where do sheep get their wool cut?

45
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,400
The baa-baa shop.

46
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,000
The baa-baa shop…

47
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,030
You smiled!
See? I told you it's funny.

48
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,360
- It wasn't funny at all.
- You know you did.

49
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,700
You smiled.

50
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,300
- What is this then?
- Don't. Just don't.

51
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,000
- It's funny! Guess one more, okay?
- No!

52
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,300
What is this?

53
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,560
Ah, they're new club members
who just joined our club.

54
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,330
Two people, at that.

(Im Seo-yeon/Park Bong-pal)

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,130
What is this?

57
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,830
I wonder what this is?

58
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,060
Here's the repair fee.
Take it and give us our key.

59
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,730
You're late.
Ghostnet has already been disbanded.

60
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,200
You should've come sooner.
The voting is over as well.

61
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,600
So when you say it's disbanded…
you're saying our club

62
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,600
has been terminated...

63
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:53,860
Chun-sang, what is he talking about?

64
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,060
I knew this would happen
so I prepared this.

65
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,860
A new club request form.

66
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,530
The manager
has even signed off on it.

67
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,900
It's been signed.

68
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Chun-sang,
when did you prepare all this?

69
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,800
The club's name
is Blood Sausage Soup.

70
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,760
Blood sausage soup?

No winter lasts forever…

73
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,460
God... thank you.

74
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:21,230
It's still here! It's our table!

75
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,600
It's ours, Chun-sang.

76
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,930
Chun-sang!

77
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,130
Chun-sang,
this isn't a dream, right?

78
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,330
If it is, I don't want to wake up.

79
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,430
Does it hurt?

80
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,500
- Yes, it hurts. I think it's real.
- I thought so.

81
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,230
- You were scared, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.

82
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,660
This is the perfect day
to have a picnic.

83
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,300
Bong-pal, should we pack some
kimbap and go on a picnic?

84
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,230
Picnic, my butt.

85
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,600
I have finals to study for and
you need to study for your exams.

86
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,400
You only think about
having fun all the time.

87
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,860
You have to take a break on a day
like this in order to study better.

88
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,960
- Is that so?
- Yes.

89
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,600
You sound like you've
been studying for a very long time.

90
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,030
It's barely been a week
since you started.

91
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,200
You're so unromantic.

92
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,660
Hey.

93
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,900
Why are you blushing?

94
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,030
What do you mean?

95
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,800
Are you okay?

96
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,060
What's wrong with her now?

97
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,730
Seriously,
what's the matter with me?

98
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,300
It's still racing.

99
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,100
Hyun-ji!

100
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,660
Kyung-ja, you're still here?
You haven't found that man yet?

101
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,900
Yes. I think I'm going to
have to set up shop here

102
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,060
until I find my honey.

103
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,630
What's with the look on your face?

104
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,230
Just because.

105
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,360
Kyung-ja, I think there's
something wrong with me.

106
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,560
In what way?

107
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,430
Can ghosts' hearts race like this?

108
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,260
Ghosts have the same feelings
they did when they were alive.

109
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,830
Yes, that can happen.
But why do you ask?

110
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,660
I don't know.

111
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,700
I don't know when it started,
but my heart races

112
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,330
whenever I see Bong-pal.

113
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,760
And I suddenly get nervous.

114
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,860
You get nervous? And?

115
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
It hurts here.

116
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,060
There's something wrong
with me, isn't there?

117
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,330
From what I see,
I think you like him.

118
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,060
What?

119
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,530
- I have feelings for Bong-pal?
- Yes.

120
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,900
You said your heart races
whenever you see him.

121
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,330
That means you like him.

122
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,260
There's no way! Absolutely not!

123
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,460
Oh yeah?

124
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,560
If that's not the case...

125
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,600
Maybe you have
some sort of heart disease?

126
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,330
It must be nice to go on a retreat.

127
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,100
How great would it be to dunk your
feet in a river on a day like this?

128
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,460
- That sounds awesome.
- With a slice of cold watermelon.

129
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,030
And in the evening,
we'd sit around a bonfire...

130
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,400
And drink beer! Just pop
a cold can of beer and...

131
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,230
No. No…
let's go on a retreat, too!

132
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,760
We have new members
and our club back.

133
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,600
It'll be a celebration
and founding of our new club!

134
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,130
Founding?
That sounds good! I love it!

135
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,530
But do you think Bong-pal will go?

136
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
What do you think?

137
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,130
Put both hands together and
raise them straight to the ceiling.

138
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,860
Raise your left arm
and look up at the ceiling.

139
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:28,160
Stretch your leg back as you stretch
the left arm in front of you.

140
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,030
Slowly lower your leg.

141
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,800
Why did we come here?

142
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,130
We have to take
Bong-pal to the retreat.

143
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,930
Our secret weapon is over there.

144
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,860
Excuse me, Ms. Im Seo-yeon.

145
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

146
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,600
We were admitted to the university
in 2010 and took four years off

147
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,030
due to financial hardship
and serving our country. Not once...

148
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,930
Not once did we go on
a retreat during our time here

149
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,930
at Myongsung University.

150
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,730
We really want to go.

151
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,400
We want to go and experience
this awesome moment while

152
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,030
we're still in college.

153
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,100
But with retreats, two is better
than one, three is better than two,

154
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,430
and four is better than three.

155
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:31,700
It's not easy for us to ask
this big favor from you.

156
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,760
You want me to go on
a retreat with you guys, right?

157
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,160
Yes, that's correct.

158
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,660
Why did Kyung-ja say that?
That doesn't make sense!

159
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,900
Why would I like him?

160
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,530
Sorry!

161
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,430
Thank you.

162
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,730
Maybe Kyung-ja was right.

163
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,260
I told you to be aware
of your surroundings.

164
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh... I was preoccupied, so...

165
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,930
Why don't you be
preoccupied with studying?

166
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,600
Also, where do you
keep roaming around?

167
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,200
Why?

168
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,660
Were you bored without me in class?

169
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't think so.

170
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,430
It was actually really nice
to be able to focus in class

171
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,930
without you there.

172
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,630
No, no. There's no way
I would like a guy like him.

173
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,230
Bong-pal.

174
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,560
What do you think, Bong-pal?

175
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,460
A retreat?

176
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,760
It's not just any retreat.
It's membership training.

177
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,530
It will be the founding
of the Blood Sausage Soup club

178
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,829
and welcome orientation
for the new members.

179
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,730
A variety, spectacular,
action, suspense retreat!

180
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, a retreat?

181
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,930
It sounds like fun! Let's go!

182
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,200
I'm not really feeling it.

183
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,430
You don't have to prepare anything.

184
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,530
The car, food, location...

185
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,000
And the various activities
are all in one full package.

186
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,960
Let's go! It's for free!
You like free!

187
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,500
Huh?

188
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,100
Well, if you're not feeling it...

189
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,500
Im Seo-yeon mentioned she's
pretty exhausted from her studies.

190
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,700
She agreed to come along.

191
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, if you're not
feeling it, then...

192
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,130
Maybe we shouldn't go.
It doesn't sound like fun.

193
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,160
Ah, I hear it might rain tomorrow.

194
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,460
So, are you not going to go?

195
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,160
I guess it's just us three then.

196
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,600
Yeah, it's just us three.

197
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,900
Hey, let's not go.

198
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,560
Well... I'll think about going.

199
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,830
- Let's make it four then.
- Okay.

200
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,030
Detective, the dead body
has been identified.

201
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,360
Noh Hyun-joo.

202
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,530
She's a Myongsung University student.

203
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
- Yes.
- The cause of death?

204
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,530
She died of asphyxiation.

205
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,760
It's most likely she was strangled
by someone's hands.

206
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,100
Her neck was broken.

207
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,660
How is that possible
with human hands?

208
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,630
Well... I'm not sure.

209
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,330
Did you check about where had
she been before her death.

210
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,800
Yes, the day before her death,

211
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,560
she was supposed to go to class
that day, but she skipped it.

212
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,930
There's no trace of
her whereabouts after that.

213
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,260
She missed class?
What class was it?

214
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,130
It's a humanities class.

215
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,300
A class called Animal Society
taught by Professor Ju Hye-sung.

216
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,130
It seems like she was
very interested in animals.

217
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,200
- Welcome.
- Hello.

218
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,730
- Seo-yeon.
- Hello, Professor.

219
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,530
What brings you here?

220
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,760
Hi, Byul! Have you been well?

221
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,660
Is Byul sick? He looks healthy.

222
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,700
No. I was hoping you could
watch him tomorrow.

223
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yes, there's a club retreat.

224
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,560
A retreat? How exciting.

225
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,460
What club is it?

226
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,360
I'm not sure what club it is...

227
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,430
Oh, Bong-pal is in the club, too.

228
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,160
Then Bong-pal must be going as well.

229
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,230
Yes.

230
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,760
- So...
- Yes?

231
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,160
Here.

232
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,660
Thank you for everything
and for Byul as well.

233
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,230
Oh, it's fine.
You shouldn't have.

234
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,560
Wow, the present is small, though.

235
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,130
Pardon?

236
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm kidding. Can I open it?

237
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
Yes.

238
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,060
It's a fountain pen.

239
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,800
I was just about to buy one.
This is perfect. Thank you.

240
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,300
You're welcome.

241
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,030
- It's just you and me, Byul.
- Say hi to the professor.

242
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
Oh, he's gotten big.

243
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,160
When I asked, you didn't
want to go on a picnic

244
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,160
with me because of class.

245
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,730
- What's up with that?
- That class wasn't that urgent.

246
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,160
I need to study for
my college entrance exams, too!

247
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,100
Let's just study at home.
I'm really going to study hard!

248
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,060
You said we needed to take
a break once in a while.

249
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,600
Once you start having fun,
you can't stop.

250
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,700
Let's stay home, okay?

251
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,460
Then you stay home and study.
I never said I was taking you.

252
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,030
What?

253
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Hey!

254
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,760
I told you not to follow me.
Why did you come?

255
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,200
Well, you'll be gone. What am
I going to do at home by myself?

256
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,160
I won't be able to take care of you
because there are too many people.

257
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,360
- I know that.
- Bong-pal.

258
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,760
Seo-yeon!

259
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,600
It's just a retreat.
Why is she all dressed up?

260
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,730
It's not like you're
going to a fashion show.

261
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,360
It's that car again?

262
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,360
How are we
all going to fit in there?

263
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,830
- Get in!
- Get in!

264
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,230
The sky is open to us!

265
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,500
I have you!

266
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,730
It's kind of tight
back there, isn't it?

267
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,300
Sorry about all that stuff.

268
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,530
We only have an hour
to go so hang in there.

269
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,760
We have to stay like
this for an hour?

270
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,900
- Darn it!
- Be patient. We're almost there.

271
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,100
You know,
you two look like a couple.

272
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,430
Bong-pal has a sky blue shirt on
and so does Seo-yeon. Sky blue!

273
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,900
It's not sky blue!
Bong-pal's shirt is sea blue!

274
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,530
Watch how you're driving!

275
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,760
Gosh, I'm so tired.

276
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,200
This place is very nice.

277
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,800
How did they rent this?

278
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,160
Wow, whose vacation home is this?

279
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,300
This vacation home belongs to my
one and only junior, my best friend.

280
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,430
They call him Young Master at home.

281
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,360
This is In-rang's vacation home.

282
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,660
Young Master? Really?

283
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,260
It's unexpected, right?

284
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,960
It is surprising.
Our In-rang is that kind of person.

285
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,200
He's very wealthy,
but he doesn't show it.

286
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,860
He's such a humble man.
Just your average Joe.

287
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,700
Is that a compliment?

288
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,860
Of course.

289
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,300
This vacation home is really nice.

290
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
What's wrong with him?

291
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,600
Don't worry about him.
He gets speechless around women.

292
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,360
He's very bashful and shy.

293
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,360
Okay then, let's take our
belongings and enter the premises!

294
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,700
What are you doing? Hurry up
and open the door! This is heavy!

295
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,860
I think my grandma
changed the passcode.

296
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,230
What?

297
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
- You didn't know she changed it?
- I didn't ask.

298
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,200
My grandma will kill you if she
finds out that I came here with you.

299
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,300
Why does your grandma
always want to kill me?

300
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,200
Just try anything.

301
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,600
My grandma's birthday!

302
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,230
This is In-rang's
vacation home for sure.

303
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,930
Gosh, how strange.

304
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,060
- Please be careful next time.
- Thank you.

305
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,900
- It's really my vacation home!
- It's definitely is!

306
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,760
Did your grandma throw a fit?

307
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,560
She asked if 'he' was
there and I said no.

308
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,630
- Who is he?
- You.

309
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,860
Good job!

310
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,900
- Please, come in.
- Okay.

311
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,400
- Gosh, this is heavy!
- Come in.

312
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,700
- This is nice.
- Oh my!

313
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,400
- This house is really nice.
- Stay still.

314
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,560
I don't want to.
I wonder what's upstairs.

315
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm going to bring
the rest of our stuff inside.

316
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,930
That's great.
What's gotten into you?

317
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,930
Let's go together.
I'll help you.

318
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,900
Okay, let's go.

319
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,560
Wait a minute.
Let's take this bag upstairs.

320
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,560
- Okay?
- Huh? Why?

321
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,730
Hold on, let me rest
on this for a bit.

322
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,960
Come on,
let's take the bags upstairs.

323
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,430
This place is so nice.

324
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,330
Hurry up, will you?

325
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,760
Are you okay?

326
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,960
Are you an angel?

327
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,660
What happened? What's going on?

328
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,630
In-rang, wake up!

329
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,830
Are you okay? You scared me.

330
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,060
Chun-sang, I saw an angel.

331
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,230
Don't be ridiculous.
You almost became an angel.

332
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,130
No, I really saw an angel.
She was right in front of me.

333
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,500
You poor boy. You almost
crossed over to the other side.

334
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,130
Let me see if there's a hole
in the back of your head.

335
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,300
There's no hole.

336
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,460
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay!

337
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,900
Still, you never know,
so let's rest for a bit. Come here

338
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,430
and get on my back.

339
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,030
Come here. Okay, let's go.

340
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm glad to see he's alright.

341
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,230
But did he see me?

342
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,530
Ms… Ms. Angel.

343
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,430
Angel.

344
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,430
An... Angel.

345
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,860
Are you okay?

346
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,660
Ms. Angel, I'm fine! I'm fine!

347
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,360
Please don't worry, I'm fine.

348
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,300
I completely forgot
to bring the ramen.

349
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,860
Ramen is the best
after drinking, isn't it?

350
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,160
Bong-pal.

351
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,930
There's a little grocery
store down the street.

352
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,360
Can you go and buy some?

353
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,500
Okay.

354
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,500
And if it's boring to go by
yourself, Seo-yeon can go with you.

355
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,160
Yeah, I'll go with you.
I have to buy some stuff anyway.

356
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,300
Okay, sure.

357
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,160
I'll just take care of this first.

358
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,060
Sure, sure, sure.

359
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,500
Let me get my wallet from the car.
I forgot to bring it with me.

360
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,730
Okay.

361
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,630
What's for dinner tonight?

362
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,960
Oh, meat! Nice!

363
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Bong-pal.

364
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,500
Take your time buying the ramen.

365
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,000
No, you can make the ramen.
Take your sweet time, okay?

366
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,500
Take advantage
of this romantic moment!

367
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,260
I am the messenger of love.
The bridge of love.

368
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,100
Okay.

369
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,230
Bong-pal, where are you going?
Are you going to buy ramen?

370
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,130
- What the heck?
- Love is in the air.

371
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,260
Oh, ramen.

372
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,400
I am the bridge of love!

373
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,460
What the heck?

374
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,400
Bong-pal.

375
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,530
You don't need to go get ramen.
We have some inside.

376
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,330
He did that to tease you
so don't go.

377
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Bong-pal.

378
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,060
Don't go.
We already have ramen.

379
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,600
Seo-yeon has something
to get anyway.

380
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,460
She can go alone.
Tell her to go alone.

381
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,830
- Bong-pal, let's go.
- Sure.

382
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,360
Stay quiet.
I will be right back.

383
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,730
This one, too, please.

384
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,100
- Did you get everything?
- Yes.

385
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,530
Oh my, you look strong
and you look pretty.

386
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,060
Are you two dating?

387
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,000
No, we're not.

388
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,400
- We go to school together.
- That's how it always starts.

389
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,900
Let's see…
there are four ice creams.

390
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,060
Oh, wait a second.

391
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,030
One more, please.

392
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,860
Who is this for?
There are only four of us.

393
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,430
- I just really like ice cream.
- I see.

394
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,860
They were begging
so I just came along.

395
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,160
But I'm glad that I came.

396
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,560
I've only been going back and forth
between home and school.

397
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,030
Me too.

398
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,360
Isn't it surprising that

399
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,430
you and I came to
this retreat together?

400
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,160
We weren't close until we started
taking Professor Ju's class.

401
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,560
You're right.

402
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,760
What's with that answer?

403
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,330
Do you feel like
that we're not that close?

404
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,330
No, I do.

405
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,930
I'm kidding.

406
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,560
Gosh, it's hot.

407
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
Wait.

408
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,060
Thanks.

409
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,860
Let's go.

410
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,530
How did you end up
falling and rolling down?

411
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,130
Did you fall on the stairs
or trip on your own?

412
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,660
Can you just go get me some water?

413
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,660
You just want me to get you water?

414
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,830
Sure.

415
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,500
- We're back.
- Hey.

416
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,330
Oh my, are you hurt?

417
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
My head...

418
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,630
What is he saying?

419
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,530
Why did you get back so early?

420
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,930
Why didn't you take your time?

421
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,630
Here it is.

422
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,030
- Are you okay?
- Of course, I am.

423
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,200
By the way, what's up with him?

424
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,500
He just fell
and rolled down the stairs.

425
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,660
In-rang, here's ice cream.

426
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Sorry.

427
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,530
There are two left.

428
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,300
I will eat these two then.

429
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,930
This one is mine.

430
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You ate yours on the way here.

431
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,060
I like ice cream.

432
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:52,030
I got it. You're such a pig.

433
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,330
I will let you have it.

434
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:12,730
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji.

435
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,000
- Here.
- I don't want it.

436
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,460
Are you sure? I will eat it then.

437
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,360
Since when do you care about me?

438
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,500
See? This is boring here, isn't it?

439
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,500
It's not boring at all.

440
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,159
Wow, this sausage looks awesome.

441
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,860
Let's all grab a drink…

442
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,930
Wow, alcohol.

443
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,600
- In-rang, come over now.
- Sure.

444
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:08,900
Now let's celebrate
our first retreat.

445
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,400
Let's toast to that.

446
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,400
I say 'blood sausage'
and you say 'soup.'

447
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,560
- To Blood Sausage Soup!
- To Blood Sausage Soup!

448
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,330
If you're not going to drink it,
why not give it to me?

449
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,160
You shouldn't drink.

450
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,500
Wow...

451
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,030
- Meat!
- Meat!

452
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,130
Meat. Meat. Meat.

453
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,530
In-rang, hurry up. Hurry!

454
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,360
Here we have meat.
Have some meat.

455
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,430
Now we will go get the meat.

456
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,760
Bong-pal, the meat looks good.
Can I have some meat?

457
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,830
Meat. Meat.

458
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,730
In-rang, there wasn't any beef
when you were buying pork?

459
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,300
Oh my, thanks.

460
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,100
I'm in the athletic department.
I should eat beef.

461
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,030
- Just eat what we have here.
- Okay.

462
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,930
I understand.

463
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,730
Bong-pal, the sausage
is good, too. Try some.

464
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,260
I will.

465
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:15,060
Wow, it's beautiful to see
how Seo-yeon takes care of Bong-pal.

466
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,330
Give that to me.

467
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,900
Why don't you two start dating?

468
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,760
- Oh my.
- Funny.

469
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
- What are you talking about?
- Why not? You're both single.

470
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,930
Two lonely single
people could go out.

471
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,730
- Go out! Go out!
- Go out! Go out!

472
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,260
True. You could do that.

473
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,200
- They can't do that.
- That's enough.

474
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,730
We've been hearing that a lot today.

475
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,730
It may be because
we're dressed alike today.

476
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,360
Probably.

477
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,860
It's weird that the smoke
only goes in her direction.

478
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,330
- It's because she's pretty.
- You're right. She's pretty.

479
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,260
- Now it's coming toward me.
- No, it isn't.

480
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,160
- Let's switch seats.
- It's okay.

481
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,460
- Wow, it's beautiful.
- Wow.

482
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:21,600
Oh, you...

483
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:35,560
- To Blood Sausage Soup!
- To Blood Sausage Soup!

484
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,960
- Alright then.
- Thank you.

485
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,430
Excuse me,
are you Professor Ju Hye-sung?

486
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,630
We should've called first.

487
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,600
We were in a hurry
so please excuse us.

488
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,600
No, it's okay.

489
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,260
How can I help you?

490
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,860
Are you aware of a student in
your class named Noh Hyun-joo?

491
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,860
Noh Hyun-joo is a dance major.

492
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,200
That's right. When was
the last time you saw her?

493
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,800
She's been absent
for the last two weeks.

494
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,960
That's probably
when I saw her last…

495
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,230
- Did something happen?
- She was found dead.

496
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,760
What? Found dead?

497
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,730
Were there any students
close to her in your class?

498
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,460
Or anyone who fought
for her attention?

499
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,860
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

500
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,600
I took over the class
in the middle of the semester.

501
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,160
I don't have any personal
information on the students.

502
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,800
That's what we heard.

503
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,130
Thank you for your time.

504
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,230
Wait.

505
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,830
If you think of anything,

506
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,160
please, call this number.

507
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,800
I will.

508
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:05,130
- Thank you.
- No problem.

509
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,260
Oh my, it's hot.

510
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:22,530
- What is it?
- Nothing.

511
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,660
Just go in there!

512
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,030
- Wait.
- Shoot.

513
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,960
There's a rock between my toes.

514
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,130
We've come all the way here
and you're not going to jump in?

515
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,660
- You're no fun.
- I'm okay here.

516
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,060
- It feels cool.
- I'm okay, too.

517
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,360
Whale!

518
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,130
What are they doing?

519
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,400
Get underwater!

520
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,860
I have a cramp! Save me!

521
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,330
One, two, three, cheese.

522
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,800
One, two, three. One, two, three.

523
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,600
Hello there.

524
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,300
Let's take a group photo
to remember this place.

525
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,060
I'd like that.

526
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,700
- I'm okay.
- What do you mean?

527
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,030
Come this way. Come over here.

528
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,760
One, two, three.

529
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,830
Now I will take one for you.

530
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,330
In-rang, what are you doing?

531
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,260
- You said you'd take a photo of us.
- You're slow, aren't you?

532
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,600
There.

533
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,200
Get closer to each other.

534
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,400
One, two, three.

535
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,100
What are you doing? Get closer.

536
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,130
Such a Seoulite.

537
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,900
One, two, three.

538
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:07,000
- No, no. Your hair was a bit messy...
- Your hair was...

539
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,630
Look here. Bong-pal,
what are you doing? One, two, three.

540
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,900
(Restricted Area)

541
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,930
You go there.

542
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,000
Sir, what's the matter?

543
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,230
No appetite?

544
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,600
About Professor Ju Hye-sung...

545
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,600
- You have his information?
- Yes.

546
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,500
Hold on.

547
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,960
But why are you asking
about him all of a sudden?

548
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,560
Nothing. I'm just curious.

549
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,560
Ju Hye-sung is 30 years old.

550
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,800
He's the youngest professor
in the Department

551
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,260
of Veterinary Medicine.

552
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,130
He was the owner of a well-known
animal clinic in Gangnam.

553
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,830
He recently started
a small clinic near the university.

554
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,230
And he was offered
a very good position before

555
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,730
he took the Myongsung position.

556
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,030
- Like what?
- He was offered a teaching job at

557
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,900
a very prestigious
university overseas.

558
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,160
So he was getting ready to leave.

559
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,760
But he changed his plans
at the last minute.

560
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,100
He came to teach at
Myongsung instead. Then again…

561
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,430
Myongsung is a good school, too.

562
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,960
Why did he turn down
such a good position?

563
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,460
He closed down his booming business.

564
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,400
Why did he come here?

565
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,500
It's close to the university.

566
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,500
Or he didn't want to live abroad.

567
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,700
(Hong Myung-hee)

568
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,960
(Hong Myung-hee)

569
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,460
- In-rang.
- Yes?

570
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,600
Can you turn up the volume?

571
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,160
It's too high.

572
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,560
It's good now. It's perfect.

573
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,230
I know how busy you are
with school and job hunting.

574
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,360
But you managed to come.

575
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,900
For that, I want to thank you,
new members.

576
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,030
This trip is celebrating
the founding of Blood Sausage Soup

577
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,860
and we welcome you to join in
this variety show for our retreat.

578
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,000
By the way, why is the name of
the club Blood Sausage Soup?

579
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,630
Well, that's because...

580
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,330
When you're tired
and things are tough

581
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,760
a bowl of blood sausage soup
can warm you up.

582
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,330
Like the bowls at the restaurants
sizzling 24-7, all year long,

583
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,730
we thought we could be something
warm for those who struggle.

584
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:08,330
And that restaurant was where
we all decided to work together.

585
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,130
He may become a scam artist one day.

586
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:25,630
Now, before we start, let's sing
our national anthem or not.

587
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,460
Let's play games first!

588
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,160
- Let's go!
- Hurray!

589
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,900
Drink up!

590
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,130
Until you drink up, I will dance.

591
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,760
Look at my shoulders.

592
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,230
I'm pouring you more.

593
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,330
- One.
- Two.

594
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,700
- Four.
- Five.

595
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,700
- Seven.
- Eight.

596
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,560
- 10.
- 11.

597
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,960
- 12.
- 14.

598
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,700
- 16.
- 17.

599
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,930
18.

600
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,560
19, 20, 21.

601
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,200
22, 23, 24.

602
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,230
- 25, 26, 27.
- 28, 29, 30.

603
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:16,430
- Drink up!
- Drink up!

604
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,900
I say blood sausage
and you say soup.

605
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,130
- Blood Sausage.
- Soup.

606
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,900
You're doing well.

607
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,530
It's been a long time.

608
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,800
Oh my, it's me again.

609
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,400
It's me again.

610
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,600
If you have any questions,
ask me now.

611
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,130
I will answer all your questions.

612
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,930
In-rang, go ahead.

613
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,330
- Me?
- Yes.

614
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,830
I want to ask...

615
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,830
Never mind. Time's up.

616
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,800
- Bong-pal, how about you?
- I don't really have any.

617
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,260
Forget you then.

618
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,460
Im Seo-yeon, if you have
any questions, ask me now.

619
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,900
- I will answer all your questions.
- Well...

620
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,800
Well, what is your last name?

621
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,060
It's Choi. Choi from Ohkyung.

622
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,700
It's Choi of
the 35th generation from Ohkyung.

623
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:25,730
It's C-H-O-I in English.
Choi is my last name.

624
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,800
35th generation?

625
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,230
Let's go again.

626
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,000
Now, it's your turn, Im Seo-yeon.

627
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:46,430
Well, is there someone
you like these days, Im Seo-yeon?

628
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,760
Yes, there is.

629
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:56,200
There is someone she likes.

630
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,860
I'm dying to know who it is.

631
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,030
Any questions?

632
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,600
Let me see.

633
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,330
Oh my, that's an angel.

634
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,930
- She's an angel.
- An angel is here.

635
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,330
- There is an angel here.
- Go to sleep.

636
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,400
You really hurt
yourself before, huh?

637
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,530
Fine then.

638
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,260
I will ask on behalf of In-rang.

639
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,560
Is the one you like here with us?

640
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,100
No, he isn't.

641
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,160
He isn't?

642
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,230
Well, then let's turn this again.

643
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,200
Well, do you like him a lot?

644
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,300
Yes.

645
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I think so.

646
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,060
Can I spin the bottle now?

647
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,800
It's you, Bong-pal.
It's your turn.

648
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:37,400
Bong-pal, is there someone you like?

649
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:53,830
He drank because he was sad.

650
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,800
If you don't want to answer,
you should drink.

651
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,300
Excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

652
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,930
Hey, you.

653
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,160
How can you leave
in the middle of the game?

654
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,230
I'm going to get some fresh air.

655
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,760
How can you leave us here?

656
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,100
What am I supposed
to do without you two?

657
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,500
You're being too loud.
You need to quiet down.

658
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,260
I will play this game
by myself then.

659
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:26,660
From what I see,
I think you like him.

660
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,330
Yes, I think so.

661
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,530
What's wrong with her?

662
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
What do I do?

663
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:43,930
Seo-yeon!

664
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,160
Get her! Get her.

665
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,700
Get her.

666
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,000
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

667
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,630
- What happened?
- I don't know.

668
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,200
It felt like someone was pulling
me down from underwater.

669
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,130
- I might have tripped then.
- Oh my.

670
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,300
Oh my, you're bleeding here.

671
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,000
We don't have any medicine.

672
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,830
I will go get some.

673
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:40,130
I told you not to
play around, didn't I?

674
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,930
- Seo-yeon is hurt because of you.
- Because of me?

675
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,960
I didn't do that.

676
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,230
You were the only one next to her.
Who else could have done that?

677
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,960
- I already said it wasn't me.
- I don't believe you.

678
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,600
You've been after her
since yesterday.

679
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,830
Why are you messing with her?

680
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,200
What's wrong with messing with her?

681
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,330
I did that to get back at you.

682
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,460
Are you acting this way
because I'm not taking care of you?

683
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,460
This is why I told you to stay home.

684
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,730
This is so immature!

685
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,930
I'm sorry for acting immature.

686
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,930
I shouldn't have followed you here.

687
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,230
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?

688
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,430
- Is there a pharmacy around here?
- Why? Is someone hurt?

689
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,560
She was in the water
and got a scratch wound.

690
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:40,430
So much energy in the morning.

691
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,560
Is it because you're young?

692
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,500
Were you guys playing
behind the cabin by any chance?

693
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,860
- Yes.
- Why did you play there?

694
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,530
There is a sign telling people
not to play in the water there.

695
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,560
- You didn't see it?
- No, we didn't.

696
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,000
That place is famous.

697
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:01,660
Even my grandmother almost
died there when she was little.

698
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,800
There's a water ghost there!

699
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:07,260
- So many people have died there.
- That's right.

700
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,560
Don't ever play in the water there.

701
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,700
Kiddo!

702
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,200
Was it because of me?

703
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,700
- I didn't do that.
- You were the only one next to her.

704
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,330
- Who else could have done it?
- I already said it wasn't me.

705
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,030
Bong-pal!

706
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,930
(Bring it on, Ghost)

707
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:23,960
How come we don't have any work?

708
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:25,400
You said you'd launch our business.

709
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,830
Should we go meet with our investor?

710
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,460
This is our business plan.

711
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,600
Blood Sausage Soup?

712
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,000
Exorcist hotline,
how can we help you?

713
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,160
You're in 12th place?
Focus, will you?

714
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:37,900
What's wrong with your grades?

715
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:42,130
- What is it?
- I thought she looked at me.

716
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,360
By the way, do ghosts get sick, too?

717
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,000
Carrots, please.

718
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,660
What now?

719
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:50,300
He said he was
the son of the dead guy.

720
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,700
Came all the way in here.
How annoying…

721
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,400
We have a problem.

722
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,030
I got a bit of my memory back.

723
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,200
- What did you remember?
- Bong-pal, where are you?

724
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,100
Sorry, but I won't be
able to come today.
