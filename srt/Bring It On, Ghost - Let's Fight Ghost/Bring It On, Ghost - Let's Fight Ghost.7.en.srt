00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,700
There's a water ghost there!

7
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,160
Was it because of me?

8
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,430
- I didn't do that.
- You were the only one next to her.

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,860
- Who else could have done it?
- I already said it wasn't me.

Are you okay?

14

Bong-pal.

15
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,600
I was so scared!

16
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,100
Do you know how scared I was?

17
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,930
It's okay. It's okay now.

19
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,700
12th place?

20
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,260
12th place?
What kind of ranking is that?

21
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,260
You went down
from 3rd to 12th place.

22
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,700
Do you know how much of
a difference that makes?

23
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,630
What's wrong with you lately?

24
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,100
Get your act together!

25
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,900
I work my butt off to get
you private lessons! What is this?

32
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,030
Hyun-ji.

33
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
- Bong-pal.
- What's wrong? Are you sick?

34
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,460
I just don't feel so good.

35
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,060
I wonder if it's because
you fell in the water.

36
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,200
Is it that bad?

37
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,300
I'm okay. I think I'll be
fine once I get some sleep.

38
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,330
- Go to my room and sleep.
- No, I'm fine.

39
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,860
Hello?

40
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,230
Bong-pal, where are you?

41
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,100
Seo-yeon, I'm sorry.
I don't think I can go out today.

42
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,900
Can we talk about
the final project tomorrow?

43
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,760
Why? Did something happen?

44
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,800
No, I just don't feel so great.

45
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,560
Oh? It's nothing serious, right?

46
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,860
It's not.

47
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,600
Okay, get some rest,
and let's meet up tomorrow.

48
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:01,860
Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow.

49
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,860
Hyun-ji, go sleep in my room.

50
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,700
What the heck am I supposed
to do when a ghost gets sick?

51
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,100
It's not like I can
take her to a hospital.

52
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,600
Hyun-ji, eat some of this porridge.
You didn't even eat breakfast.

53
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,330
She must be really sick.

54
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,260
- It's coming!
- Bong-pal.

55
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,430
Ms. Seo-yeon and...

56
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,760
It's the angel!

57
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,700
The angel…

58
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,100
Let's put it right in here.

59
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,960
How long are you going to
play that? Stop it already.

60
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,130
This is amazing.

61
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,830
- Where did you get that?
- This? I borrowed it from a friend…

62
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,000
Where did you get a friend?
You don't have friends.

63
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,300
I do... not have friends.

64
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,500
You shouldn't poke at
someone's pain like that.

65
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,730
Give it to me.

66
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,930
This... I mean, this...

67
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,330
Where did you get this? You probably
wasted all your allowance on it.

68
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,700
It's actually not as
expensive as it looks.

69
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
It's not...

70
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,900
Whether this is expensive
or not is not important!

71
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,330
Are you out of your mind?
Just what is wrong with you? Huh?

72
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,760
Look! Look! Look, look, look!

73
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,000
The retreat fees, gas money…
We need money for all these things.

74
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,960
When you start a business,
you need to spend some money.

75
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,800
This may not seem very important,
but our club members might...

76
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,360
It's necessary to help
with solidarity amongst our members.

77
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,100
But we're spending
more than we're earning.

78
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,030
That's why I have
an investment plan lined up.

79
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,300
An investment plan?

80
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,730
This measly amount of money?
We can take care of this in one go.

81
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,500
Don't... Don't worry!
What should we do?

82
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,060
Should we go meet
with our investor? Huh?

83
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,860
An investor?

84

(Acupuncturist)

85
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,760
What is it?

86
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,900
What's taking you so long?
Where are you?

87
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, did we have plans today?
Sorry, I've been out of it today.

88
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,430
I can't go today. I'm going
somewhere and I'm already on my way.

89
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,560
- Where?
- Where Bong-pal's father is.

90
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,830
I need to see him with my own eyes.
I have a bad feeling about this.

91
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,260
It's okay,
I'm perfectly fine! Hang up!

92
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,760
Just where is my honey?

93
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,800
Oh, honey! I finally found you!

94
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,030
Honey! Honey!

95
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,200
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

96
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,260
Why am I here?

97
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,430
I moved you in here.

98
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,660
You must be hungry. Stay here,
I'll heat up the porridge.

99
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,530
I told you to lie down.
Why did you come out?

100
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm totally fine now.
I think I was just tired.

101
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,830
Really? That's a relief.
Go ahead and eat.

102
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,400
Thanks, Bong-pal.

103
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,200
It's nothing.

104
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,600
Why didn't you go to school?

105
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,030
Ah, I was kind of tired, too.

106
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,430
But do ghosts get sick, too?

107
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,460
- Yeah, our hearts race, too.
- What?

108
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
What?

109
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,460
It's nothing.

110
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,960
By the way, some of my memories
returned while I was sleeping.

111
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,530
Oh, really? What popped up?

112
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,800
I was lying down and someone
was looking down at me.

113
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Who was it?

114
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Well, I couldn't see their face.

115
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,600
Oh right, and some lady was crying.

116
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,130
I wonder who it was…

117
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:05,430
She was crying with such sorrow.

118
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Have a good day.

119
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,160
Goodness, what is this?

120
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,860
Why are there so many
people looking for that man?

121
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,260
I mean, the acupuncturist
came last time.

122
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,830
What's going on today?

123
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,030
It's nothing really.

124
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,660
I came to ask some questions.

125
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,760
What is it?

126
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,360
I heard a young person came looking
for the man who lives in that room.

127
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,830
Yes, he came.

128
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,460
My eyes are bad so I didn't
get a good look at his face.

129
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,700
Oh, his son?
He's over there.

130
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,760
He was a good-looking young man.

131
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,430
His son?

132
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,400
I assumed he was his son.

133
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Your son is here to see you.

134
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,860
His face got serious
when I told him his son came.

135
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,200
He just ran into the back mountains.

136
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,530
I thought he was running away
because he owed some money.

137
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,400
Anyway, he ran away
and never came back.

138
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,060
Where are the back
mountains he ran away to?

139
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,430
So, my honey lives
in this neighborhood!

140
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,530
I think Hyun-ji lives
around this area, too...

141
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,460
- You're here.
- Hello, sir.

142
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,700
What's the schedule for today?

143
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,260
You have three appointments today.

144
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,600
- I'll get changed then.
- Okay.

145
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,830
Even the clinic is cool
and clean like my honey.

146
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,859
Something bad happened.

147
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,930
He wasn't chasing something.
He was being chased.

148
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,260
Hey, I told you to get some rest.
Why are you following me?

149
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,100
I'm all better now.
Look, I'm fine.

150
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
I swear, you don't listen.

151
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,500
(Seo-yeon)

152
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,260
I'll see you in
the study room at 11 o'clock.

153
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,500
- Who is it?
- It's Seo-yeon.

154
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,300
We're supposed to talk about
the final project today.

155
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
- Just the two of you?
- Yes.

156
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,700
Wait for me!

157
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,360
Remember the puppy factory incident
that was a huge issue a while ago?

158
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,660
Should we use that as our topic?

159
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,530
Yeah, that sounds good.
We can include this as well.

160
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,160
- I think that'll be fine.
- Okay, let's go with that.

161
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wrap it up already.

162
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,660
Why here?

163
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:27,560
What do you mean why?
We came to meet the investor.

164
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,100
- But this is my grandma's house.
- Yes, it is.

165
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,060
The investor is my grandma?

166
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,100
That's correct.

167
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,360
Why do you keep bringing
this up? It's ridiculous!

168
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,100
You know very well that
I moved out because I don't

169
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,630
want any help from her.

170
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,330
Let's go!

171
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,760
We're not asking for a handout.
This is an investment opportunity.

172
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,330
She doesn't need one. Let's go.

173
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,660
Let go, let go, let go!

174
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,600
In-rang.

175
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,760
- Grandma!
- Goodness, my precious baby!

176
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,600
Goodness, when did you get here?

177
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,500
You should've come to
me first and said hello!

178
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,530
How long has it been?
Goodness, my precious baby!

179
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,030
Hello, ma'am.

180
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,500
Why do you have that
nuisance with you?

181
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,830
I told you not to hang out
with people like that.

182
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,360
It's good to have friends,
but you need to be more selective!

183
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,330
Grandma, Chun-sang is a good person.

184
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,360
- And he has something to tell you.
- What?

185
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,860
What nonsense is he going
to talk about this time?

186
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:49,260
I swear! Anyway, let's go inside!

187
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,260
What are you doing?
Come on in!

188
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
Dig in, my precious baby.

189
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,900
Goodness, you've lost so
much weight. Eat a lot.

190
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,730
Goodness, look at you eat.

191
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,900
Why are you so nervous?
Hurry up and dig in!

192
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,200
- Dig in.
- Yes, thank you for the food.

193
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,030
So, you have something to tell me?

194
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,660
Yes, the thing is...

195
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,230
We're thinking about starting
an international, trendy business...

196
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,730
Talk slowly, you rascal!

197
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,700
How dare you try
to pull a con on me!

198
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,830
Just get to the point.

199
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,700
In-rang and I are trying
to start a proper business

200
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,700
but we're struggling
due to a lack of funds

201
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,730
so we came here to talk to you.

202
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,230
How could it be struggling
if it didn't even start yet?

203
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,460
What kind of business
are you planning?

204
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,100
Ah, yes...

205
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,400
- This is our business plan.
- What is it?

206
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,760
Blood Sausage Soup?

207
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,030
When did you prepare all this?

208
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,200
You want to start a restaurant?

209
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,400
No, it's not a restaurant.

210
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,600
A state of the art
multi-communication system

211
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,160
with a speedy, thorough,
and proper 24-hour support.

212
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,330
We're planning to set up
an exorcism system!

213
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,000
You punk!

214
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,130
You punk!

215
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,030
What did you say?

216
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,500
You con artist!

217
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,200
Wait until I get my hands on you!

218
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,200
You punk!

219
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,700
- Let's stop here for today.
- It's over!

220
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,630
Gosh, look at the time.

221
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,530
Do you want to eat lunch together?

222
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,530
Lunch?

223
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,360
What lunch? You're not
going to go, right, Bong-pal?

224
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
- Let's eat together then.
- Good, let's go.

225
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,560
What should we eat?

226
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,660
Whatever you want to eat is fine.

227
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,460
Bong-pal, let's eat some other time.

228
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,860
I need to talk to Professor Ju.

229
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,230
Sure, that's fine.

230
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,300
I'm really sorry. I promise to buy
you something really good next time.

231
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,230
- It's okay. You should get going.
- I'll see you in class.

232
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,730
What's up with her? She's the one
who asked you to lunch.

233
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Right?

234
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,400
Let's go.

235
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,860
Was Byul good while I was gone?

236
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,230
He was very bad.
Maybe he takes after you.

237
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,760
What? Really?

238
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,030
I'm kidding. He was a good dog.

239
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,030
By the way, did you have
a good time at the retreat?

240
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Yes.

241
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,230
You said you're in the same
club as Bong-pal, right?

242
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,400
- You two must be very close.
- Yes, I think so.

243
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,060
I see.

244
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,960
- Professor.
- Yes.

245
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,630
These are the list of
students for next semester.

246
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,430
- I need your signature.
- Sure.

247
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,300
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

248
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,760
Have a good day.

249
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,660
So, what did you guys
do at the retreat?

250
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,730
Hello, Professor.

251
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,900
It's good to see you again.

252
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,160
Yes, hello.
What brings you here today?

253
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,960
We didn't come here
to see you today.

254
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,460
- Are you Im Seo-yeon?
- Yes, that's correct.

255
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,530
We have some questions
to ask you about Noh Hyun-joo.

256
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
Are you free?

257
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,760
Hyun-joo is dead?

258
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,460
Yes, it's unfortunate,
but that's what happened.

259
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,160
When was the last time you saw her?

260
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,160
Well... she missed class last week.

261
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,430
I think that was the last time.

262
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,560
Do you remember how she was?

263
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,060
Anything you remember at all.

264
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,600
She looked... nervous that day.

265
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,930
Hyun-joo!

266
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,500
Hey, Seo-yeon.

267
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,400
I didn't see you in class today.

268
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,400
I just had some
business to take care of.

269
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,330
Why do you ask?

270
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,560
We received some materials to
take home from class today.

271
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,000
Just a moment.

272
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,200
Hyun-joo!

273
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
A fountain pen?

274
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,200
- Do you have that pen?
- No, I gave it to the professor.

275
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,900
Professor?

276
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,500
Yes, it belonged to
Professor Ju Hye-sung.

277
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,200
Professor Ju Hye-sung of
the veterinary medicine department?

278
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,030
Yes.

279
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:28,300
And there's
nothing else you remember?

280
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,100
I'm not sure.

281
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
(Bong-pal's father)

282
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,700
Please, leave
a message after the beep.

283
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,100
I hope nothing bad happened to him.

284
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,430
(Monk Myung-chul)

285
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,100
Tell me!

286
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,000
- Hey.
- Yeah?

287
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,130
Did your grandma deposit
the money yet? Check again.

288
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,200
You're really something else.

289
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,100
After all that abuse,
you still don't have it together.

290
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,560
Why can't she understand
this awesome idea?

291
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,700
Should we go see her again?

292
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,730
Well, if you want to die,
then go ahead.

293
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,960
Yo, Bong-pal! Long time no see.

294
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,100
Why didn't you come yesterday?

295
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,160
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

296
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,860
It's because we missed you.

297
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,430
How come we don't have any work?
You said you'd launch our business.

298
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,800
We just had that one gig…
and that was it.

299
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,060
Don't worry about that, okay?

300
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:20,460
Just think of it as
a temporary break.

301
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,300
Even frogs crouch and wait
like this before they jump.

302
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,730
Yeah, just like that.

303
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,900
I have something to give you.

304
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,030
Here, these are yours.

305
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,230
Those are the pictures
I took at the retreat.

306
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Gosh, you two look good together!

307
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,000
You guys look like a couple.

308
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,160
I'm going to go.

309
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,830
Sure, see you.

310
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,030
You two really look good
together! The perfect couple!

311
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,960
- Are you stupid?
- What?

312
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,860
Get a clue.

313
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,730
Gosh.

314
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,030
My precious baby, Grandma
sent you some pocket money.

315
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,200
Make sure you eat on time
and buy lots of yummy food to eat.

316
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,530
And stop hanging around that loser.

317
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,660
- But who's the loser?
- I don't know, loser.

318
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,230
Why the library all of a sudden?

319
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,930
Why do you think? We came to study.

320
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,430
We can study at home.

321
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,200
It's hot at home
and it's cool in there.

322
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,630
Then you study in the cool
library and I'll be at home.

323
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,460
You're not going anywhere.
You have to study, too. Follow me.

324
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,660
Bong-pal, I solved everything...

325
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,900
What are you doing?

326
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,730
Huh? Ah, nothing.

327
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
- I solved everything.
- Already?

328
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,360
I was there, too…
I didn't show up…

329
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,930
(Bong-pal loves Hyun-ji)

330
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,230
(Bong-pal loves Hyun-ji)

331
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,500
Why are you all happy?

332
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,600
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

333
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,800
Did you finish grading yet?
I did a well this time, didn't I?

334
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,900
How can you possibly smile
at a time like this?

335
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,830
Did a good job? My butt.

336
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,360
My teaching was
such a waste of time.

337
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,930
Gosh, it was number four.
I was so close.

338
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,330
Why don't you give up on
the college entrance exams?

339
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,100
- How can your score not improve?
- Maybe I have a lousy teacher.

340
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,060
What? You will never find
a teacher who is as good as me.

341
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,030
This is because the student
just isn't smart enough.

342
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,660
If you keep putting me down,
how can I possibly improve my score?

343
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,930
Then what? What am I
supposed to do for you?

344
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,860
Don't just push me, but reward me
like you give a carrot to a horse.

345
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,300
Carrots, please.

346
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,400
Carrots, my butt.

347
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,160
If I do well on the exam,
you should reward me.

348
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,930
Fine. All right.

349
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,060
If you get higher than
80 points on the next exam,

350
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,060
I will grant one of your wishes.

351
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,700
Really? Will you grant any wish?

352
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,300
As long as it's within my budget

353
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,400
- and it's reasonable.
- Hooray!

354
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,600
You promised.
I will study really hard.

355
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,830
It'll be a breeze to get
higher than 80 points.

356
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,760
What is it?

357
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,400
No, I thought she looked at me.

358
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,230
- I must have made a mistake.
- Let's go.

359
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,360
Hey, you're studying at this hour?

360
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,060
Of course. I'm all motivated now.

361
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,460
Have a good night!

362
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,830
Wow, that's nice to see.

363
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,230
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

364
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,800
Good luck!

365
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,830
Come on, I asked you to do it
with us because Yoo-jin is good.

366
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,760
Isn't Yoo-jin going
to prepare for the Olympiad?

367
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,260
I was able to find
a very good tutor.

368
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,130
The tutor won't take
fewer than two students.

369
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,930
If we take too long,
we may not be able to get in.

370
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,860
Okay. I have to get
Eun-sung's snack ready now.

371
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,100
Okay then. Call me later.

372
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,900
Eun-sung. Eun-sung.

373
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,400
Eun-sung.

374
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,830
Get out.

375
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,830
Oh my, these look very expensive.
Seriously.

376
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,429
But why are we here?

377
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,960
What? What do you mean why?

378
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,900
You've never heard of
'clothes make the man'?

379
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,900
Look at Bong-pal.
Who would think he's an exorcist?

380
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,130
We should order him a suit.

381
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah, but in order to do that,
we need money first.

382
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,400
What do you mean?
We had that investment come in.

383
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,260
Investment?

384
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,199
How is that an investment?
It's my allowance!

385
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,429
How dare you.

386
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,199
Your money is my money.
My money is yours...

387
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,460
We can't treat each other like that.

388
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,460
Wow.

389
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,560
Wait, but why are you
looking at a suit for yourself?

390
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm the face of our company.

391
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,800
Wow.

392
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,100
Why did you ask me to come here?

393
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,330
I asked you here
to order our uniforms.

394
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,160
Uniform? I want one, too.

395
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,460
- What uniforms?
- Come here.

396
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,430
It's okay, come here.

397
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,000
You should dress up like this, see?

398
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,060
How cool is this?

399
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,530
People won't look down on you
if you dress up like this.

400
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,760
When you're this stylish,
you will bring in more work, too.

401
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,230
Go put it on. Go on.

402
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,160
- Come over here.
- Well...

403
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,900
Come on. Here...

404
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,460
Put it on and come out.

405
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,400
See? We already have a client.

406
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:39,200
Hello, we provide
exorcism service 24-7.

407
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,200
This is Choi Chun-sang.
How may I help you?

408
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,730
Wow, you look cool.

409
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,960
You look the best among them.

410
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,600
Bong-pal, can you
also get me a uniform?

411
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,630
I'm the only one without one.

412
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,360
You keep asking me for things.

413
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,060
Bong-pal, hurry up.

414
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,430
Get me one, please.

415
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,230
Open the door! I said open it!

416
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,630
Open the door! Open it!

417
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,760
What happened?

418
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,660
Eun-sung...

419
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,830
Since that day, my child has...

420
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,830
Eun-sung, you're wearing makeup...

421
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,660
Take off those clothes. Now!

422
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,360
- Leave me alone.
- What?

423
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,160
Don't you feel sorry for the girl
that has you as her mother?

424
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,860
You have no idea
how much she's suffering

425
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,000
because of your greed, do you?

426
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,830
Eun-sung.

427
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,430
Why are you doing this, huh?

428
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,130
Eun-sung?

429
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,930
Your daughter is dead.

430
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,960
How could anyone live with
someone like you? It's suffocating.

431
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,260
That's why
your husband cheated on you.

432
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,900
He didn't want to live
with a wench like you.

433
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,500
Didn't you know that?

434
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,600
Get over here.

435
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,000
Get over here!

436
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,430
Ever since that night,

437
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,630
I've taken her to
see doctors and shamans…

438
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,500
It only made her symptoms worse.

439
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,700
You have no idea
what a good daughter she was.

440
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,600
I don't know what happened to her...

441
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,600
Eun-sung, please...

442
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,860
- Please, stop.
- Open the door now!

443
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,400
Open the door! Open it!

444
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,130
Eun-sung!

445
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,630
Let me go in.

446
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,130
Take this.

447
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,100
Bong-pal, I'm not getting
a good feeling about this place.

448
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,300
So please, be careful.

449
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,900
Don't get hurt.

450
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,630
I will be back.

451
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,100
Are you like the shaman
I saw last time?

452
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,160
No, you seem different.

453
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,400
You came with something else, too.

454
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,300
She's the one I saw at the library.
She also saw me then.

455
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,460
There's a ghost inside her body.

456
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,500
What should we do?

457
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,360
We need to take it out.

458
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,000
Who says you can?!

459
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,900
Bong-pal!

460
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,860
Why do you go around
with someone like her?

461
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,630
That's some strange hobby.

462
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:06,060
How about bringing me along instead?

463
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,530
Ma'am.

464
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,830
You can't. It'll be okay.

465
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,960
Eun-sung.

466
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,960
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

467
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,260
What do you think you're doing?

468
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,300
Why do you care?

469
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,100
How about you?

470
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,230
You don't want Eun-sung to die.

471
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,300
This is what she wants.

472
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,330
She's not brave enough to kill
herself so I'm just helping her.

473
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,200
Don't show off
when you know nothing.

474
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
No!

475
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,300
Eun-sung, wake up.
Eun-sung! Eun-sung!

476
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,830
I told you Eun-sung was dead.

477
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,400
Eun-sung!

478
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,000
Eun-sung.

479
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Please, don't do that.

480
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:19,660
I did all that because
I wanted you to do well.

481
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:21,460
But I was wrong.

482
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,630
So please, don't do that.

483
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,700
Don't do that, Eun-sung. Don't.

484
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,530
Don't you dare call me by that name!

485
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,260
Please, help my Eun-sung...

486
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,930
Eun-sung, don't do that. Don't.

487
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,760
- Don't come closer. Don't.
- Eun-sung...

488
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,330
Don't do it. Don't.

489
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,500
Don't come closer. Don't.

490
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,130
Eun-sung! Eun-sung!

491
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,230
Eun-sung, wake up.

492
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,100
My child... Eun-sung.

493
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,430
Mom!

494
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,700
- Mom!
- Eun-sung.

495
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,530
- Mom...
- Eun-sung.

496
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,700
Mom, did I do this to you?

497
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,160
I'm sorry, mom.
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

498
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:58,060
No, I'm okay as long as you're okay.

499
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,200
I'm sorry.

500
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,260
I'm sorry, mom.

501
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,700
How can we help?

502
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,230
Go get some rest.
We will take care of the rest.

503
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:36,560
You go over there.

504
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,630
Bong-pal.

505
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,860
The lady I saw
in my dream last time…

506
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:52,800
- I think I know who she is.
- Who is she?

507
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:56,330
My mom. She was my mom.

508
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,300
She was just like
Eun-sung's mom earlier.

509
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,500
My mom would have
cried just like her.

510
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:06,400
It's good that you're getting
some memories back.

511
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,800
If it's not my mom,
at least one person misses me.

512
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,630
Let's go.
I need to go and study hard.

513
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,760
Now, it's time for the exam.
You have one hour.

514
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,530
Wait a minute.

515
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:39,800
I'm ready.

516
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,600
Now you begin.

517
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,760
What is it? My score isn't
higher than 80 points?

518
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,100
- Hm...
- Seriously?

519
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,000
No, it is.

520
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,460
Good job. Your effort paid off.

521
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,360
Of course, it did.
I worked so hard.

522
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,060
So now you have to
grant me a wish, right?

523
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:38,060
- A promise is a promise, so...
- Yes!

524
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,030
What is your wish?

525
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,060
There is a place
I've really been wanting to go to.

526
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,000
Where?

527
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,430
- An amusement park.
- An amusement park?

528
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,830
What are you, a kid?
Why would you want to go there?

529
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,760
Do only kids go there?

530
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,760
You said you'd grant a wish.
Let's go.

531
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,860
Okay. Your wish isn't very grand.

532
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,100
I will go with you.

533
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,660
Since we're on the subject,
can we go tomorrow?

534
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:04,760
- You're done with exams tomorrow.
- That's right. Okay then.

535
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,300
My exams will end
at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow.

536
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,700
- Let's say 4:00 p.m. at the park?
- Sure.

537
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,830
Hooray!

538
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:46,000
Sir, this is Detective Yang.

539
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,600
Detective Yang, what's up?

540
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,660
You conducted an autopsy
on Noh Hyun-joo, didn't you?

541
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,500
I already sent in the results.
Didn't you get it yet?

542
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,760
Yes, I did.
I just had a few questions.

543
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,960
- What are they?
- Noh Hyun-joo's neck was broken.

544
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:04,100
Is there a possibility it broke
when her dead body was moved?

545
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,260
That's highly unlikely.

546
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,360
If it broke after she died,

547
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,030
there would be a visible physical
trace on the surface of her body.

548
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,900
But there was none.

549
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,660
Then...

550
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,800
I'm certain that her neck broke
when she was getting strangled.

551
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,930
Can a person be strong enough to
break another live person's neck?

552
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,600
It's not impossible, but it'd be
difficult for an average person.

553
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,930
I see. Thank you, sir.

554
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,130
- I'll stop by soon.
- Do that.

555
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,660
- I'm back.
- What is it?

556
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:42,030
This is the CCTV footage
from near Ms. Noh's place.

557
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,260
- Did you find anything?
- Not really, but something was odd.

558
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,960
- What was odd?
- You might want to see it yourself.

559
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,560
Play it then.

560
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,400
This is Noh Hyun-joo here.

561
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,130
And then this corner here...

562
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,330
Someone was there.

563
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,030
- What's wrong?
- It stopped recording there.

564
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,300
They say it wasn't
a camera malfunction.

565
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,830
Take a look here.

566
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,760
It's like that
for exactly 5 minutes.

567
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:25,300
He breaks someone's neck…

568
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,930
And now this camera business…

569
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,260
What's his deal?
Who is he, huh?

570
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,460
Gosh, I finally managed to come in.

571
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:56,360
Oh my, this is where
my honey works, huh?

572
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,360
Ju Hye-sung?
Even his name sounds cool.

573
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,060
Wow, it's nice here.

574
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:05,060
What is this?

575
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:07,660
He's good, isn't he?

576
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,930
Oh my, he's so photogenic, too!

577
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,430
He's so cool.

578
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,100
Wait, where is this sound
coming from?

579
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:24,430
It sounds like
it's coming from here…

580
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,630
(Kim Hyun-ji)

581
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,560
Oh my goodness.

582
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,830
(Kim Hyun-ji)

583
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:02,460
Came all the way in here.
How annoying…

584
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,800
We have a problem now.

585
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,260
Bong-pal, it's at 4:00 p.m. today.
You know that, don't you?

586
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,900
- Don't be late.
- Okay.

587
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,600
Bong-pal.

588
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,230
Seo-yeon.

589
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,230
- Did you just finish your exam?
- Yes.

590
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,900
- You, too?
- Yeah, for a liberal arts course.

591
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,200
- Where are you off to?
- I'm meeting someone.

592
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:51,100
- Excuse me.
- Okay, bye.

593
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,230
Seo-yeon!

594
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,700
Are you okay?

595
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,860
He's late...

596
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,130
Did his exam take longer?

597
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,330
Mister, please hurry.

598
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,760
(Bring it on, Ghost)

599
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,060
Hyun-ji! Kim Hyun-ji!

600
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:16,200
Hyun-ji! Did I ask you
to follow me around?

601
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,360
You're the one who decided to
annoyingly follow me around.

602
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,400
Gosh, you scared me.

603
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,230
Good for you. You're alive.

604
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,730
Do you walk around
with a ghost by any chance?

605
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,330
No, she was an angel.

606
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,130
- What do you think you're doing?
- Are you human trash?

607
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,900
Did we get some work? For real?

608
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,400
She died because of you.
Did you know that?

609
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,060
My angel.

610
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,400
She's pretty just the way she is.

611
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,560
But when she smiles,
she's even prettier.

612
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,300
Bong-pal.

613
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,360
I like you.

614
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,130
Hyun-ji!
