Kim Hyun-ji!

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,300
I'm sorry, Bong-pal.

9
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,160
Hyun-ji.

10
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,230
You're back?

11
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,830
You didn't run into
Monk Myung-chul again, did you?

12
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,500
I saw him briefly, but I was
able to avoid him quickly.

What, punk?

17
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,530
Why did you ask
to see me this late at night?

18
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,030
You bumped into Hyun-ji
this afternoon, didn't you?

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,260
Hyun-ji?

20
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,860
- So that ghost's name is Hyun-ji?
- Yes.

21
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Did you run into her?

22
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,660
Yes, I did.

23
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,800
What did you say to her?

24
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,460
- What did you say to her?
- Why are you curious about that?

25
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,060
I said what did you say to her?

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,860
I told her to leave you.

27
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,300
Seeing how you're behaving,
I guess she understood me.

28
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,660
- Why did you do that?
- Come to your senses, punk.

29
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,300
She's a ghost!

30
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,530
Mind your own business!

31
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,430
You punk!

32
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,930
This is not the time for you to
be messing around with a ghost!

33
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,400
Where are you going?

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,230
To find Hyun-ji.

35
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,800
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

36
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,060

What's wrong with this?

39
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,230
Hello, I'm Mr. Jung
from Jungmin Life Insurance.

40
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:28,760
Goodness, you're working hard today.

41
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,800
The energy is not good.
It's not good at all.

42
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,330
A lot of people have died here.

43
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,800
There have been scores of accidents
at just this place alone.

44
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,430
Everyone says that they saw a ghost.

45
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,200
If you take a look at the files
you can see that the accidents

46
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,560
only occur at 2:00 a.m.

47
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,330
It looks like he took the bait.

48
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,730
Thanks to a free-wheeling ghost…

49
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,000

50
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,530
Ah, goosebumps! Goosebumps!
Oh, that's scary!

51
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,960
Why aren't these guys
picking up their phone, huh?

52
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,530
I can understand
In-rang not picking up.

53
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,300
But Park Bong-pal has been ignoring
my texts since yesterday!

54
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,530

(Episode 11)

57
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,400
If you hadn't interfered,
I wouldn't have become like this.

58
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,260
Why are you bothering me
like this by leaving

59
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,660
something like that behind?

60
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,630
By trying to save your son's life...

61
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,760
You should've known it would
end up being a death sentence

62
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,900
for your husband and son.

63
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,730
Who are you?

64
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,530
What time did he leave the house?

65
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,230
- I think it was before midnight.
- I see, before midnight.

66
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,400
And what time did he return?

67
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,600
After a cup of tea, it was
around four in the morning.

68
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,360
What were the most valuable
items that disappeared?

69
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,260
- Probably the jewelry.
- The jewelry?

70
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes.

71
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,200
Just a moment, please. We have
a similar case to this, hold on.

72
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,000
This is similar to
the Bumil-dong case.

73
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,800
The criminal is detained
at the Kangil precinct.

74
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,160
I think we can solve this
quickly if we go there.

75
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,800
Okay.

76
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,700
What are you doing?

77
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,900
- This lady's son is overseas?
- Yes.

78
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,260
He's in the States
and she's living alone.

79
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,230
It's normal to have
pictures around like this

80
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,760
if your son is far away, right?

81
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,460
Well... yes. Why?

82
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,159
- Ju Hye-sung's mother.
- You're still hung up on that?

83
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,100
What's bothering you this time?

84
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,960
There wasn't a single picture
of Professor Ju at that house.

85
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,630
He's handsome, has
a great personality, and is

86
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,030
a successful veterinarian to boot.

87
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,130
He's the kind of son any mother
would be proud to brag about.

88
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,660
But the look on her face
when Professor Ju came home.

89
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,200
That wasn't the look of
a mother happy to see her son.

90
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,730
What was the cause of death
for Professor Ju's father?

91
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,400
It's just written down
as an accident.

92
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,400
- Where was the report written?
- At Kyungil. Why?

93
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,260
- You plan on going there?
- Something is off.

94
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,960
I need to find out more.
Go and dig up some

95
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,360
more information on Professor Ju.

96
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,060
Drive safely.

97
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,700
Hyun-ji!

98
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,160
Yes! I won! Yeah!

99
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,130
Kim Hyun-ji!

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,530
Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji.

101
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,700
You have got to be kidding me.
What the heck is wrong with you?

102
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,100
I want to be alone.

103
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

104
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,900
Are you not going to work?

105
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
It won't go away.

106
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
- The pain.
- You...

107
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,800
If you keep acting like this,
I'm going to call you the boogeyman.

108
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,830
I'm going to kill you!

109
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,730
Me... who?

110
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,830
The punk that Hyun-ji
has feelings for.

111
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Whether he's a ghost or a person,
I'm going to kill him!

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,030
Just going out and killing
yourself is another option, too.

113
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,460
What is the matter
with our Bong-pal?

114
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,100
(Professor, there's no lecture
today. You're not sick, are you?)

115
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Hello.

116
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,360
What are you
so concerned about, Seo-yeon?

117
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,060
What are you looking at?
Are you expecting a call?

118
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,100
It's nothing.

119
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,400
It's going to be summer soon...
oh, aren't you

120
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,730
graduating this semester?

121
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,060
Yes, this is my last semester.

122
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,460
I would stay longer if I could.

123
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,760
I'd like to go back
to preschool if I could.

124
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,130
I was in the forsythia class.

125
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,060
Are you in some kind of love
with that ghost?

126
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,130
- I said don't worry about it.
- Your mom died because of a ghost.

127
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,960
But you're with a ghost?

128
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,000
Since then, he's been
suffering from seeing ghosts.

129
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,360
He's been an outcast
because of his eyes.

130
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,130
Do you think it's possible for
a ghost and a human to be together?

131
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
So please, leave Bong-pal,
for his own sake.

132
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,160
To be honest, I've never
celebrated my birthday.

133
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,800
I can't do anything for you.

134
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,260
I'm sorry.

135
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,030
It's okay.

136
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,260
Yes, I made the right decision.

137
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,630
I made the right decision.

138
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,730
Hyun-ji.

139
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,660
Bong-pal.

140
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,360
Hyun-ji.

141
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,300
- Let go.
- Where are you going?

142
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,600
- I've been looking all over for you.
- I said let go!

143
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,400
Is it because of Monk Myung-chul?

144
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,030
I told you to ignore him!

145
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,730
- Let's go home.
- Let go!

146
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,500
I didn't leave because
of what that monk said.

147
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,000
- I was going to leave you anyway.
- What?

148
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,960
- Just why?
- You really don't know?

149
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,960
- Do you think you and I make sense?
- I told you it doesn't matter.

150
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,160
It matters to me.

151
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,230
Honestly, I stuck to you
because I wanted to cross over.

152
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,160
But I just forgot momentarily.

153
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,200
You and I live in different worlds.

154
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,200
Hyun-ji...

155
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,030
The time we spent together,
it doesn't matter to you?

156
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,900
You can leave me that easily?

157
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,360
Do you think ghosts and humans
can live happily ever after?

158
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,930
You're the only person in
this world who can see me.

159
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,099
I don't want to live
a lonely life like that with you.

160
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,030
What I want is to find my

161
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,800
It's just hard and lonely
being with you.

162
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,530
Those words... do you mean them?

163
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,100
Yes, I mean it.

164
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,600
- You're not happy with me?
- That's right.

165
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,030
Fine.

166

Okay.

167
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,160
Why am I crying like an idiot?

168
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,800
I was the one that left him.

169
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,430
I swear, these guys.

170
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,630
Hurry it up!

171
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,560
I'm coming. There's no need to
go to his place. Just call him.

172
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,400
Well, he's not picking up his phone!

173
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,230
So what? There's no
need to go look for him.

We can't work without Bong-pal!

175

Then just call it
quits. Why go looking...

176
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,630
Call it quits?
You said you missed Hyun-ji.

177
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,260
You can go and see Hyun-ji.

178
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,930
How can I see Hyun-ji right now?

179
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,100
She's not my girlfriend.

180
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,560
She was never
your girlfriend, to begin with.

181

Hey, isn't that Bong-pal?

How much did you drink?

186
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,230
You're not even a good drinker.

187
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,060
Did something happen?

188
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,660
So... Bong-pal.

189
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,330
Are you with Hyun-ji right now?

190
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,500
She's not here.

191
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,930
- She must be at home then.
- No.

192
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,600
She left.

193
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,100
She left? To where?
When is she returning?

194
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,360
She said...

195
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,260
she's never coming back again.

196
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,630
You can't even hold your liquor.

Ow, that hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

198
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,030
He can't hold his liquor either.

199
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,400
Just stay there!
You're going to get hurt!

200
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,730
Go. Just go. There's no hope for me.

201
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,260
Yeah, you're hopeless.

202

We're almost there.

203

again or I'll kill you.

205
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,630
Don't go, Hyun-ji.

Don't go, Hyun-ji.

207
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,660
- Hyun-ji, don't go.
- Hyun-ji?

that you were looking for
Park Ji-hoon's whereabouts.

254
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,630
I found it strange that he didn't
come to his wife's memorial service.

255
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,130
It's been about five years
since I've seen him.

I see.

257
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:32,900
But there was one person who
kept vigil for quite some time.

258
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,760
I was wondering by any chance
if that person is involved, too.

259
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,200
- Who was that person?
- He was a young man.

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,560
Did he look like this person?

263
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,500
Yes, that's the right person.
He came five years ago as well.

265
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,200

- Yes.

It was around the end
of August at that time.

wife's personal effects that day.

I guess you don't want your
grandma to find out, huh?

- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

289
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,130
I'm going to have to
set you two straight.

290
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,060
You have recently experienced
a difficult incident.

291
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,200
If you can't shake this off, your
hearts will be permanently scarred.

292
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,760
It is called trauma.

293
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,930
It's a very scary thing.

294
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,730
Don't run away.
You have to overcome it.

295
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,130
You will fall into sudden
depression if you don't.

296
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
I'm doing fine.

297
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,300
The first stage of
depression is denial.

298
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,230
You refuse to
acknowledge it or accept it.

299
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,530
What is this?

300
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,160
I'm leaving.

301
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:03,130
Have you resented or wanted to kill,
pinch, or bite someone recently?

302
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes or no?

303
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,199
- Yes.
- This is stage two.

304
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,900
Rage. You blame it all
on others and get angry.

305
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,429
You pout and get angry.
You whine and get angry... yeah.

306
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,130
What is the third stage then?

307
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,330
Depression.
You separate yourself from reality

308
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,659
and fall into depression.

309
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,900
Our Blood Sausage Soup
cannot reach that point.

310
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,199
You must overcome all of this.

311
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,199
Try to comfort yourself by
breathing in and out deeply.

312
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,659
Okay, let's begin.

313
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,159

00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,360
It's been a long time.
How long has it been?

331
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,900
The last time I saw you
was when we volunteered

332
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
at Chuncheon Hospital.

333
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,060
Right, it's been over eight months.

334
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,900
It seems you're
quite busy these days.

335
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,830
I hardly see you volunteer
at hospitals anymore.

336
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,800
Yes, I've been busy lately.
I'm going to start again soon.

337
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,600
Come and volunteer at our hospital.

Come to our hospital instead, okay?

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,730
- Yes, I'll do that.
- You said you had a favor?

342
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,160
Did someone you know
get admitted here?

343
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,600
No, I'm looking
for a certain person.

344
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,430
I looked into it and there are no
medical records for Park Ji-hoon.

Doctor, what about his head?

442
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,400
He hit it pretty hard
trying to avoid the car.

443
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,400
The wound isn't that big,
but why don't you get an x-ray?

444
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,030
No, it's fine.
It doesn't hurt that much.

445
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,800
Listen to the doctor.
He's not a doctor for a reason.

446
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,300
- I'll prepare the x-ray then.
- Thank you.

447
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,530
Stay still.

448
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,730
Rest for a bit. In-rang and I will
go and take care of the paperwork.

449
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,860
It's fine, I'll take
care of the paperwork.

450
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,460
This is company business.

451
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:30,230
As CEO of Blood Sausage Soup,
I will take care of this matter.

452
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,260
So stay put.

453
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,860
We'll be back. Let's go.

454
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,130
Rest up.

455
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,000
She went into sudden shock,
but she's stable now.

456
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,260
We'll watch over her for a bit
before transferring her to a room.

457
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,160
Will she be okay?

458
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,000
Why does she keep going
into shock, Doctor?

459
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,860
As of right now, it's hard to
predict what the situation is.

460

Yes, Doctor?

470
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:52,030
Kim Hyun-ji is
a patient at our hospital.

471
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,830
She was admitted five years
ago after a car accident

472
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,700
and she's been in a coma ever since.

473
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:01,400
Is there a chance...
that the patient might wake up?

474
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,460
I'm not sure. Looking at her
chart, that might be difficult.

475
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,830
But I can't rule out
the possibility.

476
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,630
There was a case where a patient
woke up from a 10-year coma.

00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,430
Bong-pal!

482
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,030
Hyun-ji.

483
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,360
Bong-pal, I'm sorry.

484
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,400
What happened?

485
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:04,630
I won't leave you again.

486
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,200
I don't have to.

487
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:18,000
Bong-pal, I'm alive...

488
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,100
Hyun-ji?

489
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:26,560
Hyun-ji?

490
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,500
Hyun-ji?

491
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,430
She's in cardiac arrest!

492
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,500
Is it cardiac arrest?

493
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,100
- Vitals!
- There's no pulse!

494
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,900
- It's charging.
- Clear! Shoot!

495
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,730
Shoot!

496
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,400
Clear!

497
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,830
Hyun-ji.

498
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,230
Hyun-ji.

499
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,360
Hyun-ji... Hyun-ji!

500
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:39,600
(Bring it on, Ghost)

501
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,600
Hyun-ji!

502
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,730
Hyun-ji wasn't a ghost
but a soul, right?

503
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:48,100
- I saw Hyun-ji!
- Bong-pal, wait!

504
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,360
Who are you?

505
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,200
Do you want to die?

506
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,760
Don't mess with me.

507
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,060
Be careful. If he's real,
he won't go down easily.

508
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,960
What's wrong?

509
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,230
Let's go to the police!

510
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,030
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to reinvestigate him.

511
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,160
Sir, someone is here to see you.

512
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:08,360
This is not the bathroom.

513
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,030
What am I going to do with you?

514
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,230
Bong-pal!
