8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,030
- Bong-pal!
- Hey.

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,430
Hey!

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,630
Oh my, you're so pretty.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,260
Gosh, how can a ghost be so heavy?

12
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,400
What? How can I be heavy?

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,930
I'm so light. I must be light.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,900
I'm as light as a feather.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,900
Let's go home now!

16
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,060
Make sure you hide real good.

17
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,930
I can see your hair.

18
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,630
Make sure you hide real good.

19
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,800
I can see your hair.

20
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,530
Make sure you hide real good.

21
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,060
I can see your hair.

(Episode 5)

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
I can't believe I'm making
hangover soup for a ghost.

25
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,300
What the heck am I doing?

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,260
Kim Hyun-ji, wake up.

27
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:54,030
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji.

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,500
Kim Hyun-ji, wake up.

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,900
- Why?
- It's time to eat. Come out.

30
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Oh, my head.
Bong-pal, my head hurts.

31
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,500
What's wrong with me?
I feel nauseous, too.

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,560
You feel nauseous, too? Nice going.

33
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,130
You were no joke yesterday.
Can ghosts get drunk?

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,460
I guess so.

35
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,360
How did we get in last night?

36
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,500
You don't even remember
last night, do you?

37
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,930
I thought my back would give
out after carrying you home.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,700
- You carried me home?
- Of course. Who else would do that?

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,760
Sit down and eat.

40
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,700
It's bean sprout soup!

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,899
- Did you make this for me?
- You wish.

42
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,560
I just had some left over
so I decided to make some. Why?

43
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,330
Delicious.

44
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,100
Thank you for the meal.

45
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,730
- What is it?
- Heart!

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,300
What's this?

47
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,600
Heart!

48
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,860
Heart!

49
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,960
Junior Bong-pal, our love
is going to arrive soon.

50
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,800
What's up with these seniors?

51
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,560
($3,500 has been deposited)

52
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,000
Please take your savings book.

53
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,630

54

55
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,330
$134,500?

56
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,430
Wait a minute.
How much do you have?

57
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
Wow.

58
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,230
Wow, you're very rich.

59
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,060
Why have you been acting poor when
you've been loaded all this time?

60
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,659
Let's use that money to buy
something tasty to eat, huh?

61
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,300
- That's not what that's for.
- Then what is it for?

62
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,100
Aren't you making
money to make a living?

63
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,030
Oh, are you going to
buy a house or a car?

64
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,530
No.

65
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,900
What are you going to use it for?

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,100
Are you thinking of buying
something extravagant?

67
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,300
It's my money and I'm going
to use it however I want.

68
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,860
Mind your own business.

69
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,600
It must be nice to see
ghosts and make tons of money.

70
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,830
It's not all that great.

71
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,230
Why not? Because of your gift,
you make a lot of money

72
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,800
and you have a pretty ghost
like me as your sidekick.

73
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,700
Gosh, you're being ridiculous
this morning. That's enough, okay?

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm late.

75
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,260
That's my bus.

76
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,660
Hey, wait for me!

77
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,800
- Where did she go?
- Bong-pal, over here!

78
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,530
It's nice to have a ghost around.

79
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,600
Look at that.

80
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,700
Can you scoot over?

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,130
Where am I supposed to sit?

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
- I'm sorry, but it's taken.
- Excuse me?

83
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,530
What are you talking about?
There's no one here.

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,430
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,430
- 48.
- 48.

86
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,400
- 49.
- 49.

87
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,060
50.

88
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,900
50…

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,630
- 50!
- 50!

90
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,330
We just have to do this
several more times, right?

91
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,300
I know.

92
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,060
But we need
Junior Bong-pal to make it happen.

93
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,860
I know. That's why we
need to recruit him.

94
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,930
How? He won't even
register for our club.

95
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,460
- Who am I?
- Choi Chun-sang.

96
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,360
Am I just Choi Chun-sang?

97
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,900
I'm a charming magician
who can make anyone fall for me.

98
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,930
- Perhaps Gate? Bill Gates?
- Bill Gates?

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,100
Bill Gates!

100
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,160
These are the final scores of your
last reports. Come and take them.

101
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,130
Park Bong-pal,
you're pretty smart.

102
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Good job.

103
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,000
I gave you over a week
to complete this assignment.

104
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,260
What have you all been doing?

105
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,360
Copy and paste,
grammatical errors, typos.

106
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,800
Such poor and meaningless reports!

107
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,130
How is it that Park Bong-pal is
the only one who got an A-plus?

108
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,230
This is Park Bong-pal's report.
Take a look at it and

109
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,430
get some inspiration.

110
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200
This was a group project

111
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,330
yet Bong-pal did it on his own and
still did better than all of you.

112
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,330
You have until next week.

113
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Any group that gets below a C will
have to submit it again, got it?

114
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,060
- Got it?
- Yes.

115
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,600
Good, I'll see you next week.

116
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,230
He's such a jerk.

117
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,130
There are some strange rumors
going around about Bong-pal.

118
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
What is it?

119
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,660
Something strange always
happens when you're around him.

120
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:30,060
I even heard that the kid
who fought against him died.

121
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,530
- For real?
- That's scary.

122
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,900
I didn't like the look in
his eyes from the beginning.

123
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,100
Anyway, it's bad luck
if you hang out with him.

124
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,430
There won't be any reason
for us to hang out with him.

125
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,660
He's an outsider anyway.

126
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,260
Bong-pal.

127
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,230
- Bong-pal.
- Yeah?

128
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,300
- Do you like being alone?
- Yes.

129
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,530
It's not boring?
You always eat alone, too.

130
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,300
No, I like it.

131
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,800
I mean, it's fun hanging out
and eating together with friends.

132
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,430
You always end up talking
about girls and play video games.

133
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,160
- You call that fun?
- It is fun!

134
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,130
Talking about
menial things like that is fun.

135
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,130
That's how you build
friendships and get to enjoy

136
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,760
the perks of campus life.

137
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,600
Isn't that college life?

138
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,460
It's all a waste of time.
I'd rather read another book.

139
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,930
Still, it wouldn't hurt to
have a friend help you out

140
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
once in a while.

141
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,060
It's fine.
I can take care of myself.

142
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:59,000
He's late today for some odd reason.

143
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,760
- He's never been late before.
- I know.

144
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,230
He didn't return after
he went out yesterday.

145
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,900
- Do you think he was out all night?
- With a woman?

146
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,600
- No!
- There's no way!

147
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm sure he didn't.

148
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,530
- Oh my, you're here!
- Hello, sir.

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,630
I'm sorry for being late.

150
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,160
I'll check the appointment chart
after I come back from class.

151
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,360
- Can you get everything ready?
- Okay, we will.

152
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,060
Where did he get mud on his shoes?

153
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,500
- Probably the shelter again.
- You think so?

154
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,400
Junior Bong-pal.

155
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,860
- Hi.
- Do you have time to spare?

156
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,130
Why?

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
We will be in the center of it all.

162
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,930
How? With the state of the
art multi-communication system!

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,930
Speed, accuracy,
and a comprehensive warranty.

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,730
A 24-hour...

165
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,000
exorcism system.

166
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,700
All of this...

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,030
has been gathered in one place.

168
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,900
The name is... Blood Sausage Soup.

169
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,960
Blood Sausage Soup!

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,430
Blood sausage soup? Is he setting
up a restaurant? What is that?

171
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,130
I have no clue.

172
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,200
Hold on, hold on.
Where are you going?

173
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,760
To class.

174
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,760
You're just going to leave
like that after listening to

175
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,160
this impressive presentation?

176
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,530
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- What do you mean?

177
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,530
What do you mean?
I'm saying let's work together!

178
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,000
If we bring work to you like
last time at the sauna,

179
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,900
you come and save the day.

180
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,030
- And you get a cut, right?
- And we get...

181
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
That's not how
we would put it exactly.

182
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,860
I mean, you're right...

183
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,830
but we would also be doing
this for the sake of world peace.

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,100
Peace.

185
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,430
So, it's kind of like a service fee.

186
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,230
- In what way?
- So...

187
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,030
So we could provide
you with transportation.

188
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,930
Or like some sort of physical exam.

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,630
The truth of it is, you run into
difficulties if you do this alone

190
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,860
and we would be willing to
take care of all that for you.

191
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,100
We would also collect all
exorcism fees that are past due.

192
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,700
Please, think about it.

193
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,930
You're too busy studying
and getting rid of ghosts!

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,160
There's so much stuff you
need to be concerned with.

195
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,230
If we hunt down work for you...

196
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,900
Hold on, hold on!

197
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,730
You would take
the car we provide for you...

198
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,030
Right, good job.

199
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,460
You would
go to the ghost and just...

200
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,430
Okay! Okay!

201
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,660
You would go and catch the
ghost and take our car back home.

202
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,230
How comfortable is that?

203
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,700
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
What do you think?

204
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,160
Ah! We got some work for you
from the community gym.

205
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,260
And we collected several
overdue fees as well.

206
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,730
The community gym.
How much are they going to pay?

207
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,760
- Three banknotes.
- Three thousand?

208
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,300
Deal.

209
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:49,030
Okay, then please go ahead
and sign this contract.

210
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,830
I'm not interested
in joining the club.

211
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,230
Still, this would mean
that you have agreed to

212
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,800
- work together as a team...
- I'm leaving.

213
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,230
He's leaving.

214
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,500
We did it!

215
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,860
- We did it!
- Blood Sausage Soup!

216
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,660
Bong-pal.

217
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,300
Hello.

218
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
You're going to class, right?
Let's go together.

219
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,600
Sure, let's go.

220
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,560
What is it?

221
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
It's nothing.

222
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,560
By the way, have you decided
whom you're going to work with

223
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
on the final exam?

224
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,200
It's a group project.

225
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,600
No.

226
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,930
Do you want to do it with me?

227
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,360
My Bong-pal can
do it all by himself!

228
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,060
- Yes, I'd love to.
- Great.

229
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,460
Let's go.

230
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,230
What's so great about her?

231
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,760
What?

232
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,030
I just thought of a good idea.

233
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,160
Bait that will make
Bong-pal join our club.

234
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

235
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,630
The weather is very
nice today, isn't it?

236
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,600
Let's go somewhere!

237
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,060
- Let's go somewhere!
- Let's go somewhere!

238
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,900
I bet you want to have
fun on a day like this.

239
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,830
Shall I let you all go early today?

240
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,800
- Yes!
- Yes!

241
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,460
I'll think about it if
you pay attention in class.

242
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,360
Let's check attendance first.

243
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,330
- Kim Ho-chang.
- Here.

244
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,630
- Na Jin-soo.
- Here.

245
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Okay.

246
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,260
Noh Hyun-joo.

247
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
Ms. Noh Hyun-joo?

248
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,600
Noh Hyun-joo is absent again today.

249
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,730
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

250
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,760
Do you want to eat together today?

251
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,930
Since you're helping me with class,
I'll buy something good to eat.

252
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,030
What do you think?

253
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes, it's fine with me.
What about you?

254
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,860
It's fine with me, too.

255
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

256
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,030
Welcome.

257
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,300
Please, have a seat.

258
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,460
- Oh, wait!
- What is it?

259
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,460
Well, the thing is...

260
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,160
There's some dirt here.

261
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,460
Thanks.

262
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,930
What the heck?

263
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,800
This dish is very good.

264
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,300
It's nothing.

265
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,030
He's gained a good amount of weight.

266
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,430
It seems that way.
He must be eating well now.

267
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,960
Yes.

268
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,800
What do you think?
Isn't he adorable?

269
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,730
Yes, he's adorable.

270
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,260
Bong-pal, where do you live?

271
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,260
I live near the school.

272
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,400
What a relief. I felt bad for
making you come in early

273
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,660
to prepare for my class.

274
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,830
You must be living by yourself
if you live near the school.

275
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,600
Yes.

276
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,200
Then where do your parents live?

277
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,700
Ah, they live somewhere else.

278
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,900
They must live far away.
Do you see them often?

279
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
Not really...

280
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,200
You should see them
and call them often.

281
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,100
Have you talked
to your father recently?

282
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,900
Why do you ask?

283
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,660
It's nothing.

284
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,030
By the way, are the preparations
for your final exams going well?

285
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,630
Yes, we're going to start soon.

286
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,260
Midterms didn't end too long ago.

287
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,230
It's too bad that you have to
prepare for finals so soon.

288
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,300
- Dig in for now.
- Thank you.

289
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,430
Hyun-ji, why are you
sitting here like this?

290
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,500
It's nothing.

291
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,460
I couldn't find my honey.

292
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,600
Just where in the world is he
hiding on this small campus?

293
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,100
Just thinking about it
makes me angry!

294
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,230
Right, right, right?
It's worth being angry over, right?

295
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,000
Absolutely!
How could he take the chair out?

296
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,460
I know!

297
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,560
He was so sweet to me on the bus.

298
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,400
What a jerk!

299
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,860
- Huh?
- Always scolding and nagging me.

300
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,060
But he's always smiling
and laughing like an idiot

301
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,460
in front of that girl.

302
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,760
Are you talking about
that blood sausage?

303
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,500
Yes. He's probably laughing
and eating with that girl right now.

304
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,530
I see.

305
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,800
Who am I talking to?

306
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,300
It must be nice
not having me around.

307
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,500
Watch where you're going.

308
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,960
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

309
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,630
Hey.

310
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,830
Are you still hungover? You've been
out of it since this morning.

311
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm fine.

312
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Why?

313
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,800
What do you mean why?
It's time to go home. Let's go.

314
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,500
Was it good?

315
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,830
Yeah, it was good.

316
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,760
I'm sure it was since
you ate with that girl.

317
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,260
You know, it seems like
Seo-yeon likes that professor.

318
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,060
I don't blame her. He's good-looking
and he has a nice personality.

319
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,200
He's also very popular,
unlike someone I know.

320
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,400
Cut it out.

321
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,000
It's Seo-yeon.

322
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,430
Not!

323
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,330
Do you enjoy making fun of me?

324
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,900
Yes, it's the best thing
in the world!

325
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,700
- There's something on your shoe.
- Huh? Where?

326
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,900
What a nice bow!

327
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,300
You are so immature!
That was not funny!

328
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,900
Yes, it was!

329
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,130
Hello, Ms. Im Seo-yeon.

330
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
Who are you?

331
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,360
We are close friends
of Park Bong-pal.

332
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,100
You know him, don't you?
Economic major, Park Bong-pal.

333
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Yes.

334
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,160
We would like to talk
to you for a moment.

335
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,900
Just for a moment.

336
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,030
Our club had a difficult start and
it's on the verge of disappearing.

337
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,630
We have nowhere to go.
What should we do, Ms. Seo-yeon?

338
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,530
What can I do to help?

339
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,000
It's a very tiny favor.

340

(Member Application for Ghostnet)

341
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,230
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

342
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,830
Goodbye.

343
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,100
Ah, that's cold!

344
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,500
You're such a good sleeper.

345
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,830
You have no passion
for studying whatsoever.

346
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,460
I am passionate,
but I fall asleep whenever I study.

347
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
Get your act together.

348
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,460
Passion. Fighting spirit. Okay?

349
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Okay.

350
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,030
So, how many did you solve?

351
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,860
You didn't even solve 10 problems.

352
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,130
I couldn't because it's hard.

353
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,030
Look.

In the case when
you're looking for 'r',

355
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,830
say you have two infinite sets of
numbers and all conditions are met

356
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,460
and there's a and b...

357
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,430
- Hey.
- Yes?

358
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,830
Oh... one more time.

359
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,130
In the case when

(Byeolnim Animal Clinic)

363
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,100
You scared me.

364
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,130
I told you not to pop in
whenever you want.

365
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,430
I totally forgot.

366
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,200
Knock, knock.

367
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,930
Why did you come in?

368
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,100
Just because. I can't
fall asleep and I'm bored.

369
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,130
You sleep when
you should be studying.

370
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,860
Of course, you can't
fall asleep now.

371
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,860
You were so cute when you
were little. What happened to you?

372
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,960
You know, your mom is very pretty.

373
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,660
Those heels...

374
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,730
Whom do these belong to?
Can you burn them for me?

375
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh… were they your mom's?

376
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Yes.

377
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,130
It's time for you to leave now.
I'm going to bed.

378
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
Okay.

379
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,960
Bong-pal.

380
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,700
I'm sorry. I didn't know
they belonged to your mom.

381
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,460
Good night.

382
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,930
- Hyun-ji.
- Yes?

383
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,060
Turn off the lights.

384
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Okay.

385
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,200
Dad, it's so loud!
We moved here for nothing!

386
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,400
I swear!

387
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,330
Come out! Do you know
what time it is right now?

388
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,600
I've had enough!
What the heck are you doing?

389
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,430
You're not the only ones
who live here!

390
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,930
Come out! I said come out!

391
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,830
Shut your kids up!

392
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,700
It looks like Bong-pal lives here.
It's close to the school.

393
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,900
- Did you tell him we're coming?
- I did. He'll be right down.

394
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,860
But is this even
considered a car? Huh?

395
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm impressed that this thing even
made it here. Where did you get it?

396
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,400
What do you mean?
I had to go through a lot to get it.

397
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,960
I begged my cousin
who left for the army to get it.

398
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,930
How long has he driven this car?

399
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,130
310,000 miles?

400
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,660
What is this?
Some kind of an airplane?

401
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,800
I knew it.

402
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,330
This is why
the engine was having trouble.

403
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,360
Just be grateful that we have this.

404
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,230
If this was what you
were going to borrow

405
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
why did you say that
we could provide transportation?

406
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,960
We need to give him
something for him to work with us.

407
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,960
You've seen how picky he is.

408
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,500
Plus, we could sleep
in there for a while, too.

409
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,800
Sleep? In here?

410
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,630
In here?

411
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,130
Are you crazy?

412
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,130
It's hot in here.

413
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,100
This car doesn't
have air conditioning?

414
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,960
By the way, where are we going?

415
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,760
Weren't we going to
the community gym?

416
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,600
We got an urgent offer
so we had to switch.

417
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,800
Now we're going to
an apartment building in Eunsung-gu.

418
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,860
Every night,
they hear a kid cry and...

419
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,560
you know, thumping noises
as if someone is running around.

420
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,560
So the tenants
downstairs went up there.

421
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,800
They went there
and found the unit was empty.

422
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,330
It's been empty for one year.

423
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
A guy was offered
cheaper rent and moved in.

424
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,460
He had no idea that
a ghost was living up there.

425
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,560
The rent of the whole building is
going down because of the ghost.

426
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,500
The chairman of
the building community is worried.

427
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:36,960
So she promised to pay
us a whopping $5,000.

428
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,830
Hey, that's awesome!

429
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,930
Here we are. That's the place.

430
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,800
Bong-pal, you stay here.

431
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,330
We will go meet with
the chairman and discuss

432
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,500
the contract in more detail.

433
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,330
Which unit is it?
I will go take a look around first.

434
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,560
You're such
a professional, aren't you?

435
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,200
- What was the unit number?
- Unit 607 in Building B.

436
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,160
We will be right back.

437
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,200
Wow, there is a playground.

438
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Bong-pal, can we please
go there to play a bit?

439
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,330
Come on. We're here to work.

440
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,230
Gosh, she's all about
eating and playing.

441
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,960
Bong-pal, let's play here a bit.

442
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,830
Bong-pal, let's ride this one.

443
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,800
Sit there, will you?

444
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,100
What are you, a little kid?

445
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,200
- Plus, I don't like this.
- You don't like so many things.

446
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,600
Here you are again.

447
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,730
Excuse me, I told you not
to come here again.

448
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,530
Do you understand me?

449
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
Gosh, this is driving me crazy...

450
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,500
- Ma'am, please take her away now.
- I'm sorry.

451
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,760
Hee-jung, let's go, okay?

452
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,630
Why did you come here again?

453
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,260
What if you get in trouble again?

454
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,460
- Let's go.
- Don't.

455
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,800
Ma'am, please, take her away.

456
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,130
The residents here will
make a fuss about this.

457
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,030
They're already unhappy
the market value is going down

458
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,030
because of the ghost story.

459
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,330
- Do not show up here ever again.
- I understand.

460
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,300
Hurry up now.

461
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,500
- Let's go.
- Hurry and leave.

462
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,000
Hee-jung, let's go.

463

(Flower Virgin Shamaness)

464
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,560
What? What do you want me to write?

465
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,760
I want you to write a talisman
to keep ghosts away.

466
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,030
Give me a strong one.

467
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,360
Why do you go around
carrying the sword then, huh?

468
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,860
If you need to
come here for a talisman...

469
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:36,230
Gosh, I've only heard the rumors…
but you really have lost it…

470
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,160
Hey.

471
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:42,260
Mee-sook, change that name.

472
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,260
What's up with
Flower Virgin Shamaness, huh?

473
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,330
You've been married three times.

474
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
How about Bodhisattva
who makes her husbands die fast?

475
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,400
- Or Granny Bodhisattva?
- Why you…!

476
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,230
By the way, about the motel case,
I introduced to you...

477
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,700
Oh, Gampo's Inn?
Everything was handled well.

478
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,700
I heard what happened.

479
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,300
You almost fainted and ran
when you saw the ghost.

480
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:14,330
I didn't exactly run, but I was
going to return at another time.

481
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,330
Word travels fast, gosh.

482
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,030
But the one who handled it
instead of you…

483
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,900
He's very well known in the field.

484
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,460
Who is he?

485
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,430
He's called
Master Bong-pal or whatever.

486
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,430
I don't know where he's from.

487
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,830
- He's quite young, I hear.
- Master Bong-pal?

488
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,500
Bong-pal? Park Bong-pal?

489
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,730
That sounds right.
Why? Do you know him?

490
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,430
Park Bong-pal, that punk...

491
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Hurry up and finish!

492
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,460
(I hate you)

493
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,600
(Dad)

494
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,130
Did I scare you?

495
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,530
I scared you good, didn't I?

496
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,000
- Are you mad?
- Let's not kid around at work.

497
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,830
Gosh, you're no fun.

498
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,500
Stop playing and cross over, okay?

499
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,030
People can't sleep because of you.

500
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,860
- It hurts.
- Are you okay?

501
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,060
- Don't stretch. Don't bend it.
- Stretch.

502
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,000
- You've stretched too much.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,930
You saw
how quickly I reacted, right?

504
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,400
This is how I am.

505
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,060
Other people would have
their heads spinning.

506
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,530
Spin yours back.

507
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,330
Look straight ahead and drive.

508
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,500
Alright then, Bong-pal.

509
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,500
We have to exorcise tomorrow.

510
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,900
So get plenty of rest at home.

511
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,400
I almost forgot, Bong-pal.

512
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,300
What do you think this is?

513
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,260
- What is it?
- It's our second present for you.

514
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,160
This is our third present for you.

515
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,330
(Member Application for Ghostnet)

516
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,330
(Member Application for Ghostnet
Im Seo-yeon)

517
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,200
Im Seo-yeon? That girl?

518
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,500
Why did you join?
You said you weren't interested.

519
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,630
You joined because
of her, didn't you?

520
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,430
Gosh, Park Bong-pal.

521
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,830
We finally got it.

522
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,900
Now we can move back
into the club room.

523
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,830
Hey, where are you going?

524
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,860
Hello.

525
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
To the apartment building
in Eunsung-gu.

526
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,030
Why now?
We're supposed to go tomorrow.

527
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,360
You want to get back at that kid?

528
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,630
Make sure you hide real good.

529
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:59,060
I can see your hair.

530
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,200
Make sure you hide real good.

531
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,560
I can see your hair...

532
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,800
What is this about?

533
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,530
That kid isn't playing.

534
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,600
What do you mean?

535
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,200
(Abused and Killed
by Stepfather in Eunsung-gu)

536
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,860
- He's running away.
- From whom?

537
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,600
Whom is he running away from?

538
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,800
- The one who killed him.
- Who is that?

539
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,900
His stepfather.

540
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:28,000
I've found you.

541
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,660
- You punk.
- I'm sorry.

542
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,230
- Come with me, you little punk.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

543
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,560
Come on, you little punk.

544
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,160
Seriously?
Shouldn't we call the police?

545
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,660
He's a little kid.

546
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,430
What are you doing again?

547
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,130
Leave!

548
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,530
I'm sorry.

549
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,730
I'm sorry, my baby.

550
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,030
I'm sorry.

551
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,360
Dad, forgive me.

552
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,030
Dad, forgive me.

553
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:29,660
Don't do that. Dad, forgive me.

554
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,260
Dad, forgive me.

555
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,000
Are you okay?

556
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,100
You!

557
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,560
You killed my son?

558
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,660
You! You want to die?

559
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,600
Get away from me!

560
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,230
Mom!

561
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,760
Bong-pal!

562
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,660
Mom!

563
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,830
There you are, my baby.

564
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,400
Here you are, my poor baby...

565
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,560
I'm sorry.

566
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,560
I'm sorry that
I couldn't protect you.

567
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,460
I'm sorry, my baby.

568
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,660
Mommy is very sorry.

569
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,330
My baby...

570
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,460
I'm so sorry
that I don't know what to say.

571
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,460
I'm sorry, my baby.

572
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,500
My baby...

573
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,160
My poor baby...

574
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

575
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,160
I'm sorry, my baby.

576
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,560
I'm sorry, my baby.

577
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,360
He must have been
waiting for his mom.

578
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,100
Gosh, he must have been so scared.

579
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,060
I'm sorry, Bong-pal.

580
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,230
My son. Mommy is very sorry.

581
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,130
Bong-pal, I'm very sorry.

582
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,660
Mommy, don't go.
Mommy, don't leave.

583
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:12,930
Mommy. Mommy!

584
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:25,660
I'm sorry, my baby.

585
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:28,900
Bong-pal.

586
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,100
I'm sorry.

587
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,130
Sorry. I'm sorry.

588
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,130
Bong-pal.

589
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,100
Bong-pal!

590
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,400
What are you doing here?

591
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,230
Have a seat.

592
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,630
I told you to stop exorcising.

593
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,960
I don't exorcise.

594
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,730
I know everything.

595
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:21,030
Master Bong-pal.
That's what you're called, huh?

596
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,600
If you do that, how am I supposed to
face your late mother when I die?

597
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:30,560
Why bring up my mother
all of a sudden?

598
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Gosh.

599
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,460
Gosh, why did I do
that back then, huh?

600
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,060
If I hadn't made that mistake...

601
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,730
Don't worry.
You have nothing to worry about.

602
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,400
And I don't resent you.

603
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:03,330
I'm more than grateful
that you saved me.

604
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:09,230
- Let's go and drink at home.
- No, I won't, punk.

605
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,200
I have other places to go
other than your place.

606
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,200
You're just as stubborn
as your father.

607
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,260
I'm leaving.

608
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,900
Gosh, that looks like it hurts.

609
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,830
I told you not to come here.
You're a ghost!

610
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,300
- I'm not a ghost.
- I said go.

611
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,460
- Go. I said go.
- I'm not a ghost.

612
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:42,230
The ghosts are over there.

613
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,860
I'm telling you I'm not a ghost.

614
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:03,900
Mommy.

615
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,800
Mommy.

616
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,300
I'm sorry.

617
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,560
I'm sorry.

618
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,100
I'm sorry.

619
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:38,300
Ghosts... go away.

620
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:39,730
(Bring it on, Ghost)

621
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,030
- What's going on with me?
- Why are you staring at me?

622
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,600
Something is wrong with me.

623
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,300
Can ghosts' hearts race like this?

624
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,830
Let's go have
our membership training.

625
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,230
- We have blood sausage!
- We have blood sausage!

626
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,760
I will play Cupid instead.

627
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,930
You know one of your students
named Noh Hyun-joo?

628
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,760
It's been a long time.

629
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,160
He closed down his booming business.

630
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,000
Why did he come here?

631
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,630
It's so immature of you to do that!

632
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,500
I did that to get back at you.

633
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,400
That place is famous.

634
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,430
There's a water ghost there!
