00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,800
(Ok Taec-yeon)

2
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,100

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
(Kim So-hyun)

(Bring it on, Ghost)

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,130
Bong-pal.

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,700
I'm alive...

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,460
Hyun-ji.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,160
Hyun-ji.

11
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,730
Hyun-ji.

12
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,830
She's going into cardiac arrest!

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,830
Is it cardiac arrest?

14
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,360
- Vitals!
- There's no pulse!

15
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,460
- It's charging.
- Clear! Shoot!

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,300
Shoot!

17
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,960
Clear!

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,130
Hyun-ji.

19
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,500
Hyun-ji.

20
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,030
Bong-pal.

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,000
Hyun-ji... Hyun-ji!

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,329
Hyun-ji!

23
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,100
Hyun-ji!

24
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,060
I told him to lie still on the bed!
Where did he go?

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
(Episode 12)

26
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,930
Gosh, he sure doesn't listen.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,760
He shouldn't be moving around.

28
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,130
- Bong-pal!
- Hey, Bong-pal!

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,530
- Bong-pal!
- Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

30
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,360
- Let's carry him.
- Hold on.

31
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,100
Hold on.

32
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,260
Hyun-ji, wake up!

33
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,100
Mom. Dad.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,360
- Hyun-ji!
- Hyun-ji!

35
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,000
Why am I here?

36
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,860
Why are you crying?

37
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,560
You don't remember the accident?

38
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,700
An accident?

39
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,360
Me?

40
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,160
You've been in a coma
for five years. You don't remember?

41
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,130
Doctor, why doesn't
she remember anything?

42
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,830
Don't worry too much.

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,100
It's a minor aftereffect of being
in a coma for such a long time.

44
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,860
Your memories will return in time.

45
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,330
Let's make sure
your condition is stable first

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,430
and do a physical exam.

47
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,000
For now, let's just be thankful
that she's awake now.

48
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,930
Congratulations, Hyun-ji.
I'll see you again.

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,930
Yes.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,860
- Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

51
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,060
- Hyun-ji.
- Hyun-ji.

52
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,360
Do you remember me?

53
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,460
Continue to follow up
on Kim Hyun-ji.

54
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,930
There might be
a problem with her memories

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
so set up a consultation with
the neurology department.

56
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,200
(Kim Hyun-ji)

58
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,000
You really don't remember anything?

59
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,560
Yes, I don't remember anything.

60
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,560
My head just hurts a little.

61
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,360
Don't try too hard to remember.

62
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,060
Those memories aren't important.

63
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,860
Now that you've come back alive…

64
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm so happy.

65
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,630
It's okay.

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,600
Why are you crying if you're happy?

67
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,659
Don't cry.

68
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,500
Not you too, dad.

69
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,230
You've been through a lot.
Thank you for staying alive.

70
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,530
- Don't, Mom.
- Thank you, Hyun-ji.

71
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,659
Doctor, are his BP and OP okay?

72
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,700
He's not going into
cardiac arrest, is he?

73
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,800
Don't you need to intubate
him or give him an EPI?

74
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,600
You've watched
too many medical dramas.

75
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,960
That's not necessary
and his x-rays are fine.

76
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,100
But it seems like he's
overworked himself lately.

77
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:47,560
He's exhausted and his
nutritive condition is a mess.

78
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,330
I've prescribed him vitamins.
He can be discharged after

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,730
he rests for the rest of the day.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes, Doctor. Thank you.

81
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,760
I guess he eventually
collapsed after Hyun-ji left.

82
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,060
Bong-pal was struggling? Why?

83
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,100
Huh?

84
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,660
Well, I guess Bong-pal
and Hyun-ji were kind of an item.

85
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,960
An item...

86
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,800
Hyun-ji has feelings for Bong-pal?

87
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,500
I think Bong-pal has
feelings for Hyun-ji, too.

88
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,860
That's why he's in
this state after she left.

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,560
You know, getting hurt
from a painful breakup

90
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,560
is every man's fear.

91
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,830
So that's what happened.

92
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,460
Hyun-ji and Bong-pal were...

93
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,360
I see.

94
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,100
Are you okay?

95
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,430
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- You're okay. You're okay.

96
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,560
And don't try to hurt Bong-pal.

97
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,200
(Flower Virgin Shamaness)

98
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,400
Is it true that there's
one more weapon?

99
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,300
I heard the head monk prepared one.

100
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,000
Hong Myung-hee met the head
monk before she passed away.

101
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,800
I heard she asked him
to prepare another weapon.

102
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,160
One more?

103
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,700
By any chance, do you
know where that weapon is?

104
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,830
He passed away
and that's all I heard.

105
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,500
There's one more weapon.

106
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,830
She had it made
for the sake of her son.

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm sure having
that made was not easy.

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,330
Do you maybe think the personal
effect Bong-pal's father

109
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,559
went looking for…

110
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,000
It was the weapon.

111
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,860
Then the reason why that evil
spirit is hanging around Bong-pal...

112
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,400
It's because of that weapon.

113
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,100
That's his lifeline.
That's why that bastard

114
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,960
is chasing after him.

115
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,030
I have to go.

116
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,460
- You're leaving already?
- Yes.

117
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,060
Watch out for yourself.

118
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,760
If that punk is serious,
he won't go easy on you.

119
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
Thanks.

120
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,960
I'll call you.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,500
(Kim Hyun-ji)

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,730
What should I do with you?

123
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,900
Oh, dear Buddha…

124
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,900
Bong-pal.

125
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,030
Where did he go?

126
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
Bong-pal.

127
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,360
Is this rascal in trouble?

128
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,560
- Hello? Who is it?
- Hello...

129
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Isn't this
Park Bong-pal's cell phone?

130
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,830
Yes, it is.

131
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,100
In the hospital?

132
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,830
Which hospital is it?

133
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,660
Yes, I understand.

134
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,430
That punk!

135
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,200
Who is it?

136
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,460
I don't know.

137
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,130
Hello?

138
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,000
I told you already.

139
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,060
What the heck?

140
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,060
Bong-pal.

141
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,930
What happened?

142
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,030
He's not seriously injured.
He just passed out from exhaustion.

143
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,230
The doctors say he'll be
fine after a day of rest.

144
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,900
Goodness, he must have been
seriously heartbroken.

145
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,630
But who are you?

146
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes... we're Bong-pal's seniors
as well as business partners.

147
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,830
Business partners?

148
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,800
- With Bong-pal?
- Yes.

149
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,900
Ah... this...

150
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,760
- Thank you.
- It's nothing great really.

151
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,000
We're running
a 24-hour exorcism business.

152
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,430
- I'm CEO Choi Chun-sang.
- I'm Manager Kim In-rang.

153
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,030
What's the matter?

154
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,700
Who are you?

155
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,500
He's a monk.

156
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,230
You punks...

157
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,900
You're the punks
I met at Gampo's Inn.

158
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,230
So, you punks are using Bong-pal
to catch ghosts, is that it?

159
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,830
We're not using him.

160
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,900
This is a mutual and beneficial
partnership we both agreed upon...

161
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,230
- You punk!
- Don't do this.

162
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,060
Don't you know how
dangerous exorcism is?

163
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,500
It does look a bit dangerous,
but this is the 21st century...

164
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,100
Why you little punk!

165
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,500
- I was wrong!
- Are you going to continue or not?

166
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,630
If you ever use Bong-pal
again, I'm going to...

167
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,400
The same goes for you, too!

168
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,330
Goodness, you rascal. You get sick
because of that one ghost.

169
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,630
You guys stay
right next to Bong-pal.

170
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,160
Don't go anywhere.
I'm going to meet the doctor.

171
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,360
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,900
Goodbye.

173
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,500
I thought he was about to
rip my ears off. Seriously.

174
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,900
- Who is that monk?
- I don't know. A relative, maybe?

175
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,400
Aren't you hungry?
Should we go eat something?

176
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,700
I'll go and buy something.
Stay here, I'll be back.

177
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,360
She woke up after five years.

178
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,200
Okay, try closing your hand.

179
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,100
Open it up again.

180
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,700
Put more strength into it.

181
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,430
Fortunately, there is
nothing wrong with her nerves.

182
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,200
You need to continue to exercise
your hands to relax the muscles.

183
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,930
Practice using a spoon
or chopsticks often.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,230
- Writing is fine, too.
- Yes, Doctor.

185
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,230
Walking is too much for now,
so use the wheelchair.

186
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,400
And the hospital prepared this
congratulatory gift for you.

187
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,930
Congratulations once
again on waking up.

188
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

189
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,300
Congratulations.

190
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,030
Who is it, anyway?

191
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,330
It's the girl who woke up after
being in a coma for five years.

192
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,360
The girl from the car accident?
I'm glad to hear she's awake.

193
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,860
Hyun-ji...

194
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,100
(Kim Hyun-ji)

195
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,800
Is she really...

196
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,260
Hyun-ji.

197
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,400
Hyun-ji... Hyun-ji!

198
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,200
Hyun-ji.

199
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,230
What's wrong?

200
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,260
Hey, hey! Hey.

201
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,460
- I have to find Hyun-ji.
- No, no. Wait a minute! Sit down!

202
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,730
Wait. You're burning up.
The doctor says

203
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,230
you have to be calm.
Stay still, okay?

204
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Chun-sang, Chun-sang,
Chun-sang! Bong-pal!

205
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,260
I'm so glad you're here, In-rang.
He's frantic to find Hyun-ji.

206
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,000
- I saw Hyun-ji!
- What?

207
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,660
You saw Hyun-ji?

208
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,730
Yes, I saw her at the
hospital ward on the way here.

209
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,030
What nonsense are you spouting?
How can you see a ghost?

210
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,130
No, she looked exactly like Hyun-ji...

211
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,760
No, she's Hyun-ji for sure.

212
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,330
The name tag next to her
room says Kim Hyun-ji, too.

213
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,930
Come here.

214
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,660
You're burning up, too,
so get a shot while you're here.

215
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,730
No! People are saying that she
woke up from a five-year coma!

216
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,430
Hey, Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

217
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Move! He was just
beginning to calm down!

218
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,900
Why did you have to
bring up Hyun-ji?

219
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,030
It's that way! Bong-pal!

220
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,730
Where did he go?

221
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,660
Bong-pal.

222
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,730
Bong-pal?

223
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,130
(Kim Hyun-ji)

224
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
Hyun-ji.

225
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,100
You're alive.
I thought you disappeared.

226
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,100
I was so worried about you.

227
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,860
What are you doing?

228
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,030
Hyun-ji.

229
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,900
Who are you?

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,700
You... don't recognize me?

231
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,060
Who are you?

232
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,300
I'm... Bong-pal.
Don't you remember?

233
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,200
Look... I don't know
how you know my name.

234
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,060
But I really don't know who you are.

235
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,760
Please, leave.

236
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,130
- Hyun-ji.
- Mom.

237
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,560
Who is he?
Do you know him?

238
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,830
No, I don't know him.

239
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,360
Who are you?

240
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,360
I must've mistaken you
for someone else.

242
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,130
What the heck?

243
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,530
Hey.

244
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,530
It's Hyun-ji, right?
What did she say?

245
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,260
What did Hyun-ji say?

246
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,630
She... doesn't remember me.

247
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,530
- What?
- She doesn't remember?

248
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

249
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,900
- Are you sure that's Hyun-ji?
- I'm sure.

250
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Look. There's no one prettier
than Hyun-ji in all of Korea.

251
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,730
- In all of Korea?
- Yes.

252
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,660
She is pretty, I guess.
I don't know.

253
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,930
Hi.

254
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,100
Oh no, she must not
remember me either.

255
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,630
How can she remember you when
she can't even remember Bong-pal?

256
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,460
But why can't she remember?

257
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,930
- She was in a coma for five years?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
Then you're saying Hyun-ji
wasn't a ghost but a soul, right?

259
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,860
I guess she was in limbo.

260
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,160
She came back into her
own body and forgot everything

261
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,130
that happened with us.

262
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,530
What do you want me to do about it?

263
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,860
Excuse me... beautiful nurses.

264
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,700
- Yes.
- We have some questions to ask.

265
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,360
Sure, go ahead.

266
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,000
Whois he? Do you know him?

267
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,900
No, I don't know him.

268
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,760
Bong-pal. Bong-pal!

269
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,700
Mong Myung-chul.

270
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Who says you can leave the hospital?

271
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,530
- I've been looking for you.
- How did you find me?

272
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,860
Your seniors or whatever told me.

273
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,060
I can't believe you're
friends with idiots like that.

274
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,960
They're of no help to you.

275
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,630
Are you feeling better?

276
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,360
Yes.

277
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,800
You need to take
better care of yourself.

278
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,360
Let's go. You have to
eat well at a time like this.

279
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,430
Let's go and get you
something to eat.

280
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,000
Taxi! Hurry up.

281
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,800
Over here.

282
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,960
Stop!

283
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,230
Wow, the quality
of this oxtail is good.

284
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,100
- Monk, I'll do it.
- Go away.

285
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,360
I can do this better than you.

286
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,060
I'm fine. I'll do it.

287
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,530
Listen, will you?

288
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,500
Go and get some rest.

289
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,630
Okay.

290
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,860
Monk Myung-chul.

291
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,300
What is it?

292
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,930
I'm sorry for yelling
at you last time.

293
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,900
That rascal even knows how
to apologize. He's all grown up.

294
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,160
Let's see.

295
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,130
Bong-pal.

296
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,330
Bong... Bong-pal.

297
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Bong-pal. Bong...

298
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,460
Bong-pal.

299
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,000
Bong-pal.

300
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,030
- Senior.
- Here.

301
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,500
Ah, you came here to bring me this.

302
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,900
- I could've come and gotten it.
- Well, we need to talk, too.

303
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,830
- What is it?
- The thing is...

304
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,160
So, you're not the only one
that Hyun-ji can't remember.

305
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,700
They say she can't remember
what happened five years ago.

306
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,260
Hyun-ji was a victim
of a hit-and-run accident.

307
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,030
I think she has problems
remembering because of trauma.

308
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,060
The amnesia is only temporary.

309
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,900
Her memories will return in time
so don't be too disappointed.

310
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
We should be ecstatic
and grateful that Hyun-ji is alive.

311
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,700
And at times like this, you should
be by her side, don't you think?

312
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,960
You punks!

313
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,230
Who came back alive
from a hit-and-run accident?

314
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,500
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

315
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,930
What?

316
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,700
Bong-pal left his bag behind
and we brought it for him.

317
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,960
We'll be on our way now.

318
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,660
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

319
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,600
See you later.

320
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,400
Bong-pal, is Hyun-ji alive then?

321
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:46,860
Yes, she's in the
hospital I was staying at.

322
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,130
That child was not a ghost.

323
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,100
Unbelievable.

324
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,430
He should be jumping up and down
with joy. Why does he look so down?

325
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,760
We should be ecstatic
and grateful that Hyun-ji is alive.

326
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:23,930
And at times like this, you should
be by her side, don't you think?

327
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,700
Are you okay after
saying all that to him?

328
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,760
- About what?
- Well,

329
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,930
you're trying to get
Hyun-ji and Bong-pal together.

330
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,230
Have you completely
given up on her then?

331
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,100
Hyun-ji's happiness is my happiness.

332
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,200
I'm good as long as she's happy.

333
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,000
Plus, there's something
more important than that.

334
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,860
What?

335
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,930
We have to catch
that punk and get revenge.

336
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,960
- Who?
- The bastard that

337
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,730
put her in a coma five years ago.

338
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,260
It's my life's mission
to catch that punk.

339
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,960
- Chun-sang.
- Yeah?

340
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,100
Do you have
that detective's business card?

341
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,100
- Business card?
- The business card

342
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,460
we got from that detective...

343
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,200
The business card we
got when Sadako died.

344
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,760
Ah!

345
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,630
I have it, I have it, I have it.

346
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,330
I do have it. Here it is.

347
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,630
Let's go.

348
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,630
To the police station.

349
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,830
Let's go! To the police station!

350
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,000
Goodness, it's not even a case.

351
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Why did you come all the way here?

352
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
There's something I need
to find out personally.

353
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,500
This is old news.
It's a simple accident.

354
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
There's nothing to look over.

355
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,600
Is the scene of the crime still there?

356
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Why? You want to go there?

357
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,860
Yes.

358
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,730
Okay, he fell right here.

359
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,960
Anyway, he was already
dead when we arrived.

360
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,100
I think he died from
internal bleeding.

361
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,560
One of the residents discovered
the body while passing by.

362
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:19,000
She said she didn't see him fall.
That's what happened.

363
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,030
Is anyone there? Someone help!

364
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,730
A straight fall from the 15th floor.

365
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,800
What? You want to go
up to the 15th floor?

366
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,860
- Hello.
- Who are you?

367
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,930
- We called you earlier.
- Ah, yes.

368
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,060
- We're from the police station.
- I see.

369
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,960
- Please, excuse us for a moment.
- Please, excuse us for a moment.

370
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,860
It's nothing really.

371
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,460
This detective is from Seoul
and he just wants to take

372
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,400
a quick look around.

373
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,330
- It'll only be for a moment.
- Sure, go ahead.

374
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,860
Thank you.

375
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:27,000
There was no sign of
a struggle whatsoever

376
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,560
so it's hard to say
it was manslaughter.

377
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,630
And there was no letter or
statement left behind to indicate

378
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,860
it was suicide.

379
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,200
It was written on the autopsy
report that he drank a lot.

380
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,830
So he drank, smoked, and did this.

381
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,800
He lost his balance.

382
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,700
He tilted over and lost his balance.

383
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,460
Do you remember who
was home at that time?

384
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,560
When I went up...

385
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,260
the wife was there.

386
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:25,460
She didn't know
that her husband fell.

387
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,300
Was the son at home by any chance?

388
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,060
His name is Ju Hye-sung.
He was 13 years old at the time.

389
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,830
Yes, the son was home.

390
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,960
- Yeah, what is it?
- Senior.

391
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,130
- Where are you right now?
- Did you get something?

392
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,730
The chief is looking
all over for you.

393
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,530
- You need to get back immediately.
- I'm on my way.

394
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,360
Why are you so concerned
with a simple freak accident?

395
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,700
- Did you find something?
- I don't think it was.

396
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,800
What?

397
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,030
The railing is about one meter tall.

398
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,860
Ju Hye-sung's father
was 173 centimeters tall.

399
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,300
Even if he stood by the railing,
it'd be hard for him to

400
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
fall over on his own.

401
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,660
That's unless someone
pushed him from behind.

402
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,630
The only people who were home
were the wife and Ju Hye-sung.

403
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,400
So, what are you going to do?

404
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm going to reinvestigate
Professor Ju Hye-sung.

405
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,630
(Hanil University Hospital)

406
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,500
Slowly.

407
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,730
Very good. Pull a little more.

408
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,830
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

409
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,300
I'm going to increase
the speed just a little bit.

410
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,900
Hello?

411
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
Yes.

412
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:15,260
- Let's stop here for today.
- Okay.

413
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,230
Be careful.

414
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,660
You're doing very well.

415
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,500
The muscles are responding well so
you should be able to use crutches.

416
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,230
Even though it's hard,
you have to keep it up.

417
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,760
I will.

418
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,360
Where did my mom go?

419
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,460
- Should I take you to your room?
- No, I'll do it.

420
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,560
- This is exercise, too.
- Okay, then.

421
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,360
- Thank you.
- Good job today.

422
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,930
- Hello.
- Hello.

423
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,660
Hello, Doctor.

424
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,460
- Hello, Ms. Hyun-ji.
- Hello.

425
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,860
This is a piece of cake.

426
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,760
Are you okay?

427
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,830
Yes.

428
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,230
You look tired. Where is your room?
I'll take you there.

429
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,630
Thank you.

430
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,500
You're welcome.

431
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,400
It must be your first time
in a wheelchair.

432
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,860
You looked very clumsy.

433
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,400
Ah, yes. I've only been
using it for several days.

434
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,800
You should be careful. It's actually
quite harder than it looks.

435
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,030
- Are you a doctor here?
- No.

436
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,160
I used to volunteer at a hospital,
which is when I tried one out.

437
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,030
I see.

438
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,330
I hear you were in
a coma for five years.

439
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,230
Oh, how did you find out?

440
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,630
What kind of accident was it?

441
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,530
A hit-and-run accident.

442
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,300
But the truth is, I don't remember.

443
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,660
Not even remotely?

444
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:30,130
Yes, the doctor says
it's because of the shock.

445
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
But he says my memories
will return with time.

446
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,300
What a relief.

447
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,960
Hyun-ji.

448
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,900
It's my mom.

449
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,560
Mom.

450
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,760
Where were you?
I was looking all over for you.

451
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,300
Who is he?

452
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,900
Ah, this person escorted me.

453
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,330
Really? Thank you.

454
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,130
- You're too kind.
- Not at all.

455
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,500
I'll be on my way now.

456
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,100
- Good luck.
- Yes, thank you.

457
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:13,700
Who is he?

458
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,900
He is so good-looking.
He's exactly my type.

459
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,300
Oh.

460
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,030
A present for you.

461
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,700
What is it?

462
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,600
This is mine?

463
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,130
- Yes.
- Thank you!

464
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,560
Nice.

465
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,460
Come in.

466
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,000
What the heck? He's here again.

467
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm not a weirdo
so don't be afraid of me.

468
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,800
I want to apologize for last time.

469
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,360
I didn't know you
lost your memories.

470
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,200
What are you doing?

471
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,700
It's my student ID.

472
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,930
I'm a sophomore business
major at Myongsung University.

473
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,400
Call the school if you doubt me.

474
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,600
Why did you come again?

475
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,600
You're going to regret
treating me like this

476
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,200
once your memories return.

477
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,860
Regret, my butt.

478
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,130
Just who are you to keep
bothering me like this?

479
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,200
Park Bong-pal.

480
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,930
Park Bong-pal?

481
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,760
That's right, Park Bong-pal.

482
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,930
Your boyfriend.

483
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
- Granted, you don't remember.
- What?

484
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,430
Boyfriend?

485
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,760
Yes.

486
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:55,530
We were an item? I dated you?

487
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,030
Yes.

488
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,830
No, it's more like lived together…
That's more accurate.

489
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,300
What are you saying?
Why would I live with you? When?

490
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,360
- When you were a ghost.
- What? A ghost?

491
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,360
- You've lost your mind!
- I'm perfectly sane.

492
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,230
- You chased me around.
- No way.

493
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,760
You're not my type.

494
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,830
Get out.

495
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,200
You don't have to
remember right away.

496
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,430
I'm grateful that you're alive
and well… and haven't disappeared.

497
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,260
You bought a new cell phone.

498
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,600
What are you doing?

499
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,800
I'm giving you my number.
Call me if you miss me.

500
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,660
Get out. Get out!

501
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,330
- I came back to this today.
- Today?

502
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,660
- You're coming again tomorrow?
- Yes.

503
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,460
Don't ever come again.
I swear I'll call the cops on you

504
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,830
if you come back tomorrow!

505
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,760
I'm coming tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

506
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,030
I'm going to come every day
until you remember.

507
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,200
Every single day.

508
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,200
See you tomorrow.

509
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,460
Ah... and call me if you
want to hear my voice.

510
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,030
Wow.

511
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
(My Love Bong Bong)

512
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,300
What a crazy bastard!

513
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,830
What is it?

514
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,630
What's wrong? Did something happen?

515
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,160
No, it's nothing.

516
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,960
Did you buy this?

517
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,130
No!

518
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,130
Just throw it all away.
The books, too.

519
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,960
It's exactly like the one
you used to use before.

520
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,100
- Really?
- Really.

521
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,900
You always used
a pink cup and toothbrush.

522
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,200
- Did I?
- Ever since you were little.

523
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:13,500
You threw such a fit
if I bought you a different color.

524
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,000
Mom, wait.

525
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,230
What is it?

526
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,700
Just leave it there for now.

527
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,230
You're so wishy-washy.

528
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,600
Here.

529
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,100
Let's see here.

530
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,130
(Bong-pal loves Hyun-ji)

531
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,230
This looks like my handwriting.

532
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,060
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji.

533
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,700
What is it? Are you in pain?

534
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,660
My head hurts.

535
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,060
(Hanil University Hospital)

536
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,200
Hyun-ji.

537
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,960
- Let's go.
- Sure.

538
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,460
For a patient who was
in a coma for five years,

539
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,830
your recovery speed is amazing.

540
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,760
- You're in great condition, too.
- Really?

541
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,960
When do I get discharged then?
It's so stuffy in here.

542
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:29,900
At this rate, you can start
receiving outpatient treatment

543
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,600
in three days.

544
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,330
Yes!

545
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,800
Is he not here today?

546
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,630
It's strange not seeing him.

547
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,660
No, what am I talking about?

548
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,700
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

549
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,830
I am going to introduce
you to a new friend today.

550
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,200
This fellow's name is Happy.

551
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,260
- It's that guy from last time.
- And he's three years old.

552
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,360
What is he doing?

553
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:12,800
What are all of your names? Can you
please introduce yourself to Happy?

554
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,930
- Yes!
- You go first.

555
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,700
- Hi, I'm Ji-woo.
- Hi, Ji-woo.

556
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,360
- Hi, I'm Hyun-soo.
- Hi, Hyun-soo.

557
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,530
- Hi, I'm Seo-woo.
- Hi, Seo-woo.

558
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,100
Now that we've introduced
ourselves, how about we get

559
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,000
friendlier with Happy?

560
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,330
Yes!

561
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,630
All you have to do is
gently pet him, okay?

562
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,460
Yes.

563
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,830
Gently. Happy might get scared.

564
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,800
- Hi.
- Be gentle.

565
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,530
He's so cute.

566
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,800
He's so soft and cute.

567
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,130
- Thank you.
- Bye.

568
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,100
Yes, goodbye.

569
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,300
Bye, see you next time.

570
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,030
You look much better.
I see that you can walk now.

571
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,200
Yes.

572
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
He's so cute.

573
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,230
You said you do volunteer work.
Do you volunteer here as well?

574
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,060
- Yes.
- What did you just do now?

575
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,760
Pet therapy. It helps patients
recover from or better

576
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,330
cope with health issues.
It's a type of psychotherapy.

577
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,500
I probably need it too.

578
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,830
Of course.

579
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,400
- Do you want to hold him?
- Yes.

580
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,260
Here you go.

581
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,300
- His name is Happy.
- Hi, Happy.

582
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,960
Excuse me,
is this Kim Hyun-ji's room?

583
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,730
Yes, that's correct.
How did you get here?

584
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:06,300
- Did she go somewhere?
- She's at physical therapy.

585
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,100
Who are you?

586
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,960
Kim Hyun-ji and I don't really
know each other very well…

587
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,260
By any chance, are you her mother?

588
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,800
Yes.

589
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,860
Congratulations on
your daughter waking up.

590
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,400
This is my gift.

591
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,660
- Thank you.
- I'll get going.

592
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,860
Wait, sir.

593
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,700
Who should I say came to visit her?

594
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:45,860
Tell her a mean monk who once
said some harsh words to her came.

595
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,900
Please, tell her I'm sorry.

596
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,200
Have a good day.

597
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,200
Ah, so you're a professor.
No wonder.

598
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,060
The school you're teaching at
is the school I wanted to attend.

599
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,000
I was going to apply to Myongsung
University before the accident.

600
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,160
I'd probably be graduating by now.

601
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,300
Come visit the school
once you're discharged

602
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,130
and attend one of my classes.

603
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,030
- Really? I can do that?
- Of course.

604
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,130
I get discharged in three days.
Can I come then?

605
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,460
- Yes.
- Yes!

606
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,000
Why is that punk here?

607
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,230
Monk Myung-chul.

608
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,060
Hey, Bong-pal.

609
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,900
What are you doing here?

610
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,530
Oh, just because. Just because.

611
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,460
Why are Hyun-ji
and the professor together?

612
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,400
Hyun-ji?

613
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,160
Ah, the girl next to that
professor is Hyun-ji, huh?

614
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,630
Yes.

615
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,600
Monk Myung-chul.

616
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,830
Monk Myung-chul?

617
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,160
It's nothing.
I'm going to get going.

618
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,260
You scared me.

619
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,630
You look like you're
in a good mood today.

620
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,630
I was in such a good
mood before I saw you.

621
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,930
I was wondering why
you didn't come today.

622
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,530
- Were you waiting for me?
- You wish!

623
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,960
Wait...

624
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,430
Do you remember anything?

625
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,260
Go to a mental institute
and stop bothering me!

626
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,800
What about lunch? Did you eat?

627
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,000
What's it to you if I eat or not?

628
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,430
It's boring eating
hospital food every day.

629
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,400
I packed a lunch today.
Let's go eat it together.

630
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,560
No thank you. You eat it.

631
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,900
I brought jangjorim and meat.

632
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:28,930
Meat?

633
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,200
Yes, meat.

634
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,900
Here, dig in.

635
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,960
Just because I'm eating this doesn't
mean that I've opened up to you.

636
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:53,830
I'm only tasting it out of courtesy.

637
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,230
Okay, just give it a taste.

638
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,430
Shall I then?

639
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,160
It's kimchi stew.

640
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,760
- You have to put tons of meat...
- You have to put tons of meat in.

641
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:12,960
In for it to taste good…

642
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,600
I did. Eat it.

643
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,900
You're pretty good.

644
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,530
Here, rolled eggs.
You like this.

645
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,500
You've been stalking me,
haven't you? How can you know

646
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,700
everything I like?

647
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,200
- You followed me around.
- Don't be ridiculous.

648
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,160
Don't lie!

649
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,100
Here.

650
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,460
How can I like all these dishes?

651
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,300
You're a pretty good cook.

652
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,930
Whether you're a ghost or human,
that hearty appetite

653
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,230
is still the same.

654
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,960
It's meat.

655
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,600
I don't know what you're up to.

656
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,230
But it won't go your way.

657
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,400
- Hello.
- Goodness, hello.

658
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,330
Hello.

659
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,230
Is Professor Ju Hye-sung in?

660
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,260
He's not here right now.
Can we help you with something?

661
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,400
I just wanted to say hello.

662
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,430
- When will he return?
- He'll be back in about an hour.

663
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,960
- Should I give him a call?
- No, that's not necessary.

664
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,830
I'll come again.

665
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,400
By any chance…
may I use the bathroom?

666
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,100
Of course!
The bathroom is downstairs.

667
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,700
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

668
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,360
Kim Hyun-ji.

669
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,100
Why is her student ID here?

670
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,160
- You're back, sir.
- You came back early.

671
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,460
Yes, the appointment was canceled.

672
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:55,830
- Everything's fine?
- Yes.

673
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,000
Ah, sir.

674
00:51:58,060 --> 00:51:59,860
Someone is here to see you.

675
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,930
- Who?
- The monk who came last time.

676
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,330
He's in the bathroom right now.

677
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,160
Goodness... the professor is here.

678
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:22,360
This is not the bathroom.

679
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,460
- I think you're lost.
- No kidding.

680
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,030
I went into the wrong room.

681
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,600
I'm full.

682
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,200
Since I ate all your dishes
for you, I'm going to leave now.

683
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,830
Already? Stay a bit longer.

684
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,360
I'm bored.

685
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:08,960
I wish I could, but visiting
hours are almost over.

686
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,230
See you. Hand me my crutches.

687
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,500
Hey!

688
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,600
- I'll walk you to your room.
- It's fine. I can do it myself.

689
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:23,630
- I'll walk you to your room.
- I said it's fine!

690
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,430
What the heck are you doing?

691
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,660
You were falling.

692
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,900
We almost kissed!

693
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,030
I haven't had my first kiss yet.

694
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,360
That's... not true.

695
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,560
Then...

696
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,800
You pervert!

697
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,830
Hey, hey, hey!

698
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,730
Do you want to die?

699
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,430
Ow!

700
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,960
Hey!

701
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:09,360
My first kiss what? I told you
not to mess around with me!

702
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,230
Ow! Ow! Ow!

703
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Jerk.

704
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,230
She's good at fighting.

705
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:43,030
It feels good to hit him.

706
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,360
Where have you been?

707
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:49,160
- I went for a short walk.
- Let's go in.

708
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:52,260
- Thank you.
- Be careful when you walk.

709
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,530
I will.

710
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,230
The professor is off today
so I came in his place.

711
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,100
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes.

712
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,100
Oh, I don't see
Doctor Kim Jung-woo either.

713
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,900
Pardon? Who?

714
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Doctor Kim Jung-woo.
You know, the really tall guy.

715
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,400
We don't have a doctor by that name.

716
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,600
- Rest up then.
- Thank you.

717
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,600
Rest up.

718
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,200
My cell phone.

719
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,900
I must've dropped it on the roof.

720
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,160
She's so clumsy.

721
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
(Crazy Stalker)

722
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,900
Kim Jung-woo.

723
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:35,860
Kim Jung-woo?
I've heard that name somewhere.

724
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,800
Do you know a Kim Jung-woo?

725
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,500
Kim Jung-woo?

726
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,200
He used to work at our hospital.

727
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,530
You know him?

728
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,900
You don't know him?

729
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:55,560
About 10 years ago,
that doctor died in our hospital.

730
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,360
That doctor killed a patient
in the operating room.

731
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:10,330
Not only in our hospital but also
in the previous hospital

732
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,760
where he worked.

733
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:14,830
He killed patients during surgery.

734
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,400
Look at him.

735
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,900
Right behind you.

736
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,460
- There's blood all over him.
- I can't believe it.

737
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,060
Once the police started
to investigate, he killed himself

738
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:42,800
in one of our offices.

739
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,800
Bong-pal!

740
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,700
(Bring it on, Ghost)

741
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,160
Pull it tight!

742
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,230
What are you doing?

743
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,260
Ju Hye-sung is a professor
at Myongsung University.

744
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,030
I'm sure you'll find
something on him.

745
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,230
- Is it a gift for your girlfriend?
- Yes.

746
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,430
- You may leave now.
- Where's Bong-pal?

747
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,330
You don't know what kind of
person he is. Don't get too close.

748
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,200
Professor Ju will be in charge
of Ms. Hyun-ji's psychotherapy.

749
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,330
I'm leaving tomorrow.

750
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,800
He said he'd come, but he's not here.

751
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,700
Are you sure you have it?

752
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,760
All the evil acts you committed
will come back to haunt you.
