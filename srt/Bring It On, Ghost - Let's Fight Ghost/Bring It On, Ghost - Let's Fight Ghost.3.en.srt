1
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,800
So... did something pop up?

2
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,960
You said your memories
would return if we kissed.

3
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,700
- Hey.
- Yeah?

4
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,160
Anyhow, I did it. It's time for
you to return the favor.

5
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,230
It's nothing difficult.

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,930
Just help me out like
you did today with exorcisms.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,500
I noticed earlier that
you're quite useful.

8
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,200
Hey, are you listening to me?

9
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,930
Yeah. Yes.

10
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,860
If you help me with
the exorcisms, I'll overlook

11
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,530
the $10,000 you owe me.

12
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
Hey.

13
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,030
What are you doing?

14
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,930
Sorry.

15
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,030
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,960
Did she just run away?

17
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,900
What if her memories
returning was all a lie?

18
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,900
I'm so freaking tired.

19
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
Sorry.

20
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,300
Hey, where are you going? Hey!

21
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,930
You're an idiot for
listening to a ghost.

22
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,960
It's not the first time a virgin
ghost played you like that.

23
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,300
I'm so angry.

24
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,960
Let's see here.

25
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,730
I totally forgot to buy groceries.

26
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,330
It's all because of that crazy ghost.

27
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,500
Seriously though, where
did Monk Myung-chul go?

28
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,430
She's really nowhere in sight.

29
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Fine, I better not catch you.

30
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,560
You're still here.

31
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,960
Just where is my honey?

32
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,260
I know for a fact
that it's this school.

33
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,030
Honey! Honey! Honey, Honey! Honey!

34
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,830
Where are you, honey? Honey!

35
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,960
- Hi, Hyun-ji.
- Where have you been?

36
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,830
- Finding my honey.
- My honey?

37
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,960
Yes.

38
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,300
It's been 30 years and I finally
found the man of my dreams.

39
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm only going to follow him now.

40
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,130
You changed guys again?

41
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,430
You said that the other guy was
the man of your dreams last time.

42
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,930
It's the real deal this time.

43
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,200
He's so tall with porcelain skin…

44
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,060
He was looking straight at
me with those dewy eyes of his.

45
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,700
I had so many butterflies
in my stomach.

46
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,230
Plus, he's pretty broad-shouldered.

47
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,330
He's perfect to cling on to.

48
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,500
I see.

49
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,660
What's the matter with you?

50
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,260
Did something happen?

51
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,630
The thing is...

52
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,659
Really?

53
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:44,530
So, it wasn't a soft and squishy
blood sausage, but that guy's lips?

54
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,330
Yes.

55
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,900
Oh my gosh! I'm so jealous!

56
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,700
No, wait. So you kissed
that guy again, right?

57
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,530
Did you remember anything?

58
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,530
- No. Nothing!
- Nothing?

59
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,960
- Absolutely nothing?
- Yes!

60
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,830
I don't know what happened!
I remembered something last time.

61
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,000
How strange.

62
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,460
What should I do, Kyung-ja?

63
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,100
Whom are you looking for?

64
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,299
Were you looking for me?

65
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,730
Hey, it's been a day
since we've seen each other.

66
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,130
Aren't you happy to see me?

67
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,500
I'm very happy to see you.

68
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,360
- Come on, you're scaring me.
- Come on?

69
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,730
You really don't know?

70
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,700
Shameless, selfish,
and arrogant to boot…

71
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,630
Forget it. What would I
talk about with a ghost?

72
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,330
Just stick to him
like glue no matter what.

73
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
Who knows? Your memories
might just come back again.

74
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,500
You said he's an elite
college student, right?

75
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,630
Then ask him to help you with
your exams. Do everything you can.

76
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,530
I'm pretty sure he's got something.

77
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,830
Bong-pal, wait for me!

78
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Bong-pal! Bong, Bong!

79
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,100
- How are you?
- Hello, Professor.

80
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,160
- What brings you here?
- Well... Professor.

81
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,500
About the dog you saved last time.

82
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,830
- Yes?
- May I take care of it?

83
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,860
Of course. That's perfect.
He hasn't found an owner yet.

84
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,530
Honestly, I saw him on the way here
and I can't stop thinking about him.

85
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,130
Ah, I see.

86
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,700
Can you come after class, then?

87
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,060
- Around 3 o'clock should be good.
- Yes, thank you.

88
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,660
It's a very happy day for him today.

89
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm already looking forward to it.

90
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,560
Say goodbye to love.

91
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,130
You're back with me again.

92
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,960
Hey, have you decided
not to speak to me?

93
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,730
I will help you.

94
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,460
Answer me!

95
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,530
- Hand it over.
- Will you forgive me if I do?

96
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,000
- I said, hand it over.
- No.

97
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,400
Hey, wait for me.

98
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,830
Why do you keep following me?

99
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,630
I told you that I'd help you
with the exorcisms.

100
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,560
Do you honestly believe
I'll trust a ghost's word again?

101
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,360
Why not? I'm very trustworthy.

102
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,930
You're lying about your memories.
I know exactly what you're up to!

103
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,360
- I'm not lying!
- What is it, then?

104
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,100
What about your memories?
Did they come back?

105
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,960
- No... they haven't.
- See?

106
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,500
I was told not to believe
the words of a virgin ghost.

107
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,600
My memories popped up last
time but not this time.

108
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,000
That's why I did what I did. I'm not
being sneaky so please believe me.

109
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,860
- You believe me, right?
- Then what?

110
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,600
Your memories haven't returned
so why are you agreeing to help me?

111
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,000
Well... I was hoping
you could help me study for

112
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,430
my college entrance exams.

113
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,930
- Your exams?
- Yes.

114
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,730
You have to be pretty
smart to attend this school.

115
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,630
Why would a ghost study
for the college entrance exams?

116
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,100
I don't remember, but I think
that's why I can't cross over.

117
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,430
Maybe the college entrance exams
are my unfinished business.

118
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,830
Please help me.
It's not that difficult.

119
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,760
If you help me study,
I will pay you that $10,000.

120
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,460
Take off $2,000 per exorcism!
What do you think? Great, no?

121
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,600
I get $1,000 per ghost.

122
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,060
Then, $800?

123
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,030
$500 per ghost.
Take it or leave it.

124
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,100
I'll take it!
$500 per ghost it is!

125
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,460
Wait for me!

126
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,130
You've been at this
since last night. Give it a rest.

127
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,430
Nothing good will come out of it if
you keep messing with Sadako.

128
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
He's evil.

129
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,100
You said he emptied out
your account several days ago.

130
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,500
Yes, he did. He bled me dry.

131
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,760
You call yourself my friend,
yet you have no loyalty

132
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,830
and refuse to help me.

133
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,000
Just go and get your scholarship.

134
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,560
This Sadako needs
a taste of his own medicine.

135
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,630
He talked crap about me
on the live broadcast and now

136
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
he's bullying me here!

137
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,530
How dare he touch my pride!
You're so dead.

138
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
And he's the one who
uploaded that video!

139
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:08,030
Die, Sadako!

140
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,760
It used to be buy-one-get-one-free.
The promotion must be over.

141
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,530
What are you doing?

142
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a toothbrush.

143
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,260
I know that, but why
are you putting it in here?

144
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,760
Because I need one
if we're going to be together.

145
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,600
Who said I'm going to
spend time with you?

146
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,530
- Put it back immediately.
- Why? We're a team now.

147
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,500
Some teams live together.
It's no big deal.

148
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I don't live with ghosts, okay?

149
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,230
So you want me to go back and forth
to slay ghosts and study?

150
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,330
It'd be easier if I just
stuck around, don't you think?

151
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,030
The truth is, I have no place to go.

152
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,000
Please! Please? Please?

153
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,330
Then including room and board...
it's $250 per ghost.

154
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,260
$250…

155
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll never be able to
pay back the $10,000!

156
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,330
- Forget it then.
- Okay, okay! Deal.

157
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,200
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

158
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,330
I'd like a mackerel, please.

159
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,960
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Have a good day.

160
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,660
Bong-pal, let's eat some meat.

161
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,660
Meat! Meat! Meat!

162
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,930
Meat, my butt.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
It's been a while since I ate meat.
We can use this to make some stew.

164
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,760
No.

165
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,360
- I said, no.
- I want it.

166
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,100
No!

167
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,360
We're not eating meat!

168
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,400
- Let go.
- No.

169
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,630
I said, let go!

170
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,730
Meat. Delicious meat.

171
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm going to eat a lot of meat.

172
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,900
Are you happy? Because of you,
I'm overspending on living expenses!

173
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,900
You're going to eat it, too.

174
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,500
Hey! Bong-pal!

175
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,030
Can you buy me that dress?

176
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,960
To celebrate working together.

177
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,430
No.

178
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,260
I know that dress will look really
good on me. Don't you think so?

179
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,600
No, I do not think so.
It won't look good on you at all.

180
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,100
No, look carefully.

181
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,930
What do you think?
It's pretty, isn't it?

182
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,160
Buy me this dress!

183
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,060
He's always walking off like that…

184
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,530
Wait for me!

185
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,900
His eyesight is not that great.

186
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,000
You'll have to bring him in at least
once a week for the time being.

187
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,930
- Okay.
- Hold on.

188
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,100
Okay.
Once in the morning and evening...

189
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,030
Here, give this to him in
the morning and evening.

190
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,030
Okay.

191
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,599
It's time to say goodbye now.

192
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,599
Bye.

193
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,700
Goodness.

194
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,599
- Here.
- Thank you.

195
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,630
- Go ahead and hold him.
- Come here.

196
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,130
What do you think?
Isn't he adorable?

197
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,130
What's wrong?

198
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,530
Why do girls like that
always flock to the director?

199
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,900
- She is disgustingly pretty.
- Hey!

200
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,600
One-sided love is always sad.

201
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,200
Should we go grab
some drinks after work?

202
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,530
Really?

203
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
- It's your treat, right?
- Me?

204
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,900
What the heck?

205
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,160
Chun-sang?

206
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,200
What's wrong? Are you okay?

207
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,830
- Lara is dead.
- Lara...

208
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,860
She died without
even using her magic.

209
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,660
- Sadako, that bastard.
- I see.

210
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,830
It was fun, dummy.

211
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,060
Let's be civil here.
You're crossing the line.

212
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,160
Look at you.
You're just asking for it.

213
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,960
It's the same
as your live broadcast.

214
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,230
Where are you?

215
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,760
Why? Are you going to come?
Come and find me.

216
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,260
Don't mess with me from now on.

217
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,700
You're either missing a finger
or a part of your brain.

218
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,060
Or is it both?

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,160
Famous singer Miz has
committed suicide in her apartment.

220
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,730
She caused an even greater shock
by filming the incident herself.

221
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,030
What the heck?

222
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,560
Seriously!

223
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,560
What is this?

224
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,060
Don't come any closer!

225
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,930
Would it have killed
you to buy me that dress?

226
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,030
I bought you, toiletries and meat.
Now you want a dress?

227
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,800
Do you take me for a fool?

228
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,000
It's not that. Look at this.

229
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,060
My uniform is all worn out
from wearing it for five years.

230
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,330
Then what about the ghosts that
have been dead for over 100 years?

231
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,300
Haven't you seen the clothes
of virgin ghosts up close?

232
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,030
They're really dirty and they stink!

233
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,130
Ghosts shouldn't be
complaining about their clothes.

234
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
Can you even wear it
if I buy it for you?

235
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,930
Of course! You just have to burn it.

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
People usually burn
dead people's clothes.

237
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,300
- Buy new clothes to burn them?
- Yes.

238
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,200
I don't have
an endless supply of money.

239
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,200
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at my stuff.

240
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,030
What's with that look on your face?

241
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,330
- Why do you look so pleased?
- I'm happy.

242
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,630
- About what? About that?
- Yes.

243
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,500
It's been five years since
I've received a present.

244
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,260
Of course, I'm happy.

245
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,660
Oh, please.

246
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,160
I have no memories
so I can't even eat food on

247
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,660
the anniversary of my death.

248
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,300
It's my first gift
ever since I died.

249
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,860
But can ghosts
even brush their teeth?

250
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,760
Why? Are we not allowed to?

251
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,860
I'm a very hygienic ghost.
What's the matter with you?

252
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,230
You said,
it's your first gift in five years.

253
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,430
Then it's been five years
since you've brushed your teeth.

254
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,660
Oh yeah, you're very hygienic.

255
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,400
It tastes better with a lot of meat.
Don't be stingy and put some more.

256
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,500
I put in more than enough.
I'm doing all the work here.

257
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,660
Stop distracting me and be quiet.

258
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,130
It looks so good.

259
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,900
Bong-pal!

260
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,500
Bong-pal!

261
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,500
Bong-pal!

262
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,660
Where have you been?

263
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,400
I had to go find something.

264
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,200
- Why is that there?
- What?

265
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,860
That thing right there! I've been
looking all over for it today!

266
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,800
- Did you take it?
- Why would I take that?

267
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,530
- It was here since yesterday.
- Since yesterday?

268
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,200
I must be getting weak.

269
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,730
That smells delicious. Let's eat.

270
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,930
Sure. Please, sit.

271
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,660
Gosh, what's the occasion?
I can't believe you made this.

272
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,730
- You made this for me, didn't you?
- Dig in.

273
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,930
Ah, you're a good boy!

274
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,900
That was good.

275
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,800
Oh, my stomach hurts.

276
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,030
That was tasty.

277
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,460
What about the meat?

278
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,760
I'm really sorry.

279
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,260
Is that monk always here?

280
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,200
Not always.
He's here about twice a month.

281
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,300
Oh my gosh!

282
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,300
What's up with this toothbrush?

283
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,630
That's my toothbrush!

284
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,560
Did you buy it for me to use?

285
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,930
Of all the colors,
why did you pick pink?

286
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
That's mine!
What is up with that monk?

287
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,330
I'll use it well.

288
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,630
No!

289
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,530
I am so angry!

290
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,330
I hope you fall flat on your
face and break your nose.

291
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,700
Goodness, did I break my arm?

292
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,300
Gosh, I ate too much.

293
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,230
Oh, my back.

294
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,130
Serves you right.

295
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,230
By the way, where do I sleep?

296
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
Why does he always sleep like that?

297
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,830
It's nice and soft.

298
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,430
How comfortable. How long has it
been since I've slept on a bed?

299
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,360
Hey, Bong-pal.

300
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,830
Why did you sleep out here
instead of your room?

301
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,000
It was hot.

302
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,100
If you were hot, why did
you hold onto me last night?

303
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,100
I did not!

304
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,060
By any chance...

305
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,960
Did you... did you
miss being in my arms?

306
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,460
Come on! Seriously!

307
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,060
People should
definitely live together.

308
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,830
Where are you going
without breakfast?

309
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,860
I have business to
take care of in Icheon.

310
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:46,060
Make sure you eat well. I'll see
you on your mother's memorial day.

311
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,930
- His mother's memorial day?
- And Bong-pal.

312
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,030
Don't go around exorcising ghosts.

313
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:57,500
And don't get close to
virgin ghosts, nothing but trouble.

314
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,100
They're monsters, got it?

315
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,860
Yes, I understand.

316
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,000
Don't just tell me
that you understand, huh?

317
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,130
All right.

318
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,860
I feel a strange
energy in this place.

319
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,000
Do you see anything?

320
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,500
No, I don't see anything.

321
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,630
Take care of yourself.
I'm leaving.

322
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,130
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

323
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,800
Does he think that
all ghosts are evil?

324
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,060
There are so many nice ghosts
like myself out there.

325
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,330
I don't like him at all.
He's quick to pass judgment.

326
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,630
Bong-pal. When are we going to eat?

327
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,330
Do you always ask about food
the moment you wake up?

328
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,030
Hey. Let's redo our contract.

329
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,560
What? Why?

330
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,400
I said I'd provide
accommodation and food.

331
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,060
But seeing you eat,
I won't be able to afford this.

332
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,260
- So...
- So?

333
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,460
Let's knock it down
to $200 from $250.

334
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,030
Gosh.

335
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,800
How much can I possibly eat?

336
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,900
As you can see,
there's nothing left.

337
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,300
How could you go through half

338
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,300
one week's worth of food in one day?

339
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,400
Don't you think
you're going too far?

340
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,860
I didn't eat that much.

341
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,100
You ate a lot.

342
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,700
You shouldn't be so petty
when it comes to food.

343
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,030
I need to eat well to exorcise well.

344
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,430
We haven't even started working yet.

345
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,300
What? If you don't like it,
we can forget the whole thing.

346
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,400
Gosh, how petty.

347
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,330
Do whatever you like!

348
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,000
Give me more.

349
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,100
Fine.

350
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,030
I'm so full now.

351
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,900
Where are you going?

352
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,300
- Why do you ask?
- So I can come with you.

353
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,500
I don't think so.

354
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,860
Even if we live together

355
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,930
let's not get involved in
each other's private lives, okay?

356
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,730
I will slap this Sadako,
such a psycho!

357
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,700
I will slap him once or twice...

358
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,830
- I will end him, seriously.
- This is the place.

359
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,200
His address is this dorm
for people studying for civil exams.

360
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,330
But is it okay to just
come by like this?

361
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,660
According to the rumors,
he knows martial arts.

362
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,700
None of that is true!

363
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,060
I will seriously slap him.

364
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,760
It's room 307... 307.

365
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,360
3 and wait.

366
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,430
Excuse me, I'm here.

367
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,700
Sadako, Black Star BJ Angel is here.

368
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,660
Okay?

369
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,530
He's scared, huh?

370
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,130
Come on, seriously...

371
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,700
Get out! Get out!

372
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,700
He was notorious for writing nasty
comments on social media sites.

373
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,160
He's been sued a lot.

374
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,860
Also, he was sued by
the singer, Miz, as well.

375
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,060
- The singer who killed herself?
- Yes.

376
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:10,429
- Who are they?
- They're the ones who called it in.

377
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,960
They found him
when they came to fight him.

378
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:17,030
They came to have a real
fight after fighting in a game?

379
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,960
You go to Myongsung University, huh?

380
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,600
I see many students
from there these days.

381
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,760
The punk from last time
went to Myongsung, too.

382
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,100
So you got his ID
and hacked his account, huh?

383
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,730
You got mad while chatting
with him and came here, huh?

384
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,460
Yes, sir.

385
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,030
You were mad
so you killed him, huh?

386
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
- Correct.
- What?

387
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,800
No way! He was already dead
when we got there.

388
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,800
- That's the truth. Correct?
- Correct. We didn't do anything.

389
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,060
- Seriously?
- Yes.

390
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:58,130
We checked the CCTV footage
from near his place.

391
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,100
We confirmed that
they came after the victim died.

392
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Their identification
has been checked out, too.

393
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,730
- But you might want to see this.
- What's all this?

394
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,260
All the nasty comments
made against the late Miz.

395
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,530
There are so many.

396
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,530
These are only for this month.

397
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,760
Gosh.

398
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,330
Gosh, they're all cursing her out.

399
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,830
They say that words can kill…

400
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,330
Who would want to live
after hearing such terrible things?

401
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,360
What did you want me to see?

402
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,760
The list of usernames that
wrote the nasty comments.

403
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,730
The one who wrote
the most is Sadako.

404
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,630
That username belonged to
Yang Hee-soo, the victim from today.

405
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,500
The leader of the anti-fan group,
Kim Kyung-ho, wrote the second most.

406
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,160
I just heard from Gangseo Station
that he also died.

407
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,300
His fingers were all broken,
just like Yang Hee-soo's.

408
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,300
The third person
who wrote the most is Jikdding.

409
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,000
And look at this username.

410
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,160
How do you say this?

411
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,300
Black star BJ 1004?

412
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,700
It is Black Star BJ Angel.

413
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,700
It's my username.

414
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,700
- You wrote a lot of nasty comments.
- No, it's just like I said earlier...

415
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,730
My account was hacked
and Sadako wrote all that.

416
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,160
I didn't write them. I'm serious.

417
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,230
The famous idol
who killed herself a few days ago

418
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
caused an even greater shock

419
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,000
by filming the incident herself.

420
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:37,100
The video is spreading
on the Internet and going viral.

421
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,830
It's still unknown
who leaked it and how.

422
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,830
The police are having a hard time.

423
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,700
About Sadako's death...

424
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,060
it has nothing to do
with Miz, does it?

425
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:00,100
Why did the detectives ask me
to call if something happens?

426
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,900
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

427
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,430
- What are you doing?
- Chun-sang.

428
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,930
Look at this one here. This...

429
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,500
This is the site
for Miz's anti-fans.

430
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,430
Sadako, the author of
nasty comments, died.

431
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,430
The administrator
of this site has died, too.

432
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,430
The news says
his fingers were broken.

433
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,630
Is this the start of Miz's curse?

434
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,760
Everyone who wrote any negative
comments should be careful.

435
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,830
Isn't Jikdding in danger, too?

436
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,660
No way. No way.

437
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,730
It can't be.

438
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,860
I liked Miz so much.
What am I going to do?

439
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,860
Is her ghost going
to come and haunt me?

440
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,800
It's ridiculous.

441
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,000
- Hey.
- I need to go to my hometown.

442
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,300
What are you talking about?
Your hometown is Seoul.

443
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,860
That's what I thought,
but it turns out it's not.

444
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,400
I asked my mom.

445
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,560
It's all the way down in
Gyeongsangnam-do… Jecheon.

446
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,660
- It's Jecheon.
- Jecheon is in Chungbuk.

447
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,930
Why are you acting this way
when I'm already scared to death?

448
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,630
- What is that?
- What is that?

449
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,300
Crazy brat…

450
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,230
She still wants attention
even after death?

451
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,260
Did you have to follow me to school?

452
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,530
Why not? It's fun.

453
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
I don't go to school
to make it fun for you.

454
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,760
You don't have to worry about me.

455
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:34,930
Besides, I may never get to
become a college student.

456
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,230
- Don't you feel sorry for me?
- Only if you can shut up.

457
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,460
Don't talk to her. Do not.

458
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,860
You're all about talk.

459
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,060
What do you mean?

460
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,230
Why is the lecture so long?

461
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,230
I'm starving.

462
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,830
Can we go eat first?

463
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,200
Did you die of starvation?
Why are you always hungry?

464
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,300
Maybe I did?

465
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,460
Wait. It's that girl.

466
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,060
Oh my, you're so happy, huh?

467
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,360
Don't just look at her.
Go over and ask her to lunch.

468
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,160
What lunch? Let's go.

469
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,530
- Ouch! Hey!
- Bong-pal.

470
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,060
Hello.

471
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,800
Come on. Ask her to lunch.

472
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,130
Hi. You're done with class?

473
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,260
- Yes, I am.
- Yes, I am?

474
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:41,500
Gosh, what kind of man are you?

475
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,730
- All right then. I will go first.
- Wait…

476
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,900
There you go. You're doing well.

477
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,360
- It's just that...
- Hurry up and say it.

478
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,200
- About lunch...
- What about lunch?

479
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,900
I wanted to tell you
to enjoy your lunch.

480
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,630
Oh, you do the same.

481
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,500
- See you later then.
- Sure.

482
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,860
Gosh, what was that about?

483
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,530
I wanted to tell you
to enjoy your lunch…

484
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,400
How are you ever going to
date someone like that?

485
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,030
- Hush.
- Hush.

486
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,660
- Don't repeat what I say.
- Don't repeat what I say.

487
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,900
- Do you want to die?
- I'm already dead.

488
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,560
Hey! Hey!

489
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,000
Professor Ju.

490
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,930
- Hi, Seo-yeon.
- How are you?

491
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,760
- How is the dog doing?
- Good.

492
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,500
He's doing well,
but he doesn't eat much.

493
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,500
Is that right?

494
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,960
It may be because
he's not used to where he is.

495
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,960
If you're worried,
bring him over to the clinic.

496
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,660
Thank you. When will be
a good time for you?

497
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,400
Well, any time in the afternoon
either today or tomorrow.

498
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,000
Great.
I will bring him over tomorrow then.

499
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,360
Alright then.
I will see you tomorrow.

500
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,300
You're not supposed
to feed the cats here.

501
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,930
I've been wondering
who was feeding the cat every day.

502
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,300
We meet finally.

503
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,430
Hello, Professor.

504
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,600
The building for
animal research is here.

505
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,200
We're strict about wild animals.

506
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,430
We shouldn't feed
the wild animals like this.

507
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,530
I'm sorry. The cat looked so hungry.

508
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,260
Then feed the cat
at that corner next time.

509
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,800
Pardon?

510
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,500
The security guard comes by here
often so you will get caught.

511
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,000
If you do that at the corner there,
no one will know.

512
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,730
- Not many people go there.
- Okay.

513
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,500
Wait.

514
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,130
By the way,
it looks like it just gave birth.

515
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,530
I saw kittens nearby, too.

516
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,500
By the way, what's good for
a cat who just gave birth?

517
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,900
Well, they will like
shredded chicken breast or beef.

518
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,900
But I will have
to examine it to be sure...

519
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,500
Come on.

520
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,460
Are you okay?

521
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,800
Yes, I'm okay.

522
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,830
It was vicious.

523
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,530
Why is this so confusing, seriously?

524
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,500
Here we go again.

525
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,860
It's all the will of Buddha.

526
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,330
Here we go.

527
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,930
I will start.

528
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,300
I'm sorry.

529
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,800
Buddhist prayer
is very modern these days.

530
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,230
I should take this. Excuse me.

531
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,200
What lousy timing, seriously.

532
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,430
Hello. Hold on a minute.

533
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,030
Hold on a minute, okay?

534
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,200
Park Ji-hoon,
345 Gyungwha-ro, Yangju-eup,

535
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,560
Yangju-gun, Gwangwon-do.

536
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,160
Hey, I'm asking you
because I can't be there.

537
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,730
It's near your place.

538
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,360
Go there and see what he's up to.

539
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,830
I can't get in touch with him.

540
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,660
He's Bong-pal's father.

541
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,000
All right then.

542
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,130
It's not good to have a crush
on someone for too long.

543
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,700
Go tell her how you feel.

544
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,430
What is it? Are you being shy?

545
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,700
- You want big sister to help you?
- Big sister?

546
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,800
You not doing anything
is helping me.

547
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,000
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

548
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,130
- What is it?
- Mr. Bong-pal.

549
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,400
- I'm not interested in the club.
- That's not it.

550
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,630
I wonder if you can
help Chun-sang at all.

551
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,500
God, Buddha,
and gods of heaven and earth.

552
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,760
Why is Kim In-rang taking so long?

553
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,860
It's just that...

554
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:14,400
You know the singer,
Miz, right? She died

555
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,760
and Chun-sang wrote some
nasty comments on a website.

556
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:19,500
No, there is this guy named Sadako.

557
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,060
Sadako hacked Chun-sang's account.

558
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:28,100
So... Chun-sang...

559
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,560
It's from Chun-sang.

560
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,260
Hello? I'm with Bong-pal now.

561
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,130
- Are you?
- Chun-sang, hello?

562
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,160
- Hello?
- Hello?

563
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,830
In-rang...

564
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,500
Chun-sang!

565
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,830
We have to go now!
Now! We have to go now.

566
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,960
We have to go save him.

567
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,860
God and Buddha. Please save me.

568
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,900
Don't!

569
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,330
Stop doing this.

570
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,400
You killing people
won't change anything.

571
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,000
All I wanted was
to get a compliment.

572
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,930
Why did they have
to hate me so much?

573
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,900
Why did they hate me so much?

574
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,730
You're the one
who hates yourself the most!

575
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,130
Killing people
won't change anything.

576
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,030
How dare you tell me what to do?

577
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,060
What could you possibly know?

578
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,630
Are you okay?

579
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
Yes.

580
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,800
You're the one
who hates yourself the most!

581
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:18,600
When you don't even like yourself,
who could like you?

582
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,600
Chun-sang!

583
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,030
Chun-sang!

584
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:52,930
Chun-sang!
What do we do with him? Chun-sang!

585
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,430
I'm so tired.

586
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,700
Gosh, I can't walk anymore.

587
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,300
I'll go home first
and wait for you there.

588
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,660
It's my first time
being jealous of a ghost.

589
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,660
What was that? You said you
were going home first.

590
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,230
- Why are you there?
- I don't know.

591
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,500
Maybe it's because I'm tired.
I can't seem to teleport.

592
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,500
Let me try again.

593
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:32,660
Gosh, you scared me.

594
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,730
What now?
I thought you were going home.

595
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,300
I have no idea.

596
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,630
Other ghosts
seem to do it just fine.

597
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,130
Why do I keep messing up?

598
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,100
My uniform is all worn out
from wearing it for five years.

599
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,060
Even the skirt is ripped.

600
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,600
- Good work today.
- I did a good job, didn't I?

601
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,700
Of course, I did.
You did a good job, Hyun-ji.

602
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,700
I can't say anything to you.

603
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,060
Speaking of which,
can we have meat today?

604
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,330
I couldn't eat it last time.

605
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,360
Fine.

606
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:11,330
I can't expect anything
from a cheapskate.

607
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,160
- Sure, let's have meat today.
- Seriously?

608
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,660
I will go get some so go on ahead.

609
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,630
You meant it, right? Hurray!

610
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,900
I'm hungry so hurry up, okay?

611
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,860
Hurry up.

612
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,230
After she asked me to hurry back
because she was hungry...

613
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,000
Bong-pal.

614
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,830
Are you okay, Chun-sang?

615
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,430
Chun-sang. Chun-sang.

616
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:37,600
- Am I still alive?
- Yes, you are.

617
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:45,300
You're still alive and
your fingers are still there, too.

618
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,360
You're alive. You have everything.

619
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,430
You're alive and you're good.

620
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,500
Let's go.

621
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,760
Good work, Doctor.

622
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,460
- Good work, Doctor.
- Oh my.

623
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,500
I didn't know what time it was.

624
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,730
- What happened to your hand?
- I got scratched by a cat.

625
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,230
I bet it happened
when you tried to feed it.

626
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,960
Thank you for your hard work today.

627
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:20,730
- We're going to head out.
- Sure.

628
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

629
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,600
- Good night.
- You too.

630
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:31,930
Get home safely.

631
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,000
Na-bi, where are you?

632
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,230
Na-bi, where are you?

633
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,260
How dare they take off
without paying us?

634
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,260
We can pay it back within two days.

635
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,960
Are you being bothered by ghosts?
We will take care of it.

636
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,500
- Did someone die here?
- He was a bad guy in his fifties.

637
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,500
All of a sudden, he sold
his clinic and came here.

638
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,300
He finally accepted the offer
to become a professor.

639
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,360
You said you'd tutor me.
When are we going to study?

640
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,000
No chance you will enter Buddhahood.

641
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:20,200
I didn't see anything. I'm serious.

642
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm just going to taste it.

643
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,130
It's very rare to see a drunk ghost.

644
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,160
- Hong Myung-hee?
- Who gave you permission?

645
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,430
You're a ghost
so stop acting like a human.
