Oh my, he's so photogenic, too!

7
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,960
He's so cool.

8
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,700
Wait, where is this sound coming from?

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,460
It sounds like
it's coming from here…

(Kim Hyun-ji)

13
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,130
Came all the way in here.
How annoying…

14
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,060
We have a problem now.

15
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,500
You... can see me?

16
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,800
What should I do?

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,460
What did you see in here?

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,030
Kim Hyun-ji.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,200
I knew it.

20
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,060
- Kyung-ja.
- Hyun-ji, where are you going?

21
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,930
- I'm following someone.
- Who?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,230
- I'll tell you later. Bye!
- Bye!

23
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,660
Don't resent me.

(Episode 8)

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,530
Seo-yeon, are you all right?

28
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,830
Yes, they said my arm
will get better in a month.

29
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,730
- Thanks for bringing me here.
- Not at all.

30
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,630
- I'm sorry, but I have to go.
- Oh, sure.

31
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,760
I hope you're not late for
your plans because of me.

32
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,959
No, it's okay.
I'll see you at school.

33
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,459
- Thanks.
- Sure.

34
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,760
Hyun-ji!

35
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,960
Is she waiting inside?

36
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,630
Sir, you can't enter
because we're closed.

37
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,130
- There's someone I have to find...
- Excuse me?

38
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,700
Never mind.

39
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,030
Hyun-ji?

40
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,760
Hyun-ji!

41
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,260
Kim Hyun-ji.

42
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,930
Where did she go?

43
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,860
Hyun-ji!

44
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,530
You're here.

45
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm sorry that I couldn't make it.

46
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,160
Why couldn't you come?

47
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,030
The thing is...

48
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,000
Something came up.

49
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,130
I'm sorry. Let's go to
the amusement park some other time.

50
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,960
- Fine.
- Did you wait for a long time?

51
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,930
No! I just left right away
when you didn't come.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,530
That's a relief. I was worried
that you waited for a long time.

53
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,700
Why would I wait for you?

54
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,330
Have you seen that person before?

55
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,760
He's about 174 centimeters tall
and 44 years old.

56
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,430
And his name is Park Ji-hoon.

57
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,930
Do you know the boarding house in
Yangjoo Village? He lives there.

58
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,830
It's my first time seeing him.

59
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,400
Sir, there aren't that
many accidents or cases here.

60
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
If there is,
we get a report right away.

61
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,700
I've never seen this man before.

62
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,360
I'll make a report now,
so please go to the back mountains

63
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,430
and search the area.

64
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,930
What search?

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,800
What do you mean?
I just showed you that picture.

66
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,760
This rock is all coated in red!

67
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,300
Look how red this rock
is next to the green one!

68
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,430
Something happened,
you can at least investigate.

69
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,560
We can't send out
units based on this.

70
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,330
We don't have enough people in
this precinct to go on a search.

71
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Then what are you going to do?
This is bad!

72
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
Please, that's enough.

73
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,960
If you're that upset, fill this out.

74

(Deceased/Missing Person Report
Yangju Police Station)

75
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,060
There's blood splattered
all over the mountains!

76
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,659
We're not going to get anything
done by writing a report!

77
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,000
Please don't throw a fit here.

78
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,130
Just fill that report out.

79
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,400
How do I fill this out?

80

(Kim Hyun-ji)

81
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,160
Where is it?

82
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,430
Where's that item?

83
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,900
Tell me.

84
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,960
Do you think I'm going to tell you?

85
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,330
That child died because of you.

86
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,700
Did you know that?

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,600
That child died
because you didn't tell me.

88
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,930
Tell me.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,100
If you don't...

90
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,960
Your son will die.

91
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,960
This is your last chance.

92
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,060
Tell me!

93
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,530
- Aren't you going?
- Where?

94
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,230
- To school.
- No, I'm not going.

95
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,330
I'm going to stay home.

96
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,800
That's a surprise.
You always follow me.

97
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,760
Do I have to follow you every day?

98
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,960
Fine then, stay home.
I'm leaving.

99
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,860
That's right,
I'm going to stay home!

100
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm really not good at
this 'hard-to-get' thing.

101
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,430
Did I ask you
to follow me around?

102
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,900
You're the one who decided to
annoyingly follow me around.

103
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,760
Gosh, it's actually nice
not having her around.

104
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,800
Gosh, you scared me.

105
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,960
- How long have you been there?
- I just got here.

106
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,960
What are you mumbling to yourself?

107
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,060
Nothing.

108
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,730
Why did you follow me?

109
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm not following you.
I'm going because I want to.

110
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,730
Well... I'm sure you are.

111
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,430
What is up with that puppy
dog smile? Who are you looking at?

112
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,960
This picture is from our retreat.

113
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,600
Who is making you smile like that...

114
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,500
No. Not... not Seo-yeon.

115
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,000
Absolutely not, no way!
Never, ever, never!

116
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,400
What are you going to
do if Bong-pal finds out?

117
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,360
Are you a jerk? Huh?
Are you human trash?

118
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,060
- How dare you have feelings for...
- What are you talking about?

119
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,860
Why would I have feelings for
Seo-yeon? You're being ridiculous.

120
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,660
Then who is it?

121
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,230
Then...

122
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,460
Is it me?

123
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,560
Yeah, take me instead.
You can have my body.

124
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,030
No! Get away from me!

125
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,630
Ow, my nipples.

126
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,800
Who is it then?
Is it Bong-pal?

127
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,800
No.

128
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,200
Hello.

129
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,960
Bong-pal, he keeps smiling
whenever he looks at you.

130
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,260
He's acting so weird.

131
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,730
No, I'm not! That's not true!

132
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,430
Who's making you smile then?

133
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,030
Look.

134
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
What is that?

135
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,560
Is it a ghost?
Is that a picture of a ghost?

136
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,830
Hey, it's me!
They got me on camera!

137
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,930
My angel.

138
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,360
Your angel. An angel?

139
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,130
The angel you saw at the retreat?

140
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,800
Yes, it's that angel.

141
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,830
He says I'm an angel.

142
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,400
Angel, my butt.

143
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,700
Right, when I rolled down
the stairs that time...

144
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,730
If it wasn't for my
angel... I would've... died.

145
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,860
At that time, the angel asked me...

146
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,060
Are you okay?

147
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,800
She saved me with those
words and stole my heart.

148
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,700
Oh my gosh, I think
he's fallen for me. Right?

149
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,500
At that moment...

150
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,930
I think you did get a hole
in your head back then.

151
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,860
That ghost didn't steal your
heart, she took your wits from you!

152
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,660
- Wake up!
- Who cares if it's a ghost!

153
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,760
Look!

154
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,900
She's so pretty, kind, and cute.

155
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,400
- What do you think?
- She's kind?

156
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,900
- She looks nice.
- She's cute?

157
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,060
I guess I must be pretty.
It was love at first sight.

158
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,000
- Right?
- Oh, please. Happy?

159
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,760
Someone just said they like me.
Wouldn't you be happy about it?

160
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,430
Anyway, he is not normal.

161
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,400
- Who?
- Who do you think? Senior In-rang.

162
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,700
I could understand Chun-sang
because he's naturally weird.

163
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,860
But Senior In-rang is weirder.

164
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,800
No way, he's not weird at all.

165
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,430
That's a natural response
from looking at me.

166
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,560
You're the one who is weird.

167
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,030
You're a bit overconfident today.

168
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,260
She's pretty just the way she is,
but when she smiles,

169
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,600
she's even prettier.

170
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,330
Seriously, she's just
an angel when she smiles.

171
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,330
What are you doing? Hurry up.

172
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,800
What's so pretty about her?

173
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,260
Senior In-rang is crazy.

174
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,700
That girl's arm is injured.

175
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,500
Bong-pal.

176
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,630
Hello, Seo-yeon.

177
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,600
I didn't even say a proper
thank you to you yesterday.

178
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,330
I would've had a hard time if you
weren't with me at the hospital.

179
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,730
Thanks for staying with me.

180
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,500
You said you had a prior engagement.
Were you late because of me?

181
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,930
- Ah... yes, well...
- What the heck?

182
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,030
He was preoccupied because
he was with that girl.

183
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,130
If it's okay with you,
I'll treat you to a meal today.

184
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,760
What do you think?

185
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
- That's okay.
- It's because I'm grateful.

186
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,630
Okay.

187
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,460
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

188
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,930
I have something to say
before we start class.

189
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,230
I'm sure there are other students
who already know about this.

190
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,400
Your fellow classmate, Noh Hyun-joo
has been in an unfortunate accident.

191
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,730
Hyun-joo's funeral information
is on the message board outside.

192
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,760
If you knew her, it would be nice
if you can make it to her funeral.

193
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,900
Okay, I'll take attendance now.

194
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,500
- Kim Oh-chang.
- Here.

195
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,000
Okay.

196
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,330
- Na Jin-soo.
- Here.

197
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
Thank you.

198
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,100
- Park Bong-pal.
- Here.

199
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Thank you.

200
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,600
Good for you. You're alive.

201
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,600
And Bong-pal likes you, too.

202
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,360
Okay, that's all for today.
Good job, everyone.

203
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,500
Thank you.

204
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,260
Bong-pal, what do you like to eat?
Let's eat what you like.

205
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,300
I'm sorry,
but let's just say we're even.

206
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,830
- I have to go home.
- What?

207
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,960
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

208
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,300
Hello.

209
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,330
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

210
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,760
- Are you heading somewhere?
- Yes, there's a seminar.

211
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,630
What's going on?

212
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,700
It's nothing really. We forgot to
ask you a question the other day.

213
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,800
What is it?

214
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:38,630
Where were you on the day
Noh Hyun-joo was murdered?

215
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,200
Ah, I have to ask because
it's protocol, so please

216
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,830
don't be too concerned.

217
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,560
I was at the animal clinic that day.

218
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,700
The animal clinic?

219
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,000
I understand. I apologize for
bothering you when you're so busy.

220
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,230
- Not at all. Have a good day.
- Yes, thank you.

221
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,830
You're home early.

222
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,930
Weren't you supposed
to have lunch with her?

223
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,260
I didn't eat with her.

224
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,560
Why? She would've bought you
something delicious to eat.

225
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,330
I just wanted to eat at home.

226
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,400
You bought meat.

227
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,300
Yeah, I wanted to eat some.

228
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,400
- You don't want to?
- I don't feel like eating it…

229
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,100
but I'll have a bite
since you bought it.

230
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,960
You said you were only
going to have a bite.

231
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah, but I still
can't taste anything.

232
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,400
Eat slowly, your jaw
is about to unhinge.

233
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,960
About the amusement park…

234
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,500
- Let's go tomorrow.
- Really?

235
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Yes.

236
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,330
Hey, that's not fully cooked.
Eat this one.

237
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,330
Here.

238
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,000
What is this?

239
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,400
You're my partner.
Wear it when you work.

240
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,230
Really?

241
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,430
Wow!

242
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,230
Okay, sure.

243
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,130
The breeze is cool and nice.

244
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,130
I like it, too.

245
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,660
Let's hurry it up!

246
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,560
- Mr. Kim, help this team out.
- Okay.

247
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,360
Come on, let's hurry it up!
There's not much time left!

248
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,460
- Okay, we got it.
- Come on!

249
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's hurry it up!

250
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,560
- Come on, let's go!
- This is scary.

251
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,600
There's nothing to be afraid of!

252
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,600
I'll pay you twice the amount
so let's get this over with!

253
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,230
- I'm not sure about this.
- It's perfectly fine!

254
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,160
Mr. Kim, over here! Hurry it up!

255
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,530
- Hurry it up!
- We're going!

256
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,630
Hello?

257
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,900
Excuse me? Hello?

258
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Hello? I can't hear
you very well. Hold on!

259
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,360
What?

260
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,960
I see.
What am I supposed to do then?

261
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,900
We have to take it down in
order to occupy the space.

262
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,460
Ghosts or whatever!
We have to make a living, too!

263
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,130
Hello?

264
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
Hello?

265
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,130
I swear!

266
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,100
What's wrong over there?

267
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,500
The backup generator has gone out!

268
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,060
Seriously,
nothing is going as planned!

269
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,660
Who is crazy? Me?

270
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,600
- Who is crazy? I am?
- What the heck?

271
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm not crazy!
Why would I be crazy? Why? Why?

272
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,330
Who is crazy?
I'm not crazy! I'm not crazy!

273
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,600
Wow! Wow, did we get
some work? For real?

274
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:08,630
We've been hoping it wouldn't
be the Samil Mental Institute.

275
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,230
(Ghost Appearance Halts Demolition
of Samil Mental Institute, 1 Dead)

276
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,200
Wow!

277
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,660
- Did you call Bong-pal?
- Of course.

278
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,400
Make sure you check the camera
and all the necessary

279
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,800
equipment thoroughly today.

280
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
We might be able to capture
a ghost on camera for real today.

281
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,660
Right.

282
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,660
Setting!

283
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,500
What do you think?

284
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,600
It fits you well.

285
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,030
What are we going to do
about the amusement park today?

286
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,630
- We're supposed to go today.
- We can go after work.

287
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,430
Work hard
so we can get there quickly.

288
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,960
Let's go.

289
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,600
Senior, where are we going today?
You brought the camera with you.

290
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,800
Huh? Oh...

291
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Make sure you're ready today.

292
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Why?

293
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:48,330
The place we're going to is one of
the scariest locations in the world.

294
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,500
That's right.
It's the Samil Mental Institute!

295
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,760
- Never heard of it?
- No.

296
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,100
Everything about Bong-pal is great,
but he's clueless about this field.

297
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,330
In-rang will give you
the 411 on that place.

298
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,560
That place was shut down
due to human rights issues.

299
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:13,800
The doctors and caretakers
illegally held the patients

300
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,730
against their will and abused them.
It was serious.

301
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,900
One patient couldn't take
it anymore and escaped.

302
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,060
That's how the world found
out about the hospital.

303
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,830
The police came and discovered
7 patients who died in the hospital.

304
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,630
Seven people.

305
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,800
The building owner
called exorcists and shamans

306
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,500
to get rid of the ghosts but

307
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,230
there are rumors
that a shaman fainted

308
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,330
within 30 minutes of entering.

309
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,030
This is a place full of
ghosts with deep grudges.

310
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,600
Hey, look over here.

311
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,000
What the heck?

312
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,930
Wow, Chun-sang!

313
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,500
- Chun-sang, Chun-sang, Chun-sang!
- Why?

314
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,330
- Look.
- Whoa!

315
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,500
- Look at that!
- What?

316
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,130
- Whoa!
- I'm going. Grab onto me.

317
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,400
- Grab onto me. Hold tight!
- Don't let go. Don't let go.

318
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,060
Such scaredy-cats. Why are they
doing this kind of work?

319
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,600
You want to fight? Let's fight!

320
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,330
Both of them are not normal.

321
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,460
- I'm going to go.
- Okay.

322
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,230
- Grab onto me!
- Don't let go.

323
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,600
Don't let go!

324
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,360
Hyun-ji, are you okay?
What's wrong?

325
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,030
I'm okay.

326
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,130
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

327
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,660
Quickly, come here!

328
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,200
What is it?

329
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,400
Look over there.
I think it's over there.

330
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,330
(Inpatient Wards)

331
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
- That's where the ghost is?
- Yes.

332
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,830
Inpatient Wards.
I think it's over there.

333
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,060
- Chun-sang!
- What?

334
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,900
Chun-sang!

335
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,260
It's the Casualty Department.

336
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,130
Hey, start recording.

337
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,560
- Hold me tight.
- I will hold you tight.

338
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,860
When I look this cool,
I have to hold your hands?

339
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,200
Let's just go.

340
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,900
Is this the right place?

341
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,930
Where did they go?

342
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,960
It looks like something is in there.

343
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,660
One, two, three.

344
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,960
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh my.

345
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,660
- Oh my god! What is this?
- It's just string.

346
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,560
- Where is Bong-pal?
- What?

347
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,260
Let's go find him.

348
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,200
- Pal!
- Bong-pal. Bong-pal!

349
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,660
Wait. This is the right place.

350
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,360
(Inpatient Wards)

351
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,530
He may not have gotten here yet.

352
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,100
He might have gotten lost...

353
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,500
- What if we got lost?
- Call him.

354
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,500
Hurry up and call him.

355
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,260
It's okay here.

356
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:39,060
Gosh, what is this? Bong-pal.

357
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,030
Bong... Come on.

358
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Darn it.

359
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,230
Hey, don't touch things in here.

360
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,330
- I told you not to!
- I'm sorry.

361
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:44,000
Bong-pal, didn't you say
seven people died in this hospital?

362
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,900
Yes, why do you ask?

363
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,460
Take a look at this.

364
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,130
(Deceased, Unclaimed)

365
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,160
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

366
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,960
And eight.

367
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,060
Kim Jung-soon
died of a leg fracture.

368
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,200
(Name of patient: Kim Jung-soon)

369
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,560
- Pal.
- Bong-pal.

370
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,929
Uh, we're coming in, Bong-pal.

371
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,330
- Excuse me...
- Bong-pal.

372
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,360
(Help me. Save me.
I want to get out of this place)

373
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,199
- Bong-pal.
- Pal.

374
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,730
- Pal.
- Wait a second.

375
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,730
What is it?

376
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,199
My back is killing me, gosh.

377
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,460
Come on.

378
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,800
He's not in here.

379
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,730
Hey, what is this?

380
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,000
I wonder what it is...

381
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,600
There is the angel. Angel.

382
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,430
Angel, my butt.

383
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,300
- Get over here now!
- Hold on.

384
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,500
Ms. Angel!

385
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,900
(Help me. Save me.
I want to get out of this place)

386
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,500
Hyun-ji!

387
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,360
Hyun-ji.

388
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,030
Bong-pal, stop.

389
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,600
These ghosts won't hurt us.

390
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,260
What?

391
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,560
Come over here.

392
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,060
Over there.

393
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:04,330
(Help me. Save me.
I want to get out of this place)

394
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
I think they want us to help them.

395
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,100
Detective Kim!

396
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,560
- Did you find something?
- Yes, I did.

397
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:37,400
They wanted us to find them.

398
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,800
None of the dead patients
had a family.

399
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,960
It's good that they
are found now at least.

400
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,460
Goodbye.

401
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Bong-pal, wait a minute.

402
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,760
Well...

403
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,130
It's just that...

404
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:24,430
Do you walk around with
a ghost by any chance?

405
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,730
How can you say that?

406
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,960
No, she was an angel.
Isn't she with us now?

407
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,660
- Well...
- I saw everything earlier.

408
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,000
I saw her rescue us.

409
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,230
- Didn't you?
- I did see her.

410
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,930
It was my first time seeing
a ghost fight another ghost.

411
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Are you working with that angel?

412
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,460
Yes, but she's no angel.

413
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,760
- Her name is Hyun-ji, Kim Hyun-ji.
- Hyun-ji?

414
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,830
Kim Hyun-ji. What a pretty name.

415
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,500
Is it? So is she right
next to us now?

416
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,660
She's right here.

417
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,730
Right here?

418
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,800
Hyun-ji, thanks so much for saving
us last time and also this time.

419
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,930
And...

420
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,130
you're so pretty.

421
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,300
Oh my, it was no problem.

422
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,760
I'm pretty, alright.
Don't you agree?

423
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,460
I can't stand hearing this.
I just can't.

424
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:33,960
Wait a second.
So Hyun-ji is right around here...

425
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,960
What do you think you're doing?

426
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,200
I was just wondering
if she was around here...

427
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,560
Still, you can't
touch a girl like that.

428
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,830
Did my hand touch her?

429
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,300
Hyun-ji, I'm sorry.
I didn't think it'd touch you.

430
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,430
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm leaving.

431
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:01,300
- Hurry. Aren't we going today?
- I'm coming.

432
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,060
Bye, bye.

433
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,600
No way. What do you mean
there's something here?

434
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,830
He was acting funny.
Why did he get mad?

435
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,400
See you tomorrow!

436
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,260
(Ticket Office)

437
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,600
Can I still enter?

438
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,130
- Now?
- Yes.

439
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,100
You can, but you won't
get to ride many at this hour.

440
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,800
You may be able to ride
only the Ferris wheel.

441
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,700
I like the Ferris wheel.

442
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,760
- One ticket, please.
- Sure, it's $10.

443
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,900
By the way, didn't you come
at this hour yesterday, too?

444
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,100
Yes, I did...

445
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,400
The last ride of the Ferris wheel
will be in 10 minutes.

446
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,030
Let's run. We might be late.

447
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,500
- Here, you go.
- You're riding this alone?

448
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,330
Yes, I am.

449
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,100
Did you come here yesterday?

450
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,230
Well, yes, I did come,
but I was late.

451
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,960
You weren't here, either.

452
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,700
I see.

453
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,000
Too bad that you will only
get to ride one ride tonight.

454
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,300
I still like it.

455
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,060
If you do well on your exams,
I will bring you here again.

456
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,800
- Let's get here earlier then.
- Sure.

457
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,200
Are you that happy?

458
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,430
I didn't know you'd like
something like this.

459
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,360
Bong-pal.

460
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,900
I like you.

461
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,230
What?

462
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,860
- Well, Hyun-ji...
- Don't say anything.

463
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,160
I didn't say that
to hear your answer.

464
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,800
It's just how I feel.

465
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,330
I'm crazy. So crazy.

466
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,530
Why did I have to tell him
that I like him right then?

467
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,400
Gosh, how am I supposed
to face Bong-pal again?

468
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,730
Puppy, what should I do now?

469
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,730
I don't think I can
go home like this.

470
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,600
Look at me, please.

471
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,560
What should I do?

472
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,430
What should I do, huh?

473
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,000
Hey, Kim Hyun-ji.

474
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,600
Bong-pal.

475
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,530
How could you disappear like that?

476
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,630
Kim Hyun-ji!

477
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,800
Bong-pal.

478
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,960
Professor Ju, hello.

479
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,460
You live nearby, huh?

480
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,530
Yes. So this is your hospital, huh?

481
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,400
I've passed by
this place so many times.

482
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,430
By the way, who were
you calling out for just now?

483
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,560
- Pardon?
- You were calling someone…

484
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,900
- Kim Hyun-ji?
- Ah...

485
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,100
- Is she your girlfriend?
- No.

486
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,200
- She's just someone I know.
- Ah, is she?

487
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,030
I'm going to get going.

488
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,160
Sure, get home safe.

489
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,660
Bye.

490
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,300
What should I say
when I see Bong-pal again?

491
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,430
Gosh, what should I do?

492
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,000
Hyun-ji, are you asleep?

493
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,800
Get some sleep then.

494
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,760
Bong-pal.

495
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,660
I like you.

496
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,630
Is he still asleep?

497
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,060
- Good morning.
- It sure is...

498
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,000
I need to go to the bathroom...

499
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,860
What good morning, gosh.

500
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,230
Well, I'm done.

501
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,130
I'm full, too.

502
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,460
Gosh, this is crazy.

503
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,900
So what?
She could have feelings for me.

504
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,500
It's not a reason to avoid her.

505
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,900
Okay then. Go out and act natural.

506
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,730
Okay, okay.

507
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,630
Gosh,
it's so uncomfortable and crazy.

508
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:33,130
Act natural.

509
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,000
Gosh, should I go stay
somewhere else?

510
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,000
There is no other place to go.

511
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,660
It's so uncomfortable
for the two of us alone.

512
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,900
(Chun-sang)

513
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,930
Hi, Chun-sang.
I will be right there.

514
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,860
Hyun-ji, we have work. Let's go.

515
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:12,900
- Do we? Let's go.
- Sure.

516
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,560
Sure, I should do
something, anything.

517
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,930
You sure know how to do
a good job. Are you already done?

518
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,730
We will get some money again today.

519
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,830
I don't know where she is, but
you also did a good job, Hyun-ji.

520
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,800
- Good work.
- Chun-sang, she's over here.

521
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,800
Good work.

522
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,900
By the way, where is In-rang?

523
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,800
He said he had to go
get something from the car.

524
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,730
- Wait. Are you already done?
- Yes, it's done.

525
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,260
- Is she hurt?
- I'm not hurt.

526
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:00,430
I'm talking about
Hyun-ji, not you. Is she hurt?

527
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,030
- She's not hurt at all.
- Oh my, thank God.

528
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,000
- So Hyun-ji is with us now, right?
- Correct.

529
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:24,530
Hyun-ji, I got something for you.

530
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,360
- What did you get?
- What could it be?

531
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,660
- These.
- Wow, heels!

532
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,360
- Wow.
- Hey.

533
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:38,360
You've never gotten me anything.

534
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,730
You got heels for a ghost
you can't even see?

535
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,030
Quiet.

536
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,630
Does Hyun-ji seem to like these?

537
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,130
Tell him that I love them.

538
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:50,430
She hates them.

539
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,900
I said I love them.

540
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,030
She hates them?

541
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,300
She says she's never
liked heels. Right?

542
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,900
I do like heels.

543
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,100
She's never liked them, huh?

544
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,530
- Well, too bad then.
- Isn't it?

545
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,760
- We're going to head out.
- Sure.

546
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,130
Gosh, why do you lie?

547
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,300
I so want to accept these...

548
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,530
Park Bong-pal!

549
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,130
No matter what, it just doesn't
work out for certain people.

550
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,600
It's okay.

551
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,260
Do you know what I
went through to get these?

552
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,500
We will exchange them for me.

553
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,330
- Pardon? Our doctor?
- Correct.

554
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,660
What was his schedule on the first?

555
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,260
He didn't have
anything special that day.

556
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:47,660
He was seeing patients
until the afternoon.

557
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,900
What time in the afternoon?

558
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,400
He ended early that day.
Around seven.

559
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,960
He usually stays until nine.

560
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,930
- He must have had plans...
- Was it that day?

561
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,430
- The day he stayed out?
- He stayed out?

562
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,600
That's right.
He usually sleeps here.

563
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,330
He left earlier and came
back the next morning.

564
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
- Oh my, you're here!
- Hello, sir.

565
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,260
I'm sorry for being late.

566
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,230
Can you get everything ready?

567
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,100
Where did he get mud on his shoes?

568
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,730
- Came back with mud on his shoes...
- That's right.

569
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,830
Thank you.

570
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,600
- You're late.
- I had a seminar.

571
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,800
What brings you here today?

572
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,600
We just came by
for routine questions.

573
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,860
We're off now. See you next time.

574
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

575
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,560
- Was everything okay?
- Yes.

576
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,400
What should we do?

577
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,530
What's the matter with you?
You can't even let me accept presents?

578
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,100
Exactly. Why did I do that?
It's so childish.

579
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,160
What?

580
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,700
You've changed your clothes.

581
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:37,660
- It's convenient being a ghost.
- Well, you know how it is.

582
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,260
I can't take this anymore.
It's so uncomfortable.

583
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:52,230
Bong-pal.

584
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,760
What?

585
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,030
Should we play a game
to get wishes granted?

586
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,230
We will play rock-paper-scissors.

587
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,960
Whoever loses will have to
grant the winner's wish.

588
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,030
Why grant wishes?
I don't want to play.

589
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,000
Can we please do it?

590
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,830
I didn't even get
the heels or anything.

591
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,460
Fine. Let's play.

592
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:19,760
We're doing it.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

593
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:21,600
I won!

594
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,830
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

595
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:33,330
1, 2, 3. Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot! Hooray!

596
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,260
Rock, paper, scissors,
shoot! Hooray!

597
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,930
One, two.

598
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,530
Yes! Hooray!

599
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,130
Rock, paper, scissors,
shoot! Hooray!

600
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,400
I won! Hooray!

601
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,700
You're such a kid.

602
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,830
So what's your wish?

603
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,400
Well, my wish would be...

604
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:19,560
to take back what I said yesterday.

605
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,330
I don't like being uncomfortable
around each other.

606
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,160
Just forget everything I said.

607
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,300
That's my wish.

608
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,130
One minute you're confessing
and the next you want me to forget?

609
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,500
Are you trying to confuse me?

610
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,160
You got that, right?

611
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,630
It's my wish
so you have to do what I ask.

612
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:08,330
You need to grant my wish…

613
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,030
so I can stay with you longer.

614
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,000
Bong-pal.

615
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,430
Hyun-ji.

616
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,730
I'm not feeling well...

617
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:00,700
Kim Hyun-ji.

618
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:03,660
- Bong-pal.
- Hyun-ji...

619
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
Hyun-ji!

620
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,430
Hyun-ji!

621
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,060
Kim Hyun-ji!

622
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,730
Hyun-ji!

623
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,030
Hyun-ji.

624
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,800
Bong-pal.

625
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,760
Where did you go?

626
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:19,600
Don't ever disappear again...

627
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,760
(Bring it on, Ghost)

628
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,800
I love you, Kim Hyun-ji!

629
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,060
It's too hot. You sleep in my room.

630
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,400
You're so crazy about a girl that
you'd sell out your own country.

631
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,200
Love makes you do crazy things.

632
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,900
You crazy punk!

633
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,030
He's too perfect
to be considered human.

634
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,430
Puppy, where are you?

635
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,460
Who said you could come in without
my permission? Such insolence…

636
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:16,560
You look familiar. Have we met?

637
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,700
Are we going to be okay like this?
To other people...

638
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,430
I don't care what
others think about us.

639
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,460
I like you just
the way you are, Hyun-ji.
