1
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,230
There is quite a variety of
people that exists in this world.

2
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,460
Thieves.

3
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,400
Cops.

4
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,630
Ghosts. There are even ghosts
that exist in this world.

5
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,860
Stop there!

6
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
I see ghosts.

7
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,900
Ah damn it, we made an eye contact..

8
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,060
You saw me. Didn't you?

9
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,700
Cham, cham, cham!

10
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,630
Cham, cham, cham!

11
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,400
You did see me.

12
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,460
And...

13
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,360
You stink!

14
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,100
And I can beat up ghosts.

15
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,630
You almost displaced my jaw!
Hold on, my jaw is sticking out!

16
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't ever come here
again or you will get hurt.

17
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,730
Yes, I promise to
never come here again.

18
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,930
Oh my gosh, my jaw!

19
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,160
I'll take my leave now.

20
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,829
Don't get the wrong idea.
I did not hit a girl just now.

21
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,460
I hit a ghost.

22
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,160
I needed money and I beat up
ghosts whenever I needed it.

23
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,600
Of course, I only beat up
the weak ones.

24
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,830
$1 million.
Exactly $1 million.

25
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
That is my goal in life.

26
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,630
At this rate... let me see here...

27
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,900
Twelve years and nine months.
I still have a long way to go.

28
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,100
Just catching the weak
ones isn't cutting it.

29
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,760
Should I start catching the strong
ones and hike up the price?

30
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,700
Due to inflation,

31
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,830
JP... okay, that's it for today.

32
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,630
You do know the floating exchange
rate report is due next week, right?

33
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,960
Yes.

34
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,300
The research will be quite extensive
so I divided you all into groups.

35
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,930
Work with your groups.
I expect great reports.

36
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,060
Okay, that's all for today.
I'll see you next week.

37
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,659
Thank you.

38
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,630
Hey, Park Bong-pal.

39
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,430
You're in our group. We could really
use your help, this time.

40
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,760
You guys are on your own.
Leave me out of it.

41
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,900
Good luck.

42
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,430
Arrogant jerk.

43
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,160
Driver, I need to go
to the bathroom! Oh my goodness!

44
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,660
Goodness, where am I?

45
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,600
Excuse me.

46
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,030
Here you go.

47
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,600
Ah yes. Goodness, thank you.

48
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,330
- Thank you, Monk Myung-chul.
- Not at all.

49
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,300
I'll see you in 49 days.

50
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,130
- I don't think that's necessary.
- Ah, I see.

51
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,030
- I understand.
- Please enjoy your meal.

52
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,060
Yes.

53
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,800
He used to be in such demand.
What happened to him?

54
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,130
He even exorcised ghosts!

55
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,260
All the monks used to support
him back in his glory days.

56
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,360
No spiritual powers left when you
love meat and booze that much.

57
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,100
He's old news now, I guess.

58
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,230
What are you doing in this romantic
place all by yourself? It's so sad.

59
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,400
College life shouldn't
be lonely like this.

60
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,760
No kidding.

61
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,260
Look there. How nice would
it be to eat, hold hands,

62
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,160
and date a girl like that?

63
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,960
Why are you here all by yourself?

64
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,000
Do you know why you're alone?

65
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,400
No, he doesn't know.
His face is totally clueless.

66
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,760
Excuse me, I know it's our first
time meeting each other, but…

67
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,200
He's got dark baggy eyes.

68
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,100
It's okay, give me.

69
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:00,230
His pulse is weak. It's because
there's darkness surrounding you!

70
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,030
You didn't know that, did you?

71
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,130
My dear junior,
do you believe in ghosts?

72
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,360
Well, he might not believe in them.

73
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,360
But you know, there is a lot
of darkness in this world

74
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,360
that we don't know of.

75
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,100
There's so much darkness surrounding
you that it's making you weak.

76
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,000
I know this is scary to hear.

77
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,400
But ghosts are near us.

78
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,660
In fact, there's one
right behind you.

79
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,900
Don't turn around or
it might come and haunt you.

80
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,700
So what are you going to do?
Will you continue to

81
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
live in this darkness?

82
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,500
We can shine light upon you.

83
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,000
Anyway, come to this place
if you want to know more.

84
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,600
Here.

85
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,630
Let's fight through
this darkness together!

86
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,600
- He's leaving.
- He left his food.

87
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,400
Put this back in.

88
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,660
Kids nowadays are so rude.

89
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,860
I told you they're scary.

90
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,060
They don't even talk.

91
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,630
I mean, we've been
going around for a week

92
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
and no one wants to join our club.

93
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,900
At this rate, we're really
going to get kicked out.

94
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,830
If I get kicked out of here,
I won't be able to pay

95
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,100
for my room and board.

96
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,300
Looks like we have to sell this.
Let's sell this, Chun-sang.

97
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,400
Let's sell this for now
and pay for room and board.

98
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,130
What are you talking about?
Those are our precious assets.

99
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Chun-sang!

100
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,030
What the heck did we
capture with this?

101
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,000
The dog that pooped
by the beach? That dog?

102
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,800
- Does this capture ghosts?
- It can.

103
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,560
Has everyone lied to you
for your whole life?

104
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,260
We just need one shot!
Seriously, just one shot!

105
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,260
If that happens, we'll get
more members and make money

106
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,600
by selling that video.

107
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,800
I know. So when is all
that going to happen?

108
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,260
Huh?

109
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,760
Let's go! Let's go and
do it properly this time!

110
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,060
We'll make it a live broadcast.

111
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,660
Where?

112
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,130
Over there.

113
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,530
It's really menacing.

114
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,560
Both of us will be okay, right?
Right, Chun-sang?

115
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,660
Chun-sang. Chun-sang.

116
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,330
What are you doing?

117
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,330
Huh? I'm preparing to go live.

118
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,800
That way, I'll look good on camera.

119
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,730
Look, they said six girls died here.
Will we be okay?

120
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,060
- Six girls died?
- Yes!

121
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,200
It'll be fine! It'll be fine!
Where did I serve?

122
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,300
I served in the marines!

123
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,460
Don't be scared.

124
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,430
What are you eating?

125
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,530
A sedative.

126
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,830
Let's go.

127
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,400
What's this?

128
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,060
Ghostnet?

129
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,700
- Hey, is it on? Is it on?
- Yeah, we're live.

130
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,530
Okay, okay, okay.
Welcome to Ghostnet.

131
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,900
- An exclusive live broadcast.
- Where are we?

132
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,760
A place that will stop your heart.

133
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,760
This place is...

134
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,030
Seoyi. Girls'. High.

135
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,260
- Cut it out!
- Sorry.

136
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,400
As you know, not too long ago,
seven people fainted

137
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,760
after seeing a ghost here.

138
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,200
After the encounter...

139
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
- Chun-sang!
- What is it? What?

140
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,130
Mr. Sadako,
we're not a different school.

141
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,930
No, not at all.
We'll prove it to you.

142
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,360
Okay, here we go.
I'm zooming in.

143
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,030
Seoyi Girls' High School.

144
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,760
There you go.

145
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,830
Okay. What is it?

146
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
Of course, of course.
We're going to show you real ghosts.

147
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay, we're going to find the
site where the ghost appeared.

148
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,130
Follow me. Let's go.

149
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,660
We're walking down
the hallway right now.

150
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,960
I think we're really going
to see something scary here.

151
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,960
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

152
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,400
- Don't mess around like that.
- Sorry.

153
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
- I'm sorry, let's continue.
- You scared the crap out of me.

154
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,430
Please get up.

155
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,800
This is the lab.
Ghosts tend to appear in the lab.

156
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,600
So scary. You always see ghosts
come out of here in horror movies.

157
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Hold on.

158
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,630
I'm scared.

159
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,730
- You, alright?
- Yes.

160
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,860
- Let's do an interview.
- Okay.

161
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,060
- Right now, I'm in the lab.
- Just a moment.

162
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,730
Take me!

163
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,200
What? What?

164
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,400
- Okay, I'm zooming in.
- What?

165
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,560
Bong-pal!

166
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,760
That scared me.

167
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,160
Oh, it's nothing.
Let's go. Let's go upstairs.

168
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,800
Bong-pal!

169
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,200
Goodness, I swear.

170
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,560
You should open
the door more quickly, punk.

171
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,860
I almost crapped in my pants.

172
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,660
And fix that doorbell.
It's been three years.

173
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,230
You're the only one who comes here.

174
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,800
You're such a loner.

175
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
I have to leave tomorrow.

176
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,660
Your business trips are
getting shorter and shorter.

177
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,560
Is it time to retire now?

178
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,930
I'm just taking a break.
There's still a lot of people

179
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,160
who ask for me.

180
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,700
Here.

181
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,160
Eat.

182
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
- What about the sausage?
- I'm all out. Just eat it.

183
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,660
Delicious!

184
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,530
Are you keeping that promise?

185
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,030
Keeping your distance from ghosts.

186
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,060
Pretending not to see one
even if you do.

187
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,600
Pretending not to hear
even if you do.

188
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,860
You have to keep away from
them to live a normal life.

189
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,030
- Got it?
- Yes, yes. Have a drink.

190
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,260
Oh, wait a minute.

191
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,000
Your father sent this to me again.

192
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,830
If you moved, you should've
told him the new address, bastard.

193
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,500
What for? It's not like he's
going to come and visit me.

194
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,330
Take it!

195
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,800
Just leave it there.

196
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Seriously.

197
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,630
Sir, are you the exorcist?

198
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,160
Sir, can you get rid of a ghost?

199
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,460
There's a legendary evil ghost
at our school. Is it possible?

200
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,700
Okay.

201
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,260
A high school girl. Is it possible?

202
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,230
Piece of cake.

203
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,330
But is there a price?

204
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,830
One thousand dollars.

205
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,300
Hello?

206
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,830
Are you sure you can get rid of it?

207
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,860
100 percent.

208
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,330
- Can you come this instant?
- The location?

209
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,500
Seoyi Girls' High School.

210
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,130
Seoyi Girls' High?

211
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,030
If you do it right now,
I'll give you $10,000. Deal?

212
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,130
Deal, deal, deal!
I'm on my way right now.

213
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,630
He hasn't read a single one.

214
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,830
Stubborn punk.

215
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Where are you going?

216
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,730
Study hall.

217
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,130
Why are you going to
study hall this late at night?

218
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,830
I have to study for
the civil servant exam.

219
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,060
You should study for the bar exam
with that smart head of yours.

220
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,960
I'll be back.

221
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,330
Be careful of ghosts. Bong-pal!

222
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,560
Buy some sausages on your way back.

223
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,660
Okay, sure.

224
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,400
Man, he sure can make a mean stew.

225
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, we're at the restroom
where a ghost supposedly appeared.

226
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,830
Wait a minute. Can you hear
the sound of my heart racing?

227
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,900
The air feels quite strange here.

228
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,030
Everyone, take a deep breath.

229
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's go in now.

230
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,730
Okay, we're going in.

231
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,560
We're inside. It's time to
check the scene of the incident.

232
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,760
Okay.

233
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,430
- Chun-sang!
- Yeah?

234
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,030
Look.

235
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,800
We're not perverts and please do
not call the cops on us, Mr. Sadako.

236
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,300
We only came here to capture
real ghosts. Hold tight.

237
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:02,260
And please, refrain from commenting.

238
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,760
What is this?

239
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,800
It's just a spray bottle.

240
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,160
I almost had a heart attack.

241
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,900
There's nothing inside.
There's nothing inside.

242
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,160
Calm down, calm down.
Don't be afraid.

243
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,030
I'm here.
Where are you?

244
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,600
What's going on here?
Is she inside?

245
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,160
Ms. Help Me?
Ms. Help Me?

246
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,060
Ms. Help Me?
Ms. Help Me?

247
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,100
So you're the $10,000 ghost.
You look tough.

248
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,230
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

249
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,930
I'm the exorcist who's
going to get rid of you.

250
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,930
I won't go easy on you just because
you're a female ghost. Be prepared.

251
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,500
I'm…

252
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,160
Let go of me! Hey!

253
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,530
- I said let go of me! It's not me!
- Yeah right.

254
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,060
Hey, don't act like you're weak.
You're a freaking ghost.

255
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:07,700
It really hurts! I know
I'm a ghost, but I'm still a girl!

256
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,860
How can you hit a girl?

257
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,160
I warned you ahead of time.
Get up, $10,000.

258
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,700
Oh, my heart.

259
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,500
- Don't play around.
- My heart really hurts.

260
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,500
I died from a bad heart.

261
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,500
Hey. Hey.

262
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,130
Hey.

263
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,700
Who the heck are you to
be beating up ghosts, huh?

264
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,600
Anyway, you're so dead.

265
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,630
Do you want to die, huh?
Do you want to die?

266
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,860
Come down! Come on!
I'm going to kill you!

267
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,600
Come down!

268
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,500
Hey! Hey!

269
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey!

270
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,300
How can a man be such a coward?

271
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,730
You're already dead!
Who cares about all that?

272
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,430
I swear!

273
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,530
Block this!

274
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,260
Myongsung University?

275
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,300
You're a student
from an elite college?

276
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,960
Seriously.

277
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,500
My nose is bleeding.

278
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,100
Ow!

279
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,800
Don't ever come here again!
Or you're seriously dead!

280
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,560
He can't even fight
and calls himself an exorcist.

281
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,360
What is it?

282
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,730
You cutie!

283
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,460
Okay, okay!

284
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,000
Kyung-ja.

285
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,300
You're here!
What's wrong with your face?

286
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,930
I got into a fight
with some weird guy.

287
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,500
You didn't kill him, did you?
You won't be chosen if you do that!

288
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,230
I don't kill people!
I just beat him to a pulp.

289
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,360
It's all good, then.

290
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:35,830
How long are you going to
keep following this person?

291
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,730
- I think it's been two years now.
- I know.

292
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,960
He's just not dying.
The sooner he dies, the sooner

293
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,530
I can introduce myself.

294
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,200
It was all lies. Making all the hair
on someone stand up doesn't kill.

295
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,600
How was this semester?
Did you find anything?

296
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,000
Not yet. I think I have to
go back tomorrow.

297
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,230
I hope you find it soon.

298
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,330
The college entrance exams
are coming up…

299
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,260
Has it been 5 years since you died?

300
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,630
Yes, it's already been five years.

301
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,130
Kyung-ja, why am I not able to go to
the afterlife? Why am I stuck here?

302
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,730
I mean, you either go to
heaven or hell if you die.

303
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,200
You either have a grievance or...

304
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,800
Or?

305
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,530
You were wrongfully killed
by someone.

306
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,130
They say you linger
if that happens to you.

307
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,060
You really don't
remember how you died?

308
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,860
No. I don't even
remember my parents.

309
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,860
All I know is this.
This name, Kim Hyun-ji.

310
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,530
But I don't even know
if it's my name.

311
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I tried to look for my school,

312
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,460
but who knew there were
this many high schools in Korea?

313
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,230
Why not take
the college entrance exams?

314
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,760
Do you remember
the first day we met?

315
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,300
You showed up to take them
without even knowing you were dead.

316
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,660
Maybe you have a grievance
because you couldn't take the exam.

317
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,100
See? I told you to take the exam.

318
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,730
Who knows? Your grievance might
be lifted and you might remember.

319
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,200
Should I try then?

320
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,100
But why are you lingering?

321
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,700
- What's your grievance?
- Well...

322
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,900
What could it be?

323
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,130
This isn't going to work.
I should go to church.

324
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,130
Why the church?

325
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,630
I will go pray for him to die soon.

326
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,660
See you next time then.

327
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,600
Should I seriously take the exam?

328
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm hungry, Bong-pal.

329
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,360
Is everything ready?

330
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,400
It's almost ready. Come over.

331
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,560
Okay.

332
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,830
- Did you have a good night?
- Yes.

333
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,530
- How about the sausage?
- There is none. Just eat.

334
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,260
You didn't buy any last night?

335
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,800
You're losing your spiritual energy
because you keep eating sausages.

336
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,400
- You need to eat vegetables.
- Gosh.

337
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,760
I told you to get me some...

338
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,530
Go ahead.

339
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,860
You looked fine last night.

340
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,300
Why do you have a black eye now?

341
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,160
- Where'd you go to get beat up?
- Please just eat.

342
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,360
This is why you need
to eat meat and sausages.

343
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,260
Then you will be too strong
to get beaten up.

344
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,400
Leave it. I'll eat it.

345
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,960
Monk Myung-chul.

346
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,460
About female ghosts…

347
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,260
Do they tend to be strong, too?

348
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,560
Unmarried female ghosts?
Ah...

349
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,900
Unmarried female ghosts
with a lot of grievances are strong.

350
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,800
They say that a woman's
vengeance knows no bounds.

351
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,100
Someone like you should be careful.
They will suck your energy out.

352
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,060
- But they must have a weakness.
- They sure do.

353
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,630
Unmarried female ghosts,
all ghosts...

354
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,830
Why the sudden interest in ghosts?

355
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,560
It's just that...

356
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,660
In case I get attacked by one,

357
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,060
I should be able to protect myself.

358
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,230
You got that black eye
from a ghost, didn't you?

359
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,360
I told you to run away
if you see a ghost.

360
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,530
What should I do
if they start to chase me?

361
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,800
If you'd handled it right that time,
this wouldn't have happened.

362
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm telling you
that ghost was so strong.

363
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,260
- It's not because you're weak?
- Come on.

364
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,230
Gosh, this is all my fault.

365
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,060
So please,
tell me how to fight back.

366
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:50,860
What if I get beaten up
like this again?

367
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,400
This is it.

368
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,060
Why on earth did we come here?

369
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,330
I asked you to tell me
about their weaknesses.

370
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,530
Let me see this ghost here.

371
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,530
As for their weakness,
if you keep looking at them

372
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,230
you see their weakness.

373
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,760
Gosh, I used to be able
to see it right away.

374
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,830
Gosh.

375
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,860
Monk Myung-chul.

376
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,630
- Does this stuff help at all?
- Of course, it helps.

377
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,230
It contains divine energy.

378
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,130
About this ghost...

379
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,500
Considering how calm the energy is…

380
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,500
it must be a little kid.

381
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,100
It's a little kid.

382
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,360
Rice works the best
when it comes to a kid ghost.

383
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,130
Look at this kid.

384
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:46,699
What's this? Bong-pal!

385
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,060
Bong-pal, you punk! Bong-pal!

386
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,159
Bong-pal!

387
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,699
Delete. Deleted.

388
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,730
Delete! Delete! Delete!

389
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,200
What are these people doing
on someone else's homepage?

390
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,560
This Sadako is terrorizing me.

391
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,860
Chun-sang, what should we do now?

392
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,300
What do you mean?

393
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,000
We should show them
what we're made of.

394
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,430
- You're really going?
- I should go. Of course.

395
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,030
I should go. I should go.

396
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,530
We should take this first.

397
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,360
Now, today...

398
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,400
we will stay here
until ghosts appear.

399
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,630
Since we don't know
when ghosts will appear,

400
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,630
go get some snacks to help you wait.

401
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,200
And go to the bathroom now.

402
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,630
- And add us to your favorites.
- Here. Take this.

403
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,700
Now...

404
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
we will keep the camera rolling.

405
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,600
- Ghost...
- Net.

406
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,960
It's the perfect weather
to fight ghosts.

407
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:42,160
Kim Hyun-ji... Kim Hyun-ji...

408
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,900
I'm not here.

409
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,260
Did I not go to school here?

410
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,330
Let's fight!

411
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,030
Ghost!

412
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,930
He's back again.

413
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
I was in a bad mood anyhow,
perfect timing.

414
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,430
Hey.

415
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,860
I told you not to come here again.

416
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,330
Did I say that or not, huh?

417
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,600
That wasn't intentional.
It was an accident.

418
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,860
You know how it happened.
We were rolling around.

419
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,700
Why are you acting so strangely?

420
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
You probably kissed a lot of people.

421
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,530
What?

422
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,000
Have you never kissed anyone?

423
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,900
Wait, was that your
first kiss by any chance?

424
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:11,560
It was.
It was my first kiss, you bastard!

425
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,000
Hey, what was that sound?

426
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,630
What? What was that?

427
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,400
- Didn't you hear something?
- I didn't hear anything.

428
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,460
Did I hear it wrong?

429
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,960
What are you up to?

430
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,130
This is all the people who have
died since this school was built.

431
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,100
No wonder you're the top student of
the Computer Information Department.

432
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,960
Wow, so a lot of
students have died, huh?

433
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:46,430
Is this site cursed or something?

434
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:56,360
But, why is it
so quiet here tonight?

435
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,760
Is this camera working properly?

436
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,600
I wasn't startled. I wasn't.

437
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,460
It was lightning.
Gosh, it was lightning.

438
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
Thank goodness
we took something beforehand.

439
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,130
Anyway, I'm going to get some sleep.

440
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Okay.

441
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,400
Who was that bastard?

442
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,300
Oh, it was that English teacher!

443
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,100
The one who died on the job,
18 years ago.

444
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,600
He was no teacher! Just a pervert!

445
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,030
Why would they say
that bastard died on the job?

446
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,830
- Chun-sang.
- Yes?

447
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Where did that kid go?

448
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,230
Hey, you pervert!

449
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,560
- Hey...
- What is it?

450
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,530
Shouldn't we get some ghosts
on camera before we leave?

451
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,630
- I'm going to leave.
- Wait…

452
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,100
- Shall we go?
- Let's go!

453
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,660
- Why?
- There's no way.

454
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,700
Sir, I might have been
wrong about you.

455
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,660
Why don't you continue what you
were doing and just let me go?

456
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,960
Well, she's right over there.

457
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,830
Oh, no…

458
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,760
- The back of his head!
- What?

459
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,600
Hit the back of his head!

460
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,400
You're not so bad.

461
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,230
I'm alright.

462
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,300
- You weren't that bad yourself.
- By the way...

463
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,430
- What's your name?
- Hyun-ji. Kim Hyun-ji.

464
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,000
- And you?
- Me?

465
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,100
Park Bong-pal.

466
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,630
Your name is Park Bong-pal?

467
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,630
What a relief
that your name isn't reversed!

468
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,960
Oh my...

469
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,160
I'm crying.

470
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,560
Gosh, by the way...

471
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,530
I caught the ghost.
Where do I go to get paid?

472
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,800
Hey, do you happen to know
who Ms. Help Me is?

473
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,560
What?

474
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,360
Well... no, I don't know
who that is.

475
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:56,000
What was that?

476
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:00,260
Are you Ms. Help Me by any chance?

477
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,400
- No, I am not.
- It's you, isn't it?

478
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,360
Okay, then…

479
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,900
give me my $10,000.

480
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,430
- It's not me.
- It clearly is.

481
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,430
- Give me my money.
- Hey.

482
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,930
What kind of ghost has money?

483
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,560
If you had no money,
why would you hire me?

484
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:20,500
It was because
I was scared of that ghost.

485
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:21,960
That's what it was.

486
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:25,060
A ghost was afraid of a ghost?

487
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,900
Forget it. Give me my $10,000!

488
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,500
I said, I didn't have it! Hey!

489
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,700
Since we're on the subject,

490
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,130
did you catch it alone?

491
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,200
We caught it together.

492
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,530
Why should I pay you
when we did it together?

493
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,360
You were so weak.

494
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,230
Forget it.

495
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,230
What would I talk about with you?

496
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,230
Don't ever let me see you again.

497
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,400
I will kill you!

498
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,560
I'm fine with that.
That's what I wanted anyhow.

499
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
Who's there?

500
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,060
What are you doing here?

501
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,060
Did you fight again? Seriously?

502
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,430
You can't go a day
without fighting, huh?

503
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,530
- Where have you been?
- Praying.

504
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,230
Because my prayers
weren't being answered.

505
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,500
Who did you fight with today?

506
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,100
There is this weird guy...

507
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:34,000
You may be cursed. You keep getting
mixed up with guys like that.

508
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:41,960
Hyun-ji, what happened to your lips?

509
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,900
I just bumped into something.

510
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,600
I bumped into something lightly

511
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,560
and then I suddenly saw
all these memories.

512
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:56,600
Did you really? What were they?

513
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,260
- What were they?
- They were...

514
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,330
I can't remember now.
What should I do?

515
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,630
What do you mean?
Go bump into it again!

516
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,730
- I should do that, right?
- Of course.

517
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,100
It's your first time seeing
memories after five years.

518
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,230
But, what did you bump into?

519
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,960
What?

520
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,730
Well, it was...

521
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,700
It was mushy and soft...

522
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,330
It was warm, too...

523
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,800
Was it blood sausage?

524
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,230
What do you do for a living?

525
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,560
- I'm a college student.
- A college student?

526
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,200
What was a college student
doing at an all-girls high school?

527
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,530
Gosh, there aren't any books
in your backpack.

528
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,460
Do you study at Shaolin Temple?

529
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,330
- What is this?
- I borrowed it.

530
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,700
Detective.

531
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,860
You recorded
the girls' bathroom. Why?

532
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:07,000
That's not mine.

533
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,030
Of course, it's not yours.

534
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,100
This was in your pocket.

535
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,600
I bet this is not yours, either.

536
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,660
What kind of student
has this much money?

537
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,060
It's as much as the security
deposit for my house.

538
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,600
- Wait, you said it wasn't yours.
- That's mine.

539
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,960
How did you make such
a large amount of money?

540
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,360
Detective, I understand everything
points to me being a weirdo,

541
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:35,600
but you don't think such money
came from that, do you?

542
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,960
I'm not that weird.

543
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,800
- When you look at me...
- When I look at you...

544
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,630
you look just like that.

545
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,060
Detective.

546
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:53,460
He doesn't have
any other videos on his phone.

547
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:55,400
He has no photos.

548
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,100
Did you get in touch
with his guardian?

549
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,660
His mother passed away
a long time ago and he has a father…

550
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,700
but there's no contact info.

551
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,860
- There's no phone number?
- No, look at his contact list.

552
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:10,460
He has only one contact.

553
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,130
He's one interesting guy.

554
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,360
Park Bong-pal.

555
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,800
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

556
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,460
Hello, you have a student
named Park Bong-pal here.

557
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,760
- He's tall and named Park Bong-pal.
- Oh...

558
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,030
Why did you come?

559
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,130
What do you mean?
The police called me.

560
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,130
I saved your father's number.
Why did they call me?

561
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,060
I guess his number
was deleted somehow.

562
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,900
What is this?

563
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,230
I made it.

564
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,760
Are you going around exorcising?

565
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,700
- Hey!
- Gee, you scared me.

566
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,800
How many times did I tell
you not to do such a thing?

567
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,130
Don't yell like that.
Think about your blood pressure.

568
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,730
- I needed money.
- What for? Huh?

569
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
Why would you need money?

570
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,500
You said it yourself last time.

571
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,730
My eyes could be fixed
with $10 million.

572
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,730
That's why I did that.

573
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,160
I was being careful.

574
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,430
That's not enough.

575
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,000
If you deal with ghosts,
you might become one, too.

576
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:21,560
It's not like
I'm normal right now...

577
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,960
- Bong-pal.
- I'm leaving.

578
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,100
When you come to visit me next time

579
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,160
I will make you a stew
with top-quality sausage.

580
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,860
Bong-pal.

581
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,700
What happened?

582
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,630
I have no idea how and
when the dog got down there.

583
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,630
It might have fallen in.

584
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,360
- What should we do?
- It looks hungry.

585
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:24,060
We should get it out.

586
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,060
Don't do that.

587
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:28,060
Mr. Kim got bitten earlier.

588
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,030
It seems vicious.

589
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,000
Why don't you put
on these gloves first?

590
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,030
If I put on gloves,
it might get more frightened.

591
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,730
It's okay.

592
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,200
Come on. Good dog.

593
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,430
Hi there. There you go.

594
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,060
There you are...

595
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,200
I'm sorry.

596
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,560
Good dog. There you go.

597
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,530
- There you go.
- Oh my.

598
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,200
It's okay.
You must have been scared.

599
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,330
You were scared, weren't you?

600
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,860
Why did you go in there?

601
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,830
- Professor, you're bleeding.
- Pardon?

602
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:09,860
- You're bleeding.
- Blood.

603
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,530
Hold on.

604
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,230
Excuse me.

605
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,360
Thank you.

606
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,300
Professor Ju Hye-sung,
Department of Veterinary Medicine…

607
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,260
- Wow.
- It looks very calm.

608
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,900
Isn't he too young
to be a professor?

609
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,630
Wow, even professors
at this school are cool.

610
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,100
I will examine it,
but I'm sure everything is okay.

611
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,430
I will take care of it.

612
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,360
I'm liking this school
more and more…

613
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,900
I don't have time
to waste like this…

614
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,060
We don't want to be late for class.
Let's go in.

615
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,500
Yes!

616
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,300
Park Bong-pal...

617
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:14,300
Bong-pal...

618
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,330
There he is. His address is...

619
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,430
Hey.

620
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,930
What took you so long?
I've been waiting for a long time.

621
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,600
What's with you?

622
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,060
- How did you know to come here?
- Did you forget?

623
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,630
I'm a ghost.

624
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,130
So why did you come here?

625
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,660
You think I came
because I missed you?

626
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,430
I told you not to
show up ever again.

627
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:50,730
- I'm not in the mood to fight.
- I'm not either.

628
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,100
Then why did you come here?

629
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,830
I just need to confirm one thing
so just hold on, okay?

630
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,030
Just in case...

631
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,160
Don't get the wrong idea.
I don’t want to do this either.

632
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,530
What's she going on about?

633
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:57,460
So please, do me this favor.

634
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,830
No. I don't know
what you're up to but…

635
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,000
Go find someone else.

636
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,600
You're not the only ghost
who has followed me around.

637
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,560
He is our savior.

638
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,100
If we keep following,
we might be able to take

639
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,230
a picture of a real ghost.

640
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,900
- You can keep this as a secret?
- I understand.

641
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,530
That's the type
Im Seo-yeon likes, huh?

642
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,460
- Gentle...
- Please, go away.

643
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,460
I'm sensing some weird energy…

644
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,360
There is this naughty stray cat.

645
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,900
- Another one died yesterday.
- Last night?

646
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,630
A dead body was found inside
the closet of Room One.

647
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,960
These are his parents?
Why does he live alone then?

648
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:31,130
How am I supposed to confirm it
when he won't let me?

649
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,830
What did you just do to me?

650
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,300
Mister, you're dead!
