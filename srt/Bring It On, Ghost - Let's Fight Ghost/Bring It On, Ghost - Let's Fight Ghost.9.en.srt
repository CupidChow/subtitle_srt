(Bring it on, Ghost)

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,430
So what's your wish?

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,060
Well, my wish would be...

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,060
to take back…

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,900
what I said yesterday.

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't like being uncomfortable
around each other.

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,630
Just forget everything I said.

12
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,060
That's my wish.

13
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,460
One minute you're confessing
and the next you want me to forget?

14
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,500
Are you trying to confusing me?

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,400
You got that, right?

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,229
It's my wish
so you have to do what I ask.

17
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,300
You need to grant my wish…

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,600
so I can stay with you longer.

19
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,530
Bong-pal.

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,800
Hyun-ji.

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,430
I'm not feeling well...

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,060
Kim Hyun-ji.

23
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,260
- Bong-pal.
- Hyun-ji.

24
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Hyun-ji!

25
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,360
Hyun-ji.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,700
Kim Hyun-ji!

27
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,530
Hyun-ji!

28
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,130
Hyun-ji.

29
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,560
Bong-pal.

30
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,060
Don't ever disappear again.

31
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,230
Never again.

32
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,630
(Bring it on, Ghost)

33
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,830
(Episode 9)

34
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,460
- Good night.
- Okay.

35
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,200
Hyun-ji.

36
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,930
- What?
- Well. It's too hot.

37
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
From now on, you sleep in my room.

38
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,130
- Me?
- Yes.

39
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,900
I don't like hot weather.

40
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,030
- Good night.
- Okay.

41
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,430
Don't disappear.

42
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,630
Never again.

43
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,900
His father had an accident
and passed away when he was young.

44
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,560
Since then, he has been living
with his mother.

45
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,000
He lived in a dorm during
his middle school years.

46
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,159
And he has been
living alone since then.

47
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,100
It seems like he keeps in touch
with his mother

48
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,360
but they never visit each other.

49
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,330
- Is this all?
- Yes.

50
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,800
Honestly,
there's nothing to look into.

51
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,200
He's always on time with his bills.

52
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,000
His hospital payment
record is also clean.

53
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,560
The only thing we have is
his medical record.

54
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,200
- What is it?
- It's nothing special.

55
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,260
It seems like he was very ill
when he was young.

56
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,400
He has several medical reports.

57
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,360
- What do others say about him?
- All compliments.

58
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,930
They said he is nice and diligent.

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,030
And you can see why.
He participates in

60
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,530
five different volunteer groups.
And he does surgeries for

61
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,700
homeless dogs for free.

62
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,230
People said they have never
seen him upset or irritated.

63
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,200
He's a genius, with perfect looks,
and a perfect personality.

64
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,030
That's right... He is perfect.

65
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,860
He's too perfect
to be considered human.

66
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,500
Not even a bit.

67
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Shouldn't we change
our approach to this investigation?

68
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,930
- Did you find Noh Hyun-joo's phone?
- No.

69
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
I contacted the phone company.

70
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,900
They said that her phone was
turned off in front of her house.

71
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,060
Check if we missed anyone
on her call list.

72
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,660
- Okay.
- And track down his location.

73
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,200
Check the path he took and compare
it to where we found the body.

74
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,800
Okay.

75
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,160
Did you hear about
how Hyun-joo died?

76
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,000
- Her neck was broken.
- Really?

77
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,430
- Oh my.
- Did they find a suspect?

78
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,130
No, not yet.

79
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,160
It's Min-soo.

80
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,530
- Who is he?
- Last semester,

81
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,660
he told Hyun-joo that he liked her.

82
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,960
Professor Ju.

83
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,830
Hello. Did you come here to
console with her family?

84
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,930
- Yes.
- Well. Professor Ju.

85
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,660
You should go and pay your respects.

86
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,100
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

87
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,860
Aren't you hungry? Wait just a bit.

88
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,130
- Are you not eating?
- Huh? I'm eating.

89
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,400
- What? Is it not good?
- Huh? No, it's delicious.

90
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,300
Then why are you eating like that?

91
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,930
What's wrong with it?
I always eat like this.

92
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,300
It turned green. Let's run.

93
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,960
What's the title of the book?

94
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,500
Economic Theory.

95
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Economic Theory...

96
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,200
It should be somewhere here.

97
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,930
- Oh, it's right here.
- Huh?

98
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,060
Excuse me.

99
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,500
Oh...

100
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,000
I have something to do.
See you later.

101
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,300
Hey, where are you going...

102
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,600
- Enjoy.
- Thanks. Have a safe trip back.

103
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,030
Hey, In-rang. Let's eat. Eat.

104
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,860
Wow. One, two, three.

105
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,230
Wow. Why do we have so many?

106
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,760
I ordered one for Bong-pal, too.

107
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,330
So then with Bong-pal…
We have three people.

108
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,660
But we have four of these.

109
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,800
Hey, you.

110
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,960
After you started earning money...
You spend too much. You've changed.

111
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,760
Okay then.

112
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,930
This one. Grilled beef bento.

113
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,430
I like this a lot.

114
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,660
I will try some.

115
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,830
- This one is for Hyun-ji.
- What?

116
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,760
- That's for Hyun-ji.
- Hyun...

117
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,800
- Angel?
- Angel.

118
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,760
You're so crazy about a girl that
you'd sell out your own country.

119
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,130
You even bought shoes for a ghost.

120
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,900
Love makes you do crazy things.

121
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,460
Crazy. Crazy. You have gone crazy.
You crazy punk!

122
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,760
Why don't you just date her?

123
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,730
That's embarrassing.

124
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,330
That's embarrassing…

125
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Gosh.

126
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,700
You are insane.

127
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,600
Hey, you are
a human and she is a ghost.

128
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,300
Don't you know what that means?

129
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,530
She is a dead person. Okay?

130
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,030
Why don't you
marry her and have kids?

131
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,560
Are you that happy?

132
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,730
Ghosts can't live with people.
Can't you understand that?

133
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,330
But a wedding… You're getting
too ahead of yourself.

134
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,560
You should go to
Samil Mental Institute.

135
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,200
You should be admitted
into a hospital.

136
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,030
Gosh. Gosh.

137
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,860
How could you eat now?

138
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,230
We are going to eat together once
Hyun-ji and Bong-pal get here.

139
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,430
Our angel is not even here yet.
How rude. How could you eat this?

140
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,160
Wait!

141
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,100
Don't move.

142
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,760
I thought my heart
was going to burst.

143
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,200
If Kyung-ja was here,
we could talk about Bong-pal.

144
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,160
Where is she anyway?

145
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,130
Why is it so hard
to see her these days?

146
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,360
She's not here either.

147
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,830
Did she go home?

148
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,660
Oh, Pal, Pal, Pal. Welcome.

149
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,260
- Hello, In-rang.
- Hi, Hyun-ji.

150
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,800
Hyun-ji didn't come with me.

151
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,260
Really? Where is she?

152
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,300
I think she went home.

153
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,200
Our Bong-pal. Have a seat.

154
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,530
Our Bong-pal,
do you have any worries?

155
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,100
- Well. A woman...
- A woman?

156
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I want to do something for her.

157
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,330
I'm not sure what I should do.

158
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,060
- This is not about me.
- Yes, this is not about you.

159
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,800
- This is about your friend, right?
- That's right.

160
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,530
Woman. Woman.

161
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,430
Woman. Female. Woman.

162
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,829
Should I give you some
good dating advice?

163
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,460
It's not easy to figure out
what a woman wants or

164
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,000
what you should do for her.

165
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,300
Dating? Do you know what love is?

166
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:32,730
A baby bird like you should
stay out of this. Got that? Huh?

167
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,060
Before you find out what she wants

168
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,030
you should find out what type
of person she's attracted to.

169
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,830
Assistant? Look here.

170
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,500
It's okay even if
you are not that good-looking.

171
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,860
Do this.

172
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,730
Put your hand here like this.
Move your fingers.

173
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,100
It's okay even
if you look like a squid.

174
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,700
That's not what makes
a man attractive.

175
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,530
Then what does?

176
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,130
In English, we call it 'charming.'

177
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,630
Ah... Ah... Charming.

178
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,060
Shall we start now?

179
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Step one.

180
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,400
The side profile. The neck muscles
that symbolize masculine beauty

181
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,200
and the sharp nose that is full of
intellectual beauty.

182
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,130
When women see those things

183
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,060
they will fall for you.

184
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,160
They will totally fall for you.

185
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,530
Step two.

186
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,360
Eye contact.

187
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,760
Eye contact.

188
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,230
There are times when wild beauty

189
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,030
and eyes that are like the ocean

190
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,200
can do the trick.
When you look at her with those eyes

191
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,630
she might melt like a glacier
because of global warming.

192
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,560
She will melt like that.

193
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,500
Step three.

194
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm okay, I'm okay.

195
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,130
Don't cry, you fool.

196
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,800
You must be able to make her laugh
when she falls into despair.

197
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,100
What do you call a pretty apple?

198
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,130
An a-peel-ing apple!

199
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,930
A sense of humor.

200
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,230
We can say that
the sense of humor is

201
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,160
one of men's strongest
charming points.

202
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,460
Is this helpful to you?

203
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,200
That's okay. I have eight more.
There are 11 steps.

204
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,900
Step four.

205
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,700
I think I'm okay. That's enough.

206
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,860
Hyun-ji.

207
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,430
Kim Hyun-ji?

208
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,330
Hyun-ji.

209
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,200
Bong-pal.

210
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,630
Where were you?

211
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,000
I told you to stay by my side.
Don't disappear.

212
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,100
I looked everywhere for you.

213
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,700
I'm sorry.

214
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,660
- What were you doing?
- Nothing, really.

215
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,030
Charming.

216
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,800
Then what does make
a man attractive?

217
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,730
Step 1! The side profile.

218
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,730
- Hyun-ji.
- Huh?

219
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,430
- Bong-pal.
- Huh?

220
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
- Bong-pal?
- What?

221
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,600
Are you not feeling well?
What's wrong with you?

222
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,160
I have a stiff neck.

223
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,500
- Is this not it?
- Step two.

224
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,200
- Eye contact.
- Eye contact. Okay.

225
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,100
- Hyun-ji?
- Yes?

226
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,730
What? Do you want to
have a staring contest?

227
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,700
No. My eyes hurt.

228
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,900
- Is this not it either?
- Step three.

229
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,900
We can say that
the sense of humor is

230
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,100
one of men's strongest
charming points.

231
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,200
Hyun-ji, do you want
to hear something funny?

232
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,500
- What is it?
- Why did the king

233
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,160
go to the bank after dinner?

234
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,500
Hm...

235
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,800
To make his knightly deposit.
Isn't it funny?

236
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,130
- What kind of phone makes music?
- Well.

237
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,560
Saxophone!

238
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,300
Okay then.
What do you call a pretty apple?

239
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,300
An a-peel-ing apple!

240
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,830
Are you sure you are okay?

241
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,730
Are you okay?

242
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,730
Yes.

243
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,060
- This is not working.
- What isn't?

244
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,730
Oh... It's nothing.

245
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,360
Let's just eat lunch.

246
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,600
Meat! Meat! Meat! Wow!

247
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,430
Wow, it's all done.
Can I eat it now?

248
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,000
- Go ahead.
- Which one looks good?

249
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,830
Meat is always the best.

250
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,930
That star is the brightest.

251
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,460
That one? That's Altair.

252
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,360
The Altair and the Vega?

253
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,560
Yes.
And that one right there is Vega.

254
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:22,000
The one spread out is the Milky Way.

255
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,900
Oh, that's cool.

256
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,930
I didn't know that before.

257
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,430
Those two stars
are really far apart.

258
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,730
They must be sad.

259
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,200
They only get to see each other once
a year since they're so far apart.

260
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,600
Don't you think they'd be happy
enough just seeing each other?

261
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
Even if it's just for a day.

262
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,800
How do you know so much
about constellations?

263
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,260
Oh, my father taught me
when I was young.

264
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,830
- Shall I tell you more about it?
- Yes.

265
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,600
The one shining on top is Aquila.

266
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,700
So there's Aquila...

267
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,900
Bong-pal, are you asleep?

268
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,360
Go to bed.
If you want to go out tomorrow...

269
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,560
Really? Are we going
on a date tomorrow?

270
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,930
Well.

271
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,030
Okay. It's a date.

272
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,360
Okay. I will get up early tomorrow.

273
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,030
Good night. Dream of me.

274
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,330
What do you want to do today?

275
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,860
The things all the other couples do.
Eat out, have a cup of tea,

276
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,400
watch a movie, and walk together.

277
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,300
Okay.
Let's do what other couples do.

278
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,560
Okay.

279
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,930
Oh. Hey!

280
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,530
Hey, hey, hey.

281
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,860
Hey!

282
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm sorry. Sorry.

283
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm sorry.

284
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,360
Don't do that.

285
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,000
Excuse me.

286
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,230
What's taking her so long?

287
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,700
What am I supposed to
wear on a first date?

288
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,260
Bong-pal.

289
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,400
Why did you tell me
to come out first?

290
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,060
Just...

291
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,960
Let's go.

292
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,560
This is not it.

293
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,600
It's just like
the one you already have.

294
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,700
It's not bad.

295
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,400
Knock, knock.

296
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,000
- Mister, what do you sell here?
- We sell rice wine.

297
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,260
Oh, really? Can I have some?

298
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,260
No drinking for you.

299
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,860
What about this?

300
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,000
You are so pretty.

301
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,600
Two tickets for 10 o'clock.

302
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,260
We have couple seats and
regular seats. Which would you like?

303
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,760
Couple seats, please.

304
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,330
Just a moment, please.

305
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,860
Bong-pal, let's eat that.

306
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,130
Can you really
eat this all by yourself?

307
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,900
This is nothing for me.

308
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,530
It feels like
we're a real couple, don't we?

309
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Yes.

310
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,000
What would you like to eat?

311
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,500
What you want to eat.

312
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,560
Excuse me.

313
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,230
May I take your order?

314
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,630
Set Number Two, please.

315
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,230
Set Number Two is for two people.

316
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,930
Yes, I'm okay with that.

317
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,700
Oh, and can I have
another glass of water here?

318
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Okay.

319
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,800
Here.

320
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,900
Aren't you doing too much today?

321
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,900
You took me out to the movies
and a full-course meal.

322
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,500
- I can handle it.
- But still...

323
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,330
Fine. I will exorcise more
and make you a lot of money.

324
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,860
They're all dead now.

325
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,530
Sounds good.

326
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,730
Wait. It's raining.

327
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,100
Let's run.

328
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,700
Hold on.

329
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,300
Shall we go?

330
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,130
Bong-pal,
aren't you getting all wet?

331
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,500
It's okay. Let's go.

332
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,100
(Female Student Murder Case:
Noh Hyun-joo)

333
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,960
(Crime Scene)

334
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,430
Sir, are you going to question
the witnesses again?

335
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,430
I need to do something.

336
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,330
The analysis team asked
me to give this to you.

337
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,900
Thank you.

338
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,960
What is it?

339
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:02,000
These are the photos
from the toll gate.

340
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,400
Sir, you might want to see this.

341
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,200
The license plate matches, right?

342
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,900
Yes, it's Professor Ju's
plate number.

343
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,830
Before we question
the other witnesses,

344
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,400
bring Professor Ju to the station.

345
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,730
- If he resists, arrest him.
- Yes, I will.

346
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360
- A fountain pen?
- No, I gave it to the professor.

347
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,230
Where were you on the day
Noh Hyun-joo was murdered?

348
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,930
I was at the animal clinic that day.

349
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
See you later.

350
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,530
Hyun-ji!

351
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,530
Hyun-ji.

352
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,030
Did the power go out?

353
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,330
Are you okay?

354
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,830
I'm scared.

355
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,000
- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I am.

356
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,630
Bong-pal.

357
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,630
There is something
I've been meaning to ask you.

358
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,460
What is it?

359
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,330
When did you start seeing ghosts?

360
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,530
Maybe when I was five...

361
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,560
I think it started from around then.

362
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,860
You were so little.

363
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:29,460
- How did it happen?
- I'm not sure.

364
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,400
According to Monk Myung-chul,

365
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,400
there are still evil spirits
left inside me.

366
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,230
Evil spirits?

367
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,030
What are they?

368
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,960
I don't really know.

369
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,230
I don't remember
much before I was five.

370
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,330
It must have been
scary all the time.

371
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,460
I was at the time.

372
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,530
I'm okay now.

373
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,160
Thank you, Bong-pal.

374
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,000
- For what?
- For everything.

375
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,130
Everything seems good
when I'm with you.

376
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:28,030
When I woke up as a ghost
without my memory,

377
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,430
I was so scared and lonely.

378
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,230
But not anymore.

379
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,100
Even if I don't get my memory back,

380
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,230
I like how things are now.

381
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,700
I'm so glad that you can see me.

382
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm also glad that I can see you.

383
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,060
Sir.

384
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,260
It's a photo of your car taken
at dawn on the first.

385
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,160
Is this your license plate number?

386
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,060
Yes, it's my car.

387
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,630
I see.

388
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,400
You passed the toll gate
at 11:28 p.m. on the first.

389
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,130
You arrived in Insung at 1:38 a.m.
on the second.

390
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,660
You took Route 34

391
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,860
to reach Mount Woojung.

392
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,800
You came back to Seoul
early that morning.

393
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,760
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

394
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,760
I don't know if you're aware.

395
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:35,160
But Noh Hyun-joo's body
was found near Mount Woojung.

396
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,530
She was murdered
on the night of the first.

397
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,760
It appears her body was abandoned
early in the morning on the second.

398
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:45,160
Was it a coincidence that you
happened to be near there?

399
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,000
Why did you go to the mountain
in the middle of the night?

400
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,630
I feel like I'm a suspect.

401
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,130
Please, answer my question.

402
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,200
I went to see my mother.

403
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,700
My mother lives in the area.

404
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,030
- Your mother?
- You can confirm if you need to.

405
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,600
- You're good at this, huh?
- Because it's the truth.

406
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,830
Hello, this is Detective Kim.

407
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,860
Sir, may I speak
to you for a moment?

408
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,860
Excuse me.

409
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,600
What do you mean?

410
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,330
One of the witnesses
for the case just died.

411
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,600
Who is it?

412
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,400
His name is Lee Min-soo,
a student at Myongsung.

413
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,300
Phone records show that he talked
to Noh Hyun-joo on the 30th

414
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,200
for a minute and I included him
on the list of witnesses.

415
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,400
It appears he jumped
from his place and killed himself.

416
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,730
- He committed suicide?
- Correct.

417
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,860
And he claimed that
he killed Noh Hyun-joo.

418
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,560
The estimated time of death is...

419
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,860
right after he came back
from Noh's funeral.

420
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,400
Who are you?

421
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,460
I'm sorry. I killed Hyun-joo.

422
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,830
I didn't mean to do it.

423
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,160
He texted his mom
before he killed himself.

424
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,160
He said he killed her in the text.

425
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,900
Noh Hyun-joo's cell phone
was found in his room, too.

426
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,800
It seems that he was following her
around since last semester.

427
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,160
The boss told me
to wrap up this case.

428
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,030
He wants us to investigate
a murder case in Woohyun-dong.

429
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,960
What should we do?

430
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,630
Get the files together
and leave them on my desk.

431
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,160
I will. Gosh.

432
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,200
You're still here. Hello there.

433
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,830
- Do you know that dog?
- Yes.

434
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,400
When you gave me a hard time,
she was there for me.

435
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,100
When did I give you a hard time?

436
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,800
Bong-pal.

437
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,100
Wow, it's that handsome professor.

438
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,630
Hello, Professor Ju.

439
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,630
What are you doing here?

440
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,960
Well, I was looking at the dog...

441
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,360
Were you?
Why don't you go in and look?

442
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,760
- We can have some tea, too.
- I want to go in.

443
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,730
Come on. Come inside.

444
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,700
You look like you're
watching your girlfriend.

445
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,700
- Pardon?
- Why so surprised?

446
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,530
You had love in your eyes.

447
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,460
- I guess you like dogs, huh?
- Well...

448
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,260
That dog is very pretty.

449
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:24,530
Ah, it's almost summer break now.

450
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,960
Have you completed
your volunteer hours yet?

451
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,900
Not yet.

452
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,360
Then can you help me
with the volunteer work I'm doing?

453
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,130
I can use some help these days.

454
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,800
You can fill up the hours here.
What do you think?

455
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,660
It sounds good.

456
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,860
I was looking
for something actually.

457
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,730
- Good then.
- Where are you going?

458
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,860
Where are you going?

459
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,530
Hey, puppy. Where are you?

460
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,200
Where did she go?

461
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,760
There you are.

462
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,630
Come here. You're so pretty.

463
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,130
Professor Ju.

464
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,530
- I'm going to head out.
- Oh. Hold on.

465
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,300
Who said you could come in
without my permission?

466
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,100
Such insolence…

467
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,660
- Go on upstairs.
- Okay.

468
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,260
(Kim Hyun-ji)

469
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:40,260
- Goodbye.
- Sure, take care.

470
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,760
Wait, that punk is...

471
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,960
Bong-pal. Bong-pal.

472
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,630
Monk Myung-chul.

473
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,100
Who was the man at
that animal clinic earlier?

474
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
- Professor Ju?
- Professor?

475
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,900
Yes, he's a professor at my school.

476
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,230
Ah, then he also lives
in your apartment building?

477
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,360
No, it seems that
he lives in his clinic.

478
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,160
At his clinic?

479
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,800
- What's wrong?
- What?

480
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,900
It's nothing.

481
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,400
Let's go.
Aren't you on your way home?

482
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,730
- Yes.
- Let's go. It's hot.

483
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,530
Bong-pal.

484
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,830
Are you studying for
the college entrance exams?

485
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,400
And why are there photos in here?

486
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,130
I wanted to brush up on the basics.

487
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,130
By the way, why didn't you call
before coming over?

488
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,130
When have I ever called you?

489
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,300
What is it?

490
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,500
Is there something on the balcony?

491
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,160
Nothing. It's nothing at all.

492
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:29,730
By any chance, have you noticed
anything weird around you?

493
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:32,330
No, nothing much.

494
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,430
- Why?
- It's fine then.

495
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,460
Let me see.

496
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,730
I can't come out?

497
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,230
He can sometimes feel
the presence of ghosts.

498
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,660
Did he save
his dad's contact information?

499
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,100
He's his dad after all.

500
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,230
He still hasn't saved
his contact information.

501
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,660
1223? Is that it?

502
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,300
(Bong-pal, your middle school
graduation, May 13th)

503
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,260
May 13th?

504
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,430
If this was sent on May 13th,

505
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,430
it's when he was still
staying at that place.

506
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,900
(Bong-pal, your middle school
graduation, May 13th)

507
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,660
Middle school graduation?

508
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,900
- Bong-pal! Bong-pal!
- Yes?

509
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,900
When was
your middle school graduation?

510
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,230
I think it was February...

511
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,660
Probably about then.
Why do you ask?

512
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,630
Nothing. Never mind
and get back to your business.

513
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,030
Hello, senior.

514
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,660
I will be right there.

515
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,660
Monk Myung-chul, I will be back.

516
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:03,930
Sure.

517
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,700
If it was his graduation...

518
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:18,700
What happened at the graduation
for him to leave such a text?

519
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,230
Wait, he taped the graduation.

520
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,930
Let me go find it.

521
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,630
He definitely taped
the ceremony back then…

522
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,160
September, June, May... wait.

523
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,960
According to the Gregorian calendar,
it was February.

524
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,100
It was February 24th. February 24th...

525
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,660
Yeah, it's February 24th.

526
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:05,230
Well, they said the ghost
went into this man's body…

527
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,460
So stay behind
Bong-pal today, Hyun-ji.

528
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,060
- It's dangerous.
- Okay.

529
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:11,760
It must be nice having
someone look out for you.

530
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,300
- Are you jealous now?
- What is Hyun-ji saying?

531
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,230
Are you okay?

532
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,560
What are you thinking about?
Sit properly!

533
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,360
Gosh...

534
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,300
Hyun-ji, are you okay?

535
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,430
(24th Doowon
Middle School Graduation)

536
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,160
No! No!

537
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,100
No...

538
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,860
No.

539
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:07,160
No, no.

540
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,300
No!

541
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,800
My brother was very ill a while ago.

542
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,500
After he got well,
he suddenly had a seizure one day.

543
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,560
Hyun-min! Hyun-min!

544
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,000
What's wrong?

545
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,660
Hyun-min!

546
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,660
Hyun-min, open this door!
Are you okay?

547
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,130
- Hyun-min, open this door!
- Open this door!

548
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,500
- What happened?
- Here, Key.

549
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:17,600
Since that day, he's been
lying in bed like that.

550
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,560
He screams like that
whenever he wakes up.

551
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,330
My mom thinks there's
a ghost inside his body.

552
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,160
We will go in first.

553
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,800
Oh my, what's wrong with this?

554
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,800
Gosh, no.

555
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:03,400
Please, no. No!

556
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,900
- Hyun-min! Hyun-min!
- No! No!

557
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,600
Hyun-min, it's okay.

558
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,430
Bong-pal, look over there.

559
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,360
This is the ghost
from a few minutes ago.

560
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,160
So you're saying that girl
was strangling my son?

561
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,060
If she's dead, she should've
just gone to the afterlife quietly.

562
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:43,200
Why my son? Oh my.

563
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,530
Let's go inside.

564
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,760
- Oh my goodness.
- Gosh.

565
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,960
By the way, who is that woman?

566
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,230
She and my brother
went out a while ago.

567
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,030
So what would you like us to do?

568
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,330
Once he falls back asleep like that,

569
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,430
he doesn't wake up for two days.

570
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,330
He might be stable until then.

571
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,600
Then we will come back in two days.

572
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,730
- If anything happens, call us.
- I will.

573
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,160
My goodness...

574
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,300
Did he get anything?

575
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,760
Bong-pal! Bong-pal, look here!

576
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,800
Smile a bit, will you?

577
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,600
Why was that man there?

578
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,060
Please, take care.

579
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,960
- You saw that, didn't you?
- Saw what?

580
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,430
Didn't he make you think?

581
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,830
- No.
- No?

582
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,460
You just lost
all sense of logic, didn't you?

583
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,900
If you follow around a ghost,
the same thing will happen to you.

584
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,030
If a ghost drains
your energy like that,

585
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,960
how can you possibly survive?

586
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:17,960
Will you be drained like
that man and live your life, huh?

587
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:21,800
A ghost and a person
are not meant to be together.

588
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,200
Quiet down. Hyun-ji will hear you.

589
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:34,700
You think she heard me?

590
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,400
Of course, she did.
How could she not hear you?

591
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,860
I'm sorry.

592
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,960
Let's go.

593
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,830
Bong-pal.

594
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,500
Are we going to be okay like this?

595
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,560
To other people...

596
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:36,960
our relationship doesn't make sense.

597
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,860
I like you.

598
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,830
I don't care what
others think about us.

599
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,100
I like you just
the way you are, Hyun-ji.

600
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,500
(Bring it on, Ghost)

601
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,960
- You're so ugly.
- Stop it.

602
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:10,500
We will also have to separate
like them someday.

603
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,130
Bong-pal,
who are you talking to now?

604
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,960
This ghost was seen
here and there on campus.

605
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,530
But the way it looks
is very peculiar.

606
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,530
Wait, it's the tape
from my graduation.

607
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,060
Why was he watching this
out of the blue?

608
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,460
You have the address
of the professor's mother, right?

609
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,800
Hyun-min!

610
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,730
He killed the person he liked
and himself out of guilt.

611
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,360
How can you be in love with a ghost?

612
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,130
Bong-pal, I want you to be happy.

613
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,030
Hyun-ji!

614
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,830
Kim Hyun-ji!
