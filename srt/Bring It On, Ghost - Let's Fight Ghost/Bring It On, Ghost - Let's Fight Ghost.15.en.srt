00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,800
(Ok Taec-yeon)

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,660
(Kim So-hyun)

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,530
(Kwon Yul)

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,360
(Kim Sang-ho)

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,100
(Bring it on, Ghost)

6
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,430
I can see ghosts.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,700
No matter what happens,
I'll protect you.

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,130
(Previously)

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,860
Why is my father here?

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,000
It appears that your dad was murdered.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,430
You killed Bong-pal's mother.
As if that wasn't enough,

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,760
you killed his father.

13
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,230
- You've met his father before?
- It was at a temple five years ago.

14
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,860
He asked me to give
something to his son.

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,300
He also asked me
not to show it to anyone.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,100
That is very important to Bong-pal.

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,900
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I will come back soon.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,230
Wait for me, Bong-pal.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,160
You don't look so good.
Have some tea.

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,500
Monk Myung-chul.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,700
(Episode 15)

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,400
By chance, did you know?

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,060
What do you mean?

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,860
The detective came by.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,660
He asked me about Professor Ju.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,430
He said...

27
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,200
that Professor Ju Hye-sung is
connected to my father's death.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,930
Bong-pal.

29
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,300
Professor Ju is not human.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,160
To be exact… an inhuman force
is inside his body.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,530
An evil spirit.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,460
The same evil spirit that came
out of your body a long time ago.

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,030
What's wrong?

34
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,360
I just feel dizzy.

35
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,600
Excuse me, I'm going to
use the restroom.

36
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,460
That evil spirit has been
hanging around you and Hyun-ji.

37
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:49,960
Hyun-ji?

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,760
She has what he wants.

39
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:55,300
- What is it?
- A weapon.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,100
The weapon that was used to get rid
of that evil spirit from your body.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,730
Do you remember?

42
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,400
That weapon... was broken.

43
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,130
It was.

44
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,100
But it seems like your mother
made another one for your sake.

45
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,329
Bong-pal, your mother
had a very strong soul.

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,130
So much so that it shocked
even the shamanesses.

47
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,630
- My mom?
- Yes.

48
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,560
Some say it was a gift, but to
your mother, it was a nightmare.

49
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,100
She decided to not accept the gift.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,430
- Why?
- She was pregnant with you.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,530
She wanted to raise you
like a normal person.

52
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,300
The gods were angry.

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,900
Among them, the evil
spirit was also there.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,430
It was rejected, so....

55
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,030
It tried to possess my body.

56
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,730
Yes.

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,100
That's when
the misfortune all started.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,800
I eventually got rid of
the evil spirit from your body

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,700
but your mother made
another weapon just in case

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,360
it tried to harm you again

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,300
- with all her energy.
- My mom.

62
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,400
But... how did Hyun-ji...

63
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,630
Your father came looking
for that weapon at the temple

64
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,760
and it seemed like
Hyun-ji also came to pray.

65
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,730
Your father was being chased
by the evil spirit at that time.

66
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,860
He was frantic and asked her
to look after the weapon.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,700
But she got into a car accident
on her way to give it to you.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,160
The weapon got lost in the middle

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,630
and your father was back
to being on the run again.

70
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,730
My mom, my father, and Hyun-ji…

71
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,260
- They all got hurt because of me.
- No. No, Bong-pal.

72
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,360
It's not because of you.
It's because of that evil spirit.

73
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,700
Where are you going?

74
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,500
I need to go to Hyun-ji.

75
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,360
(My Love Bong Bong)

76
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,130
The person you are trying
to call cannot be reached...

77
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,800
Hyun-ji... are you okay?

78
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
- Hyun-ji...
- Young lady.

79
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,900
Where is the item
you're supposed to give?

80
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,260
Young lady.

81
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,030
Professor Ju, you're...

82
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,930
You remember.

83
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,530
It's best to bury bad memories.

84
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,100
Excuse me!

85
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,530
What brings you here?

86
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,260
- Is Hyun-ji home?
- She's not home right now...

87
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,960
- Didn't she go out to meet you?
- She hasn't returned yet?

88
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,700
Is there something going on?

89
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,230
No.

90
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,830
Young man! Young man!

91
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,659
- Never mind.
- Seriously!

92
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,100
It's not him.

93
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,760
You need to move more quickly.
You're not careful at all.

94
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,700
Don't you know
the fundamentals of a stakeout?

95
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,460
Is this necessary, huh?
What are we? Detectives?

96
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,030
Didn't the monk tell
us to watch over him?

97
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,330
And when did you
ever follow directions so well?

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,000
You know, you're not as
bright as I thought you were.

99
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,560
We need to score points with him
if we want to work with Bong-pal.

100
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,600
Why do you think
he asked us to do this?

101
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,900
It's because this person
is dangerous to Bong-pal!

102
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,130
He must've seen us as very
strong and reliable colleagues

103
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,730
to give us something
so important like this to take on.

104
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,830
- Ah.
- Ah?

105
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,430
I get it.

106
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,630
Isn't that him?

107
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,760
Right?

108
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,360
He's... he's loading
something in the car.

109
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,360
Let's follow him.

110
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,700
Let's go.

111
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,800
Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji!

112
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,300
Hyun-ji.

113
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,160
Right, the alarm went
off 30 minutes ago.

114
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,760
We started the search and rescue.
We'll catch him soon.

115
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,260
Don't worry too much.

116
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,360
I'll call you right away
if something comes up, so go home.

117
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,800
Bong-pal! Bong-pal!

118
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,400
Goodness, hello.

119
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,700
What's going on here?

120
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,860
That bastard...

121
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,100
took Hyun-ji.

122
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,830
Goodness.

123
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,930
Oh my dear Buddha.

124
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,260
Oh goodness.

125
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,000
Is your daughter Kim Hyun-ji?

126
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,000
It seems that she went
missing a little while ago.

127
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,060
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

128
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,400
- Sir.
- Did you talk to the employees?

129
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,730
Yes, I think he
planned this all along.

130
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,330
He gave them time off
a few days ago.

131
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,500
And they know nothing about
Professor Ju.

132
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,260
Even his phone is off.

133
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,000
It'll be hard to track him.
What should we do?

134
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,760
Compare Park Ji-hoon's
and Professor Ju Hye-sung's DNA.

135
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:34,130
Tell everyone this is an emergency.
He hasn't gone too far.

136
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,830
Yes, sir.

137
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,560
Who went to his mother's house?

138
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,230
The local precinct
agreed to cooperate.

139
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,200
They're probably there by now.

140
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,230
Hey, be quiet.

141
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,160
- What in the world is he doing?
- I don't know.

142
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,500
He seems very suspicious.

143
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,130
Seeing how he's switching
cars this late at night.

144
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,400
It's always the good-looking
ones that surprise you.

145
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,400
He's taking something out.
He's taking something out.

146
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,630
Hyun... Hyun-ji!

147
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,130
What are you doing over there?

148
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,100
Nothing.

149
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,260
Is this your car?

150
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,900
Yes. Why do you ask?

151
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,960
You can't park here for
two days without a contact number.

152
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,900
Hurry up and move it.

153
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,760
I got so many complaints
because of this car.

154
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,800
- Just go.
- Hurry up and move it.

155
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,860
Excuse me.

156
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,830
Yes?

157
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,700
I told you to just go.
Why do you keep bothering me?

158
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,830
- What the heck?
- What are you doing? Let's go!

159
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,500
What the heck!
This worthless piece of crap!

160
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,360
Bong-pal, don't worry too much.

161
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,630
That punk won't be able to touch
Hyun-ji until he finds the weapon.

162
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,500
Why... is he so
obsessed with that weapon?

163
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,530
He can completely possess you
once that weapon disappears.

164
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,500
Me?

165
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,660
It's because your mother's energy
has been handed down to you.

166
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,500
That's why he's been lurking
around you for 10 years.

167
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,730
Yes, Senior In-rang.

168
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,030
What did you say?

169
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,000
Where?

170
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,600
Okay.

171
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,500
Sir, that camera is useless.
It's been broken for a long time.

172
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,130
The students did not get
a good look at the license plate.

173
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,660
Tracking him won't be easy.

174
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,230
If this was premeditated,
I'm sure he planned a hideout.

175
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,800
Check Professor Ju's call records
and all the CCTV in the vicinity.

176
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,330
Yes, sir.

177
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,260
Bong-pal.

178
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,400
Let's go back home. You guys too.

179
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,230
- Bong-pal.
- Go on without me.

181
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,430
What about you?

182
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,160
I have to find Hyun-ji.

183
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,760
How? How are you going to find her?

184
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,460
I can't sit around and do nothing.

185
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,600
He's after you.
You're the one who is in danger.

186
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,360
Then what about Hyun-ji?

187
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,330
- I'll find her.
- This happened because of me.

188
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,230
- I have to do something.
- Bong-pal.

189
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,130
We'll stay with Bong-pal.
Don't worry.

190
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,930
(Ju Hye-sung
Lee Min-soo: Deceased)

191
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,660
(Park Ji-hoon: Deceased)

192
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,330
(Kim Hyun-ji)

193
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,930
- Sir.
- Yeah?

194
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,700
- Did you find something?
- Yes, I checked the cameras

195
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,960
and a few cars that look like
Professor Ju's car was captured.

196
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,430
We're in the process of
looking through it right now.

197
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,800
We should be able to get its
location in a couple of hours.

198
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,130
Let me know as soon
as you get the results.

199
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,660
Yes, sir.

200
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,460
Hello.

201
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,700
Monk, you can't stay here.

202
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,230
If you take a seat over there,
we'll let you know if we get

203
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,330
any information on Professor Ju.

204
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,730
- She's here.
- Hello.

205
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,660
Please, sit over here.

206
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,800
Just a moment, please.

207
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,200
Who is that person?

208
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,960
Professor Ju Hye-sung's mother.

209
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,330
Let's go.

210
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,230
Did Hye-sung kill all those people?

211
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,130
We're still investigating.

212
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
It's true.

213
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,060
I heard what happened on the way.

214
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,860
How...

215
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,930
I realize that
this must be difficult,

216
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,760
but please, help us so that the
investigation moves along quickly.

217
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,400
I'm not sure if I can
be of any help to you.

218
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,960
What was the last thing you
talked about with your son?

219
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,800
I don't remember.

220
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,830
I understand.

221
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,500
- Senior In-rang.
- Yeah?

222
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,630
Did you say
Professor Ju headed to the right?

223
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,730
Yes, he went to the right.

224
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,060
Professor Ju is looking for
the item that Hyun-ji has.

225
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,160
And Hyun-ji got into a car accident
trying to give me that item.

226
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,330
Then that item is probably in Seoul.

227
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,960
That's true.

228
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,800
Why did he come
all the way here then?

229
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,900
I think he's trying to lure us away.

230
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,460
He probably went to Seoul.

231
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,200
- You fixed it?
- That's right.

232
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,360
Don't you know who I am? We can use
this for 10 more years.

233
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,160
What should we do? Where do we go?
Just head straight to Seoul?

234
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,460
The detectives said that
he planned for his escape, right?

235
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,160
Yeah, why?

236
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,960
Then he must have surveyed
the area beforehand?

237
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,960
Probably.

238
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,560
Then...

239
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,030
Hey, where are you going?

240
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,900
Hey.

241
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,860
What are you doing?

242
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,800
Are you searching for
the entered destination?

243
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,230
He probably erased it. I swear
you're slowly turning into an idiot.

244
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,000
Of course, he erased it.

245
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,330
It can be deleted from the screen,
but a trace will remain on the RAM.

246
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,060
If I do this right, I can even
find out where he went a week ago.

247
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,800
It worked! I found it! I found it!

248
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,700
- Is that a phone number?
- It's the coordinates.

249
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,630
Longitude, latitude,
and stuff like that.

250
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,260
If I input the coordinates here...

251
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,800
Ta-da.

252
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,860
Just who are you?

253
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,360
Bong-pal, come quickly!

254
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,800
These were his recent destinations.

255
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,460
That's the school
and that's the hospital.

256
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,530
Where is that?

257
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,860
I think this is Guil-dong.
I'll look for it.

258
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,630
Ah, Guil-dong is where
that empty warehouse is!

259
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,200
It's the perfect place
for bad guys to hide out in.

260
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,300
Do you think Hyun-ji is there?

261
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,030
Let's head over there first.

262
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,260
Thank you.

263
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,130
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you.

264
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
Not at all. I'm thankful
that you even came.

265
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,630
I'll escort you home.

266
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,060
No, I'll just go by myself.

267
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,200
Are you alright?

268
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,430
- Yes.
- Can we talk?

269
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,830
I'm sorry.

270
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,530
I'm sorry.

271
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,660
- I have nothing to say.
- No, it's fine.

272
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,930
I'm not doing this so I can
get an apology out of you.

273
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,700
Then...

274
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,930
There are some questions
I want to ask about your son.

275
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,130
I told the detective everything.

276
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,130
I won't know anything
even if you ask me.

277
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,000
You can tell me what you
couldn't say to the detective.

278
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,760
When did it start?

279
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,460
When did your son change?

280
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,930
I know there is an evil
spirit inside your son's body.

281
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,230
When did it start?

282
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:18,630
Hye-sung is who he is because of me.

283
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,560
You brat! You're just
like your mother!

284
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,060
I told you not to
look at me like that!

285
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:30,700
- Don't look at me like that, punk!
- Hye-sung, run! Stop!

286
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,800
Please, stop!

287
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,330
Why are you crying?

288
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,160
Do you want me to help you?

289
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,460
Leave me alone! Go away!

290
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,430
Go away!

291
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,000
Should I save you from hell?
How about it?

292
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,460
You have to save your mom, too.
Don't you think so?

293
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,330
Mom?

294
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
Mom.

295
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,030
Kill him, kill him, kill him!

296
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,900
Kill him!

297
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,860
Hye-sung... Hye-sung!

298
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,760
Someone help!
Someone has fallen!

299
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,030
I should've taken
better care of him.

300
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,930
He wouldn't be what he
is now if I had done that.

301
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm home.

302
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,030
Mom?

303
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,330
Mom?

304
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,930
Mom!

305
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,330
- What about the number and address?
- Gosh, it's really hot today.

306
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,700
Why are there so many reports
on a hot day like this?

307
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,230
- Yes, I understand.
- So many reports.

308
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,900
No kidding.

309
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,460
By the way, who is that kid?

310
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,830
He came back from school
and his mom moved away without him.

311
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,400
- Did you call her?
- I did.

312
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,960
She's coming.

313
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,860
Ever since that day,
Hye-sung started to change.

314
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,960
He went to live in
the dorms at his middle school.

315
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,100
And he only called me
once in a while.

316
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's all my fault.

317
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,960
I made him that way.

318
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,530
I'm to blame.

319
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,600
It's for one day.

320
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,160
Why did mom pack this much?

321
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,400
It will be hard to
carry this around.

322
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,730
You're awake?

323
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,160
I've been waiting for so long.

324
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,330
Why are you doing this?

325
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,160
If you have your memory back,
you should know.

326
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,630
You shouldn't resent me.

327
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,960
You should resent the man that
gave you the item and his son.

328
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,360
They left you in hell
for the last five years.

329
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,730
If you hadn't gotten that item,

330
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,660
we wouldn't have met this way.

331
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't you think so?

332
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,960
Are you scared of me?

333
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,200
No, I'm not scared of you at all.

334
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,330
Good.

335
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,760
Do you know what's scarier
than just feeling scared?

336
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,300
It's being found out
that you're actually scared.

337
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,960
See? You're already shaking.

338
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,760
What are you?

339
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,260
You're not human, are you?

340
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,600
Not sure. What am I?

341
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,300
Am I human or not?

342
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:03,300
Whether I'm human or not

343
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,560
depends on your answer.

344
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,330
Where is... that item?

345
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,100
That is very important to Bong-pal.

346
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:30,530
If you remember,
please tell me, okay?

347
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,260
What is it?

348
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
You still don't remember?

349
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,260
Then I will help you remember.

350
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,500
- Hello?
- Mom.

351
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,600
Is this Hyun-ji? Hyun-ji!

352
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,260
- Mom!
- Hello? Hyun-ji!

353
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,830
What do you think?

354
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,730
Do you remember now?

355
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,700
You better remember.

356
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,760
If not…

357
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,300
your loved ones will die one by one.

358
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,360
Here!

359
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,930
Hyun-ji.

360
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,300
Hyun-ji!

361
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,060
- Hyun-ji!
- Kim Hyun-ji!

362
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,260
Hyun-ji!

363
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,630
- Kim Hyun-ji!
- Kim Hyun-ji!

364
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,830
(Myongsung University)

365
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,830
As a boy, he probably wanted
to protect himself from

366
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,060
the guilt from killing his dad
and feeling distant from his mom.

367
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,260
His hatred made
the evil spirit come to him.

368
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,330
The spirit used
the boy's open wound.

369
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,330
Do you think that professor
might still have his humanity?

370
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,460
Not at all. They're one body now.

371
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,930
Then what should we do now?

372
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,800
Where is the thing
I had you hold onto?

373
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,100
Ah, hold on.

374
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,800
If I think about how hard it was to
make this all the way out here...

375
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,100
Wow, great work.

376
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,460
Thank you.

377
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,060
I really hope this has
the power of divine spirits.

378
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:41,000
If you borrow the power
of the divine spirits

379
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,760
in your condition,
you won't be able to even walk.

380
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,160
Do you want to
not be able to walk forever?

381
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,960
Seeing as your nagging is getting
out of hand, I should leave.

382
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,000
What are you planning to do?

383
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,000
I have to finish
what I couldn't 18 years ago.

384
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,360
What?

385
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,160
I will finish him.

386
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,230
How are you going to do
that without weapons?

387
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,100
You'll just end up dead!

388
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,060
I will have the power
of the divine spirits.

389
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,960
If I don't finish him,
Bong-pal will be in danger.

390
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Bye now.

391
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:14,200
I hope you get married.
I'm leaving now.

392
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,600
You better not do anything stupid

393
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,960
if you care about your mother.

394
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,060
Get out.

395
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,560
Bong-pal, is it true?
Is that punk here?

396
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,630
Yes.

397
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,100
- Did you call the police?
- They should be on their way.

398
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,330
Bong-pal, I will go in by myself.

399
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,830
- You stay out here.
- No, I won't.

400
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,130
It happened because of me.

401
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,360
I will finish it.

402
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,700
You two stay here.

403
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,130
Excuse me, sir.
The subway has stopped running.

404
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,800
Sir, I said we're closed.
Please, leave.

405
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,430
There are buses outside.
Take the bus.

406
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,630
He must have
just passed through here.

407
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,030
Bong-pal!

408
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,100
Hyun-ji!

409
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,700
Hyun-ji!

410
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,600
Hyun-ji!

411
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,260
Kim Hyun-ji!

412
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,360
Hyun-ji!

413
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,260
Hyun-ji!

414
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,060
Bong-pal.

415
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,100
- You didn't see her?
- No.

416
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,300
If she's nowhere to be seen...

417
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Is this really the right place?

418
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,630
(Myongsung University)

419
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,600
It is.

420
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,300
Maybe she made a mistake because
it happened 5 years ago.

421
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,100
If not, this is one
of the evil spirit's tricks.

422
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,960
How can she vanish without a trace?

423
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,600
Five years ago? Five years...

424
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,330
If it happened five years ago,
we're at the wrong place.

425
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:44,060
If Hyun-ji came to
this station five years ago

426
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,100
this wasn't the same station then.

427
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,130
What do you mean
this wasn't the same station?

428
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,100
It means that
there was a fire five years ago.

429
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,600
They closed the station then
and rebuilt this station instead.

430
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,400
He's right. There was a fire...

431
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,160
- So where is the original station?
- It's…

432
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,630
It's maybe near Exit Two?

433
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,630
This feels very spooky.

434
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,360
Wait. We should wait for the police.

435
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,760
- That's right.
- Right?

436
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,660
True. You're right.

437
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,930
Bong-pal, be careful.

438
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,160
You too, Monk Myung-chul.

439
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,360
You've done your part.

440
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,800
I will let you rest now.

441
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,060
Hyun-ji!

442
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,360
I was going to come find you.

443
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:00,060
Thank you for coming to me first.

444
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,460
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for this moment?

445
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,960
If I hadn't been
driven out of your body...

446
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,530
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

447
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,130
Just wait a little bit longer.

448
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,430
You and I will become
one soon enough.

449
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,360
No, you can't!

450
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,360
Bong-pal!

451
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,630
Wicked spirit,
you're up to your wicked ways!

452
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:01,160
Bong-pal, Hyun-ji.
Are you two okay?

453
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,030
Hyun-ji, get Bong-pal
out of here. Hurry!

454
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,360
I won't let you do that.

455
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,000
Are you really going to kill me?

456
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,500
This man will end up dying as well.

457
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,300
It'd mean that you're taking a life.

458
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,200
Sure.

459
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,830
If I can end you, I shall do that.

460
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,130
Don't kill yourself over this.

461
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:54,360
I will end you today,
you, treacherous evil spirit.

462
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,000
You bastard!

463
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,460
This is why I told you
not to kill yourself over this.

464
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,300
Now, this is really over!

465
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,860
You bastard!

466
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,460
Monk Myung-chul. Are you okay?

467
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,560
Hyun-ji.

468
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,300
The weapon... the weapon...

469
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,930
You stop that!

470
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,730
Monk Myung-chul.

471
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,700
It's done. It's done.

472
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,030
Bong-pal. Bong-pal!

473
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,200
Hyun-ji, find the weapon!

474
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,860
It's the only thing
that will stop him, Hyun-ji.

475
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,060
Monk Myung-chul!

476
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,830
(Bring it on, Ghost)

477
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,760
Hyun-ji is leaving?

478
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:57,830
Why do you exorcise,
Monk Myung-chul?

479
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,230
Do you know why I was against
you exorcising when I found out?

480
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,700
It was because your eyes
were full of spite then.

481
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,230
- You remember these people, right?
- I killed them.

482
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,260
You can't see the world correctly
when you're filled with anger.

483
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,660
What is this?

484
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:13,530
She seems like a con artist!

485
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,900
Not all ghosts are bad.

486
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,230
They may deserve your sympathy.

487
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,230
I said get lost!

488
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,130
Can you really do this as a job?

489
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,600
It's up to you.

490
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,000
Isn't this place
a restaurant for rice and soup?

491
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,430
I'm Goo Dae-young, a sophomore
physical education major.

492
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,300
Nothing will make you happier
than making others happy.

00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,230
Hello, seniors.
I'm a freshman, Kim Hyun-ji.

495
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,360
I look forward to our time together!
