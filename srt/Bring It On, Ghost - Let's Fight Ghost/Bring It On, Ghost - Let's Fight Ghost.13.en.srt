Hyun-ji!

10
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,530
Hyun-ji, are you okay?
Wake up.

11
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Hyun-ji.

12
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,930
Someone help!
Is anyone here?

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,960
Hyun-ji.

Kim Hyun-ji?

16
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,360
Why is her student ID here?

17
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,560
- You're back, sir.
- You came back early.

18
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,900
Yes, the appointment was canceled.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,630
- Everything's fine?
- Yes.

20
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,460
Ah, sir.

21
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,430
Someone is here to see you.

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,160
Goodness, the professor is here.

23
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:57,500
This is not the bathroom.

24
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,400
- I think you're lost.
- No kidding.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,430
I went into the wrong room.

26
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,530
Excuse me then.

27
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,800
Monk.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,930
- Did you not come here to see me?
- Ah, yes.

29
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,200
I came to ask if Bong-pal
was doing well in school.

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
Is that so?

31
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,829
Yes. Bong-pal is doing very well.

32
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm glad to hear that.

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,200
That rascal is not very social
so I was a bit worried.

34
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,700
Monk.

35
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,900
Would you like to hear
something interesting?

36
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,460
Several days ago, I went down to
the countryside to rescue a cat.

37
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,100
I went to the site, and that cat was
trapped inside a small ventilator.

38
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,060
There was noise coming
from it so it probably went

39
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,600
inside out of curiosity.

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,360
But...

41
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,600
it went in so deep that
it couldn't get out.

42
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,200
Despite all the pain, that cat...

43
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:42,260
kept going inside deeper
and deeper to follow the noise.

44
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,900
So do you know what happened?

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Ultimately, it couldn't breathe...

46
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,030
and died a painful death.

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,730
That's not an interesting story.

48
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,230
You think so?

49
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,730
I thought it was.
And there's a lesson to be learned.

50
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm in no place
to give you any advice...

51
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,630
but let me give you some words
of wisdom from Buddha.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,600
He who delights in evil will never
be free from his grudge and hatred.

53
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,530
If you have a heart
filled with anger,

54
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,260
karma will come and get you someday.

55
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,600
- Thank you for the words of wisdom.
- You're welcome.

56
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:44,030
Please, keep that in mind.

57
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,730
You see, nothing and no one
is an exception to the rule.

58
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,659
Whether it's a beast or a ghost…

59
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,130
Sir.

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes?

61
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,330
Someone from animal protection
is here to see you.

62
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Oh, I see. I'll be right there.

63
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,700
Yes, sir.

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,060
Monk.

65
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,830
I'll keep your words in mind.

66
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,200
Goodbye.

67
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,300
- I'm sorry for coming by so late.
- That's okay.

68
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,600
- What's going on?
- Ah, well...

69
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,700
I want to ask you some questions
about what happened 18 years ago.

70
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,130
Is it true that
your husband died from an accident?

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,830
It's all in the past.
Why are you asking?

72
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,800
I believe that case has been closed.

73
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,760
I just found a couple of things
strange with the case.

74
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,830
You were inside the house with
your husband at that time, correct?

75
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

76
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,000
How could you not know about
the accident when it happened?

77
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,300
- I thought he went outside.
- Ah.

78
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,930
I went to the site of the
accident during the day earlier.

79
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,930
Your husband and I are
about the same height.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,030
When I was standing
out on the veranda

81
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,560
I noticed it would've been difficult
to fall over the railing

82
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,100
even by mistake.

83
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,760
What do you think?

84
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:40,299
I think someone pushed
him over from behind.

85
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,630
Professor Ju Hye-sung was also
inside the house at the time,

86
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,130
wasn't he?

87
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,260
What was he doing
during the accident?

88
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,830
Ma'am.

89
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,660
Please, leave now.
I have nothing more to say to you.

90
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,160
Ah.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,930
Well...

92
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,830
If I can ask you
one more question...

93
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,060
I'm sorry for bothering you.

94
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,630
Excuse me.

95
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,800
(Hanil University Hospital)

96
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,630
How is she doing?

97
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,560
Her breathing is stable
so there's nothing to worry about.

98
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,630
- She's fine, right?
- Yes.

99
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,930
She just had
a temporary mental shock.

100
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,630
She'll wake up once she's stable.

101
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

102
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,000
You may leave now.

103
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,200
Yes, ma'am.

104
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,860
Excuse me.

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,060
This is Hyun-ji's cell phone.

106
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,130
I'll be on my way.

107
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,700
Kim Hyun-ji?
Why is her student ID here?

108
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,830
Just how is she connected
to that punk?

109
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,630
(Kim Hyun-ji)

110
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,100
Please, go home now! Let me work!

111
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,500
- Please, help us, Detective.
- Yes, please, help us.

112
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,160
Seriously, you two
are driving me nuts!

113
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,460
- You're here.
- What's going on?

114
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,700
Excuse me, sir.
Detective, please help us.

115
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,430
Please catch the punk that
hurt our friend, Hyun-ji.

116
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,100
Who are these kids?

117
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,660
They've been here for hours begging
me to catch a hit-and-run criminal.

118
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,200
- That's enough.
- Wait.

119
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,530
You guys are the kids
from the cyberbullying case.

120
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,700
He remembers us!

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,830
But we were not the bullies.

122
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,960
We called you in the afternoon, too.

123
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,700
Were you the ones
who called me 11 times?

124
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,260
- Yes.
- Yes.

125
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,160
- Tell me what the case is about.
- Yes, so…

126
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,900
I have a really beautiful friend.

127
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,260
She's like an angel.

128
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,700
Nothing like that. What's her name?

129
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,330
Her name is Kim Hyun-ji and she was
a victim of a hit-and-run accident.

130
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,730
She was in a coma for five years
and woke up not too long ago.

131
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,930
She's awake,
but she doesn't remember anything.

132
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,260
I feel so bad for her
and Bong-pal, Detective.

133
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,930
It's very important that
you catch the criminal.

134
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Please catch the culprit, Detective.

135
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,260
It's the hit-and-run accident that
happened five years ago

136
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,660
in Seokjeong-dong.

137
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,760
I contacted traffic control
and there were no witnesses.

138
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,000
- The case was suspended.
- It was suspended?

139
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,100
The case was suspended?

140
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,160
My friend is in the hospital
struggling to regain her memories…

141
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,130
Okay, I got the gist of it.
You can go home now.

142
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,460
No, I will not go home!

143
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,430
Detective, I request
a reinvestigation...

144
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,660
If you guys keep this up,
I'm going to charge you for

145
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,000
obstruction and detain you!

146
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,100
Then we'll wait for you to call us.

147
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,400
Please, promise us that
you'll reinvestigate the case...

148
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,730
Look, that's not up to us, okay?

149
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,730
There's no proper witness!

150
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,260
I swear, how many times
must I repeat this to you?

151
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,230
Come here and get them out of here!

152
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,660
Go.

153
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,560
- Just a moment, please.
- In-rang, that's enough.

154
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,930
No, wait a minute!

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,960
Detective,
you have to catch that punk! Please!

156
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,430
I request a reinvestigation!
Detective, a reinvestigation!

157
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,060
Please, reconsider.

158
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,860
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

159
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,430
By the way, the chief
wants to see you tomorrow.

160
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,100
- Why?
- Why do you think?

161
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,700
You keep digging stuff up on
Professor Ju Hye-sung

162
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,430
and he's noticed.

163
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,900
Nothing is going my way
and I keep getting complaints.

164
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,400
Bong-pal.

165
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,700
Bong-pal!

166
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,000
Bong-pal!

167
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,130
Bong-pal.

168
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Bong-pal.

169
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,300
Why did you drink so much?

170
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,100
Well, I just wanted to.

171
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,960
- Bong-pal.
- Yes?

172
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,830
Come here and give me a kiss.

173
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,330
What's the matter with you?
You're grossing me out!

174
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,300
You gave me so many kisses when
you were this little. Come here.

175
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
Forget it! I'm not a child anymore.

176
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,130
- What?
- I'm not a child.

177
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,360
Come and lie down.

178
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,730
Goodness, you've gotten big.

179
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,830
- You're all grown up.
- I'll get you some tea.

180
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,460
No, that's okay.

181
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,900
No, tea. How about a cup of water?
Get me a cup of water.

182
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,930
Oh goodness.

183
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,400
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:48,360
Bong-pal, I'm sorry.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,030
Bong-pal, I'm sorry.

186
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,300
Mom.

187
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,030
- You're awake?
- Yes.

188
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,260
- And you're fine?
- Yes, I'm fine.

189
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,200
You mean it?

190
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,130
Speak up if something
doesn't feel right, okay?

191
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,430
Okay.

192
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,900
What happened?
Why did you suddenly pass out?

193
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't know.

194
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,360
I saw something scary and I think
I fainted from the shock of it.

195
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,600
But what about Bong-pal?
Did he leave?

196
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,330
You don't know what kind of
person he is. Don't get too close.

197
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,900
- Why? He's a good person.
- How do you know that?

198
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,360
The world is a scary place.

199
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,430
Mom.

200
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,359
- You weren't mean to him, were you?
- What?

201
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:11,000
- What would I possibly say to him?
- Don't be mean to him.

202
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,060
He has nothing to do
with me passing out.

203
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,160
If anything, he helped me.

204
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,500
Let's not talk about him anymore.

205
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,760
I'm going to go see the doctor.

206
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,030
Can you be alone for a moment?

207
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,600
Yes.

208
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,860
Bong-pal!

209
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,330
Are you okay?

210
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,600
What did I see that time?

211
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,560
Was it a ghost?

212
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,730
Why did I call for Bong-pal?

213
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,500
Did we really know each other?

214
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,630
Oh, I don't know.

215
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,060
(Amnesia)

216
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,830
(Are you okay?)

217
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,930
(My love Bong Bong)

218
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,830
Are you okay?

219
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,560
When did he change his caller ID?

220
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,460
Yes, I feel much better now.

221
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,730
That's a relief. I was worried.

222
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,260
Yeah right.

223
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,730
Thanks for saving me earlier.
Did you get hurt?

224
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,060
I'm fine.

225
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm glad to hear that,
but what did I see?

226
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,530
I'll tell you later.

227
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,730
Okay.

228
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,830
I'm being discharged tomorrow.
You can come if you want to.

229
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,700
Okay, I'll come.

230
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,900
(Good night)

231
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,660
Good night.

232
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,400
You too.

233
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,800
Do you know what time it is?
Hurry up and go to bed.

234
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,660
- Okay. After I send this.
- That's enough.

235
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm not a kid. Give it back.

236
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,000
You're not a kid,
but you're still a patient.

237
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,130
If I see you messing with your
cell phone late at night again

238
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,230
I'm really going to confiscate it.

239
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,630
Fine.

240
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,530
Good night, mom. Bye.

241
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,460
Good night.

242
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,230
(Did you get hurt?/I'm fine)

243
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,630
(I'm being discharged tomorrow.
You can come if you want to)

244
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,760
(Okay, I'll come/Good night)

245
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,460
Bong-pal, are you sleeping?

246
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,160
No, not yet.

247
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,600
What were you doing?

248
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,130
I'm just here. Aren't you sleeping?
It's after 2:00 a.m.

249
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,630
I'm going to sleep in a little bit.

250
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,600
When are you being
discharged tomorrow?

251
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,800
In the morning.

252
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,730
(You too. Sleep well)

253
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,960
(Sleep well)

254
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,300
Monk Myung-chul.

255
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,030
Monk Myung-chul.

256
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,660
I made some
bean sprout soup. Eat it.

257
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,200
Where are you going this morning?

258
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,430
To the hospital.
Hyun-ji is being discharged.

259
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,260
I see.

260
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,760
That's good to hear.

261
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,200
- Tell her congratulations.
- Sure. I'll see you later.

262
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,800
Okay.

263
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,730
I'm not sure if it's okay for those
two to continue to see each other.

264
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,400
Welcome.

265
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,860
- Is it a gift for someone?
- Yes.

266
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,630
Your girlfriend?

267
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Yes.

268
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,630
Would you like to see this product?

269
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,730
- Yes.
- Sure.

270
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,330
Here you go.

271
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,060
It's a necklace that means certain
people are destined to meet.

272
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,860
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

273
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:34,900
Excuse me.

274
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,260
Hello.

275
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,630
By any chance, did you
come to see Hyun-ji?

276
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,700
Yes. I heard she's
being discharged today.

277
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm sorry, but just go back.

278
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,560
- Excuse me?
- I don't know what

279
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,460
your relationship is with her,
but I don't like you coming here.

280
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,200
Hyun-ji passed out while
she was with you yesterday.

281
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,200
It's been five years
since she woke up.

282
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,460
Yesterday's incident
can never happen again.

283
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,760
- I'm sorry.
- Please, leave.

284
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,730
The results... are very good.

285
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,530
- You can leave.
- Yes!

286
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,930
Mom, I can go home!

287
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,260
But what about
her fainting yesterday?

288
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,060
That's called vasovagal syncope.

289
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,330
Hyun-ji was in a coma
for a very long time

290
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,360
so it's hard to say
that she's mentally stable.

291
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,500
In instances like that, when
a sudden emotional change occurs...

292
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,830
something like yesterday can
happen due to sensory overload.

293
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,460
What should we do if something
like that happens again?

294
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,660
Vasovagal syncope occurs frequently
in even normal young adults.

295
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,160
I wouldn't worry too much.

296
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,060
As long as you continue your
treatment, you shouldn't experience

297
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,700
what you did yesterday again.

298
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,030
You must come twice a week for
mental and physical therapy.

299
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,730
- Yes.
- Hello.

300
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,230
- I'm a little late.
- You're here.

301
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,760
Professor Ju will be in charge
of Ms. Hyun-ji's psychotherapy.

302
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,900
- Hello.
- Congratulations on your discharge.

303
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
Thank you.

304
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,460
He's a veterinary professor
who helps us out

305
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,830
in the psychology department.

306
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,960
He's very popular in
the animal therapy field.

307
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,200
- Oh.
- He's quite a busy person

308
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,930
but he personally volunteered
to take Ms. Hyun-ji on

309
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,260
once he heard her story.

310
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,730
Thank you.
You also helped us out last time.

311
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,130
I can't believe
we're meeting like this again.

312
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,130
- Not at all.
- Do you two know each other?

313
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
That's perfect.

314
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,960
What about her father?

315
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,730
He's busy, but he'll
be home later tonight.

316
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,900
What should we do with
all her belongings?

317
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,500
I'll help her since
she's also my patient now.

318
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,830
That's great then.

319
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,160
Your recovery will
be faster the sooner

320
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,230
you get to know one another.

321
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,230
Well, you don't
really have to do that, but

322
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,960
if you insist on helping us out...

323
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,960
- Mom.
- What?

324
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,630
He said he'll help us.
It would be rude to refuse him.

325
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,900
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's correct.

326
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
- Thank you for everything.
- Thank you.

327
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,360
- We're going to get going.
- Take it easy.

328
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,660
- Goodbye.
- Let's go.

329
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,600
What the heck? He said he'd come,
but he's not here.

330
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,360
What did you say?

331
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,800
It's nothing.

332
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,630
Okay, I'm going to drive now.

333
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,460
You're home.

334
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,300
Yes. Are you leaving?

335
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,660
Yes, I'm going to
step out for a bit.

336
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,230
I thought you were going to the
hospital. Why are you back so early?

337
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,800
Just because.

338
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,600
Isn't that Hyun-ji's discharge gift?

339
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,830
I'll give it to her next time.

340
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,260
- Did her memories return?
- No.

341
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,700
I don't think she remembers
the time when she was a ghost.

342
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,100
Bong-pal.

343
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,600
I shouldn't say this for your sake.

344
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,660
But it might be better if
her memories don't return.

345
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,930
What?

346
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,360
What good is it to remember
her time as a ghost?

347
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,100
She would be so scared if
she knew she was near death.

348
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,030
I'm sure every day was a nightmare
being near those dangerous ghosts.

349
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,230
It's better not to remember.

350
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,130
She's human now.
She deserves to have a normal life.

351
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,230
You don't know how it will affect
her if she finds out the truth.

352
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,200
It will be difficult for you

353
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,960
but I don't think it's a bad idea
for you to help her live a new life.

354
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,430
In order for Hyun-ji to move on, you
need to let go of her hand first.

355
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,030
I'll be back.

356
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,030
I'll see you later.

357
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,160
- Have your memories returned?
- No, not yet.

358
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,460
I can't believe you went there.

359
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,100
- Where?
- Someone asked her to do a favor.

360
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,830
She went to some unknown
academy and got into a car accident

361
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,860
right in front of it.

362
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,900
Just from whom and what kind
of favor did you agree to do?

363
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,730
I don't know. I don't remember.

364
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,630
Anyway, I don't know who it was

365
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,700
but it was all for nothing
and that person ruined your life.

366
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,400
It's your fault, too!
You're too kind for your own good.

367
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,400
You're always helping people out.

368
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,930
Why did you go all the
way to Seoul to do that?

369
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,230
It's good to be kind.

370
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,900
Oh please!

371
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,200
Anyway, that's another story,
but the hit-and-run culprit

372
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,500
is even worse.

373
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,060
I hope that evil jerk
gets what he deserves.

374
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,360
I'm going to leave now.

375
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,330
Thank you. We were able to come
home comfortably because of you.

376
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,330
I would love to treat
you to a hot cup of tea.

377
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
- I feel so bad.
- We can do it next time.

378
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,130
I'll call you to
schedule our appointments.

379
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,960
- Yes, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

380
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,830
Drive safely.

381
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,960
Wow, he is one decent guy.

382
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,600
- I told you he's pretty cool.
- I know.

383
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,500
- Is this place our home now?
- No.

384
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,600
We lived here temporarily
because of you.

385
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,160
Let's pack up and leave soon.
Your father has been by himself.

386
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,160
Okay.

387
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,130
- All the boxes are still here.
- Of course.

388
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,900
How could I unpack when you were
lying in the hospital like that?

389
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,430
You should go to your room.

390
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,230
I made sure it is
in perfect condition.

391
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,460
- It's on the second floor.
- Really?

392
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,730
Wow, it's exactly like my old room.

393
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,500
Oh my, what's all this?

394
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,260
It's so pretty.

395
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,400
So cute.

396
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,730
Mom.

397
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,360
- What do you think? Like it?
- Yes.

398
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:01,300
We bought all these
one by one on your birthdays.

399
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,460
We prayed you'd wear them
when you wake up.

400
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,900
- Thank you, mom.
- Don't be silly.

401
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,930
I'm even more thankful.

402
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:13,000
- Come back out when you're done.
- I will.

403
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,660
Thanks, mom.

404
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,160
You must have worried
so much because of me.

405
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,160
I will be a very good daughter.

406
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,100
I will study hard and go to college.

407
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,200
I will get a job
and give you money, too.

408
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,800
I don't need you to do any of that.
Just don't get sick.

409
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,560
That's all I need.

410
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,930
No, I will do everything for you
that I couldn't do before.

411
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,600
I will kiss you this much, too.

412
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,630
You're too big to do that.

413
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
I know you like it.

414
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,130
Stop it.

415
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,260
It's now clear that
you had it all this time.

416
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,360
What? Reinvestigation?

417
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,000
It's been years
since the case was closed.

418
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,000
You two have a lot of time
on your hands, huh?

419
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,500
If you have all this time,
catch up on all your other work.

420
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
Am I making myself clear?

421
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,500
Don't even say a word. I can't
stand you right now so leave.

422
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,830
Get out!

423
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,460
How could you tell him
that you want to reinvestigate

424
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,960
the case out of the blue?

425
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,000
Well, he wouldn't let me
do it even if I ask nicely.

426
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,760
It wouldn't have changed anything.

427
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,699
I only did that because
he asked me for a report.

428
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,630
Then will you continue
to investigate the case?

429
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:57,360
I have to. Two people, Noh Hyun-joo
and Lee Min-soo, were killed.

430
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,730
We can't just let it go.

431
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,160
What happened 18 years ago
is also suspicious.

432
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,400
I understand, but based on what?

433
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,360
So we will investigate
until we find the evidence.

434
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,160
He's so stubborn.

435
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,160
(Hyun-ji)

436
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,530
What are you doing?

437
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,760
Why isn't he responding?

438
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,930
What are you doing, huh?

439
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You should be studying at this hour.

440
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,960
What have you been doing
since last night, huh?

441
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,160
Your grandma would be
thrilled to see this.

442
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,300
Don't you feel bad for
Bong-pal and Hyun-ji?

443
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,630
I feel bad. I do.

444
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,460
If you just post things online,
who is going to read it?

445
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,430
People do!

446
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,030
It's been read by one person.
It was me just now.

447
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
I should do something.

448
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,900
How about you?
Do you have a plan?

449
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,730
I do. I do have a plan.

450
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,000
Delivery!
Is Choi Chun-sang here?

451
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,230
Perfect timing.

452
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,460
Wow, it's amazing.

453
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,800
We have no money
because we can't exorcise

454
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,330
and yet you buy something?

455
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,160
Then are you going to wipe with
your hands in the bathroom

456
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,200
because you're poor?

457
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,600
There are bare necessities in life.

458
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,330
This is toilet paper and tissues.

459
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,930
Wow, these are
some bare necessities.

460
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,560
They are for our leisure.

461
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,760
Anyway, that's not what's important.

462
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,960
Where could it be?

463
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,200
Here it is.

464
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,460
Hey, hold this.

465
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,700
- Hold it.
- What is it?

466
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,500
Walk three steps backward.

467
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,500
One, two. One, two.

468
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,600
Do it right. You will be
surprised when you see it.

469
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,830
Ta-da!

470
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,130
(Looking for a Witness!)

471
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,400
Usually witnesses
of hit-and-run cases

472
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,260
tend to travel around
the site of the accident.

473
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,400
Posting online like
you did won't work.

474
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:55,030
We should hang this
where people walk by.

475
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,830
We will mention
the reward money, too.

476
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,230
I already had a couple
of these made.

477
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,230
- We will go and hang them all over.
- Wow, Chun-sang.

478
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:10,360
- You're so cool.
- You punk!

479
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,630
It's me, Chun-sang, punk.

480
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Bong-pal.

481
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,230
Are you on your way to class?

482
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,360
Yes, where are you two off to?

483
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,030
- To hang this.
- What is it?

484
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,430
It's a banner looking
for Hyun-ji's hit-and-run driver.

485
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,930
Chun-sang got this all ready.

486
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,230
- Have you talked to her?
- Yes.

487
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,800
- Are her memories back yet?
- Not yet.

488
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,800
I hope she gets
her memory back soon...

489
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,230
I'd love all four of us to
hang out together like before.

490
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:20,960
That's Bong-pal.

491
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,730
Park Bong-pal.

492
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,460
Ah, it's Hyun-ji.

493
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,260
- Wow, she's so pretty.
- Why did she come here?

494
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:34,730
- Did she get her memory back?
- I don't know.

495
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,300
- Why are you ignoring my text?
- Sorry. I didn't see it.

496
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,400
By the way,
what brings you here to school?

497
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,100
I came to sit in on
Professor Ju's lecture.

498
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,900
Professor Ju?

499
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,160
- Animals and Society?
- Do you also take that class?

500
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,600
Amazing. Where is the lecture hall?

501
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,960
Come with me.

502
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,060
- I'm going to head out.
- Okay, go on then.

503
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,400
Hi there.

504
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,930
Hello.

505
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,260
She doesn't seem to
have her memory back, does she?

506
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:11,430
No. By the way, why is Bong-pal
acting that way with Hyun-ji?

507
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,000
I want my Hyun-ji to be happy.

508
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,930
My heart started to beat fast...

509
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,860
Who are they?

510
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,360
- They are my seniors.
- I see.

511
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,000
They're not my type, but they do
look familiar for some reason.

512
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,000
By the way...

513
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,130
how do you know Professor Ju?

514
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,030
He's helping me with
my psychotherapy treatment.

515
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,600
- I met him at the hospital.
- Did you?

516
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,700
- You're here.
- Hello, Professor Ju.

517
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,200
Oh, I'm glad you found the way okay.

518
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,960
- Are you okay to come out today?
- Yes.

519
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,830
Even my doctor told me
to not stay home all day.

520
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
He told me I should
practice walking a lot.

521
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,430
I didn't realize it at the hospital,

522
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,000
but you sure look like
a college student now.

523
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,460
I do?

524
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:13,200
By the way, do you two
know each other?

525
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,900
Well, we know
each other a little bit.

526
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,830
I see.

527
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,400
- Then shall we go in?
- Sure.

528
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:24,400
About my lecture today...

529
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,030
- Hope you like the class.
- Thank you.

530
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,630
- Bong-pal, hi.
- Hi, Seo-yeon.

531
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
Who is she?

532
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,060
- She's sitting in today.
- Ah.

533
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

534
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,560
She's just sitting in?

535
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,200
Didn't he say
I was his girlfriend last time?

536
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,300
Are you hurt?

537
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,800
What happened? Are you hurt?

538
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,700
I just got a tiny scratch.

539
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,060
It doesn't look tiny.

540
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,900
It's okay.

541
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,200
Did he get injured because of me?

542
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,530
Animals also have the right
not to be tortured.

543
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,000
Let's look at a toy for an example.

544
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,630
If you step on a toy
and break it by accident,

545
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,930
you would apologize
to the owner of the toy.

546
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,160
But you don't feel
sorry for the toy.

547
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,860
Until now, we didn't give
animals proper rights.

548
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:50,660
We considered animals the same
as toys, rocks, and plants...

549
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,530
Lift it a bit higher.

550
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,700
Higher.

551
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,900
Tie it a bit tighter.

552
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,430
Come on.

553
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,260
Shall I pull it tighter?

554
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,600
- You tied it?
- I did.

555
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,700
Pull it now.

556
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,800
Excuse me. What do you
think you're doing here?

557
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,300
You can't be doing this, seriously.

558
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,700
Did you get permission
from the police station?

559
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,130
Are we supposed to get permission?

560
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,400
- No.
- This is just too much.

561
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,160
What's all this, huh?

562
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,560
(Looking for a Witness!)

563
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,800
Are there too many?

564
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,130
Can you please try to investigate?

565
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,000
How can I just take
your word and investigate?

566
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,030
You will find something
only if you investigate.

567
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,900
Ju Hye-sung, a veterinary professor
at Myongsung University.

568
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,500
- You will find something.
- Please leave.

569
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,930
Conduct an investigation.
You will find something. Please!

570
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,160
Hello.

571
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,260
You're the detective
who released Bong-pal last time.

572
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:04,260
- How are you?
- Hi.

573
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,460
We've met before.

574
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,760
By the way, what is it?

575
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:11,560
(Ju Hye-sung, veterinary
professor at Myongsung University)

576
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,160
How do you know Professor Ju?

577
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,730
Do you also know him?

578
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,000
Are you saying Professor Ju
has Kim Hyun-ji's belongings?

579
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,460
That's what I'm saying.

580
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,160
That's why he's the one.

581
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,760
At the scene of the accident,
her belongings weren't found.

582
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,860
It was because he took them all.

583
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:34,630
Even so, without any evidence,
we can't start the investigation.

584
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,600
You should head back for now.
We will be in touch.

585
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,260
It's better to start
the investigation soon.

586
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,560
Hello, detectives.

587
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,930
What's with them?

588
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,730
We got a call about them
hanging banners illegally.

589
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,500
The vendors caught these students.

590
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,260
They said they knew you
so I brought them here.

591
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,260
Good work. You can go.

592
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,230
A banner? What is it about?

593
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,430
A hit-and-run case?

594
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,500
Go home.

595
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,300
This case is proceeding
in an interesting way.

596
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:22,930
Go get the case file
from the transportation department.

597
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,630
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,260
We'll get going then.

599
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,860
Wait!

600
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,860
Anything you want to tell us?

601
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,130
You attend Myongsung, don't you?

602
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,960
- You rude punks!
- Why are you doing this?

603
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,100
- Do you know Professor Ju Hye-sung?
- Professor Ju Hye-sung?

604
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,230
Ah, he's a veterinary professor
at our school.

605
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,060
Then can I ask you to do me a favor?

606
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,760
We'll wrap up here for today.
Thank you.

607
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

608
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,430
- Bong-pal.
- Hyun-ji.

609
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,400
How did you like my class?
Did you like it?

610
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,830
- Yes, I liked it.
- Did you?

611
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,430
A lot of students were dozing off.

612
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,900
Were they? I thought it was fun.

613
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,600
I'm glad you liked it.

614
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,860
If you're free now,
maybe we can go eat together?

615
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:38,800
We can also schedule
our next appointment.

616
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,560
Can we do that next time?
I just have things to do today.

617
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,400
Do you? That's too bad.

618
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,400
- I will call you then.
- Sure. Thank you.

619
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,960
Professor Ju.

620
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,260
Well, I have something
to talk to you about.

621
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,730
You said you wanted to tell
me something. What is it?

622
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,760
It is...
I'm graduating after this semester.

623
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:14,460
So I won't have much
time to see you.

624
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,430
That's why...

625
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,760
Go on.

626
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,430
I like you, Professor Ju.

627
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,430
I've liked you ever since I met you.

628
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:34,130
I'm sorry.

629
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,860
I wonder if I led you on.

630
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:43,400
If I acted inappropriately,
I apologize.

631
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,200
No, I'm the one
who started liking you first…

632
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,060
Thank you for the sentiment.

633
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:54,830
Then.

634
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,200
This.

635
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:20,600
Hey, why did you leave
without saying anything?

636
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,460
You were talking to Professor Ju.

637
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,200
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

638
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,500
- No?
- No.

639
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
- Bong-pal.
- Yes?

640
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,530
Have I been here before?

641
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,730
I told you that
you followed me around.

642
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,500
I still can't believe that,
but this place is familiar.

643
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,630
Ah, I need to go now.

644
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,960
- Where?
- To see my friends.

645
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:42,860
- Your friends?
- Yes.

646
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,960
Some of my high school friends
live in Seoul.

647
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,830
They will help me take the GED.

648
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,060
- Will they?
- Yes.

649
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,900
I'm going to get really busy soon.

650
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,960
After taking the GED, I'll need to
take my college entrance exams

651
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:58,800
and find a job…

652
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,660
Take it easy. Why rush?

653
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,660
I'm five years behind
compared to everyone else.

654
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,730
I will have to try
five times harder.

655
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,800
I want to get my life back together.

656
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,130
I lost so much all those years.

657
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,360
There are a lot
of things I want to try.

658
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,230
Hi, Min-ji. Are you here already?

659
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,400
Okay. I will be right there.

660
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,160
- Bong-pal, I need to go.
- Have fun.

661
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,860
See you next time. I will text you.

662
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,300
It will be difficult for you

663
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,330
but I don't think it's a bad idea
for you to help her live a new life.

664
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,230
In order for Hyun-ji to move on,

665
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,760
you need to let go
of her hand first.

666
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,960
Let's get together more often.

667
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,300
Seo-yeon.

668
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,960
Hi, Bong-pal.

669
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:59,900
- Did something happen?
- No, no reason.

670
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,300
Stop drinking. You've had enough.

671
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,630
- I'm okay.
- Stop drinking.

672
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,330
I'm okay.

673
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,830
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine. I'm going to wash up…

674
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,400
See you next time. Bye.

675
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,000
(Pharmacy)

676
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,730
(Hyun-ji)

677
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,960
- Where are you?
- Hello?

678
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,260
Hello?

679
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,330
This is Bong-pal's cell phone.

680
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,400
Seo-yeon, get up.
I will take you home.

681
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,360
- Hyun-ji.
- Hello.

682
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,760
Hello. There is a cab outside
that brought me here.

683
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,860
Take that home.

684
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,060
Let's go, Bong-pal.

685
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,230
- What's with you?
- What do you mean?

686
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,030
You said you liked me
and that you were my boyfriend.

687
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,000
Then why do you keep
changing your mind?

688
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,430
It bothers me.

689
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,400
- It bothers you?
- Of course, it bothers me.

690
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,760
- Really?
- Yes, it just bothers me.

691
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,100
You being with another
girl bothers me.

692
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,500
You're smiling?
How can you smile now?

693
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,500
When a man loves a woman,
he should follow through.

694
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,300
You shouldn't do this.

695
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,960
Even if I don't remember you,

696
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:21,800
you should find a way
and try anything...

697
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,900
You pervert!

698
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,860
Don't ever call me again!

699
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,500
Hey.

700
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:46,560
You should at least apply
the ointment before you leave...

701
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,360
I can't believe you asked
me to apply the ointment.

702
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,100
Ouch! It hurts.

703
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,300
What do you mean it hurts?
I'm applying it so gently.

704
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,400
- All done.
- Ouch!

705
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,000
- You're grateful, right?
- I'm grateful.

706
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,660
It's late, but I wanted
to congratulate you

707
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,200
on coming home from the hospital.

708
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,060
What is it?

709
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,960
It's a necklace.

710
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,230
I'll put it on for you.

711
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:23,460
Then are we officially
going out now?

712
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,430
Well, it depends on
how you behave...

713
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,400
I will behave.

714
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,700
See what happens
if you're seen with another girl.

715
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,960
It won't happen again.

716
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,730
You're the only one for me.

717
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,630
Get home safe.

718
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,030
See you tomorrow.

719
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:48,030
Good night.

720
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:50,360
You have a good night, too.

721
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,400
- What took you so long?
- I told you I'd see friends today.

722
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:42,030
- Can you be here alone for a bit?
- Sure.

723
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,500
I'm not a little kid. Why ask?

724
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,400
I'm going over to your uncle's.

725
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:50,430
- Lock up, okay?
- I will.

726
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,760
- Wait, mom.
- Yes?

727
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:57,330
- Get me ice cream on your way home.
- You got it.

728
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,930
- See you later.
- See you later.

729
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,930
Sir, what are you looking at?

730
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,360
I'm looking at the record
of the cars Ju has had.

731
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:37,430
A white car was seen
at the hit-and-run scene, right?

732
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,630
Yes, it was a white sedan.

733
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,630
No other information was available.

734
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:47,830
Ju drove a white car five years ago.

735
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,130
- He did?
- On August 25th, 2011

736
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,600
- he scrapped it.
- Hold on.

737
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,900
- That's 2 days after the accident.
- That's right.

738
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,160
What interesting timing…

739
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:20,060
(Kim Hyun-ji)

740
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,960
Bong-pal.

741
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,630
Hyun-ji, what's wrong?
What happened?

742
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,600
Bong-pal.

743
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,800
What should I do now?

744
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,630
What I saw at the hospital
wasn't a one-time thing…

745
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,460
I can see ghosts.

746
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,500
She's human now.

747
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,500
She deserves to have a normal life.

748
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,430
You don't know how it will affect
her if she finds out the truth.

749
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,160
- Hyun-ji.
- What should I do now?

750
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,330
Don't worry.

751
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:32,330
No matter what happens

752
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,330
I will protect you.

753
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,460
(Bring it on, Ghost)

754
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,000
Now Hyun-ji can see ghosts.

755
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,160
If a ghost attacks you this way...

756
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,800
Let's practice
as if it's a real situation.

757
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,560
How did you get to know Bong-pal?

758
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,160
- It was like fate.
- I miss you.

759
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,760
I don't want her to
live like me so please, help.

760
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:53,460
He's not after Bong-pal next, is he?

761
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:54,260
What's wrong?

762
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,460
I thought I got my memory
back from the accident.

763
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,130
- Is he Park Ji-hoon?
- You go alone.

764
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,300
Bong-pal!

765
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,600
- Where are we going?
- It's kind of far from here.

766
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,800
- Help Hyun-ji before me.
- You punk.

767
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,300
You bastard!

768
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,030
Don't be afraid.

769
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,800
I will always be with you.
