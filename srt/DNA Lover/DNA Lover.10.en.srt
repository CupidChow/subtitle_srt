(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,309
I'm going to break up with you,

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,149
and I plan to hang up in 30 seconds.

11
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:46,350
Love is a game where the one who keeps their distance wins.

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,719
That's what I believed.

13
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,460
So Jin!

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,400
We finally connected.

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,939
Our telepathy.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
Until I met that weird woman.

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,109
This woman...

18
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,450
keeps making me want to lose.

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,049
I'll be going now.

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,620
Hang on, So Jin.

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,590
What?

22
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,390
Haven't you forgotten something?

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,359
I'm sure there is.

24
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,040
I love you, Yeon Woo.

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,650
I said, "I love you."

26
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,219
Very much.

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,560
Oh, so...

28
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:04,530
I think you forgot...

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,098
this in the car.

30
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,699
By the way, what is this?

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,869
This is a call button, right?

32
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,800
When you push this at restaurants, you call the server.

33
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,139
Give me that.

34
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,080
I'll see you at the meeting, So Jin.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm not going to see you.

36
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,849
Get inside safely.

37
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,830
I'm standing at the crossroads of that choice now.

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,909
You're home, honey.

(Shinsung Middle School)

41
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,740
Don't ever say that you love someone...

42
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,180
in a careless way when you grow up.

43
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,319
Live freely instead.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,319
Don't cut down...

45
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,099
someone else's life like your father did.

46
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,539
From what I saw, at the end of love,

47
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,509
there was never any happiness.

(Episode 10: A Hurdle)

49
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:25,439
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

50
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,610
What if you got into an accident while acting so rashly?

51
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,138
Don't you know that your oxygen mask is your lifeline, you punk?

52
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,980
How can you give that to someone else?

53
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,779
It was a studio apartment and we put out the fire quickly. It was fine.

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,888
What was fine about that?

55
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,250
Look at yourself right now.

56
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,259
I don't know what's going on with you lately,

57
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,229
but if you're going to act however you want like this,

58
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,560
take off that uniform right now.

59
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,370
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon.

60
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,500
Seo Kang Hoon!

61
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,379
- I'm back. - Hey.

62
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,180
Hey, why are you walking like that?

63
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,720
Did you get hurt?

64
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,319
No.

65
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,589
What about dinner?

66
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,129
I'm not hungry.

67
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:25,829
Goodness, my son's face looks so gaunt.

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,370
Hey, just sit down for now. Sit.

69
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,639
Slt.

70
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,949
I said I wouldn't eat.

71
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,819

72
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,399
Something is wrong, isn't it?

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,300
No.

74
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,939
Your face looks like you've been rejected by a girl.

75
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Hey, is it that woman who brought that book last time?

76
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,810
No.

77
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,449
Goodness.

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,449
Kang Hoon, when you meet a good partner, you have no regrets.

79
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,790
I may not have lived happily with your mom forever,

80
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,388
but I live with good memories.

81
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,500
(Always by your side)

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,660
You should meet someone like that too.

83
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,829
Someone who leaves no regrets.

84
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:39,169
I'll manage on my own.

85
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,539
Goodness! If you can manage on your own,

86
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,709
why are you like this for 29 years?

87
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,540
Seriously?

88
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,518
Anyway, once you're done eating, go outside and tell So Jin to stop.

89
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,649
She's been running around for the past few hours already.

90
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,589
(Always Sushi)

91
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:03,089
Goodness.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,040
No, I can't do it.

93
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,019
I love you, Yeon Woo.

94
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,889
I said, "I love you." Very much.

95
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,529
But the more I think about it, the weirder it is.

96
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,739
His girlfriend told him that she loved him.

97
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,909
Not only once but twice.

98
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,410
What was wrong with his reaction?

99
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,509
"I love you too." "I love you even more." No.

100
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,209
"I do too."

101
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,379
Are those words so hard to say?

102
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,990
Let's forget it.

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,629
Breathe. Slowly.

104
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,839
One, two.

105
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,269
One, two, three.

106
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,079
This one is for you, Jang Fox.

107
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,220
"Hello, I'm a 37-year-old man who's polyamorous."

108
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,389
"Recently, I started living with my girlfriend who's also polyamorous."

109
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,620
"But it's becoming harder to hear about my girlfriend's dating life."

110
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,629
"Does my jealousy prove that I'm not polyamorous?"

111
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,669
"Or am I changing because I like this woman so much?"

112
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,638
Why not try coaching this guy?

113
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,700
A man and woman who were in a non-monogamous relationship met,

114
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,638
but one person's dating philosophy has changed.

115
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,509
But why would they live together?

116
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,279
They can just split up.

117
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,850
What's with that face? That's so not like you.

118
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,649
I guess he can't do that like he wants to.

119
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,259
He has found out how much he loves that person.

120
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,529
How could he break up with her?

121
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,399
If something feels happy,

122
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,399
one's dating philosophy could change at any time.

123
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,470
Does Jang Fox have a new consent?

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,080
So Ri, it's not "consent." It's "concept."

125
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,549
I know. I said "concept."

126
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:08,950
What...

127
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,519
Are you a visiting salesman for cosmetics?

128
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,779
If I leave a bunch of stuff here,

129
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,490
I'd come here to wash up, at least.

130
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:19,919
If that happens,

131
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,299
I figure I'd work out, even if it's not by choice.

132
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,100
Goodness, that darned poster.

133
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,570
Oh, my. You work so hard in life.

134
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,669
Goodness.

135
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,840
Goodness.

136
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,639
Oh, dear.

137
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,240
Sung Mi, tell me our workout of the day.

138
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,908
Okay, then. If you haven't warmed up yet,

139
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:19,319
- we'll start with 50 jumping jacks. - Okay.

140
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,950
Ready, go!

141
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,189
- Two, three. - One.

142
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,059
- One, two, three. - Two.

143
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,159
After you're done with the jumping jacks, 30 burpees.

144
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,899
Burpees?

145
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,000
Or not. Let's just do 15.

146
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,799
Oh, okay.

147
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,539
All right. Jumping jacks. Start again!

148
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,210
Darn it.

149
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,149
Oh, dear.

150
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,659
Goodness.

151
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,529
- Jung Tam. - Yes, thank you.

152
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:04,428
You should rest for a while,

153
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:08,129
and you can just stick with the regular workout at the gym.

154
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,110
- Then, what about the poster... - Does that matter right now?

155
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,610
I think I gave you too hard a workout out of my own greed.

156
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,610
I...

157
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,220
like you just the way...

158
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,019
you are now.

159
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,000
Come on!

160
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,600
Oh, Jung Tam!

161
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,939
But there are people around.

162
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,350
Then, am I not shooting the poster?

163
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,919
What?

164
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,018
So, you won't do early morning workouts with Sung Mi?

165
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,518
And you won't do a body profile photoshoot? Why?

166
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,558
What do you mean, why?

167
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,758
I'm just going to go to a workshop and make matching pottery.

168
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,789
I mean, why do you want to do so many things together?

169
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:15,428
It was uncomfortable for you to try to work out with Sung Mi.

170
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,899
And isn't it uncomfortable for Sung Mi to join you in your hobbies?

171
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,439
We want to do things together because we like each other.

172
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,809
I'll do anything if Sung Mi wants me to.

173
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,539
I'll go anywhere with her...

174
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,778
and express that I love her so much.

175
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,809
Do you have to say that you love someone?

176
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,749
What are you saying? Why ask such an obvious question?

177
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,388
Hey, you have to express that you love someone.

178
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,460
If you don't, how would the other person know?

179
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,628
That's why I tell Sung Mi that I love her...

180
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,128
more than 50 times a day.

181
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,999
- Fifty times? - That's right.

182
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,628
Is that some sort of illness?

183
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,830
What do you know about love? You don't know anything.

184
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,710
(Iroun Genetic Center)

185
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,949
- Ms. Jang Mi Eun. - Yes.

186
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,678
You're here for the age spot course treatment, right?

187
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,019
No, I don't have age spots.

188
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,820
I just want to prevent any from showing up later on.

189
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,759
- Yes, then come this way. - Okay.

190
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,159
Oh, right.

191
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,399
Would it be okay for me to see Ms. Han So Jin first?

192
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,970
Sure.

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,879
They say a person dies if she changes too quickly.

194
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,820
I might actually die at this rate.

195
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,820
Goodness.

196
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,389
Why are you so tired today?

197
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,529
I started running recently.

198
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,070
Who? You?

199
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,500
You usually never work out. Why run all of a sudden?

200
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,309
I might go on a long trip with Yeon Woo this summer.

201
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,809
The basic necessity of traveling is good stamina.

202
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,490
Indeed.

203
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:19,090
Love makes a person change.

204
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,539
What's up with her?

205
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,169
Our A Ri had a big change of heart too.

206
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,740
"A change of heart?"

207
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:40,110
Okay, let's go in order.

208
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:43,449
First, the greatest homebody, Ms. Han,

209
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,720
is going running.

210
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,850
Aren't you accommodating Yeon Woo too much?

211
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,960
If she doesn't do that, she thinks Sewer might not use PGS.

212
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,059
"Sewer?"

213
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,689
Oh, So Jin stole Sim Yeon Woo's basketball uniform...

214
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,460
- Number 7! - for his DNA sample.

215
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,469
So, she extracted pheromones from Sim Yeon Woo's DNA.

216
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,668
And that smelled like sewage to me.

217
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,309
To me, it smelled like the garden of paradise.

218
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,580
You found a DNA sample on Yeon Woo's uniform?

219
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,648
Yes. I found his blood-like sweat.

220
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:20,720
So?

221
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,149
How is the effect of PGS so far?

222
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,418
Since he started using PGS,

223
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,658
his Playboy Gene seems to be...

224
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,799
more suppressed for sure.

225
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,199
I guess it feels like he loves me a bit more.

226
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,439
Although, he hasn't told her he loves her yet.

227
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,209
Oh, so it hasn't been effective yet, right?

228
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,909
Then, send me Yeon Woo's PGS data.

229
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,139
I can only believe it when I see it myself.

230
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,779
Oh, not that I can't trust you, Ms. Han.

231
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,179
Uniform?

232
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,789
Now, about A Ri's...

233
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,320
change of heart... What is it about?

234
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,130
What is it about?

235
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,630
What is it about?

236
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,569
The doors are opening.

237
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,809
The person you have reached is unavailable.

238
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,039
Why isn't she picking up since yesterday?

239
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,879
(Sung Mi, is something going on?)

240
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,889
(Why can't I reach you?)

241
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,489
(Call me when you get my message.)

242
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,319
- Dr. Yeo. - Oh, my goodness.

243
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,930
Oh, hello.

244
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,529
Is something wrong?

245
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh, nothing.

246
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,470
By the way, Yeon Woo is in the garden outside.

247
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,710
- Oh, right. - Bye.

248
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Okay, then.

249
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,789
- Yeon Woo. - I'll call you later. Bye.

250
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,089
What?

251
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:23,539
What?

252
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,008
You're not wearing your bracelet.

253
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,079
Oh, right.

254
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,548
I left it at home.

255
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:34,750
I took it off before my shower and forgot. Sorry.

256
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:38,118
You can just keep it on all the time.

257
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,390
I'm just not used to it.

258
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,259
I'm sorry. I'll be better from now on.

259
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:49,170
Do you want to buy a pair of matching sneakers for our trip?

260
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,170
I found one I really like.

261
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,210
You seem to like matching items so much.

262
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,808
Yes, even when we're apart,

263
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,480
it shows that we feel the same.

264
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,480
Does having matching items necessarily mean you feel the same?

265
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,589
Anyway, I'll be better from now on.

266
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,099
So, the day we went to see that movie,

267
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,299
you had a call from your mother.

268
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,200
I couldn't get your face from that day off my mind.

269
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,739
There isn't anything wrong with your mother, is there?

270
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,869
No, nothing.

271
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,980
I'm glad to hear that.

272
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,109
Right.

273
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,980
I want to...

274
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:45,160
hear about your family too.

275
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:49,558
I'm curious about you when you were 3, 7, 14,

276
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,759
and 20 years old too.

277
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,630
Why?

278
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,869
It's obvious.

279
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,799
It's about you and your family.

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,539
You're dating me, not my family.

281
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,839
But still.

282
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,809
Won't it be nice for you and me to know about each other the most?

283
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,680
The more we know, the more we'll understand each other.

284
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:14,450
Then, we could rely on each other too.

285
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,549
Is that so? I don't really think so.

286
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,789
What?

287
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,160
Everyone must be waiting. Let's go inside.

288
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,559
Oh, right.

289
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,249
Ms. Han was with the Vice Director earlier, but I guess they fought.

290
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,420
What's wrong with her face?

291
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,119
The D-day for their breakup has begun, then.

292
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,789
Well, it has always been like this.

293
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,369
I hear that you're seeing someone.

294
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,710
The hospital won't see it as a problem.

295
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,680
You know all doctors bring their spouses to the gatherings.

296
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,980
You should marry her first.

297
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,250
Then you can get to know her more.

298
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,720
Marrying someone for the sake of appearances isn't my style.

299
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,519
You must still resent me.

300
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,660
Why would I resent you?

301
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,430
We all have our own life to live.

302
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,730
Yeon Woo.

303
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,799
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

304
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,109
But I did love your mother at first.

305
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,680
I just didn't know that my love for her would change.

306
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,450
"Love?"

307
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,349
Have you ever considered...

308
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,490
that your love has kept her...

309
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,029
imprisoned her whole life?

310
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:14,299
What I know is that I remained faithful to my feelings.

311
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,139
If your love was going to change that easily,

312
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,769
you shouldn't have told her you loved her.

313
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,519
Excuse me. I must leave. I'm sorry.

314
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,460
Hey.

315
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,519
(Grass tree)

316
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,720
Here I go! Shoot!

317
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,390
Father!

318
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,599
- I'm sorry. - Sister Anna. Are you all right?

319
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,970
Gosh, you're bleeding too much.

320
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,210
The ball was coming straight at your face. Weren't you scared?

321
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,180
The idea of you getting hurt scared me more.

322
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,259
Sister Anna. You stopped hiding, right?

323
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,430
Ever since I confessed to you,

324
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,869
I’ve strangely felt a sense of inner peace.

325
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,569
I'm glad to hear that.

326
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,549
Father, whom do you talk to when you're troubled?

327
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,949
I confess everything to the Lord...

328
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,289
because He is always by my side, protecting me.

329
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,089
Can't you talk to other people?

330
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,259
Pardon?

331
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,559
I hope to be by your side...

332
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,900
whenever you're feeling troubled.

333
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,940
You got a haircut.

334
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,250
I did.

335
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,119
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

336
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,559
It's good.

337
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,890
Really?

338
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,990
What a relief.

339
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:25,098
This time, I added more water parsley.

340
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,359
I see.

341
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,970
("The Thorn Birds")

342
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,609
("The Thorn Birds")

343
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
("The Thorn Birds")

344
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,190
So Jin. Remember what you said?

345
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,989
That the one who can get me out of the wardrobe...

346
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,930
would be my DNA lover.

347
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,730
It's not that I completely believe what you said.

348
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,630
But I think I've found that person.

349
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,909
I ended up sharing much more...

350
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,750
about my innermost feelings with him than with you.

351
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,579
If I am his DNA lover,

352
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,589
could I be his healer too?

353
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,088
Could you tell me a bit more about that?

354
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,730
No. I need to finish reading this book by today.

355
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:37,069
It's about a woman who loved a priest her entire life.

356
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,910
It's the opposite for me.

357
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,150
It's becoming harder for me to talk to him about my innermost feelings.

358
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,049
I'm afraid it might pressure him.

359
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:59,759
When I'm with him, I'm so happy and have so much fun.

360
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,759
But once we say goodbye for the day, I feel uneasy for some reason.

361
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,069
It feels as if I know...

362
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,299
nothing about him.

363
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,379
Maybe, Sewer only wants to have fun with you.

364
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,880
But you want him to be serious. Imagine the pressure he must feel.

365
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,680
Come on. Why would you say that?

366
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,019
That's not true.

367
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,699
So Jin. Take the main road until the streetlamp gets fixed.

368
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:28,779
(So Jin. Take the main road until the streetlamp gets fixed.)

(Iroun Genetic Center)

371
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,579
What was that?

372
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:05,819
Darn it.

373
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,129
Look at my face. I bumped into a glass door...

374
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,259
on my way to work today.

(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

376
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,230
She didn't have to text me about this.

(My Lover Sim Yeon Woo)

378
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,839
You should tell me everything about your day too.

379
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,269
Right. Sending a photo is a must!

380
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,769
(Right. Sending a photo is a must!)

381
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,719
It’s possible that your nasal bone might be injured.

382
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,950
Make sure to see a doctor.

383
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,618
Right. Don't forget our plan...

384
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,329
to work out at the Han River this afternoon together.

385
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,730
See you soon, So Jin.

386
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:56,400
It hurts.

387
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,769
What are you doing?

388
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,609
You should also try walking backward.

389
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,480
It feels so weird to walk backward with other people.

390
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,150
The creative mind of a scientist starts here.

391
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,509
Come on. Try it.

392
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,589
- Like this? - Yes.

393
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,519
- This is it? - You're pretty good.

394
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,190
Then do you want to race to see who can get to that rest area first?

395
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,390
- How about the winner gets a wish? - I'm in!

396
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,400
- Are you serious? - Yes.

397
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,029
- I'm really going to run. - Sure.

398
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,829
This is me walking.

399
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:34,900
- See you later. Bye. - What?

400
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,369
Darn it!

401
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,180
Looking at the river makes me want to look at the ocean.

402
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,990
Do you want to go to the ocean?

403
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,750
Is that your wish?

404
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,220
Well, we can get nice food there and watch the sunrise too.

405
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,789
- The sunrise. - Yes.

406
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,700
Really?

407
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,230
Hey! Seo Kang Hoon!

408
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,140
Come on.

409
00:31:09,109 --> 00:31:10,170
Hey.

410
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:11,709
I told you to text me if you were going...

411
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,279
to wear that sweater. Darn it.

412
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,008
If I text you, I won't be able to wear it.

413
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,410
I shouldn't have taken the sweater from your buy-1-get-1-free deal.

414
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,279
You're wearing a short sleeve under this, right?

415
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,649
- What are you doing? - Take that off!

416
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,149
- Gosh. - We're wearing the same sweater!

417
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,220
- Goodness. - I have a better idea.

418
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,319
Let's go and have dinner together.

419
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:31,430
- I was just... Come on. - Take it off before you go.

420
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:33,758
- Look at Yeon Woo. It's alive. - It's moving.

421
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,399
Did you see that? It flipped over.

422
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,470
- The crab totally "flipped!" - Yes.

423
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:39,169
- Oh, my. - Be careful.

424
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,000
- Goodness. - Do you like radishes?

425
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:44,939
- Yes. - Nice to meet you.

426
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,640
- At the next trial... - So far...

427
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,209
Do you need brutally honest dating advice?

428
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,479
- That's So Ri. - We can give dating advice for you.

429
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,449
- "Backseat Dating Advice" begins. - So Jin.

430
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,048
You know that So Ri's birthday is coming up, right?

431
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:58,149
How is it that you remember my family's birthdays...

432
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,390
better than the times table?

433
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,119
- I celebrated them every year. - Why can't you?

434
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,429
Doesn't it mean you can't have your significant other to yourself?

435
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,858
- So Jin. - No. That's not true.

436
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,199
Could you bring me abalones from the fridge.

437
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,400
- Sure. You got it. - Polygamy is...

438
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,700
one of many dating preferences.

439
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:14,839
But shouldn't they try to adjust while dating someone?

440
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,079
You may consider yourself as someone who practices polygamy.

441
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,279
But you could still date only one person.

442
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,818
(Yeon Woo)

443
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:35,758
Actually, many polygamists from abroad forge relationships.

444
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,160
In Korea, there are polygamists like myself.

445
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,650
In my opinion...

446
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,519
Yeon Woo. I'll clean the abalones.

447
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,660
What?

448
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,890
- Why? - You should go.

449
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,730
I've done it a lot at my father's restaurant.

450
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,660
Then could you?

451
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,470
- Polygamists... - Great.

452
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,069
Aren't just about dating many people.

453
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,440
In my opinion, the guy in the letter is also hung up on her.

454
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,379
I don't think the exam was that important, to begin with.

455
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,209
And let's talk about the cell phone thing too.

456
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,278
"What? Why is she sending me this?"

457
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,008
- Don't think like that. - How's the food?

458
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,819
- Just ignore her. - Yes.

459
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,849
- Let's read the next letter. - It's good.

460
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,619
"Hello. I've been dating my dream guy for ten months."

461
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:42,789
"Our principles on showing affection are very different."

462
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:46,258
"I like to show my affection verbally and physically."

463
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,599
"But my boyfriend isn't like me."

464
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:51,299
"When I tell him I love him, he only says, 'Okay.'"

465
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,869
"Whenever he does that, I feel so embarrassed."

466
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,139
"I tell him countless times that I love him."

467
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,009
"But my boyfriend has never once told me that he loved me."

468
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:05,720
"Is it okay to keep trusting him and dating him?"

469
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,178
That's our third letter.

470
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,689
- This one is so obvious. - He didn't say it back...

471
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,389
after she said she loved him?

472
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,659
I don't get it.

473
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,559
Right.

474
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:19,559
There must have been other occasions he must have said the word, right?

475
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:22,368
Well, there are some things you can feel with your heart.

476
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,469
She can just feel his love.

477
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,239
Is that really necessary for him to say it? I'm siding with the guy.

478
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,469
But still.

479
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:32,039
When your love grows, aren't you bound to express it?

480
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,550
When you express your love, your feelings are bound to grow too.

481
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,948
It's a decision to confess your feelings.

482
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,579
It's also a promise that your feelings won't change.

483
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,149
Does he have no confidence in the relationship?

484
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,348
Why did he start dating her?

485
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,788
But why is it so hard for him to say he loves her?

486
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:49,529
This just means that he's not in love with her. Period.

487
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,190
While some things may come easily to certain people,

488
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,428
they might be challenging for others, So Jin.

489
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,868
Adjusting to one another is part of dating.

490
00:34:57,869 --> 00:34:58,940
Why is that?

491
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,469
If he wants to say it, he can just say it.

492
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:08,609
I believe one's decision to show intimacy is up to the individual.

493
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,980
But you do confess your feelings way too openly.

494
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,118
From what I remember,

495
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,150
you started confessing your feelings since you were in fourth grade.

496
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:20,289
She was in elementary school and played a dwarf for a musical.

497
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,629
If I'm not wrong, you were into the prince. Right?

498
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,559
Was his name Ji Hoon?

499
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,229
Hey, you were totally in love with the pianist at our church.

500
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,768
You were totally out of it.

501
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:32,098
- Gosh. - With those manly hands,

502
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,170
he probably folded 1,000 paper cranes.

503
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,939
With those rough hands.

504
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,268
So what? I didn't confess my feelings like you, at least.

505
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,308
Don't fool yourself.

506
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:40,709
You practically gave away your heart with those 1,000 paper cranes.

507
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,780
Gave away my heart?

508
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,250
I'll go and wash my hands.

509
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,300
This photo was in the icebox.

510
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,769
I think So Jin saw it too.

511
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,009
I can throw it out.

512
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,309
I'm worried.

513
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,710
Why?

514
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,780
That you may want to throw out your memories with So Jin...

515
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,650
like this photo.

516
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,489
Let's just eat.

517
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:31,960
Have the abalone.

518
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,369
Respect your guy's dating method.

519
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,308
Only then will your dating method be respected too.

520
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,779
("Backseat Dating Advice")

521
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,880
Hey, Yeon Woo. I just finished filming.

522
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,380
How about a drink?

523
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,960
(Always Sushi)

524
00:37:53,139 --> 00:37:56,010
(Always Sushi)

525
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Darn it.

526
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,760
Come on.

527
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,630
Darn!

528
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,219
All right.

529
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:45,289
So Jin saw this photo.

530
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:49,000
Could you be careful next time? She might get the wrong idea.

531
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,210
Right. It looked like you were interested in Kang Hoon.

532
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,539
Why won't you express your interest?

533
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,980
I am interested in someone.

534
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,150
But it's not Kang Hoon.

535
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,449
I've known him.

536
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,559
But it feels as if I'm getting to know a different man.

537
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,559
He's someone I want for myself...

538
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,059
for the first time.

539
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,139
Mi Eun.

540
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,940
So Jin and Kang Hoon...

541
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,440
What do you make of their relationship?

542
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:43,718
Why do you ask? Are you bothered by their relationship?

543
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,219
No, not really.

544
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,059
Let's see.

545
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,260
When I look at them together,

546
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,159
it makes me wonder if there's destiny after all.

547
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,759
Other couples have to work really hard to be compatible,

548
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,829
but with those two,

549
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,170
it's like they've been compatible ever since their birth.

550
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,469
Is that so?

551
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,570
Yes.

552
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,579
Yeon Woo.

553
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,349
Didn't you say you were So Jin's genetic partner?

554
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,550
Was it a DNA lover?

555
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,219
Is that what she said?

556
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,449
Yes.

557
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,659
I get treatments from the center. That's when she told me.

558
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,130
That she extracted your DNA from your basketball uniform...

559
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,360
and found her DNA lover.

560
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,530
Oh, that?

(Machundong Boxing Gym)

562
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,780
All right.

563
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:45,609
It's been a while, sir.

564
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,619
Hey. I thought you were upset at Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

565
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,159
Look at our poster. Doesn't it look great?

567
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,750
Jung Tam!

568
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:24,019
Gosh. Doesn't it look great?

569
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,558
Sung Mi. You've been busy lately. Was it because of this poster?

570
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,559
Yes.

571
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,759
You told me I could skip the workout.

572
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,360
Was it so that you could take photos with another man?

573
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,030
Not just with anyone but with this jacked-up jerk!

574
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,800
Gosh.

575
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,968
I thought you didn't want to take the photos for the poster.

576
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,638
So you took them with another man because I didn't want to?

577
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,809
How could you do that?

578
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,308
Did you think I wouldn't see this?

579
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:47,379
Or do you not care even if I see this?

580
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,209
This is worse than ghosting me or dating someone right after me.

581
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,519
How could you replace me for the photoshoot?

582
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,319
You don't like to exercise.

583
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,889
Coming to the gym to work out was hard on you.

584
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,988
But I already promised the coach that I would do the photoshoot.

585
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,090
So I had to do my best with a sense of responsibility.

586
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,199
Making a promise to someone else is making a promise to myself.

587
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,869
I must keep my promises no matter what.

588
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,238
What misunderstanding do you have of this?

589
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:16,610
Misunderstanding, my foot.

590
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,409

This ocean's surface is the warmest.

598
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,679
The warmest ocean?

599
00:42:53,539 --> 00:42:57,449
Right. There's a red lighthouse by the seawall.

600
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,749
People say when couples walk to the lighthouse together,

601
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,619
their love will come true.

602
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:13,099
If we're going there to see the sunrise...

603
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,860
So he wants to spend the night with me, right?

604
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:17,699
Gosh. This is moving all so fast.

605
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,340

606
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:22,570
Gosh.

607
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:27,179
I see. Did you get the skin treatment?

608
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,179
Could we talk?

609
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,920
Sure.

610
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,590
I heard that you saw the photo of me and Yeon Woo together.

611
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,170
I see. The photo.

612
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,900
Right. Did you take a photo with Yeon Woo too?

613
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,809
Not yet.

614
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,239
Well, it won't be easy.

615
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:03,179
Yeon Woo is adamant...

616
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,780
on not taking any photos with his girlfriend.

617
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,590
I'm not sure.

618
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:17,489
We'll have to wait and see about that.

619
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:21,730
Yeon Woo and I are going to the beach tomorrow.

620
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,869
I appreciate...

621
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,110
all of the advice you've given me.

622
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,440
But I...

623
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,710
won't care about what type of relationships...

624
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,449
Yeon Woo had in the past.

625
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,989
Because I'm going to be that one special person for him.

626
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,190
So Jin.

627
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:48,219
Do you feel very anxious about dating Yeon Woo?

628
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,760
- Pardon? - Well...

629
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,000
Enough to spray that chemical on him?

630
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,999
How did you know about that...

631
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,539
I'm sorry. I happened to hear when I was at the center.

632
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,550
Do you really think that will change him?

633
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,049
- Well... - That destined partner...

634
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,819
you want to prove even with a DNA test...

635
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:19,820
I don't know if it actually exists.

636
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,889
But if that partner is Yeon Woo,

637
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:24,828
wouldn't he not make you so confused like this?

638
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:26,799
That has nothing to do with Yeon Woo.

639
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,769
It's just how I am when I'm dating.

640
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,969
You're the anxious type.

641
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:39,809
An anxious attachment type woman...

642
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:42,409
with an avoidant type man...

643
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:44,909
is the worst.

644
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:47,820
An avoidant type?

645
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,489
He runs away in the critical moment.

646
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,489
Yeon Woo and I think dating is a game.

647
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,500
But no matter how fun it is, you don't bet your life on dating.

648
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:05,099
- Yeon Woo is not like that. - Are you sure?

649
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:10,510
I dated Yeon Woo for three years, but he never told me, "I love you."

650
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,309
Because we,

651
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,809
Yeon Woo and I, didn't try to own each other.

652
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,449
But you're different.

653
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,018
A relationship in which you're the only one who is expressive.

654
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,320
Can you handle that?

655
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:31,889
Yeon Woo and I are a genetic match.

656
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,230
We're DNA lovers.

657
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,369
If you're really Yeon Woo's destined partner,

658
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,738
he must do things for you that he doesn't do...

659
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,098
for other women, right?

660
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,139
Then you could do a destiny test with that.

661
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,739
A destiny test?

662
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,380
Should we talk later? I have a treatment scheduled.

663
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,320
Wait.

664
00:46:58,719 --> 00:46:59,788
What is that?

665
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:02,219
What doesn't he do for other women?

666
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,599
Are you curious?

667
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,099
- Yes. - He always says no...

668
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,039
- to matching items. - Pass.

669
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,110
Do you see this?

670
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,510
Second.

671
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,109
He doesn't introduce his girlfriend...

672
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,848
to friends or acquaintances.

673
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:28,948
Also pass.

674
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:32,090
Yeon Woo and I already have several acquaintances.

(Seo Kang Hoon, Firefighter, Like a brother to So Jin)

678

(20 years, Yeon Woo's special forces comrade, 8 years)

679
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,309
Third.

680
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,110
He never talks about his family.

681
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,249
I want to hear about your family too.

682
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,079
You're dating me, not my family.

683
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:04,190
That's like crossing the final line with him.

684
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,329
And last.

685
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,530
As I said earlier, he'll never say...

686
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,969
"I love you."

687
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:19,230
I love you.

688
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,840
I said, "I love you." Very much.

689
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,510
He may have not done those things with other women,

690
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,280
but he will with me.

691
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,710
I'm sure of it.

692
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,659
Good luck.

693
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:52,000
Darn it.

694
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:55,739
You have to actually be cool about this.

695
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,039
You can't keep pretending to be cool about it, Han So Jin.

696
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:18,460
Hi.

697
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,158
Give me your bag. Why do you have so much stuff?

698
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,999
Since we'll be gone overnight.

699
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,439
But I didn't pack much.

700
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,098
Just the mini humidifier that you gave me.

701
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,368
I also packed a pillow just in case my neck is too high.

702
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:35,009
I also packed some toiletries and bath products.

703
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,480
Get in!

704
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,320
So Jin. Sewer has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

705
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,949
So he must be coming up with his strategy right now.

706
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:48,189
So you can't forget about pushing and pulling.

707
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,059
Push, pull.

708
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,288
What is this?

709
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,730
DNA lovers don't need to push and pull.

710
00:49:59,869 --> 00:50:01,269
How pretty.

711
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:05,609
- We're not staying overnight. - Pardon?

712
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,440
We talked about going to see the ocean.

713
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:13,519
I don't think we talked about sleeping there.

714
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:16,889
Oh, gosh. It's so steep. How dangerous.

715
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,130
So Jin.

716
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:32,230
We're not staying overnight.

717
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,469
Stop it.

718
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,090
Yes.

719
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,159
It looks good.

720
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,960
It looks so good.

721
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,800
Jump. One, two, three.

722
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:05,769
Oh, my!

723
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,670
(Yeon Woo, So Jin)

724
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,379
- Here. - I can't.

725
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,809
What do you think I'll do? Just one time.

726
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,949
From here...

727
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,019
You can do that. I'll take a picture from the back.

728
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,650
Okay. Like this.

729
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:25,750
Like this.

730
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,960
Here.

731
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,788
- Okay. - Did you get it?

732
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,829
Take a look.

733
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,900
You're so detached.

734
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:48,940
What?

735
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,280
He's so kind.

736
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,788
- How about... - Yes?

737
00:51:57,789 --> 00:51:59,690
Walking to the lighthouse?

738
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,059
Let's just walk while holding hands like this.

739
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,059
Shall we go later?

740
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,659
Sounds good.

741
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,139
It's so pretty.

742
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:19,809
I didn't know you liked ice cream so much.

743
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,848
Should we put this in the middle and take a photo together?

744
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,449
- A photo together? - Here.

745
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:27,480
Look over here.

746
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,389
One, two.

747
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,750
Oh, no.

748
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

749
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,500
Oh, no.

750
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,300
Oh, it hurts.

751
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,469
What? Let's take it again.

752
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,638
Look over here. One, two.

753
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:54,139
Excuse me. Could I have a bandage?

754
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,919
What are you doing?

755
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,590
You dislike taking pictures so much. How did you take them with Mi Eun?

756
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,489
Are you jealous?

757
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,459
When you and Kang Hoon were wearing...

758
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,730
those matching light purple hoodies,

759
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,558
I didn't misunderstand at all.

760
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,300
You must just not be curious.

761
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,699
Because you don't know how it feels to be jealous.

762
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:23,368
It's not that. Your relationship with Kang Hoon...

763
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:26,209
is a part of you, so I didn't want to intrude.

764
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,739
How can he not care when we're dating?

765
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:32,179
He's so cool about things that he might freeze to death.

766
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,989
Welcome...

767
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,650
Take your time drinking. You're going to get sick.

768
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,719
Did you know those two went on a trip today?

769
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,590
Yeon Woo and So Jin.

770
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:18,730
They went on an overnight trip to the beach.

771
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,199
What about it?

772
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,139
Right.

773
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,469
Why do I care?

774
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,809
Yeon Woo going on a trip with another woman...

775
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,539
isn't a big deal.

776
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,449
You were always strange, but you're especially so today.

777
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:44,690
Do you really like Yeon Woo?

778
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:51,960
If so, forget about it.

779
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:55,659
Yeon Woo and So Jin love each other, and they'll be happy together.

780
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,570
Do you think...

781
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,139
you can forget about your feelings for So Jin?

782
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:04,909
Do you think ignoring your feelings will make them go away?

783
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:11,010
I'm sorry, but you're not that type.

784
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,519
I didn't say the feelings would go away.

785
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,190
If you're done, I'll leave.

786
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,059
Do you think...

787
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,670
those two are really destined for each other?

788
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:38,369
Do you think...

789
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:43,409
they're really destined partners?

790
00:55:53,989 --> 00:55:55,719
That's so nice.

791
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,559
I want to be like that.

792
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,030
Walking together like that...

793
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,570
in old age after our kids are all grown.

794
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:11,969
I guess you've been here often.

795
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:16,139
No. I've only been here once.

796
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,909
On a family trip.

797
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,349
I see.

798
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,090
But I kept seeing this in my dreams lately.

799
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,059
And we looked very happy in my dreams.

800
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,090
So I wanted to come back.

801
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,000
Try catching me.

802
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:46,840
Oh, no!

803
00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:50,610
I'm coming to catch you!

804
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,519
I'm going to catch you!

805
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:01,659
I get a feeling...

806
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:06,800
that being here will erase my bad memories.

807
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,300
This is the warmest ocean, right?

808
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,980
Yeon Woo. Do you want...

809
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,780
to send a postcard with the slow mailbox?

810
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:33,920
(Slow Mailbox)

811
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,030
If we send it now, we'll get it a year later.

812
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,868
A year later? What should I write?

813
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:47,570
You can write a promise you'll keep in a year.

814
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,138
I don't believe in promises.

815
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:52,570
Just write what you want to write now.

816
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,679
I can write to the So Jin one year in the future, right?

817
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,129
(It's been a year, and I still want to see you...)

818
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,130
(and hear your voice every day. What should I do? I love you.)

819
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:21,440
I think we should keep an eye on her for a bit longer.

820
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,369
I'm out right now.

821
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:28,039
Let me know if any problems come up.

822
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,079
If so...

823
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,750
Please keep an eye on her for now, and update me.

824
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,218
(To So Jin 1 year from now. I hope I'm by your side...)

825
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,788
(a year from now, but if I'm not, )

826
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,289
(I hope that guy is someone who can protect you forever.)

827
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:45,190
To So Jin one year from now.

828
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:50,469
I hope I'm by your side a year from now,

829
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,170
but if I'm not,

830
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,739
I hope...

831
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,170
that guy is someone who can protect you forever.

832
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,340
Thank you.

833
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,019
So Jin?

834
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,860
Is this...

835
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,300
all you think of our future?

836
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:27,899
- What do you mean... - A relationship that can end...

837
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,300
at any point?

838
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:35,239
Is that the kind of relationship you want to have?

839
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,880
What do you mean by that?

840
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:40,250
I just don't understand.

841
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:46,050
You've never told me that you loved me.

842
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:50,190
You always are ready to break up with me.

843
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,428
Do you not trust me?

844
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:55,599
I want to trust you.

845
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,070
So please prove it to me.

846
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,900
I want to hear it.

847
01:00:00,769 --> 01:00:04,039
I want to hear you say that you love me.

848
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,010
One moment.

849
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:14,448
Yes?

850
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:16,018
We performed the emergency care as you instructed,

851
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:17,519
but the mother is in serious condition.

852
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,789
It seems the placenta is blocking the opening of the uterus.

853
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,989
Dr. Choi is out of the office, and I can't get in touch with her.

854
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:26,690
I understand. I'll be there right away.

855
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,530
- I'm sorry, So Jin. - We should go.

856
01:00:53,619 --> 01:00:55,119
(Slow Mailbox)

857
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,699
Hey.

858
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:10,440
I think something is wrong.

859
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:12,510
You should go and console her.

860
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:17,179
She's your acquaintance. Are you going to let her get drunk alone?

861
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,519
What's wrong with me?

862
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,559
What is it?

863
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,659
It happens often lately. Maybe I'm too tired.

864
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,940
Is your field of view narrowing?

865
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,539
Are you having trouble distinguishing objects?

866
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:51,880
Are you thinking...

867
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,348
of RP right now?

868
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:56,920
You have the RP gene.

869
01:01:57,019 --> 01:01:59,619
Nobody knows when RP will become active.

870
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,039
It's okay, So Jin.

871
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,050
It's okay.

872
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,489
Let's hold hands.

873
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:37,789
I want to do so.

874
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,099
Okay.

875
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:19,630
If you drink alcohol, your body temperature will drop.

876
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,440
Do you know that?

877
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,780
Well, Mr. Sim...

878
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,349
No, Yeon Woo.

879
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:35,849
Yeon Woo's...

880
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:38,719
destined partner...

881
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,619
isn't So Jin.

882
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:45,789
Well...

883
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,059
That uniform So Jin stole and tested.

884
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:52,630
That...

885
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:56,099
was yours.

886
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,809
Seo Kang Hoon's DNA.

887
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:11,190
That's not my uniform.

888
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,090
- What? - She took Kang Hoon's uniform...

889
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,518
thinking it was mine.

890
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,789
Who wore this?

891
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,129
I wore this one.

892
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:23,730
It ripped during the last game.

893
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,539
- You should've given this to me. - It's okay.

894
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,269
It wasn't my DNA.

895
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:32,769
It was Kang Hoon's.

896
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,849
Is that why those two get along so well?

897
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,250
So So Jin's DNA lover...

898
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:45,349
isn't Yeon Woo.

899
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,889
It's you, Seo Kang Hoon.

900
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,630
Do you get it now?

901
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:05,030
And there was another hurdle between us.

902
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:49,980
(DNA Lover)

903
01:06:50,309 --> 01:06:54,009
The uniform was Kang Hoon's and not Yeon Woo's?

904
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,678
Yeon Woo. Should we meet using telepathy?

905
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,719
Okay.

906
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,719
It wasn't a coincidence.

907
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:01,460
He says he pretended to be...

908
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:04,359
my DNA lover all this time for me.

909
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,230
But how is that for me?

910
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,428
I'm sure Yeon Woo didn't want to do so.

911
01:07:08,429 --> 01:07:10,230
He must've done so because he liked you.

912
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:14,169
Are you confident you won't hurt So Jin, Yeon Woo?

913
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:17,469
She's looking for that one man who she'll love forever.

914
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,570
The important point is that I don't want to say goodbye yet.
