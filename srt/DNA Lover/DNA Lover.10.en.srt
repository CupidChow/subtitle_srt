What's wrong with her?

189
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:08,461
Ah Ri had a major change in the state of mind.

190
00:15:08,461 --> 00:15:09,931
Change in the state of mind?

191
00:15:09,931 --> 00:15:13,091
Hold on. Let's do this in order.

192
00:15:13,091 --> 00:15:18,951
First of all, the homebody Han So Jin started running.

193
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,141
Aren't you changing yourself too much for Yeon Woo?

194
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,991
She thinks the Sewer won't apply PGS otherwise.

195
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,491
The Sewer?

196
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:28,611
<i>In order to acquire Dr. Shim's sample,</i>

197
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,671
<i>Seven!</i>

198
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,481
she stole his basketball uniform.

199
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,311
I mean, she extracted his pheromone from his DNA,

200
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,621
but to me, it smelled like the sewer.

201
00:15:41,621 --> 00:15:45,651
To be, it smelled like heaven's garden.

202
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,591
You found a sample from Yeon Woo's uniform?

203
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:52,581
Yes, I extracted the precious sweat.

204
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:57,481
So? How's the PGS working this time?

205
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:01,711
I definitely think his playboy gene was

206
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,691
suppressed a bit since he applied the PGS.

207
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:09,231
It somehow feels like he loves me more.

208
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:12,171
Although he hasn't told her he loves her yet.

209
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,131
So, it hasn't worked yet.

210
00:16:14,131 --> 00:16:17,221
Send me Yeon Woo's PGS data, then.

211
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:19,631
I need to see it myself to believe it.

212
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:22,971
But it's not that I don't believe you, Team Leader Han.

213

214
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:30,291

215
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,001

219
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,021

No, it's nothing.

By the way,

228
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:20,221

Oh, okay.

- Yeon Woo.
- I'll call you back.

233
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,501
I left it at home.

234
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,301
I took it off while taking a shower and forgot. I'm sorry.

235
00:18:08,301 --> 00:18:10,981
It's okay to just keep it on.

236
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:13,361
I'm not used to it.

237
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:15,941
I'm sorry. I'll be better from now on.

238
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:22,361
Should we get matching sneakers for our trip?

239
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,901
I found a pair I really like.

240
00:18:25,751 --> 00:18:30,211
- Looks like you love matching items.
- Yes.

241
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:34,621
It means we feel the same way even when we're apart.

242
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:38,341
Do you feel the same way just because you wear matching stuff?

243
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:42,181
Anyway, I'll remember to wear it.

244
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:54,861
You got a call from your mother the day we saw the movie.

245
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:58,291
I keep worrying about the way you looked that day.

246
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,611
Everything is okay with her, right?

247
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,261
Yes, she's fine.

248
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,071
That's a relief.

249
00:19:07,071 --> 00:19:08,481
Yes.

250
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:18,621
I want to hear about your family, too.

251
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:25,521
I'm curious about how you were when you were three, seven, 14, or 20.

252
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:27,531
Why?

253
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:31,851
Why shouldn't I be? Because it's about you and your family.

254
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,441
You're dating me, not my family.

255
00:19:36,601 --> 00:19:42,231
But still. Wouldn't it be nice if we knew each other better than anyone?

256
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:45,031
The more we know, the better we'd understand each other.

257
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,301
We'd be able to rely on each other, too.

258
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:51,731
Is that so? Is it necessary?

259
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,141
Pardon?

260
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:56,811
Everyone must be waiting. Let's go in.

261
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,181
Oh, okay.

262
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:22,151
Ms. Han was with the assistant director earlier. I think they had a fight.

but all doctors attend gatherings with their spouses.

269
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,811
You should get married first...

270
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,401

271
00:20:53,401 --> 00:20:56,431
Having a relationship for display isn't my style.

"love" trapped Mother forever?

282
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,351
It's just that I've always been true to my feelings.

283
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:51,811
You shouldn't have said you loved her if you'd change so easily.

284
00:21:58,321 --> 00:22:01,321

297
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,881
I confide everything to the Lord.

298
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:15,301

I'm going. Here I go.

358
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:10,641
Darn it. Geez!

359
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:20,621
Seeing the river makes me want to see the ocean.

360
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,261
Should we go see the ocean?

361
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,191
Is that your wish?

362
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:28,151
We'll eat something tasty and watch the sunrise, too.

363
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:30,561
Sunrise?

364
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:32,211
Really?

365
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,121
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

366
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:46,241
Hey, I told you to text me if you're wearing that.

367
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,971
I couldn't have worn it if I did.

368
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:51,071
I shouldn't have gotten it for free when you bought it.

369
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:53,731
You're wearing a T-shirt inside, aren't you?

370
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,581
- What are you doing?
- Take it off.

371
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:57,081
We look the same.

372
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:59,381
How about we just...

373
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,821
go get dinner together?

374
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:04,251
- I'll just-
- Take it off. Off!

375
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:06,571
- Yeon Woo, look at this. It's alive.
- It's moving.

376
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,261
Will it flip if I did this?

377
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:10,441
This is what it means to flip.

378
00:31:10,441 --> 00:31:12,551
- Be careful.
- My gosh.

379
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,901
Do you like radish?

380
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:17,851
<i>- Yes.
- That's right.</i>

381
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:19,781
<i>- For the next trial...
- Until now...</i>

382
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:22,241
<i>Do you need brutally honest advice?</i>

383
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:25,521
- It's So Ri.
<i>- We're here to give you relationship advice.</i>

384
00:31:25,521 --> 00:31:27,311
<i>- "Relationship Advice" starts now.</i>
- Noona.

385
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:28,881
You know it's So Ri's birthday soon, right?

386
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:32,701
You remember my family's birthdays better than the multiplication table.

387
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,141
Because I've celebrated them every year.

388
00:31:35,141 --> 00:31:37,251
<i>Not having a significant other to yourself...</i>

389
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:40,411
So Jin, could you get me the abalone from the fridge?

390
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:41,641
- Okay.
<i>- Polyamory.</i>

391
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:44,111
<i>It's one of countless relationship styles.</i>

392
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,701
<i>It's all about making things work with the other person.</i>

393
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:54,821
<i>It's about sharing with other people.</i>

394
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:58,221
<i>By saying, "I'm a polyamorist,"</i>

395
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:00,771
<i>the girlfriend can argue back.</i>

396
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:08,821
[To Yeon Woo...]
<i>There are many polyamorists abroad and...</i>

397
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:13,331
<i>I'm also a polyamorist in Korea.</i>

398
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,261
<i>I think it's...</i>

399
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,651
I'll prep the abalone, Hyung.

400
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:39,371
Huh?

401
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:41,411
- Okay.
- Go over there.

402
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:43,601
I've done it a lot at Dad's restaurant.

403
00:32:43,601 --> 00:32:45,291
Okay, then.

404
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:52,551
<i>Polyamory isn't about having many...</i>

405
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,571
<i>I think the man still has feelings, too.</i>

406
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:58,291
<i>I don't think the test was important from the beginning.</i>

407
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:02,121
<i>And don't think, "Why is she sending me this?"</i>

408
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:03,821
<i>- looking at your phone.</i>
- How does it taste?

409
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:06,121
<i>Just ignore it.</i>

410
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:08,361
- It's tasty.
<i>- Let's move on to the next letter.</i>

411
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,711
<i>"Hello, I'm a woman who's been dating her ideal type for 10 months.</i>

412
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:16,021
<i>We have very different ideas about expressing affection.</i>

413
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:19,111
<i>I like expressing my affection with words and physical contact.</i>

414
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:21,011
<i>But my boyfriend is different than me.</i>

415
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:25,401
<i>When I say I love him, he only says, 'Okay.'</i>

416
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:28,261
<i>I feel so embarrassed whenever that happens.</i>

417
00:33:28,261 --> 00:33:30,921
<i>I keep telling him I love him,</i>

418
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:35,541
<i>but my boyfriend never tells me he loves me.</i>

419
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:39,121
<i>Can I trust him and keep seeing him?"</i>

420
00:33:39,121 --> 00:33:41,721
<i>That was today's third letter.</i>

421
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:45,481
He didn't say "I love you" back to the woman?

422
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,331
I don't understand it.

423
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,751
I know.

424
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:53,211
It's not like he's never said it before, right?

425
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,031
You can sense a person's feelings, too.

426
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:57,971
You can just feel it. There's no need to hear it.

427
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,751
I'm on the man's side.

428
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:05,641
But isn't it natural to express it when the feelings grow?

429
00:34:05,641 --> 00:34:08,781
You feelings grow the more you express them, too.

430
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:10,861
You decide to confess your love to someone.

431
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:14,231
And it's a promise not to have a change of heart.

432
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:17,221
Is he not confident? Why did he start dating her?

433
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,721
<i>What's so hard about saying, "I love you"?</i>

434
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:22,541
<i>It clearly means it's not love.</i>

435
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,831
What's easy for someone...

436
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:26,931
can be difficult for someone else, So Jin.

437
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,871
<i>You try to alter yourself when you're with someone...</i>

438
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:32,791
Why?

439
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:35,671
You can just say it if you want to.

440
00:34:35,671 --> 00:34:39,861
<i>They're polyamorist. But polyamorists aren't about exclusivity.</i>

441
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:41,511
<i>Expressing affection is...</i>

442
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,801
But you confess your love a lot.

443
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:49,421
I think you started doing that when you were in fourth grade.

444
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,741
When she played a dwarf in a musical,

445
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:56,491
she fell for the boy who played the prince, I think.

446
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:59,541
Was his name Ji Hoon?

447
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,631
You were totally smitten by the pianist at the church then.

448
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:07,441
I think he made 1,000 paper cranes with his own hands.

449
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,841
With these hands. These hands.

450
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:11,111
What? What? I didn't confess my love like you, at least.

451
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,631
Give me a break. Giving her 1,000 cranes is the same.

452
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,161
What are you talking about?

453
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:19,981
I'll go wash my hands.

454
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:39,081
This photo was inside the ice box.

455
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:41,421
I think So Jin saw it, too.

456
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,101
It's okay to throw it away.

457
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,801
I'm worried.

458
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,211
About what?

459
00:35:50,711 --> 00:35:55,191
That your memory with So Jin would get discarded like that, too.

460
00:35:59,381 --> 00:36:00,901
Let's eat.

461
00:36:03,711 --> 00:36:05,391
Eat the abalone.

462
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:16,691
<i>Respect the other person's relationship style.</i>

463
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:21,781
<i>That way, you'd be respected for your relationship style, too.</i>

464
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:25,441
Yes, Yeon Woo. I finished shooting just now.

465
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:28,991
Should we get a drink?

Please be careful from now on.

482
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,821
She might get the wrong idea.

483
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:31,091
Right. I thought you had feelings for Kang Hoon.

484
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,181
Why don't you tell him how you feel?

485
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:37,731
There's someone I'm interested in,

486
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:39,861
but it's not Kang Hoon.

487
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:44,341
He's someone I've known,

488
00:38:44,341 --> 00:38:47,631
but he makes me feel like I'm getting to know him again.

489
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:52,881
A man I want...

490
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:54,621
for the first time.

491
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:01,571
Mi Eun,

492
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:08,161
what do you think when you see So Jin and Kang Hoon?

493
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:16,581
What about them? Are you worried about them?

494
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:18,771
No, it's not that.

495
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:25,391
They make me wonder if destiny actually exists.

496
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,721
Some people have to try so hard,

497
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:33,231
but those two probably had a connection since birth.

498
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:35,481
Is that how they look?

499
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:36,911
Yes.

500
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:44,051
But aren't you supposed to be So Jin's DNA partner?

501
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,781
DNA lover?

502
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,461
Did So Jin say that?

503
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:52,721
Yes. I go to the DNA center for skincare. She told me there.

504
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:56,971
She said the DNA she got from your basketball uniform

505
00:39:56,971 --> 00:40:00,961
revealed that you're her DNA partner.

506
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:04,991
Oh, that?

507
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,501
Long time no see, Coach.

508
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:23,281
I thought you were upset with Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

509
00:40:26,061 --> 00:40:28,831
Didn't our poster turn out well?

510
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:47,681
[New Membership Drive]

511
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,451
Jeong Tam.

512
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:57,301
Didn't it turn out well?

513
00:40:57,301 --> 00:41:00,411
- Is this why you've been so busy, Seong Mi?
- Yes.

514
00:41:00,411 --> 00:41:03,591
Did you say I didn't have to work out, so you can take the photo with another man?

515
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:07,591
With a c-c-chunk of muscles like him?

516
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:13,861
I thought you didn't want to do the photoshoot.

517
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:16,961
But still, you did it with another man. How could you do that?

518
00:41:17,051 --> 00:41:20,231
You thought I wouldn't see this? Or you don't care if I do?

519
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:24,051
You aren't breaking up with me or cheating on me,

520
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:27,151
but a body profile shoot with someone else?

521
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,271
You don't like working out...

522
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:31,921
and it was tough for you to come to the gym.

523
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:35,881
But I already promised Coach to be on the poster.

524
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:38,501
I had to be responsible and do my best.

525
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:42,131
Once I promise someone, it becomes a promise to myself.

526
00:41:42,131 --> 00:41:44,661
I have to keep it, no matter what.

527

544
00:43:04,961 --> 00:43:06,361
Sure.

545
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:19,341
I heard you saw the photo of Yeon Woo and me.

546
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,481
Oh, the photo?

547
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,771
Do you have a photo with Yeon Woo, too?

548
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:31,161
Not yet.

It won't be easy.

550

He never takes photos with his girlfriends, no matter what.

551
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,281
I'm not sure.

552
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:50,861
We'll have to wait and see about that.

553
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:55,541
Yeon Woo and I will go to the beach tomorrow.

554
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:05,251
I'm grateful for the advice you gave me, Mi Eun.

555
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:12,901
But I won't worry about what kind of relationships he's had before.

556
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:17,061
I'll become his special one and only person.

557
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:22,021
So Jin, are you very anxious about your relationship with him?

558
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:25,181
- Pardon?
- So much...

559
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:30,741
so you'd apply a chemical product called PG or something?

560
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:34,011
How do you know that...

561
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:37,421
<i>I'm sorry. I overheard by chance when I was at the center.</i>

562
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:43,941
But do you really think he can be changed by that?

563
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:46,981
- That's-
- You even did a DNA test...

564
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,741
to prove that he's your DNA partner.

565
00:44:49,741 --> 00:44:52,851
I don't know if that person actually exists,

566
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:55,351
but if Yeon Woo is that person,

567
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:57,731
I don't think he'd confuse you.

568
00:44:57,731 --> 00:44:59,791
It has nothing to do with Yeon Woo.

569
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:03,541
That's just what I do in relationships.

570
00:45:06,141 --> 00:45:08,711

He runs away in critical moments.

576
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:28,801
Yeon Woo and I think relationships are a game.

577
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:33,391
But no matter how fun, you don't bet your life on a game.

578
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:37,101
He's not that kind of a person.

579
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,721
Are you sure?

580
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:44,071
He never told me he loved me while I dated him for three years.

581
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:45,761
Because we...

582
00:45:46,551 --> 00:45:49,791
Yeon Woo and I didn't try to possess each other.

583
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:53,121
But you're different.

584
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:57,121
You're the only impassioned one. Can you sustain it?

585

Yeon Woo and I are DNA partners.

We're DNA lovers.

If you really are his destined partner,

588

he'd do what he's never done with other women with you.

00:54:08,571 --> 00:54:10,341
It's nothing new.

706
00:54:11,321 --> 00:54:13,041
I've always found it strange.

707
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,321
But it's even stranger today.

708
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:18,371
Do you really like Yeon Woo?

709
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:25,061
If so, you'd better give up.

710
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,791
Yeon Woo and So Jin love each other, and they'll stay together.

711
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:31,491
How about you?

712
00:54:31,491 --> 00:54:34,601
Do you think you could give up on So Jin?

713
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:38,851
Will you no longer have feelings if you keep ignoring them?

714
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:44,731
I'm sorry, but you're not that type, Kang Hoon.

715
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:53,191
I didn't say my feelings would disappear.

716
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,891
I'll go if you're done.

717
00:54:58,891 --> 00:55:00,681
Those two...

718
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:04,291
Do you think they're really meant to be?

719
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,891
Are they...

720
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:17,151
really destined partners?

721
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:29,561
It's so nice to see.

722
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,421
I hope I'll be like that, too.

723
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:38,101
After the children grow up,

724
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:42,301
I'll walk holding hands with my husband at sunset.

725
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:46,171
Looks like you've been here often.

726
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:49,811
No, I've been here just once.

727
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:53,651
It was a family trip.

728
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:58,041
But I keep seeing it in my dreams these days.

729
00:55:58,041 --> 00:56:02,381
I looked very happy in my dream.

730
00:56:02,381 --> 00:56:04,991
That's why I wanted to come back.

731
00:56:11,931 --> 00:56:14,611
Catch me, catch me.

732
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:24,271
I'll catch you! I'll catch you!

733
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,441
I'll catch you!

734
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:41,201
It feels like my bad memories will get erased when I'm here.

735
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:43,981
Is it because this is the warmest ocean?

736
00:56:51,771 --> 00:56:57,491
Yeon Woo, should we send a postcard through the slow mailbox?

737
00:57:04,138 --> 00:57:06,368
[Slow Mailbox]

738
00:57:11,638 --> 00:57:13,928
It will arrive a year later if you send it now.

739
00:57:13,928 --> 00:57:16,508
A year later? What should I write?

740
00:57:16,508 --> 00:57:19,128
You can write a promise, maybe.

741
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:21,218
One you want to keep a year later.

742
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,888
I don't believe in promises.

743
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:26,288
Just write what you want to write now.

744
00:57:26,288 --> 00:57:29,158
I can write you one year in the future, right?

745
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:51,748
[I love you]

746
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:54,548
I think we should keep an eye on her.

747
00:57:55,328 --> 00:57:58,148
Yes, I'm out right now.

748
00:57:58,148 --> 00:58:01,708
Yes, I think it might be an issue.

749
00:58:03,748 --> 00:58:05,358
If so,

750
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:11,168
keep an eye on her condition and let me know.

756
00:58:33,018 --> 00:58:34,318
Okay.

758
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:53,068
Do you have...

759
00:58:53,068 --> 00:58:58,498
so little hope for our future, Yeon Woo?

760
00:58:58,498 --> 00:59:02,768
- What do you mean-
- A relationship that can end anytime.

761
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:09,218
I suppose that's the relationship style you prefer.

762
00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:11,238
What do you mean by that?

763
00:59:11,238 --> 00:59:13,678
It's because I'm not certain.

764
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:19,628
You never said you loved me throughout the relationship.

765
00:59:19,628 --> 00:59:23,648
You're always ready for the moment to break up.

766
00:59:26,058 --> 00:59:29,138
- Do you not trust me?
- I want to.

767
00:59:29,138 --> 00:59:31,488
So, prove yourself to me.

768
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,508
I want to hear it.

769
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:37,598
I want to hear you say you love me.

770
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,178
Just one moment.

771
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:48,718
- Yes.
<i>- I gave her the emergency treatment as you said,</i>

772
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,378

773
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,998
<i>I think the placenta is blocking the uterus opening.</i>

774
00:59:52,998 --> 00:59:56,548
<i>Dr. Choi stepped out, but I can't reach her.</i>

775
00:59:56,548 --> 00:59:59,028
Okay, I'll be right there.

776
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,378
Okay.

777
01:00:00,378 --> 01:00:02,858
- I'm sorry, So Jin.
- Let's go.

778
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,671
Hey, hey.

779
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,281
Looks like something's going on.

780
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,601
You should go comfort her.

781
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:50,041
You know her. Will you just let her get drunk alone like that?

782
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,351
What's going on?

783
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:05,861
W-What's wrong?

784
01:01:05,931 --> 01:01:09,631
This happens sometimes these days. Is it because I'm tired?

785
01:01:14,581 --> 01:01:18,001
You don't have a narrower vision...

786

or having difficulty identifying objects, right?

787
01:01:21,771 --> 01:01:26,491
Are you thinking about the RP gene right now?

788
01:01:26,491 --> 01:01:29,101
You have the RP gene, Yeon Woo.

789
01:01:29,101 --> 01:01:32,591
You never know when it'll get activated.

790
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:55,141
I'm okay, So Jin.

791
01:01:55,141 --> 01:01:56,781
I'm okay.

Okay.

Your temperature drops when you drink.

You know what?

Well...

01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:23,472
the uniform So Jin stole and tested...

803
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:25,142
That's...

804
01:03:27,162 --> 01:03:28,962
yours.

805
01:03:30,382 --> 01:03:35,522
It's your DNA, I mean.

806

<i>That wasn't my uniform.</i>

807
01:03:44,052 --> 01:03:46,952
- What?
- She took Kang Hoon's uniform...

808
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:48,562
thinking it was mine.

809
01:03:48,562 --> 01:03:52,102
<i>Who wore this one, by the way?</i>

810
01:03:52,152 --> 01:03:56,652
This is the one I wore. It got torn in the last game.

811
01:03:56,672 --> 01:03:58,122
You should've given this to me.

812
01:03:58,122 --> 01:04:00,102
It's okay. It's okay.

813
01:04:00,942 --> 01:04:05,502
It's not my DNA, but Kang Hoon's.

814
01:04:07,162 --> 01:04:10,132
Is that why they're so in sync?

815
