Excuse me, Ms. Han.

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,910
Please open your eyes.

8
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,510
Are they open?

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,070

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,570
Could you let go of this, then?

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,540
You're so consistently reckless.

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,810
Why am I like this right now?

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:09,880
I think I could explain if you moved a little.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,530
I'm sorry.

15

What? Han So Jin. Han So Jin!

16

- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

17
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,180
You can't butt in all the time. Why did you go up there?

18

Some pass out or have a heart attack while falling.

20

Ms. Han might be unlucky, but I tend to be lucky.

21

By the way, how do you two know each other?

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,270
You two should go to the hospital first.

23

- Come on.
- It's okay.

I fell with my nose in his armpit.

38

He smelled so sweaty.

39
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,030
You noticed that when you were about to die?

40
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,910
I know. I find that strange, too.

41

A glass for me, too.

47

It's so strong.

48
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,100
And you drank this every day?

49
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,840
Geez.

50
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,650
I told you not to drink at a place like this, didn't I?

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,110
A female college student was kidnapped and asked to be rescued around here.

52
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,080
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

53
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,270
Your routes are so predictable.

54
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,570
Aigoo, aigoo...

55
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,210
I told you not to cry alone.

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,350
Get up. I'll make you noodles at the restaurant.

57
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,720
I already knew...

58
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,690
that my dad would die.

59
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,740
He freed all of his pet birds...

60
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,530
and he gifted the plants he cherished to neighbors, too.

61
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,940
He couldn't handle hard liquor,

62
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,760
but he bought Gaoliang liquor at a grocery store every day.

63
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,620
I knew all about it.

64
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,900
But...

65
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,970
I pretended I didn't know.

66
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,330
Because he looked too miserable.

67
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,010
So Ri, Mom, and I...

68
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,820
hated Dad for being in unrequited love.

69
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,380
We were so annoyed with him for telling us he wanted to die.

70
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,440
So, I'm the worst person here.

71
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,310
- Noona.
- He didn't call any of us before he died.

72
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,590
So Ri, Mom, and me...

73
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,180
None of us would've told him...

74
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,900

78
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,060
I saw him exhale.

79
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,510

No, just one minute.

83
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,730
It's because I need to tell him something.

84
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,770
That I'm sorry...

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,620

86

87
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,260

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,880
- Pardon?
- Of course.

182
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,330
A brave person finds their destiny.

183
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,680
Right, that was a story about a serial killer. I'm sorry.

184
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,460
I'll steal his scent.

185
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,300
Here we go again.

186
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,760
What's wrong? What's going on?

187
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,800
I cheated a bit today.

188
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,110
A tank truck got into my lane.

189
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,220
What do you mean?

190
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,110
Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist's name was Nam Seong Mi*.
(Means "masculine charm")

191
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,720
You told me to try cheating.

192
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,980
So, I signed up at the gym immediately.

193
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,530
Her name is Nam Seong Mi?

194
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,120
So? How was it?

195
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,280
It was nice. Her smell was really nice.

196
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,740
What? What do you mean? What smell?

197
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,530
Anyway, be careful.

198
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,720
The truck might suddenly stop.

199
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,730
If you don't slow down, you'll tip over.

200
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,840
I can manage myself.

201
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,930
You know we have a basketball game with Hwalgichan Urology today, right?

202
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,530
Right, it was today.

203
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:46,900
By the way, Nurse Pyo has reserve force training today.

204
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,220
Gosh, that Nurse Pyo.

205
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,920
We're missing one person. What do we do?

206
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,760
There isn't anyone else in our department.

207
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,720
Hey, let's recruit someone.

208
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,860
I know someone.

209
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,010
I'm talking a boxer and a firefighter.

210
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,570
Firefighter?

211
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,940
I'll recruit someone instead.

212
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,670
No, their ace is two meters tall.

213
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,580
A normal person can't handle him.

214
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,330
Only Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist can handle him.

215
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,560
Do you know someone?

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,700
He better be as good as Yeosam-dong Fire Fist.

217
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,440
Here's your order.

218
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,120
Thank you.

219
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,640
Enjoy.

220
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,980
A bottle of sake, please.

221
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,930
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,070
Thank you.

223
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,790
What's with you today?

224
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,140
You did something wrong again, didn't you?

225
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,160
No. I'm helping you because you looked busy.

226
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,950
I'm not busy.

227
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,660
Yes.

228
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,420
Thank you.

229
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,650
By the way, why don't your friends come here?

230
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,340
It'd be nice if they helped the business.

231
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,760
My friends? A lot of them came.

232
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,920
Really? But that doctor from Shim Hospital? He never came, right?

233
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,120
You mean, Yeon Woo?

234
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,030
Yes, Shim Yeon Woo.

235
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,800
Does he come here often?

236
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,620
I guess he comes sometimes.

237
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,770
By the way, why are you asking me that?

238
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,840
Huh? Well, I just...

239
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:40,260
So, you two seemed pretty close. How do you know each other?

240
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,790
[Yeon Woo]

241
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,300
Speak of the devil.

242
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Hyung.

243
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,700
Tonight? Why? Is something going on?

244
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,550
Basketball?

245
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,180
<i>Basketball?</i>

246
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,550
<i>Basketball is...</i>

247
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:07,800
<i>a sport that lets me collect sweat, which contains body scents.</i>

248
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,470
<i>This is it.</i>

249
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,420
I'm helping my father at the restaurant. I don't think I could.

250
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,270
<i>F-Father?</i>

251
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,590
<i>No!</i>

252
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,420
Okay, let's play some other time.

253
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,990
Okay.

254
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,150
What?

255
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,680
Kang Hoon, I find men most attractive when they sweat.

256
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,910
What are you talking about?

257
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,850
What do you mean? I want to see you play basketball.

258
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,060
- All of a sudden?
- Yes, all of a sudden.

259
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,960
I really want to see it.

260
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,830
Can you, please?

261
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,500
Are your eyes hurting?

262
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,930
Just once. Play basketball.

263
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,260
You need to exercise. You need to exercise and sweat.

264
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,200
Let's go.

265
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,330
Ahjussi, just once. Please? Basketball.

266
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,680
Kang Hoon, leave now.

267
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,950
- What?
- Right now.

268
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,720
Happy, So Jin?

269
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,850
- Go!
- Start!

270
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,320
Front. Stay.

271
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,600
Nice.

272
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,900
Good.

273
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,790
Seo Kang Hoon! Nice, Kang Hoon! So cool!

274
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,180
You'll need to play hard to make her happy.

275
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,500
Kang Hoon, go! Fighting!

276
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,110
Your fan is scarier than you.

277
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,410
Let's go! You look great!

278
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,910
She's too much today.

279
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,710
<i>Run a little more. A little more.</i>

280
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,540
Hey, pass! Pass! No. 7! No. 7!

281
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,090
No. 7! No. 7!

282
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,280
Okay, nice! Nice!

283
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,620
Okay!

284
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,990
Darn it. No. Good job!

285
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,990
That's right. Do that.

286
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,800
<i>That's right. Keep running.</i>

287
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,350
<i>Nice. A little more. Keep running.</i>

288
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,760
That's it.

289
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,160
That's the real deal.

290
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,450
<i>That's right. That's right.</i>

291
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,370
<i>That's right.</i>

292
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,270
<i>No! No!</i>

293
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,300
<i>I need to collect that.</i>

294
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,090
<i>Gosh, what a waste.</i>

295
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,940
<i>That's mine!</i>

296
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,570
That was the real deal.

297
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,440
Gosh.

298
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,220
Fighting! Fighting! Fighting!

299
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,130
<i>Thank you.</i>

300
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,650
Thank you. Good game.

301
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,100
Are you sure you haven't played in a while? You were good.

302
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,710
- Really?
- Yes, you were.

303
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,580
Why aren't you No. 23 today?

304
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,140
I needed the lucky number seven today.

305
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,590
Winners, we're having dinner afterward.

306
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,530
- Should we take a shower and go?
- Hyung, I'm sorry.

307
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:21,230
I have a plan tonight. How about tomorrow?

308
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,370
You little bastard. You're meeting a woman again, aren't you?

309
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,300
You always have to leave halfway.

310
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,030
How about you? You're coming, right?

311
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,530
Hey, where did our goddess of victory go?

312
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,910
Hyung, I'm sorry.

313
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,020
I need to go back to the restaurant, too. Let's eat later.

314
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,370
You two should go instead.

315
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,550
Yes, take him with you. Hurry.

316
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,410
Just forget it.

317
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,650
I don't need you. Don't touch me. I don't need you.

318
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,680
Should we get a beverage instead?

319
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,120
Let go. I don't want you.

320
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,890
<i>You didn't forget the show tonight, right? See you at eight.</i>

321
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,830
<i>You think a beverage could comfort me?</i>

322
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,150
<i>I'll get you something tasty. I'll get you two.</i>

323
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,380
<i>Two, my foot.</i>

324
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,540
<i>There are many people here...</i>

325
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,550
This is my chance.

326
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,470
His number was...

327
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,780
Seven. It was seven.

328
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,730
Seven. Seven. Seven. Shit...

329
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,150
I'll have the elephant one.

330
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,780
Okay. Let's have five of those. The same one.

331
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,190
Where's seven? Seven!

332
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,870
What's she doing?

333
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,300
Here.

334
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,530
I'm almost there. Almost there. Here I go.

335
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,150
<i>Put the sweaty shirt in a vacuum flask</i>

336
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,680
<i>and ferment the scent.</i>

337
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,110
<i>The fermented smell will become the person's unique scent.</i>

338
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,230
<i>How much you like the scent will tell you</i>

339
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,530
<i>how close he is to becoming your DNA lover.</i>

340
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:18,140
<i>It's because his sweat scent contains his immunity gene.</i>

341
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,740
<i>Women recognize her man's immunity gene for her offspring.</i>

342
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,960
DNA lover. DNA lover.

343
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,610
DNA lover! DNA lover!

344
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,170
<i>DNA lover!</i>

345
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,710
Shim Yeon.

346
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,560
He's the man I mentioned before.

347
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Nice to meet you. I'm Shim Yeon Woo. Congratulations on your show.

348
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,620
- Thank you.
- I really like your work.

349
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,090
What an honor.

350
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,770
By the way, which one did you like so much?

351
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,980
Are you attracted to the baby one because you're an obstetrician?

352
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,560
Is that so?

353
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,780
Most of these paintings were inspired by my pregnancy and childbirth.

354
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,190
Could you tell me what feelings you get from it?

355
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,350
Yes.

356
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:32,680
The mother's face looks scared but also very sad.

357
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,660
Does she have postpartum depression?

358
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,720
I depicted how I felt when I had my first child.

359
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,400
It felt like she would pierce my heart like a nail and stab me.

360
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,260
She grabbed me by my ankles and broke my wings.

361
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:55,160
It felt like she would eat me alive and create my grave.

362
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,250
Mi Eun must feel sad hearing that.

363
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeon Woo, Mom and I don't share a drop of blood.

364
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,140
- I'm sorry.
- We're social mother and daughter.

365
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,570
We all have someone we respect.

366
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,740
Someone you wish she were your mom.

367
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,280
Someone I would've loved to have as my mom.

368
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,830
I wouldn't have created this painting if Mi Eun were my daughter.

369
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:29,390
My husband and my children were like a wall to me.

370
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,080
I need to go because the reporters are here.

371
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,750
- See you again.
- Take care.

372
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,630
<i>Did the painter get divorced?</i>

373
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,290
Her husband passed away.

374
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,510
I heard she has two daughters,

375
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,500
but I've never seen them at her shows.

376
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,930
I think they basically cut ties.

377
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,270
That might be easier for them.

378
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,310
It seems that I like her,

379
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,440
but I don't like her.

380
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,090
You have someone. What's she like?

381
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,590
She's just a person, not a woman to me.

382
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,190
- She's like a stalker.
- What?

383
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,190
She's a researcher. The nerd I mentioned before.

384
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:44,980
I see. She has an intriguing appeal.

385
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,760
You feel uncomfortable, but you're drawn to her.

386
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,130
I've never felt this way before.

387
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm curious.

388
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,870
It's 10 weeks old. The ultrasound doesn't show anything unusual.

389
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,290
Congratulations. It's growing up in good health.

390
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,110
- Really, Doctor?
- Yes.

391
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,470
By the way, there's something I'm worried about.

392
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,920
My baby's late grandpa went blind.

393
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,240
Let's do a DNA test. Our hospital provides it.

394
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
How does it work?

395
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,620
It won't hurt the baby, right?

396
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,910
We won't test the fetus directly. Don't worry.

397
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,130
You and your husband need to do a DNA test first.

398
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,320
You can visit the hospital together.

399
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,400
But the baby's father is too busy.

400
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,650
Let's get your blood sample first, and we'll test with a kit for the father.

401
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,400
Nurse Eo Jin Seon will explain everything to you.

402
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,620
Yes. By the way, if you don't mind me asking,

403
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:21,380
could you tell me what your fetus name was?

404
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,110
I want to have a son like you.

405
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,080
We don't know if it's a boy or a girl yet.

406
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,270
But I...

407
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,600
It was "Shinhon*."
(Means "newlywed")

408
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,990
My mother named me that because she wished they would be like newlyweds forever.

409
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,200
Shinhon?

410
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,000
That's pretty. I'll name my fetus that, too.

411
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,480
Okay. We need to do a test for the genetic disorder.

412
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,830
Get a blood sample and send it to Irowoon immediately.

413
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:29,770
What's the deal?

414
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,400
<i>Knock, knock. Ms. Han.</i>

415
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,840

Isn't that Team Leader Han?

427
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,580
What did she have for lunch today?

428
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,760
She had spicy pork.

<i>I've never smelled this from any other DNA lover candidates.</i>

434
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,670
<i>It's a sweet and subtle scent.</i>

435
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,650
<i>It leaves me longing intensely. It's a powerful scent.</i>

436
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,140
Did you smell it?

437
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,890
Can someone be your DNA lover if the pheromone is to your liking?

438
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,160
It smells like the sewer.

439
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,980
Really? It smells like the sewer?

440
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,720
Yes, that's it.

441
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,680
God couldn't have made the 23 pairs and 46 chromosomes so simple.

442
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,800
Calm down, Han So Jin.

443
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,080
This only means he passed the first step.

444
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,040
What's the next step, then?

445
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,070
I need to confirm something before moving on to the next step.

446
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,810
The promiscuous Octo-gene, which makes you cheat, isn't allowed.

447
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:26,030
That's your favorite gene. You'll be reunited with it in the end.

448
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,320
That's why I want to check that first.

449
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,050
I'll check if he has the promiscuous Octo-gene that he can't go a day without a woman.

450
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,010
He smells like the sewer, but if he cheats, too...

451
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,370
That's the worst.

452
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,100
But I need his consent first.

453
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,490
How do I get that?

454
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,890
Is someone speaking ill of me today? My left ear is so itchy.

455
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,310
There must be countless women who speak ill of you.

456
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,280
Well, that means they're interested in me in a way.

457
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,110
Should we have the team dinner at Munggi tonight?

458
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,780
I'll call Kang Hoon.

459
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,290
Invite the goddess of victory, too.

460
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,470
Who?

461
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,830
Bring So Jin, too?

462
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,370
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

463
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,850
Hey...

464
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,340
We're just having dinner. You didn't have to change.

465
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,300
I felt gross after being in the lab all night.

466
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,970
There he is.

467
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,950
Let's wait inside.

468
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,330
Okay.

469
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,770
<i>The powerful pheromone.</i>

470
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,730
<i>He can't have the promiscuous Octo-gene, right?</i>

471
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,530
<i>He definitely looks like the popular type.</i>

472
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,670
<i>A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved!</i>

473
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,100
I'd get rejected even before I get to try.

474
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,460
Right. That's right.

475
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,280
Not too bad.

476
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,290
Yes, the past is supposed to be forgotten.

477
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,950
Shouldn't you come every week?

478
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,010
But this place is...

479
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:42,850
You have to be a good dancer.

480
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,800
- Don't be so rash.
- Got it.

481
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,330
- It's not easy, okay?
- Okay.

482
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,760
Try dancing now.

483
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,740
So Jin is here. Let's raise our glasses.

484
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,310
Hand me your glass.

485
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,940
Thank you for cheering for our team.

486
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,850
Don't mention it.

487
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,280
Let's put our glasses together.

488
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,850
We came.

489
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,090
We went. We fought. We won.

490
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,080
<i>We won!</i>

491
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

492
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,770
Let me do it for you, Ms. Han.

493
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,230
Okay.

494
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,470
Have some, Ms. Han.

495
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:36,620
- Thank you.
- Eat this, too.

496
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,240
Since when did you like octopus? We seem to have something in common.

497
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,470
I don't like octopus.

498
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,880
They have sex with their legs because their genitalia is located there.

499
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,250
- Pardon?
- What?

500
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:59,030
The male octopus approaches the female while in disguise.

501
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,810
Only to the young and not fully developed octopuses.

502
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,730
I have a different opinion.

503
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,860
Octopuses can relate to each other and have strong maternal instincts.

504
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,800
They're strong-hearted because they have three of them.

505
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,040
They have three hearts.

506
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,470
But I don't get why they make love with their legs instead.

507
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,960
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,330
The gene I'm studying these days is named after octopus.

509
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,800
It's a combination of "promiscuous" and "octopus."

510
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,300
It's the promiscuous Octo-gene.

511
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,680
There's a gene that makes humans genetically cheaters.

512
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,630
<i>She must've been betrayed by a cheater before.</i>

513
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:47,700
Do you really believe there's a cheating gene?

514
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,950
I don't believe it. It exists.

515
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:54,340
The dopamine receptor in chromosome 11 is the promiscuous Octo-gene.

516
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,640
Most people have two,

517
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,140
but some have four, and some even have seven of them.

518
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,060
You should get a DNA test, too.

519
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,500
You always have more of everything.

520
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,290
He has many hobbies, girlfriends-

521
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:12,880
I know. Ms. Han must know best if I have the promiscuous Octo-gene or not.

522
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,370
Pardon?

523
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,840
Me?

524
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,100
How?

525
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,650
I asked you to do a DNA test last time.

526
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,870
Oh, that?

527
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:32,000
We destroy all personal information after the goal of the test has been met.

528
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,750
I don't do DNA tests for personal reasons.

529
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:43,390
A researcher I know stole a man's uniform.

530
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,210
What could've been the purpose?

531
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:49,860
She was like this.

532
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,540
I'm not sure. I suppose some people do that.

533
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,360
Gosh.

534
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,030
Are you okay?

535
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,190
Give me water.

536
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,620
Keep coughing. Are you okay?

537
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,790
Cough out the octopus.

538
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,630
What's with you?

539
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,660
This is no good.

540
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,570
Let me help you.

541
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,490
What are you doing right now?

542
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,040
I'll push you five times. Keep trying to cough.

543
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,470
You don't have to do this...

544
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,700
I'll start.

545
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,300
- One, two...
- Hold on. Hold on.

546
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,580
three, four...

547
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,070
five.

548
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,920
Good job.

549
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,950
It must've been hard. Good job.

550
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,480
Pour me a glass.

551
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:21,006
Do you need my help again?

552
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,676
I think you have something to return.

553
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:35,946
Pardon? What do you mean...

554
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:46,336
I see why you could misunderstand. But it's not like that.

555
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:49,776
I'll clean it well and give it back to you.

556
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:57,026
W-What is it?

557
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:06,736
By chance, is that your kink...

558
00:42:06,736 --> 00:42:11,676
Pardon? K-Kink? No, it's not like that.

559
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,776
I'll tell you. To be honest-

560
00:42:13,776 --> 00:42:15,566
I'm listening.

561
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:28,646
The immunity gene is mixed in the sweat, and you develop a unique scent.

562
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:33,976
And depending on the MHC genes in the immunological product,

563
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:37,556
the smell of that person attracts some people.

564
00:42:37,566 --> 00:42:40,266
- It leads to attraction?
- Yes, attraction. That's it.

565
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,976
Do you need to smell someone to know that?

566
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,896
No, it's not that. Biologically-

567
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,076
How was my smell, then?

568
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:53,196
Well... The thing is...

569
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:00,676
I liked your...

570
00:43:01,956 --> 00:43:03,786
smell, Dr. Shim.

571
00:43:08,096 --> 00:43:11,916
When we fell from the hospital rooftop, your smell...

572
00:43:12,746 --> 00:43:17,206
<i>felt so vivid that I could almost see it.</i>

573
00:43:18,216 --> 00:43:20,836
I've never felt that.

574
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:24,366
And I wanted to find out why.

575
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:29,126
That's why I stole your uniform.

576
00:43:29,126 --> 00:43:31,856
I'm so sorry.

577
00:43:31,856 --> 00:43:36,396
I wanted to experiment to see if I was mistaken or not.

578
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:44,526
Ms. Han,

579
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:47,606
are you confessing your love for me right now?

580
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,826
Pardon? Love? No.

581
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,166
It's just that I-

582
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,616
Noona, let's get going.

583
00:43:54,616 --> 00:43:55,926
Get up. Let's go.

584
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:57,476
Okay, let's go.

585
00:43:57,476 --> 00:43:59,776
I should get going, too.

586
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:01,906
Ms. Han,

587
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:05,276
I'll drive you home if it's on the way.

588
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:08,806
No, she lives near me. She can go with me.

589
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:10,936
I'll make sure to return your shirt.

590
00:44:10,936 --> 00:44:14,206
Looks like you need it for your experiment. Just keep it.

591
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:16,536
I think you need it more than I do.

592
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:18,546
What are you talking about?

593
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:21,086
It's nothing. Let's go.

594
00:44:22,386 --> 00:44:23,956
I'll go.

595
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:48,276
Why did it have to be an octopus?

596
00:44:48,276 --> 00:44:50,956
Why did you get stuck inside my throat then?

597
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,756
Octopus, octopus, octopus!

598
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,556
What do you have against me?

599
00:44:59,636 --> 00:45:01,276
[Cheater gene]

600
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:03,246
[Promiscuous Octo-gene, go away!]

601
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:19,536
The Heimlich maneuver. Was it really necessary?

602
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:22,946
He touches people so naturally.

603
00:45:22,946 --> 00:45:24,836
He's totally an octopus, isn't he?

604
00:45:24,836 --> 00:45:31,126
He knew I had stolen the uniform, but he was testing me.

605
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,646
Yes, I need to know for sure.

606
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:39,026
I need to do the promiscuous Octo-gene test.

607
00:45:39,026 --> 00:45:41,966
I'll run the test with the uniform for now.

608
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,976
Should I just do it? No.

609
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,826
I can't do it without his consent.

610
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,756
I could get into trouble for this.

611
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:50,716
But what if he doesn't agree to it? What do I do then?

612
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:53,276
That'd be bad!

613
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,256
Let me sleep.

614
00:45:57,256 --> 00:45:59,356
Let me sleep!

615
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:06,766
Why did you call me on my day off?

616
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:10,376
You practically live in the gym if I don't invite you out.

617
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,466
What's wrong with that?

618
00:46:12,466 --> 00:46:14,626
We'll have another serving of soondae.

619
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,506
What's that?

620
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,426
It's a fire.

621
00:46:23,426 --> 00:46:25,396
Let me borrow this water, sir.

622
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,566
- Let's go.
- I'll evacuate the victim.

623
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:30,066
- Notify the station for me!
- Okay!

624
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:36,256
No, I want it to be casual, like a handbook.

625
00:46:44,086 --> 00:46:46,116
Evacuate this way! This way!

626
00:46:46,116 --> 00:46:48,456
Stay calm! Stay calm!

627
00:46:51,406 --> 00:46:53,066
It's okay.

628
00:46:54,226 --> 00:46:55,656
Anyone inside?

629
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:58,156
Yell if you're inside!

630
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:03,286
I know.

631
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:05,226
<i>Is anyone inside?</i>

632
00:47:06,106 --> 00:47:07,856
<i>Is anyone inside?</i>

633
00:47:08,566 --> 00:47:09,746
Is anyone inside?

634
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,276
Who are you-

635
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:12,506
Didn't you hear the fire warning?

636
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:14,546
No, I didn't.

637
00:47:16,496 --> 00:47:18,396
Is the emergency speaker just a decoration?

638
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:19,696
You can't just disconnect that.

639
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:21,436
It was disconnected since I moved in.

640
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:23,676
Let's head out. It's dangerous to inhale smoke.

641
00:47:23,676 --> 00:47:26,826
Cover your nose and mouth. Lower your body and follow me.

642
00:47:34,336 --> 00:47:36,076
Lower your body!

643
00:47:39,076 --> 00:47:41,476
Be careful. Just one moment.

644
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:45,236
Yes, Sunbae. I found a tenant on the eighth floor.

645
00:47:45,236 --> 00:47:46,816
We're in the emergency stairway.

646
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:49,006
We need to go down, but I can't see anything.

647
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:50,536
<i>The stairs are still safe.</i>

648
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:51,836
<i>The Team Leader came and stopped the fire.</i>

649
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:54,286
Okay, I'll be right there.

650
00:47:55,536 --> 00:47:58,166
Don't get scared and hold my arm tightly.

651
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,486
I need to guess we're going.

652
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:01,736
We'd both be in danger if you lose me.

653
00:48:03,276 --> 00:48:04,796
Let's go.

654
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:12,776
Stay calm.

655
00:48:15,316 --> 00:48:16,906
Stay calm.

656
00:48:20,786 --> 00:48:22,756
Hurry!

657
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:29,076
Are you okay? We're almost there. Hang in there.

658
00:48:30,676 --> 00:48:32,286
That way.

659
00:48:34,146 --> 00:48:35,756
Watch your head.

660
00:48:37,336 --> 00:48:38,846
Are you okay?

661
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:41,906
<i>Hold my arm tightly.</i>

662
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,926
You inhaled a lot of smoke.

663
00:48:44,926 --> 00:48:48,066
Make sure to see a doctor, just in case.

664
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:51,216
Are you okay?

665
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:52,636
Yes, I'm okay.

666
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:54,526
She was on the site for a long time.

667
00:48:54,526 --> 00:48:56,636
Please treat her accordingly.

668
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:58,566
- H-Hold on-
- Your airway might be damaged.

669
00:48:58,566 --> 00:48:59,946
Could you try talking?

670
00:48:59,946 --> 00:49:01,586
What's your name?

671
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:04,706
J-Jang Mi Eun.

672
00:49:08,696 --> 00:49:13,416
<i>Shim Gynecology puts the parents and children first.</i>

673
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:17,136
<i>I'll be there throughout pregnancy and childbirth...</i>

674
00:49:17,136 --> 00:49:20,246
I'll get him to consent, no matter what.

675
00:49:20,246 --> 00:49:23,906
<i>We'll try our best so you can trust us...</i>

676
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:27,686
Yes.

677
00:49:27,686 --> 00:49:31,556
<i>Ms. Han So Jin of Irowoon DNA Center is here.</i>

678
00:49:31,556 --> 00:49:33,066
Okay.

679
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,746
I have a sample of a hair growth restrictor.

680
00:49:41,746 --> 00:49:43,266
I'm sorry for making you wait.

681
00:49:43,266 --> 00:49:46,326
It took you a long time. I thought you gave up.

682
00:49:47,866 --> 00:49:51,396
These are the samples custom-made to your DNA.

683
00:49:51,396 --> 00:49:53,826
Oh, is that so?

684
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:55,526
Let me test it.

685
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:03,886
Well, that's not how you apply it.

686
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:06,746
- How do you do it, then?
- Just one moment.

687
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:24,396
You're smelling my pheromone again, aren't you?

688
00:50:26,586 --> 00:50:28,796
I'm not.

689
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:33,346
Each strand of hair needs to absorb the restrictor.

690
00:50:36,876 --> 00:50:39,066
There. You're done.

691
00:50:53,436 --> 00:50:56,186
Dr. Shim, have you...

692
00:50:56,186 --> 00:51:01,346
been strongly attracted to a woman's scent before?

693
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:09,436
You're asking what kind of scent I like in women, right?

694
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:14,076
If you don't mind, could you tell me what you think of my scent?

695
00:51:18,226 --> 00:51:20,416
I can't smell from here.

696
00:51:21,676 --> 00:51:23,476
Do you want to come closer?

697
00:51:43,406 --> 00:51:48,326
Whoa, I... Dr. Shim, I have a favor to ask.

698
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:51,256
- What is it?
- Well...

699
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:56,956
I would like to do a DNA test on you.

700
00:51:56,956 --> 00:51:59,556
- Could you sign the consent-
- But you already did it.

701
00:51:59,556 --> 00:52:01,926
This isn't about hair growth.

702
00:52:01,926 --> 00:52:06,816
I want to find out about you in detail.

703
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:16,086
To be honest, all of my exes had the promiscuous Octo-gene

704
00:52:16,086 --> 00:52:19,566
and they all cheated on me because it became active.

705
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:29,556
That's why I want to find out if you have that gene.

706
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:32,866
Promiscuous Octo-gene?

707
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:35,286
That's what you mentioned last time.

708
00:52:36,726 --> 00:52:38,616
Ms. Han,

709
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:44,846
you talked about attraction through scents last time.

710
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:48,216
