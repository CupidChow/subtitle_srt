Dad!

10
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,578
Dad, I'm here.

11
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,520
Get up, Dad!

(Sim General Hospital)

13
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,938
I'm so scared...

14
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,209
Excuse me, Ms. Han So Jin?

15
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,010
Try opening your eyes first.

16
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,909
Are they open?

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,010
- Are they open? - Yes.

18
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,650
Then can you let go now?

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
What?

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,689
You're so reckless.

21
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,899
Why am I lying down like this?

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,829
I think I might be able to explain if you get off me.

23
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,939
I'm sorry!

24
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,180
What is this? So Jin?

25
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,709
Han So Jin!

26
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,519
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,829
Why are you always so nosy? Why were you up there?

28
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,559
Some people faint while falling.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,199
Some even suffer heart attacks.

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,828
If you're unlucky, you could miss the mattress...

31
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,370
and suffer from aortic rupture.

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,339
Ms. Han might not be lucky,

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,810
but I tend to have luck.

34
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,879
How do the two of you know each other?

35
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,249
You need to see a doctor first. Both of you.

36
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,150
- No way. - I'm fine.

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,229
But she made it.

38
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,129
We don't want to see anyone else die in front of our eyes again.

39
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,129
I won't ever let that happen again.

40
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,009
Just a minute.

41
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,949
Mr. Sim!

42
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,579
I thought you were dead.

43
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,349
- Are you okay? - Yes. I'm fine.

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,449
Are you all right?

45
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,759
Let me check on you first.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,759
Knowing Yeon Woo,

47
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,699
I know he'll save Ms. Yoo.

48
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,370
As far as I know,

49
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,039
he deeply cares for his patients.

50
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:25,509
What are you doing?

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,849
- What? - I said, what are you doing?

52
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,878
- I... - Hurry.

53
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,319
I fell with my nose in his armpit.

54
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,658
- His sweat stank. - Darn it.

55
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,129
You were between life and death, and you were smelling his sweat?

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,699
Exactly, I find it strange too.

57
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,759
But...

58
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:55,569
It smelled nice.

59
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,430
Dad. Have a shot.

60
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,899
I won't let you drink alone today.

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Here.

62
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,939
One for me too.

63
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,319
This is so strong!

64
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,230
How did you drink this every day?

65
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,799
- You! - Ouch.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,170
Didn't I tell you not to drink at a place like this?

67
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,138
We received a report of an abduction...

68
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,179
of a female college student around here.

69
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,420
Hey. Do you have a tracker on me or something?

70
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,149
I know all your pit stops.

71
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,888
Gosh.

72
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,160
What?

73
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,300
I told you not to cry by yourself.

74
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,000
Get up. Let's go to our restaurant. I'll make you some noodles.

75
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,939
I already knew...

76
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,769
Dad would die.

77
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,550
He freed his bird...

78
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,550
and gave away the plants he loved to our neighbours.

79
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,860
I knew he couldn't drink hard liquor,

80
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,759
but he bought kaoliang liquor from the store every day.

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,800
I knew it all.

82
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
But...

83
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,110
I acted clueless...

84
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:19,620
because Dad looked so unhappy.

85
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:25,389
Me, So Ri, and Mom...

86
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:29,660
We hated Dad for being in love with someone else.

87
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,269
I hated him for saying he wanted to die.

88
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,910
I'm the biggest sinner.

89
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,778
- So Jin. - He didn't call any of us...

90
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,449
before he died.

91
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,850
Not me, So Ri, nor Mom.

92
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,459
None of us would've given him...

93
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,129
the reason to live anyway.

94
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:19,110
Dad!

95
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,179
Did you see that? He just breathed out!

96
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,179
Did you see? I saw him breathe out with his nose.

97
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,149
It's the air that was sitting in his lungs coming out.

98
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,449
Kang Hoon.

99
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,518
Please save Dad.

100
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,829
Just for ten minutes.

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,930
No, even just a minute.

102
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,660
I have something to say to him.

103
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,170
I have to tell him I'm sorry.

104
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,670
I have to ask for his forgiveness.

105
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,069
I have to tell him I love him.

106
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,279
I never got to tell him...

107
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,878
Dad, wake up.

108
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,149
Dad, I'm here. Get up, Dad!

109
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,769
So Jin.

110
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,310
Just find a man like your dad.

111
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,810
Someone who loves you dearly.

112
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,680
Someone who sticks by your side...

113
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,019
until you get sick of him.

114
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,220
I want you to be happy.

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,490
Because everyone I save...

116
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,029
has to be happy.

117
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,870
But I couldn't save...

118
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:51,769
your dad.

119
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,649
Is that why you're still saving people?

120
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,370
Here.

121
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,470
It's an herbal hot pack.

122
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,379
Microwave it for two minutes, and put it on the shoulder and back.

123
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,279
I'm not so good with heat...

124
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,179
I think he might be in more pain than I am right now.

125
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,918
He? Who?

126
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,950
Mr. Sim.

127
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,778
That single moment to meet each other...

128
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,980
That one moment where they can meet...

129
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,149
could be the most precious thing in the world.

130
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,289
Might be more precious than forever.

131
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,059
Why did I suddenly say that?

132
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,100
But being nosy...

133
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,700
saved a life.

134
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,850
That single moment to meet each other...

135
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,450
might be more precious than forever.

136
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,519
He remembered what I said.

137
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:54,830
If they could breathe again even if it's just for a minute,

138
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,259
I'd do everything for them and tell them I love them.

139
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,730
I could give up my life for them.

140
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,169
I know how it feels.

141
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,639
But she made it.

142
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,610
We don't want to see anyone else die...

143
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,440
in front of our eyes again.

144
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,309
Right...

145
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,750
It's none of my business.

146
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:22,950
Are you all right?

147
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,019
Let me check on you first.

148
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,439
(Episode 3: The Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene)

149
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,569
- Hands up. Jab. - Next. Body.

150
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,908
- One, two. - One, two.

151
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,179
- Jab, one, two. - Okay, straight.

152
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,778
- One, two. Okay. - Jab.

153
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,148
- One, two, right. - Jab.

154
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,678
- Jab, one, two. - One, two. Duck.

155
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,219
- One, two. - One, two.

156
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,349
One, two, duck. Focus.

157
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,689
- Focus. - Okay.

158
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,589
We'll go from one, two, duck, to weave.

159
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,590
Ready, go.

160
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:02,658
One, two, duck, weave!

161
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:03,659
How wild.

162
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,428
You have to focus.

163
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,128
- Stop looking out the window. - Sung Mi.

164
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,199
Why not just kill that sandbag?

165
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,999
Just rip them all open, won't you?

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,898
Do you want to spar with Do Wan?

167
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,139
I could give you some guidance.

168
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,440
I'd love to.

169
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,679
Shall we see how good you are, Do Wan?

170
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,048
Go easy on him. You'll kill someone if you hit people like you do bags.

171
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,980
Let's stay healthy and pure.

172
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,919
Fight!

173
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,450
- Fight! - Yes!

174
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,719
That's it. Go.

175
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,729
- Get into position. - Let's go!

176
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,929
Position yourself.

177
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,830
Move.

178
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,929
Let's go!

179
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,429
That's it!

180
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,500
Focus!

181
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,110
No, move out!

182
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,408
Stop! Enough!

183
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,808
Stop hitting her!

184
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,820
What?

185
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,350
That's it!

186
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,990
Good!

187
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,690
Nice! Yes! Nam Sung Mi won!

188
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,759
Hey. He must be a huge fan of yours, Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

189
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,268
No, I just...

190
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,229
You won and all, so give your fan some love.

191
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,799
What are you talking about?

192
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,138
Should I give him some love instead?

193
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,610
- Here, take this! - Hey!

194
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,259
I'm sorry. Please hand it back.

195
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,690
No, that's okay.

196
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,159
I'll put it in the towel collection bin.

197
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,330
Wait...

198
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,470
Darn it.

199
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,289
(Iroun Genetic Center)

200
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,759
A Ri.

201
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,490
Hear me out.

202
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,859
It was an impossible situation,

203
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,299
but I could somehow smell a scent on that man.

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,469
What could be that scent?

205
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,539
Are you on about scents again?

206
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,509
You'll have to test it out to see if it's real or not.

207
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,980
Just dip him in.

208
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,349
- "Dip him?" - Yes.

209
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,919
Dip him in alcohol.

210
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:42,419
A Ri?

211
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,018
So Jin. I read this in a book somewhere.

212
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,418
They put the human body in alcohol,

213
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,959
and the alcohol can extract...

214
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,830
the human scent.

215
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,940
A Ri, I'm not in the mood for strange jokes.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,870
How can you put a human in alcohol?

217
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,980
That's a great idea.

218
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,808
- What? - That's right.

219
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,220
The brave always finds their fate.

220
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,548
Right... I was talking about a serial killer.

221
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:16,648
Sorry about that.

222
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,490
I'm going to steal...

223
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,360
that scent.

224
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:23,659
Not again...

225
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,029
What is it? What's the matter?

226
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,539
I started an affair today.

227
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,039
A tank cut into my lane.

228
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,070
What are you talking about?

229
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,809
Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist's name is Nam Sung Mi.

230
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,709
You told me to try having an affair,

231
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,979
so I signed up at a boxing gym.

232
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,220
Is her name Nam Sung Mi?

233
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,350
Really? How was it?

234
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,120
Great. It was nice. I mean her scent.

235
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,289
What is this? What scent?

236
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,459
Anyway, be careful.

237
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,628
If they suddenly cut in front, they might make a sudden stop.

238
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,768
Keep your balance or you'll fall.

239
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,129
I can take care of myself.

240
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,638
You know we're playing a basketball game...

241
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,908
against Energetic Urologists, right?

242
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,480
Right, was that today?

243
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,908
But Nurse Pyo is out on reserve forces training.

244
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,850
Darn it, Nurse Pyo.

245
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,820
That means we're one man short. What do we do?

246
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,519
There's no one else from my department.

247
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,689
Hey, let's get someone external.

248
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,759
I know someone...

249
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,029
who is a firefighter and is into martial arts.

250
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,159
- Who? - A firefighter?

251
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,399
I can bring someone external.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,668
No! Their ace is 2m tall.

253
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:38,569
They'll be hard to fight against.

254
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,210
Only Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist can beat them.

255
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:44,579
Do you know someone?

256
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,110
They better top Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

257
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,110
Here's your order.

258
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,679
Thank you.

259
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,779
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

260
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,649
Please give me a bottle of sake.

261
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,220
- Sure. - Sure.

262
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:02,429
Thank you.

263
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,730
What's with you today?

264
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,099
Did you do something wrong again?

265
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,199
No.

266
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,440
You look busy, so I'm just trying to help.

267
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,109
I'm not busy.

268
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,819
- Give it to me. - Okay.

269
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,650
Thanks.

270
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,089
How come your friends never visit your restaurant?

271
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,258
It'd be nice for them to boost your sales.

272
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:37,758
My friends? Many came already.

273
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:38,759
Really?

274
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,229
But what about that doctor...

275
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,630
from Sim General Hospital?

276
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,098
Yeon Woo?

277
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,900
Right. Mr. Sim Yeon Woo.

278
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,808
Does he come here often?

279
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, he comes from time to time.

280
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,410
But...

281
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,779
why are you asking?

282
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,119
What? No reason...

283
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,389
You two looked close that day.

284
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,559
How do you know each other?

285
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,630
(Yeon Woo)

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,230
Look who's calling.

287
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,299
Hey.

288
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,440
Today?

289
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,140
Why? Is something going on?

290
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,109
Basketball?

291
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,539
"Basketball?"

292
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,750
If they play basketball,

293
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:33,450
I'd be able to collect sweat which holds the human scent.

294
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:35,819
That's it!

295
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,389
I'm helping my dad at the restaurant, so I can't.

296
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,490
His dad?

297
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,259
No...

298
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,730
Yes. Let's play together next time.

299
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,359
Okay.

300
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,139
What?

301
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Kang Hoon.

302
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:56,539
I think a man looks the hottest when they're sweating.

303
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,179
- What are you talking about? - What do you think?

304
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,749
I mean I want to see you play basketball.

305
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,809
- All of a sudden? - Yes, all of a sudden.

306
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,549
I really want to watch you.

307
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,079
Won't you let me?

308
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,490
Please?

309
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,019
Do your eyes hurt?

310
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,959
Just this once. Let's play basketball.

311
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,358
You should exercise. You should break a sweat.

312
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,630
Come on, let's go. Please?

313
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,669
Mister, please let him go this once.

314
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,940
Let him play basketball.

315
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,369
Hurry up and go, Kang Hoon.

316
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:31,939
- What? - Now.

317
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,710
- Are you happy, So Jin? - Yes.

318
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,410
Jump ball.

319
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,249
- In front of you. - Pass.

320
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,259
Nice.

321
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,559
Good!

322
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,089
Go, Kang Hoon!

323
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,828
You're doing so well, Kang Hoon! You're so cool!

324
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,670
You better play well today to repay her.

325
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,528
Hang in there, Kang Hoon!

326
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,098
I'm more scared of your fan than you.

327
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,298
Kang Hoon! You're so cool!

328
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,069
Why is she overdoing it?

329
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,809
Nice.

330
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,578
That's it. Run a bit more.

331
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:14,619
Hey.

332
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:18,859
Yes, okay.

333
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:21,929
Hey, pass!

334
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,759
Pass to number seven!

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,299
Steal the ball.

336
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,399
Okay.

337
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,900
That fool... No.

338
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,569
- Good job... - That's it.

339
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,869
- Pass. - Defend.

340
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,440
That's it. Just like that.

341
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,838
Good, keep running.

342
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,508
Good. A bit more. Keep running.

343
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,549
Nice!

344
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,150
That's it...

345
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:51,219
- Hey. - Over here.

346
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,490
That's real.

347
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,430
That's it... Yes, that's it.

348
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,528
Gosh...

349
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,730
No!

350
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,239
I have to get that.

351
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,970
What a waste!

352
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,410
It's mine!

353
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,380
That's real sweat...

354
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,479
Gosh. No...

355
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,219
Let's go!

356
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,159
- Good game. - Good game.

357
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,588
- See you again. - Good game.

358
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:29,629
- Good game. - Good throwing.

359
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,758
- Thank you. - Likewise.

360
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,959
Hey, I thought you haven't played in a while.

361
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,098
- You were good. - I almost died.

362
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,298
- Really? - Yes. You were good.

363
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:36,500
I'm dying.

364
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,568
Why aren't you wearing number 23 today?

365
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:41,039
Today? I needed lucky number seven today.

366
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,538
Victorious gentlemen. We have a team dinner after this.

367
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:44,539
What?

368
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,609
Oh, no.

369
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,249
I have plans today. Should we do it tomorrow?

370
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,379
You arrogant punk. You're seeing a girl again, aren't you?

371
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,819
He already dips out in the middle.

372
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,819
How about you? You're coming, right?

373
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,618
Hey. Where's our goddess of victory?

374
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,919
Jung Tam. I'm sorry.

375
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,058
I have to go to the store right now. Let's eat together another time.

376
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,499
- But you two should go. - Yes. Take him out to eat.

377
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,759
Hey. Forget it.

378
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:09,969
I don't need you guys. Don't touch me.

379
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,439
- I don't need you guys. - We could...

380
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,568
have something to drink.

381
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,969
- Let go. - Wait.

382
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,140
I don't even want to anymore.

383
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,038
You didn't forget about today's exhibition, right?

384
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,838
- See you at 8pm. - Let's go.

385
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,778
Do you think a beverage will make me feel better?

386
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,910
I'll buy you a nice one. I'll buy you two.

387
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,319
Two, my foot... Two?

388
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,450
You must be thirsty.

389
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,589
This is my chance

390
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,730
He was number...

391
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,200
seven. He was number seven.

392
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,469
Number seven.

393
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,739
Gosh.

394
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,209
I want Pocari Sweat.

395
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,909
Okay. Five of these.

396
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,109
Let's all get the same one.

397
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,319
Where is number seven?

398
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
Number seven!

399
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,269
What is she doing?

400
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,730
Here.

401
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,349
I'm almost there.

402
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,950
Almost there.

403
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:23,169
Put the T-shirt drenched in sweat in a vacuum flask...

404
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,039
and age the smell.

405
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:28,538
When the smell ages,

406
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,140
it becomes the unique scent of that person's body.

407
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,480
How much you like that scent...

408
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,609
is the way to measure a DNA lover.

409
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,449
That's because body scent from sweat...

410
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,589
is that man's immunity gene.

411
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:49,929
For their future children, women can instinctively recognize...

412
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,529
her man's immunity gene.

413
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,500
DNA lover.

414
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,568
DNA lover!

415
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:05,109
DNA lover!

416
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,279
Oh, my.

417
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,150
Over there.

418
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,849
Hey, Sim Yeon Woo.

419
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,119
This is the guy I mentioned before.

420
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,459
Nice to meet you. I'm Sim Yeon Woo.

421
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,528
Congratulations on the exhibition.

422
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,529
Thank you.

423
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,659
I really like all of your work.

424
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,129
It's an honour.

425
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,798
Which piece do you like so much?

426
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,799
Well...

427
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,640
I see.

428
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,469
Are you drawn to the painting that depicts giving birth...

429
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,609
because you're a gynaecologist?

430
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,210
Is that so?

431
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,848
Most of the pieces in this exhibition...

432
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,119
were inspired by my pregnancy and experience of giving birth.

433
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,219
Could you tell me what you feel from the painting?

434
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,289
Okay. Well...

435
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,720
The face of the mother who gave birth...

436
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,730
seems full of fear but also very sad.

437
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,799
Is it postnatal depression?

438
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,670
I drew how I felt after giving birth to my first child.

439
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,768
The feeling that this child will pierce my heart...

440
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,579
like a nail.

441
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,579
That they'll hold me back, snap my wings,

442
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,119
eat me alive, and dig my grave. That feeling.

443
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:27,519
That must be sad for Mi Eun to hear.

444
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,829
Yeon Woo. Mom and I don't share even a drop of blood.

445
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,399
Oh, my apologies.

446
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,869
We're mother and daughter by social connection.

447
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:41,598
We all have one person we admire.

448
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,768
"I wish she was my mom."

449
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,309
"That must be so nice." Someone like that.

450
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,149
If Mi Eun was my daughter,

451
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,808
I wouldn't have painted something like this.

452
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,680
To me, my husband and children...

453
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,789
felt like a barrier.

454
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,058
Right. I have to go because the reporters are here.

455
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,089
- See you again. - See you again.

456
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,869
Did she get a divorce?

457
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,298
Her husband died.

458
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,508
I heard she had two daughters,

459
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,339
but I've never seen them at her other exhibitions.

460
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,949
It seems they basically cut ties.

461
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,380
That might be more comfortable for them.

462
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,509
I think I like her,

463
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:52,539
but I don't like her.

464
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,008
Someone has caught your eye. What kind of woman is she?

465
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,349
A person, not a woman.

466
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,519
- A stalker. - What?

467
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:05,960
She's a researcher. The otaku I mentioned before.

468
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,529
Right.

469
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,460
A kind of alternative charm.

470
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,799
She's coming on too strong, but you're interested. Am I right?

471
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,269
I've never felt this way before,

472
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,299
so I'm curious.

473
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,450
(Sim General Hospital)

474
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,039
You're ten weeks along,

475
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,339
and there are no abnormal findings in the ultrasound.

476
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,278
Congratulations. Your baby is growing healthily.

477
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,079
- Really, doctor? - Yes.

478
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,019
I do have one thing that I'm worried about.

479
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,390
My baby's deceased grandfather lost his eyesight.

480
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:14,759
I suggest a DNA test. You can do it at our hospital.

481
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,189
How does it work?

482
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,900
It won't harm the baby, right?

483
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:22,969
It's not done directly on the baby, so it's okay. Don't worry.

484
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,199
Before that, the baby's father and you have to do a DNA test.

485
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,910
You can come to the hospital together.

486
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,338
But he's so busy with work.

487
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:35,808
Then we can take your blood first,

488
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,709
and we'll use an at-home kit for the baby's father.

489
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,348
Nurse Eo Jin Seon here will kindly explain everything.

490
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:42,349
Okay.

491
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,950
Doctor. Would it be okay for me to ask...

492
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,160
what your baby nickname was?

493
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,390
I want a son like you.

494
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,789
I see...

495
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:54,960
You don't know whether it's a boy or a girl yet.

496
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,299
Well, but I still...

497
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,839
Well...

498
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,640
It was Sinhon.

499
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,440
They gave me that nickname because my mother wanted...

500
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,579
her and my father to live like newlyweds forever.

501
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,319
Sinhon.

502
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,289
That's pretty. I'll use that baby nickname too.

503
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
Okay.

504
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,489
We have to run the tests for genetic disorders separately,

505
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,959
so get your blood sample first and have it sent here right away.

506
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,569
(Ultrasound Room)

507
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,970
This way.

508
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
What was that?

509
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,348
Knock, knock. Ms. Han So Jin.

510
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:23,490
(Do you like me?)

511
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:30,029
(Did you take my uniform...)

512
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:39,299
(Ms. Han So Jin. Ms. Heo Ga Hee's prenatal tests...)

513
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,380
(Iroun Genetic Center's Han So Jin)

514
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,819
To draw out the scent of the sweat that aged overnight,

515
00:31:55,849 --> 00:31:58,250
add refined alcohol.

516
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,028
Add 1ml of this special reagent...

517
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:05,528
that I perfected after so much trial and error,

518
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,130
vacuum-seal it so it can fully react,

519
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:12,640
and you can collect that person's pheromones.

520
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,749
Good work.

521
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,349
What? Isn't that Ms. Han?

522
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,548
What did she eat for lunch today?

523
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:04,750
Spicy pork.

524
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,930
Sim Yeon Woo. Age, 35.

525
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,230
Job, gynaecologist.

526
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,900
His pheromones...

527
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,140
smelled like paradise.

528
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,309
It was a sweet and longing scent...

529
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,910
that I've never smelled from any other DNA lover candidate.

530
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,159
It makes me feel like my heart will explode from longing.

531
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,789
It's a fatal scent.

532
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,140
Did you smell it?

533
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,009
Does liking someone's pheromones really make them your DNA lover?

534
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,480
Yes.

535
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,079
It smells like a sewer.

536
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,119
Really? It smells like a sewer?

537
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:09,749
Yes, that's it.

538
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,689
There's no way 23 pairs of 46 chromosomes...

539
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,829
can be that simple.

540
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,500
Calm down, Han So Jin.

541
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000
That only means he passed the first test.

542
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,070
What's the next test?

543
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:30,110
There's one thing I must check before going onto the next test.

544
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,579
(Super Teol)

545
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,459
He can't have the Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene...

546
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,859
that makes people flirty.

547
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,158
The Casanova gene is your favourite,

548
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,029
so you'll meet it again someday.

549
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,268
That's why I'll check for that first.

550
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:58,368
To see if he's a guy with the cheaters' genome...

551
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:01,098
who can't go a single day without seeing a woman.

552
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,170
If the sewer-smell guy also cheats...

553
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,739
That's the worst.

554
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,449
But I need to get his approval first.

555
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:13,050
How could I get that?

556
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,118
Gosh. Someone must be talking badly about me today.

557
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,849
My left ear is so itchy.

558
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,159
There must be more than a few women who talk badly about you.

559
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,288
Well, talking badly about someone means they care in some way.

560
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:26,029
Should we have the get-together at Munggi?

561
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,360
I'll contact Kang Hoon.

562
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,170
Right. Tell him to invite the goddess of victory too.

563
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:36,909
Who?

564
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,840
With So Jin?

565
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,349
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

566
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,409
Hey.

567
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,820
We're just going to eat. Why did you change?

568
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:55,530
I felt icky after running tests all night.

569
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,289
There they are.

570
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,730
Let's go in first.

571
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Okay.

572
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:10,269
Fatal pheromones.

573
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,840
He must not be a cheater, right?

574
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,710
He definitely does look popular with women.

575
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,929
You don't deserve to be loved!

576
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,570
Gosh. I might get cut off before I even get started.

577
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,769
Oh, right.

578
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,219
Not bad.

579
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,389
Yes. The past should be erased.

580
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,928
She could come every week, don't you think?

581
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,959
- Yes, definitely. - She's pretty.

582
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,328
She has to be good at dancing like Irene.

583
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:09,400
Hey.

584
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:11,799
- Don't act rashly. - All right.

585
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,269
- We're picky, okay? - Okay.

586
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,400
Show us some moves now.

587
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:18,738
Now that So Jin is here, please give us a toast.

588
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,939
Give her that glass.

589
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,279
- Right. - Thank you.

590
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,948
Thank you for cheering us on.

591
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,250
It's nothing.

592
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,079
Okay, fill your glasses and bring them forward.

593
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,349
We came.

594
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,149
We went. We fought. We won!

595
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,058
- We won! - We won!

596
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:37,429
- Good job. - Good job.

597
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,170
Let's see.

598
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,409
I'll serve it for you, Ms. Han.

599
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,750
Okay.

600
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,579
Here you go, Ms. Han.

601
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Thank you.

602
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:02,989
Have this too while you're at it.

603
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,859
Since when did you like octopus?

604
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,189
We have some things in common.

605
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,489
Oh, I don't like octopus.

606
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,658
Octopuses have reproductive organs on their legs,

607
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,828
so they have sex with their legs.

608
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:15,829
Pardon?

609
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,869
Pardon?

610
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,469
Oh, so...

611
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,768
Male octopuses use camouflage...

612
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,979
to approach the females.

613
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,808
And they only do that to the immature, young ones.

614
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,380
I think a bit differently.

615
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,309
Octopuses are good at communion...

616
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,848
and are full of motherly love.

617
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,650
They are strong with three hearts.

618
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,289
But this guy...

619
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,489
has three hearts.

620
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:46,499
So why does it love with its legs and not his heart?

621
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Right.

622
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Exactly.

623
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,268
I named the gene I'm researching lately...

624
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,339
after octopuses.

625
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,510
Combining "indecent" and "octopus tentacles,"

626
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:58,510
I named it Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene.

627
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,308
"Indecent octopus tentacles?"

628
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:03,678
Humans have a gene that makes them cheat...

629
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,579
for generation after generation.

630
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:08,949
She must've been very hurt by some Casanova.

631
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,718
Do you really believe there's a Casanova gene?

632
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:14,719
Yes.

633
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,530
I don't believe it. It exists.

634
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:19,299
The dopamine receptor on chromosome 11...

635
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,359
is the Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene.

636
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,300
Normally, people have two.

637
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,630
But some people...

638
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,300
have 4 or even 7.

639
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,138
I see.

640
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,009
Hey, you should get that DNA test too.

641
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,479
You have more of anything compared to other people.

642
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,238
He has many hobbies, girlfriends...

643
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,549
Exactly. Ms. Han must know better than anyone...

644
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,619
whether I have the indecent octopus tentacles gene.

645
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:42,449
Pardon? Me?

646
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:44,089
How?

647
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,960
I requested a DNA test before.

648
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,059
Oh, that?

649
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,158
Once we've used the test for its intended purpose,

650
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,929
we dispose of any samples with personal information.

651
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,698
I'm not the type of person...

652
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:03,570
who runs DNA tests out of personal interest.

653
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,979
A researcher I know...

654
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,380
stole some guy's uniform.

655
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,178
What kind of personal interest is that?

656
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,190
She was walking like this.

657
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,329
Who knows? Do people do things like that?

658
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:26,059
- Gosh. - Gosh.

659
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:33,739
Are you okay?

660
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,169
Give me some water.

661
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,510
Keep coughing. Are you okay?

662
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,179
So the octopus can come out.

663
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,340
Here. Drink some.

664
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,779
- She's going to throw up. - What's wrong?

665
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,819
- Try to spit it out. - Spit it out.

666
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,448
- I should do something. - She's really struggling.

667
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:51,449
Yes, do that thing.

668
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,019
I'll help you. Okay.

669
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,428
What are you doing?

670
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:00,029
I'm going to press 5 times, so cough 5 times.

671
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,428
You don't have to do this...

672
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,629
I'm going to start.

673
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,928
- One. - Hold on.

674
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:06,439
- Give us a dish. - Three.

675
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,199
Four, five.

676
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,280
Good job.

677
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,219
Good work. Good job.

678
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,860
Pour me a glass.

679
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:32,190
Okay.

680
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:45,939
Hey.

681
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,079
Do you need more help?

682
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,389
I think you have something you need to give back to me.

683
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,820
Pardon? What do you mean...

684
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,730
I completely see why you'd misunderstand,

685
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:13,098
but it's not like that.

686
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:15,909
I'll get it cleaned and give it back to you.

687
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,150
What?

688
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:29,889
Do you...

689
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:32,519
prefer that sort of thing...

690
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,089
What? Prefer?

691
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,459
No, it's not like that.

692
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,399
I'll tell you. To be honest...

693
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,460
I'm listening.

694
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:50,309
People's sweat...

695
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,839
has immunity molecules,

696
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,909
which gives off a unique scent.

697
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,549
The variation of their immunity traits,

698
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,678
which depends on the M, H, and C genes,

699
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:04,218
causes romantic attraction when someone smells it.

700
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,419
Romantic attraction?

701
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,988
Yes, attraction. That.

702
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:09,658
Do you need to smell something to know that?

703
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,589
No, it's not like that. Biologically...

704
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,000
How was my scent?

705
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,099
Well...

706
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,539
Your scent...

707
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:29,780
was attractive to me.

708
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,679
What?

709
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,820
When I was falling from the hospital rooftop,

710
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,829
your scent felt so vivid that I could almost see it.

711
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,329
I've never experienced that before,

712
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,599
and I wanted to know the reason.

713
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,599
That's how I ended up stealing your uniform.

714
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,309
I'm so sorry.

715
00:43:58,539 --> 00:44:00,538
I wanted to test if it was a delusion...

716
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:02,409
or if it was real.

717
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,150
Ms. Han So Jin.

718
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,960
Are you confessing your love for me right now?

719
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:16,558
What? Confessing my love? No.

720
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,759
Well, I was just saying...

721
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,530
- that in... - So Jin. Let's go now.

722
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,598
Get up. Let's go.

723
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,129
Oh, right. We should go.

724
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,900
Oh, I should go too.

725
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,670
Ms. Han.

726
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,908
If you're going the same direction as me, I'll take you home.

727
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,908
No, she lives close to my house.

728
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,079
I can take her home.

729
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,609
I'll be sure to return your clothes.

730
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,949
You seem to need it for your research. Just keep it.

731
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,150
It seems like you need it more than I do.

732
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,550
What are you talking about?

733
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,989
Nothing. Let's go.

734
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,030
Bye.

735
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,289
- Come on. - Okay.

736
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,948
Darn it! You annoying octopus!

737
00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:17,649
Why on earth did you get stuck to my throat right then?

738
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,320
Octopus!

739
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,460
What kind of bad connection do we have?

740
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,190
Darn it.

741
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,929
Darn it.

742
00:45:26,329 --> 00:45:27,828
(Casanova gene)

743
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,829
(Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene, get lost!)

744
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,210
I mean, the Heimlich manoeuvrer. Was that really necessary?

745
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,119
Now that I think back, his skills for sneaking in physical touch is...

746
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,820
Isn't he obviously an octopus too?

747
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:54,459
Also, he clearly knew I had stolen...

748
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,130
his uniform, but he kept testing me.

749
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,630
Fine. I should make things clear.

750
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,229
I should test him for the Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene.

751
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,400
(Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene, get lost!)

752
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,269
First, I can get the sample from his uniform.

753
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,868
Should I just do it?

754
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,468
No, I can't just do that without his consent.

755
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,309
There's no knowing what might happen later.

756
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:17,479
But what if he doesn't consent? What do I do then?

757
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,820
That can't happen!

758
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,190
Let me sleep.

759
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,190
Let me sleep!

760
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:32,190
Hey, why did you call me out on my day off?

761
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,098
If I don't take care of you, you only go to the gym and back.

762
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:38,969
- What's wrong with that? - Gosh.

763
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,739
- Another serving of sundae, please. - Sure.

764
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:45,710
What's that?

765
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:49,210
It's a fire.

766
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,510
Ma'am, let me borrow this water.

767
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:53,018
- Sung Mi. - Let's go.

768
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:55,348
I'll evacuate people first. Please call it in!

769
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:56,349
Okay!

770
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,090
No, I want to make it light, like a handbag.

771
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,230
Oh, gosh.

772
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,500
Please come this way.

773
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,300
Be calm and keep going!

774
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:16,909
Go.

775
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,110
It's okay.

776
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,750
Is there anyone here? If you're there, yell!

777
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:29,420
I know.

778
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,190
Are you inside?

779
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:34,019
Is no one home?

780
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:36,328
Is there anyone home?

781
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:37,928
Who are you? What...

782
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,089
There's a fire. Didn't you hear the alarm?

783
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,630
No, I didn't.

784
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,069
Is the emergency speaker just for decoration?

785
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,399
You can't just remove it.

786
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,038
That was like that since I moved here...

787
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,039
Let's go for now.

788
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,509
It's dangerous to inhale smoke. Cover your mouth and nose.

789
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,239
- Stay low and follow me. - Oh, okay.

790
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,050
Come on!

791
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,179
Crouch down.

792
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:07,320
Be careful. Just a moment.

793
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,729
Hey, Sung Mi. I found a resident on the eighth floor.

794
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm in the emergency stairwell.

795
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,658
We have to go down, but I don't have a clear visual.

796
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,529
No, the stairwell is still fine. Captain came and put out the fire.

797
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,570
Okay. We'll be right down.

798
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,198
But this looks dangerous.

799
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,808
Don't be afraid. Hold on to my arm tightly.

800
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:26,069
I'm feeling my way down too.

801
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,679
It'll be dangerous for us both if you let go.

802
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:30,980
Let's go.

803
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:39,550
- Are you okay? - Yes.

804
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:42,889
Watch out.

805
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:48,860
- Hurry. - Hurry up!

806
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,039
Are you okay? We're almost there. Just a bit farther.

807
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,409
Over there.

808
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:01,809
Watch your head.

809
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,550
- Are you okay? - Yes.

810
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,780
Hold on to my arm tightly.

811
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,618
You've inhaled a lot of smoke.

812
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:14,059
You never know, so go to the hospital and get checked out.

813
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,859
Are you okay?

814
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,130
Yes, I'm fine.

815
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,198
She was on the floor where the fire broke out for a while.

816
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,730
- Please take care of her. - Okay.

817
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,129
- But... - Your trachea might be damaged.

818
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,598
Could you try saying something?

819
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:27,869
What's your name?

820
00:49:28,269 --> 00:49:30,539
Jang... Mi Eun.

821
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,440
All units, report to the eighth floor.

822
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,979
The OBGYN Department of Sim General Hospital...

823
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,920
consider the parents and child our utmost priority.

824
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,888
From pregnancy to childbirth, we are there for the pain and worry...

825
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:46,888
- of the expectant mothers... - I'll get his consent for sure.

826
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:49,860
We will always try hard so that you can trust us with...

827
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:53,929
Yes?

828
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,000
Ms. Han So Jin from Iroun Genetic Center is here.

829
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,230
All right.

830
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,479
There's a sample of the hair growth suppressant.

831
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,009
You waited too long, didn't you?

832
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,380
It took you a while. I thought you might've given up.

833
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:17,949
These babies are the tailored samples for your DNA.

834
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,049
I see.

835
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,619
Oh, is that so? Let me test it out.

836
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,499
Wait, but... You can't apply it like that.

837
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,529
Then how?

838
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,699
Excuse me.

839
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,710
Wait.

840
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,050
You're sniffing my pheromones again, aren't you?

841
00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:54,489
No, I'm not.

842
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,090
The suppressant has to be absorbed by each and every hair follicle.

843
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:04,929
There, you're done.

844
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,440
Oh, right.

845
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:21,320
Mr. Sim.

846
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,750
Have you ever been strongly attracted by the scent...

847
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:27,289
of someone of the opposite gender?

848
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,699
You're asking me what kind of scent I like on a woman, right?

849
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,569
If it's not too much trouble,

850
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:39,969
could I ask you how I smell?

851
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:46,369
I can't smell it from here.

852
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:49,440
Can you come closer?

853
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,499
Oh, wait.

854
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,999
Mr. Sim. There's something I'd like to ask you for.

855
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,940
- What is it? - Well...

856
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,969
Mr. Sim.

857
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:22,639
I want to test your DNA.

858
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,409
- Can you agree... - You've already done it.

859
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,079
Not about the hair growth.

860
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,489
I want to know about you in more detail.

861
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,059
Actually,

862
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,059
all of my ex-boyfriends had the Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene.

863
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,329
And that gene took effect, so they all ended up cheating.

864
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:52,808
So, I really want to know if you have...

865
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:55,610
the Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene.

866
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,510
The Indecent Octopus Tentacles Gene?

867
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,219
What you mentioned last time?

868
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,420
Ms. Han So Jin.

869
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,759
Last time, you talked about smells...

870
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,489
and told me you had an interest in me.

871
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,130
Is this how you express your interest in someone?

872
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
What...

873
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,899
My interest?

874
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,840
I'm sorry, but I can't agree to your suggestion.

875
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:25,539
That's not how a man and woman get to know each other.

876
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,639
You're coming to the restaurant with your mother and So Ri today, right?

877
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:59,308
(Family Chat)

878
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:02,109
(I have some good news. Want to come have dinner?)

879
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,979
(So Ri: I'm busy.)

880
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,409
(You'll come to Always Sushi tomorrow evening at 7, right?)

881
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,530
(Chief Director)

882
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:28,539
Yes, Chief Director.

883
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,909
Hey, I just arrived.

884
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:35,239
I get aches and pains whenever I come back from a trip.

885
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,480
Are you at the hotel?

886
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:39,809
Oh, I'm on my way there.

887
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,980
Is your mom doing well?

888
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,050
Her hormone treatment doesn't seem to be working.

889
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,420
I was thinking of switching it.

890
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:49,059
Have her continue with the psychiatrist too.

891
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,788
She took all of her sedatives at once,

892
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,260
so she's not seeing the psychiatrist for now.

893
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:54,828
I see.

894
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:56,999
- The hospital is fine, right? - Yes, sure.

895
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,170
We're going straight to the hotel, right?

896
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:03,469
Yes. I'll see you when you come to the hospital.

897
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,110
Bye.

898
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,550
Dad, which table is this for? Table Four?

899
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:17,550
Here is your meal.

900
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,718
- Dad. - Hey.

901
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,289
- Hey, you're here. - Hey.

902
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,859
Gosh, I came to have a drink, but you guys look busy.

903
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,058
- I'll come again next time. - Oh, no.

904
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,299
Most of the customers will be leaving in a bit.

905
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,429
Have a seat here.

906
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,098
- Is that okay? - Yes, it's fine.

907
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,329
Business is booming.

908
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,340
Have you eaten? I'll bring you your usual drink.

909
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:38,308
Hey, don't do that. Why don't I go and help Dad out?

910
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:39,309
You know I'm a good cook.

911
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,780
Come on. It's fine. Just sit and wait.

912
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,260
Here is the hot sake you always drink.

913
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,530
- Wait just a bit. - Okay.

914
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,460
Yoon Seob.

915
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,360
Our Kang Hoon is keeping her safe,

916
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,530
so don't worry about So Jin.

917
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:37,670
I'll take good care of your family...

918
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,699
in your stead.

919
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,670
Enjoy the food, and rest up before you go.

920
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,309
Thank you, Mr. Seo.

921
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,860
What's this?

922
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,630
Have you forgotten already? It's Dad's silverware.

923
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,269
Here is your sashimi.

924
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,840
Mother.

925
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:51,768
Our aged kimchi is really tasty.

926
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,440
Try a piece with the salmon sushi.

927
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,779
Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

928
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,780
Okay.

929
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,519
So Ri, you brat. Turn that off now.

930
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,118
It's because these guys whine by the door when I'm not there.

931
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,619
You listen so well to Kang Hoon.

932
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,230
Kang Hoon has a smell that doesn't exist in our family.

933
00:58:13,059 --> 00:58:14,260
The smell of a human being.

934
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,869
I'll bring you plum juice when you're done eating.

935
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,769
Take your time and enjoy.

936
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,780
A man's mere wish...

937
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,749
was to eat a meal with his family.

938
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,780
That's why your dad's life ended like that.

939
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,419
Keep that in mind.

940
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,550
Even family becomes a nuisance if you don't make a decent living.

941
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:40,219
It's worse than being strangers.

942
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,630
Even strangers say stuff like that to one another.

943
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:55,138
To someone who was the breadwinner his whole life,

944
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:56,738
you could say things like, "Good job," "You worked hard,"

945
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:57,739
and "It's fine."

946
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,610
Have you ever said anything like that to our family members?

947
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,320
It's not like I owe you anything.

948
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:10,349
Why do you expect so much from me?

949
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:12,549
I guess it's my fault for being born your mom.

950
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,359
All of you, quiet down!

951
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,519
Can't you just stop?

952
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:19,529
People have the right to be forgotten.

953
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:22,259
You don't even remember properly, and you've already forgotten?

954
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,899
Was that why you always yelled at Dad like he was nothing?

955
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,669
Who was it that blocked Dad's number?

956
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,869
Han So Jin, think about it.

957
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,710
Dad died because of you.

958
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,510
- What? - You two.

959
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,380
Do you know what you inherited from your father?

960
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,519
It's depression.

961
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:42,449
You, So Jin.

962
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,650
Do you know what you always said as a teenager?

963
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,988
"I was hurt." "I'm suffering." "I want to die."

964
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:51,260
"I didn't want to give birth to you, but I was forced to."

965
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,869
Seeing how I heard that growing up, I think my depression came from you.

966
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,399
How depressing would it have been?

967
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,340
To have something disgusting growing inside your belly.

968
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:09,179
I painted the emotions of when I gave birth to my first child.

969
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,948
It felt as though she would pierce through my heart like a nail...

970
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:14,719
and stab me.

971
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:20,860
Hey.

972
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,090
Why do you always have such high hopes?

973
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,399
Do you still not know that there is no love among our family?

974
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,469
Right. I was wrong.

975
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,968
We're the survivors of suicide and accomplices in doing that to Dad.

976
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:36,269
But at least for today...

977
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,340
I thought we could act like a normal family.

978
01:00:42,579 --> 01:00:45,880
Just an hour to eat together while Dad is watching.

979
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,920
At least for an hour,

980
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,989
I thought we would be a family.

981
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:59,590
You must feel better to stab someone else.

982
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,698
But what have you done?

983
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:05,699
Did you really not know that your dad...

984
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,639
would leave like that?

985
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:17,250
- Kang Hoon. - Excuse me.

986
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,679
Just leave her alone.

987
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,449
Excuse me. We still haven't gotten the sushi we ordered.

01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,250
It's cold, isn't it?

990
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:40,460
Gosh.

991
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,190
Ta-da.

992
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,639
Were you at the restaurant the whole time?

993
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:31,949
Then, perhaps...

994
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,650
You must've really liked your father.

995
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,320
I did.

996
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,329
Of course, Dad loved Mom more than me.

997
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,260
But not everyone is fated for each other just because you love them.

998
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,099
If you only love someone by yourself,

999
01:03:57,469 --> 01:03:59,340
it becomes more painful the more you love.

1000
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,949
My experiment might seem funny to you,

1001
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,389
but I believe that DNA lovers exist.

1002
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:15,618
Meeting the perfect partner...

1003
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,690
is the only way to keep the other alive.

1004
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:19,760
To save each other.

1005
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:24,570
My partner...

1006
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,139
I'll be so good to him once I meet him.

1007
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:32,909
He must've suffered a lot...

1008
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,980
while we were apart.

The moment someone looks pretty to you...

1010
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,820
is different for each person.

1011
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,150
The moment this woman looks pretty...

1012
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:49,860
is right now.

1013
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,690
It's weird.

1014
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,940
Are you still interested in my DNA?

1015
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,940
What?

1016
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:09,280
I don't think you'll solve the problem with your method,

1017
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,279
but go ahead and test my DNA.

1018
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,480
I'll consent.

1019
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:16,479
- Really? - But...

1020
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,218
do we have to do this thing again like last time?

1021
01:05:19,219 --> 01:05:22,420
No. I can just use your uniform.

1022
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:23,690
My uniform?

1023
01:05:25,989 --> 01:05:27,230
You agreed, right?

1024
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,899
Thank you!
