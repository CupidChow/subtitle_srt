00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,310
(DNA Lover)

(Choi Si Won)

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,689
(Jung In Sun)

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
(Hyangto Warm Porridge)

10
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,960
When you fall for someone,

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,960
timing becomes cruel.

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,340
If I start to like you now,

13
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,640
would that be the worst timing?

14
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,150
What do you want to do when you go home?

15
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,250
Well...

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,518
As long as I'm with my DNA lover, anything is fine.

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,658
Should we go on a drive to somewhere nice?

18
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,189
That sounds nice too.

19
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:33,260
Do you want to try staying at home all day together?

20
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,299
(An introvert)

21
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,840
What would we do at home all day?

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,670
(An extrovert)

23
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,139
There's a lot to do.

24
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,578
We can eat together, drink beer...

25
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,609
Right.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,419
Since you like wine, should we have wine?

27
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,919
You don't have other impure intentions, right?

28
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,548
What do you think of me? I'm not like that...

29
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,719
Come on.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,359
You didn't misunderstand me, right?

31
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,859
Your hands are quite strong, So Jin.

32
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,159
Well,

33
00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:05,629
since you're good at cooking,

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,769
how about we try baking?

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,429
I really wanted to do that.

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,639
Let's get delivery.

37
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,270
You're good at cooking.

38
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,739
You'll just leave right after you eat again.

39
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,009
Stop it.

40
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,310
- You're so silly. - I'm sorry.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,079
That hurts.

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,879
Stop it. Seriously.

43
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,229
Have some octopus too, Kang Hoon.

44
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,029
I caught the biggest octopus this time.

45
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,198
When she gets home from the hospital,

46
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,628
let's help her recover by feeding her octopus.

47
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:41,870
Cut it up with scissors.

48
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,870
Where are the scissors?

49
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,469
I'm back.

50
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,849
Again?

51
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,180
I wasn't fooled.

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,289
I just loved as hard as I could.

53
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,490
Meet a good guy next time.

54
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:06,889
Then it'll be okay.

55
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,159
Does a guy like that...

56
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,399
actually exist in this world?

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,240
He does. A guy who'll only love you.

58
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,039
And who is that?

59
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,460
Father.

60
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,299
This guy has three hearts,

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,469
so why does he love with his legs instead of his heart?

62
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,740
What?

63
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,538
Do what with his legs?

64
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:59,710
There are only reproductive organs in the legs, so why...

65
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,448
So why does he love with his legs?

66
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,749
You should ask such personal things directly to the octopus.

67
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,349
Don't ask me. You're so weird.

68
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,860
(Yeon Woo)

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,740
(Episode 9, Bad Timing)

70
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,850
Let's see.

71
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:41,019
Yeon Woo.

72
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,319
Did you sleep well?

73
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,560
Yes. Thanks to you.

74
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,160
Here. Your going home present.

75
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,399
You shouldn't have.

76
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,398
Can I open it now?

77
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,399
Of course.

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,470
What is it?

79
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,438
It should be the right size.

80
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,778
They're the same size as the shoes you left in my house last time.

81
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,778
You checked the size then?

82
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,049
No, I can tell at a glance. It's 225mm.

83
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,149
Try it on.

84
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,359
It's so pretty!

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,120
Oh, my goodness.

86
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,300
But they say...

87
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,800
couples shouldn't give each other shoes.

88
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,568
But I don't plan to leave you,

89
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,869
so don't worry.

90
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,870
Okay.

91
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,339
Right.

92
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,579
I also have a present I wanted to give you.

93
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,489
Ta-da. What do you think?

94
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,989
Matching bracelets?

95
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,799
Is that in the shape of DNA?

96
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,198
- I have to put on... - Isn't it pretty?

97
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,170
Those shackle-like things, right?

98
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,839
- That... - What is it?

99
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,799
Do you not like it?

100
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,869
No, not at all.

101
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,509
It's not that. I never knew...

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,540
DNA was so cute.

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,648
Right? Can you give me your hand?

104
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,079
I want to put it on for you.

105
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,720
- Right now? - Yes.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,389
Okay.

107
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,698
Ta-da.

108
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,300
It's the first matching item I'm giving to my DNA lover.

109
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:39,039
You have to wear it every day now.

110
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,198
Don't ever take it off.

111
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,208
I'll keep that in mind.

112
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,469
Right. Yeon Woo.

113
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,110
Were you the one who left porridge in my name after my surgery?

114
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,109
- Porridge? - How did you know...

115
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,680
I liked red snow crab porridge?

116
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,749
- Hi. - Hi.

117
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,220
Hi, Kang Hoon.

118
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,860
I was really worried.

119
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,059
Good job, both of you. I heard the prognostics were good too.

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,059
How could you not come by even once when you were so worried?

121
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,500
You didn't even answer the phone yesterday.

122
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,370
I was...

123
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,698
a bit busy.

124
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,899
Sorry, So Jin.

125
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,639
It's okay. I was fine because So Ri hired a caregiver for me.

126
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,049
This is all of your stuff, right?

127
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,050
Yes.

128
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,289
I'll head down first.

129
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,689
Get ready and take your time coming down.

130
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,188
I suddenly got a surgery scheduled for this afternoon.

131
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:32,458
Please take good care of So Jin.

132
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,790
You don't need to ask.

133
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:36,089
I've always done so.

134
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,929
Don't just punch. Turn your body like this.

135
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,028
Go!

136
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,729
- One, two. - Go!

137
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,959
Again.

138
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,459
There you go.

139
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,670
Okay.

140
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,470
- Yes. - There you go.

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Go.

142
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,369
Very nice.

143
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,540
Again.

144
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,970
One, two.

145
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,579
Doctor.

146
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,039
Do it a bit harder this time.

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,750
- Yes, ma'am. - One, two.

148
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,249
One, two.

149
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,778
Are you okay? I hit you too hard, didn't I?

150
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,750
No, I'm fine.

151
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,719
- Let's increase the tempo a bit. - Okay.

152
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,159
Okay. One, two!

153
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,829
I'll really punch hard this time.

154
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,000
- Okay. - Okay.

155
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,399
I can't. I'm worried that I might hurt you.

156
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,038
I told you to do it harder.

157
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,709
Instead of this, could we go on a date?

158
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,509
I have so many things I want to do with you.

159
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:00,749
We're exercising right now.

160
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,750
But...

161
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,949
Focus! Okay.

162
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,548
One, two!

163
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:07,319
How long are we going to do this for?

164
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,389
One, two!

165
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,048
- One, two. - Come on.

166
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,319
- You can make it harder. - I can't.

167
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,229
- It's okay. - I can't.

168
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,830
I told you to exercise, but you're on a date.

169
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,428
Hi, coach.

170
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,829
- Here. - Thank you.

171
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,100
Thank you.

172
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,739
What do you think about being the model...

173
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,809
for our promotional poster?

174
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,508
Like a couple body profile shoot.

175
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,339
We don't have anyone...

176
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,278
at this gym who can replace our Yeoksam-dong Fire Fist.

177
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,418
If it's to promote our gym,

178
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,419
I'll give it a try.

179
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,750
Let's go!

180
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Doctor.

181
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:52,100
Will you give it a try with me?

182
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Pardon?

183
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,469
I didn't mean you should do it with him.

184
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,339
One of our members of two years has a great body.

185
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,649
He said he'd help you if needed.

186
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,119
No, I'll do it.

187
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
Without me, Sung Mi can't do it either.

188
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,459
Right. Photoshop is very developed nowadays.

189
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,299
No. We don't need Photoshop.

190
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:28,628
I'll take a shot...

191
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,740
at designing your body.

192
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,399
Pardon?

193
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,570
Let's go.

194
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,979
- Doctor? - Yes?

195
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,278
I'll give it a touch now.

196
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,279
Okay.

197
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,870
Sung Mi.

198
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,269
Aren't we going too fast?

199
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,809
You only have fat.

200
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,519
You don't have any muscle.

201
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,849
Come this way.

202
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,648
Let's measure your skeletal muscle mass.

203
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,750
Then we'll start with squats.

204
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,230
Oh, my.

205
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,470
I can't believe...

206
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,440
I'm wearing a matching item.

207
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,240
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

208
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,350
So Jin. You're still awake?

209
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,980
Yeon Woo. What are you up to now?

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,019
I was just thinking of you.

211
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,519
Don't lie.

212
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,229
I'm serious. What were you up to?

213
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, it's nothing big,

214
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,330
but I bought some supplements for you while buying mine.

215
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,398
Your RP gene kept worrying me,

216
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,499
so I bought some supplements that are good for the eyes.

217
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,038
I'll bring them to you next time we meet.

218
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,039
Thank you.

219
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:17,679
You have to take them regularly.

220
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,908
Okay. I will.

221
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,649
You said you were going to work tomorrow, right?

222
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,719
Since it hasn't been long since your surgery,

223
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,548
it'll probably be better for you to rest.

224
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,720
Will you be okay?

225
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,249
I'm okay.

226
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,620
I have a low sensitivity to pain.

227
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,158
And I have a lot of work to do.

228
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,889
Going into work as soon as possible will make me feel better.

229
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,000
But you can't overwork yourself, okay?

230
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,330
Okay. I won't.

231
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,729
So Jin. You must be tired. You should go to sleep.

232
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,340
I'll call you tomorrow.

233
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,239
Wait. Well...

234
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,570
What was it?

235
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,008
Oh, right.

236
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,279
Do you like plants?

237
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,808
I like plants.

238
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,609
Speaking of which,

239
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,850
I saw on the Sim General Hospital bulletin board...

240
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,090
a notice about volunteer work to remove invasive plants.

241
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,288
Do you want to go together?

242
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,918
Should I sign us up?

243
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,989
You could do it too.

244
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,529
I could do it too.

245
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,100
- It doesn't matter. - So Jin.

246
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,730
- Yes? - You're not hanging up...

247
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,840
because you want to keep calling, aren't you?

248
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,169
Was it obvious?

249
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,870
Oh, no.

250
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:26,138
I want to see you...

251
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,480
and hear your voice every day. What do I do?

252
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,779
I don't know why I'm like this.

253
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,690
Why do you think I like you, So Jin?

254
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,360
Why do you like me?

255
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,000
The more I see you,

256
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,470
the more unfamiliar I feel.

257
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,139
Is that a good thing?

258
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,610
I'm not sure. I'm not used...

259
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,178
to this feeling of unfamiliarity.

260
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,779
But I don't dislike it either.

261
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,549
It's kind of difficult.

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,389
I guess I'll slowly find out.

263
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,559
I'll also slowly find out more about you, right?

264
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,330
Yeon Woo.

265
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,100
Who is your ideal type?

266
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,299
I don't have an ideal type.

267
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,710
How about you?

268
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,480
Before I met you,

269
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,750
someone like my dad was my ideal type.

270
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,450
I see. Someone like your dad.

271
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,990
When I think about my dad,

272
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,789
I regret so many things.

273
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,288
Once,

274
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,429
there were these hiking shoes my dad really wanted.

275
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,830
He said he wouldn't fall if he wore those.

276
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,269
But...

277
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:59,240
I never got to buy them for him.

278
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,710
I'm such a bad daughter, right?

279
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,080
Even now, that's what...

280
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,679
I regret the most.

281
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,889

283
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,529
Are you listening?

284
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,100
Good...

285
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,339
Goodnight.

286
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,250

Oh, my goodness.

291
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,128
Did you make all of this yourself?

292
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,469
I fell asleep first. I should be punished for that.

293
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,470
Here.

294
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,508
How could you fall asleep like that?

295
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,809
How much did you hear?

296
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,980
I don't exactly remember because I was so sleepy.

297
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,779

298
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,220

It's a brand older people like.

I don't know if your father will like them.

302
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,630
Were you still listening?

303
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,500
I don't miss important information.

304
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,339
Is it your hobby to buy shoes for people?

305
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,709
Is it?

306
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,949
Your shoes were too old.

307
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,308
And your father didn't have hiking shoes.

308
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,779
It's nice to give gifts that people need.

309

enjoy this food.

They look so happy.

353
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,409
and did 100 squats and 50 push-ups.

354

into strong muscles.

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,220
Getting the other person to like something is a skill.

372
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,960
That's easier said than done.

373
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,758
Seriously. You're still annoying. Now, that's a real talent.

374
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,159
Why is it that it's so easy for me to hear my complaints?

375
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,230
Exactly. Your hearing is too sharp for your own good.

376
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,740
If she declines an activity you enjoy,

377
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,809
that must be the extent of her affection for you.

378
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,380
Here's a thing about being in love.

379
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,649
It doesn't matter what your significant other wants to do.

380
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,680
Unless it's a dealbreaker,

381
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,950
couples usually share activities.

382
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,319
Hearing you talk about love...

383
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,490
feels a little surreal.

384
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,230
See you later.

385
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
Don't you feel awkward?

386
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,410
Gosh.

387
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,650
Yeon Woo. What are you doing here?

388
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:24,779
We talked about spending...

389
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,680
an entire day at my house once you got discharged.

390
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,449
It was your idea. Don't you remember?

391
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,949
How could I forget?

392
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,288
Do you want to come over today?

393
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,990
I promise you'll be invigorated by the time you leave my house.

394
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,258
You said you liked red snow crab porridge,

395
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,359
so I prepared it for you.

396
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:36,890
Sounds great!

397
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,900
Hold on.

398
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,629
Your bouquet is ready.

399
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,768
Please pick it up by 5pm.

400
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,999
So Jin, are you working tomorrow?

401
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,068
(We're always together.)

402
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:49,409
Thank you for the food today as always.

403
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,809
- I'll get going. - Okay. Get home safely.

404
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,149
What is it? Do you not like porridge?

405
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,579
No. It's not that. I...

406
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:04,119
I'm so sorry.

407
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,159
I had an important appointment, but I completely forgot about it.

408
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,689
I'll call you later.

409
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,989
- What? - I'm really sorry.

410
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,099
So Jin!

411
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,598
Hello? Yes, I'm coming right now.

412
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,630
I'm sorry!

413
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:22,740
Are you really not coming? If you don't, I'll defriend you!

414
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:24,439
I get to take wedding photos only once.

415
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,140
You're my friend. How could you not show up?

416
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,949
It was always the three of us.

417
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,950
It feels a bit empty without So Jin.

418
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,950
She had other plans. What could we do?

419
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,990
Is that so? Well, there's nothing we can do about it then.

420
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,390
Oh, right.

421
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,059
The flowers for your mother.

422
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:46,129
So Jin prepared them every year, so I forgot.

423
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,599
Oh, no. You're right.

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,298
Dad, I'll go and look for a flower shop.

425
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,469
Gosh, that's fine.

426
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,910
Not a lot of flower shops have pink hydrangeas.

427
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,568
Mr. Seo!

428
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,609
What?

429
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:01,009
I must miss So Jin so much.

430
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,349
I'm hearing her voice now.

431
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,279
Mr. Seo!

432
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,118
Kang Hoon!

433
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,150
- Hey. - Gosh.

434
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,890
How come no one brought her favorite flowers?

435
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,430
I heard you had plans. How did you make it here?

436
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,899
I'm sorry, Mr. Seo.

437
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,538
I clearly remember making a note of her death anniversary a week ago.

438
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:28,910
You're busy. It's understandable.

439
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,539
By the way, you prepared these flowers...

440
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,278
every year for her.

441
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:37,950
So we almost showed up empty-handed this year without the flowers.

442
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,548
I'll remember it from now on.

443
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,548
Gosh, I'm not allergic to these flowers.

444
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,849
You don't know how much I've been looking forward to today.

445
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,989
Please let me continue to handle flowers.

446
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,559
Yes, ma'am. I will. Let's go.

447
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,598
You guys look great.

448
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,200
I'll take one from here too. One, two, three.

449
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,529
Beautiful!

450
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,838
- You look beautiful. - How about this?

451
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,239
Gosh, you look great.

452
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,539
Seriously.

453
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,670
That's it.

454
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,739
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

455
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,779
Yes.

456
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,250
- You look so beautiful. - How beautiful.

457
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,380
What? Sim Yeon Woo!

458
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,589
Gosh. Seriously.

459
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,288
He was going to show up all along. He always plays hard to get.

460
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:20,319
I know, right?

461
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,689
Hurry up.

462
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,028
Hurry up, Yeon Woo! Let's take a group picture.

463
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,200
All right. I'll take one now.

464
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,599
One, two, three.

465
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,670
One more. One, two, three.

466
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,970
Gosh, how beautiful.

467
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,969
You said you couldn't make it. But here you are.

468
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,508
Well, it just happened that way.

469
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:41,609
My plan got canceled all of a sudden.

470
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:42,809
I see.

471
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm happy that you're here.

472
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,749
- You look gorgeous. - Okay.

473
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,859
Great. Why don't you guys look at the flowers?

474
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,889
I love it.

475
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:56,490
Loving only one person for the rest of their life.

476
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,630
I wonder how that feels.

477
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,799
They'll just be committed to each other legally.

478
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,599
Besides, who says they will love only one person?

479
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,068
- Is that what you think? - One, two, three.

480
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,539
- Smile. - But the two of them...

481
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,210
You look great.

482
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,740
- look incredibly happy today. - Why don't you move that way?

483
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,079
Do they?

484
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,079
How lovely.

485
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,690
My wife and I also...

486
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,989
took pictures here while holding a traditional lantern.

487
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,328
Guys. Excuse me for a moment.

488
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,768
I'd like to go on a date with my wife. Just the two of us.

489
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:36,828
Why alone? Let us join you.

490
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,028
You brat.

491
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,399
Today is a special day.

492
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,910
I deserve a date with her in private.

493
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,308
Have fun, Mr. Seo.

494
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:46,179
You brat. I'll be back.

495
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,608
- See you later. - Okay.

496
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,750
If you don't come back in an hour, I'll dump him here and go.

497
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,779
Okay. I'll be back before that.

498
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,420
Why don't we take a look around here?

499
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,829
Look at the roof tiles.

500
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,669
Among those who resided in this palace,

501
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,969
there were many royal couples who had a loving relationship.

502
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,568
After Queen Soheon passed away, King Sejong...

503
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,608
never took a new queen...

504
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:20,039
until his own death.

505
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,879
For 22 years, the King and the Queen had 8 sons and 2 daughters...

506
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,379
thanks to their strong marital bond.

507
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,079
If they were around today,

508
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,689
They might have been as a sweet couple...

509
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,890
with the woman being older than the man.

510
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Let's go to the next spot.

511
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,559
He had so many court maids and royal concubines.

512
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,529
How could he love only one person throughout his lifetime?

513
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,460
Do you think you could have done that too?

514
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,970
I might have been the same...

515
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,700
if I had found the one.

516
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,150
You should look into that.

517
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,180
- There. - What?

518
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,150
What are they doing together here?

519
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,518
You guys should go ahead without me.

520
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,258
- Okay. We'll get going first. - We'll start taking pictures.

521
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,319
- Okay. Look around there. - Will do.

522
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,328
What a surprise to run into each other here of all places.

523
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,068
So Jin, you said you had an important appointment today.

524
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,470
Was that with Kang Hoon?

525
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:21,598
What? Well, let me explain.

526
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,068
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

527
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,440
So she came with us. We come here together every year.

528
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,439
I see. Okay.

529
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,278
What brings you here?

530
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,409
Oh, right.

531
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,480
Our friends from the club are taking their wedding photos today.

532
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,750
You said you couldn't have lunch together, so I came here instead.

533
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,190
I see.

534
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:43,089
But why are they dressed in matching hanbok outfits?

535
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,729
Where's your dad? Why is it just the two of you here?

536
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,199
He needs some time alone, I guess.

537
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
He'll come back soon.

538
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:52,669
Why don't we all grab dinner together? It's my treat.

539
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,240
Thank you for the offer.

540
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:57,769
But we have a family meal together on my mom's death anniversary.

541
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,078
Anyway,

542
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:02,950
it's nice that the four of us ran into each other unexpectedly.

543
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,849
This is great in many ways.

544
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,920
"In many ways?"

545
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:10,018
Hey, Yeon Woo. Don't move for a second.

546
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,019
What?

547
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,959
- What's she doing? - Thank you.

548
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,028
Han So Jin.

549
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:17,528
- Don't let her get to you. - It's almost dinnertime.

550
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,630
Only losers will be bothered by this.

551
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,329
- Shall we get going? - Sure.

552
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,999
We'll get going now.

553
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,268
Call me when you get home.

554
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,799
Sure. I'll call you later.

555
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,720
We should get going too. Dad must be waiting for us.

556
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,180
Okay.

557
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,558
(My Lover Sim Yeon Woo)

558
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,729
(Did you have to meet with her in matching hanbok outfits...)

559
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,859
(because I couldn't have lunch with you?)

560
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,829
If you were going to get so upset, why did you put on an act?

561
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Is it that obvious?

562
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,970
Totally.

563
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:06,779
I don't know.

564
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,250
Honestly, I hate Yeon Woo more than Mi Eun at the moment.

565
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,049
The thing is,

566
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,558
I feel as if I hate him and he let me down to the extent...

567
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,119
that my heart might ache.

568
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,660
But oddly enough, it's different with him.

569
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,529
How is it different?

570
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,839
I'm just drawn to him even though he could hurt me.

571
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:36,809
Aren't you exposing yourself to another heartbreak?

572
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,380
Let me clarify. Based on what I'm feeling right now,

573
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,750
even if I were to be heartbroken like before,

574
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,319
I still couldn't bring myself to hate him.

575
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,990
I don't know.

576
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:53,690
Is he more special because he's my DNA Lover?

577
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,670
Why does it feel so off?

578
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
Why?

579
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,940
I don't know either.

580
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,210
Well,

581
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,180
it might be because of Mr. Seo.

582
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Kang Hoon?

583
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:16,410
Yes.

584
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:20,618
She accompanies him on his mother's death anniversary...

585
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,318
every year.

586
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,359
That kind of friendship is rare between a man and a woman.

587
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:29,029
Is that so?

588
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:30,328
Of course.

589
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:34,230
You'll need to guard your place as So Jin's boyfriend.

590
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,140
Naturally, she must do the same for you too.

591
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,269
Our friendship is far from being typical too.

592
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,058
Hello, ma'am.

593
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,258
I'd like tteokbokki and sundae for to-go.

594
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,829
You can hold the liver and offal.

595
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,630
Please give him a lot of liver and offal.

596
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,098
You're failing because you only stick to one thing.

597
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,440
You need to broaden your tastebuds.

598
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:21,140
So tell me. Do you want the liver and offal?

599
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,750
No. I'm good.

600
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,119
Gosh. You're so stubborn.

601
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,289
Thank you.

602
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,220
I bet you didn't get any sleep.

603
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,390
Your skin looks so dry.

604
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,490
What are you getting at?

605
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,328
"The angels can fly because..."

606
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:43,799
"they consider themselves to be light."

607
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,869
If it feels too heavy, you'll never be able to do it.

608
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,209
So you need to treat it lightly.

609
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,609
Treat what lightly?

610
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,210
You tell me.

611
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:57,450
What could that be?

612
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,950
What on earth...

613
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:01,819
could it be?

614
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:05,119
What do you think? Isn't it tastier than you think?

615
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:08,059
Here you go, ma'am.

616
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,769
You should tell me the answer before you go.

617
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,130
What?

618
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,739
You said if it felt too heavy, I could never do it.

619
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,069
What's that about?

620
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,140
Are you even curious?

621
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:28,710
Confessing your feelings.

622
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,149
If you miss your timing,

623
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,880
you'll never get a chance to confess your feelings.

624
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,690
I've said way too much now.

625
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,930
How is it? Is it good?

626
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:53,369
It's good.

627
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,509
Good.

628
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,909
- Who was that? - I've never seen her before.

629
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,109
I see.

630
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,448
It's a special treat from me.

631
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,389
I hope it's to your liking.

632
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,259
You must come here often.

633
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,429
It's my first time here.

634
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,960
I see.

635
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,539
Look at these women, intensely gazing at Yeon Woo.

636
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,380
They keep giving him attention.

637
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:39,249
I had forgotten for a moment...

638
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,250
that he had the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

639
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,550
Yeon Woo's Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

640
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,018
- was still so strong. - Do you want to watch a movie?

641
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,190
Darn it.

642
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,030
So Jin.

643
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,929
So Jin?

644
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,198
- Yes? - What do you think?

645
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,799
- About what? - About going to a drive-in theater.

646
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,129
You know the movie, "The Man from Nowhere," right?

647
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,698
It will be released again in the theater.

648
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,440
I wanted to watch it with you, So Jin.

649
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,099
I see.

650
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,279
But I have a hard time watching movies with a lot of blood in them.

651
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,250
"I'll chew you out except for your gold tooth."

652
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,880
"I still have one more bullet left."

653
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:14,218
"This is a bulletproof window, you jerk!"

654
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,219
Don't you know this movie?

655
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,090
Gosh. You sounded just like Won Bin.

656
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,519
(Iroun Genetic Center's Han So Jin)

657
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,800
My DNA Lover is bound to be popular among women.

658
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,630
But...

659
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,400
it's not like Yeon Woo is giving those women any attention.

660
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,769
I must adjust too.

661
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,639
I must be cool about it.

662
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,039
Ms. Han.

663
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,079
Yes?

664
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,178
A new client requested a consultation.

665
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,449
I need you to handle it, no one else.

666
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,519
Me?

667
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,719
Yes. The client specifically asked for you.

668
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,239
This way, please.

669
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,968
Oh, right. Hold on.

670
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,639
I wasn't expecting you.

671
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,510
All right, now.

672
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,150
Please have a seat.

673
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,259
You really came.

674
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,590
Yes. I've been meaning to come by for a visit.

675
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,460
You came here once before because of Meniere's disease, right?

676
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,598
Well, yes.

677
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,369
Hold on. I was supposed to get your chart.

678
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,440
Right here.

679
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,679
I don't know where you got diagnosed,

680
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,719
but I don't see any genetic mutation that could lead to...

681
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,250
Meniere's disease.

682
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,158
But according to your chart, you're at a high risk...

683
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,919
for genetic mutations...

684
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,488
in hormone receptors, which could stimulate melanocytes.

685
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,799
That could also lead to genetic mutations...

686
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,429
which may contribute to the development of freckles.

687
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,369
That result sounds worse to me.

688
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,340
Don't worry so much.

689
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,939
Our center can offer tailored skincare routines...

690
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,308
based on individual genes.

691
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:55,808
We're also developing...

692
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,179
high-efficiency brightening cosmetics.

693
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,420
I will think about that.

694
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,250
What a cute pair of shoes.

695
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,889
Was it a present from Yeon Woo?

696
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:07,420
Oh, my shoes?

697
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,329
Yes.

698
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:12,558
But how did you know that?

699
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:14,159
Yeon Woo likes that brand...

700
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,369
very much.

701
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,209
When you date him for three years,

702
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,808
you learn things about him that you might wish you didn’t.

703
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,078
That's how you end up forming a deep connection with him.

704
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,949
At least, that was my experience.

705
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,090
So Jin.

706
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,059
Did you two decide to date officially?

707
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,090
Yes.

708
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:45,089
We just started seeing each other.

709
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,558
But I'm going to see where it goes with Yeon Woo.

710
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:50,328
What do you like about Yeon Woo?

711
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,500
Well,

712
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,139
I can't just pinpoint one thing.

713
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,939
But I can say that Yeon Woo is the one for me.

714
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,339
He's the one?

715
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,349
Genetically speaking, we were bound to be drawn to each other.

716
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,179
Should I say we are each other's destiny?

717
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,589
So Jin, how could you know that you are the one for Yeon Woo?

718
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,860
Well,

719
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,129
I can't tell you all the details.

720
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,000
But it's a verified fact after many experiments.

721
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,239
As I don't believe in destiny, I can't seem to understand.

722
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,469
But this is interesting.

723
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,439
Right. Thank you for the consultation.

724
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,038
I'll think about the skincare routine.

725
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,710
- Sure. Then have a good day. - Bye.

726
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,349
Right.

727
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,889
So Jin. Why don't I give you a tip?

728
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,488
In a relationship,

729
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:48,419
you should never try to control or chain him.

730
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,429
It's especially the case...

731
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,260
for Yeon Woo.

732
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,099
He hates that kind of relationship.

733
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,730
Bye.

734
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,889
The man I like has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

735
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,730
There are bound to be many women...

736
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,400
around my DNA Lover.

737
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,840
Women who can stay cool will win their destiny.

738
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,678
When you date him for three years,

739
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,279
you learn things about him that you might wish you didn’t.

740
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,549
That’s how you end up forming a deep connection with him.

741
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,519
At least, that was my experience.

742
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,159
Thank you.

743
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,328
So Jin. You just started dating this guy.

744
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,469
What's wrong this time?

745
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:13,210
Is he public property? Why is she touching my man?

746
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,678
Think of...

747
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,949
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene as the cross you have to bear.

748
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,619
Genes can't be remodeled.

749
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,420
Genes...

750
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,789
Remodel?

751
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:33,698
Don't do it.

752
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,459
- That's it. - Stop it!

753
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,269
It can't be remodeled,

754
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,969
but it can be improved.

755
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,969
People...

756
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,510
can change.

757
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,789
(Project to Improve Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

758
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,259
Among the three billion human genes,

759
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,059
only about 20,000 are expressed.

760
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,899
While I can't change the inherited DNA sequence,

761
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,800
I can alter its function.

762
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,069
Turn off Yeon Woo's Casanova Gene switch...

763
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,570
and activate the monogamous gene hiding somewhere...

764
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,849
among the 2,999,980,000 unexpressed genes.

765
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,649
A research team led by a world-renowned expert...

766
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,389
in social neuroscience, Larry Young...

767
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,189
collected the vasopressin receptor gene...

768
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,558
from a monogamous prairie vole...

769
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:38,058
and injected it into a playboy meadow vole.

770
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,630
Then, the male mouse with many female partners...

771
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,130
suddenly changed into a dedicated husband.

772
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:46,139
If so...

773
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,510
I thought you might get cold at the theater, so I brought this.

774
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
Put that over you.

775
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
Thank you.

776
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,829
It's fine.

777
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,039
The kids in class are like that, and so is my teacher.

778
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,469
Mom said that if I got lost,

779
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,440
I should act like I don't know my address and phone number.

780
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,909
She always says we should die together when she gets drunk.

781
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,949
That fatty teased me, saying I was a beggar,

782
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,719
but you're even meaner, mister.

783
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:41,388
Dr. Yeo.

784
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,389
Yes?

785
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,590
If you cry like that,

786
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,630
you'll lose muscle mass.

787
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,969
The muscles in our body are full of water, you see.

788
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,510
Is losing muscle mass important right now?

789
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,579
Do you have a heart made of steel?

790
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:06,820
To that small child,

791
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,119
that Dark Knight card means everything.

792
00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:13,760
But she gave it to that man.

793
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,230
There's no one in the world she likes if she hates the man too.

794
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,329
I can't even cry when I want to either.

795
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,829
You're like a trainer, not a girlfriend.

796
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,610
I'm sorry, Dr. Yeo.

797
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:33,239
It was a joke. Just kidding.

798
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,650
Call me Jung Tam.

799
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,050
Don't call me Dr. Yeo.

800
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,190
Or call me My Cutie Pie.

801
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,059
Good. Yes!

802
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,129
Like that. Yes!

803
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,199
Chew them all up and spit them out!

804
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,369
Yes, go!

805
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,138
I thought you couldn't watch movies with lots of bloody scenes.

806
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:08,408
You've completely gotten used to it, So Jin.

807
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:09,948
Oh, I...

808
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:13,319
Well, the sound is so full and realistic.

809
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,849
I keep getting immersed in it.

810
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:20,259
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

811
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,659
I have something to say.

812
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,730
Oh, okay.

813
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,059
An exciting mood?

814
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,828
Oh, this is too bright.

815
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:29,529
I'm going to talk about something important.

816
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,699
Something important?

817
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,840
Okay, what kind of mood do you need?

818
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,499
Which one would be nice?

819
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,569
A sentimental mood like this? Or...

820
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,110
Oh, I think this lighting would do.

821
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:41,539
Okay.

822
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:44,849
Tell me.

823
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,920
This is a present.

824
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,250
Again?

825
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,760
A bracelet is enough. What is it this time?

826
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,760
What is this?

827
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,230
It doesn't seem like cologne.

828
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,638
Is it something like a hair growth serum again?

829
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,710
No, it's not like that.

830
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,009
It's called PGS.

831
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,509
It stands for "Playboy Gene Suppressor."

832
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,349
A suppressant for the Casanova gene?

833
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,149
It's something I've been developing lately.

834
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,150
I was wondering if you could use it.

835
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,689
Do you still think that I have no choice but to live...

836
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,289
as someone with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene?

837
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,359
No, it's nothing like that.

838
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,658
It's purely an academic...

839
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,730
All right. I'll spray this mist.

840
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,929
- Really? - But I have a favor to ask you.

841
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,229
What is it? Tell me anything.

842
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,369
Let's go abroad together.

843
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,570
What? A trip abroad?

844
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,669
Is that a no? Then, I won't spray this...

845
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,178
No! I'll go.

846
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,009
But for how long?

847
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,209
At least 6 days and 5 nights.

848
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,550
For 6 days and 5 nights?

849
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,980
I'd have no more wishes if I could stay home for 6 days and 5 nights.

850
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,518
(It's dangerous outside my covers! Sensitive and gets easily drained)

851
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,519
(A homebody)

852
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,058
You'll like it after we get back from the trip.

853
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,259
I assure you.

854
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,629
(Recharge my energy outside! Very active)

855
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:04,659
(An outgoing guy)

856
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,099
But you have to spray this mist three times a day.

857
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,130
Okay.

858
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,469
I'll spray it every time I meet you. I promise.

859
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:15,599
All right.

860
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,279
- Did it go in your eye? - Yes. It's okay.

861
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,510
Let me see.

862
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:24,449
Oh, my.

863
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,519
Something went in your eye.

864
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:29,989
What?

865
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,019
Yeon Woo is swimming in it.

866
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,260
Like a little child. Splashing about.

867
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,769
Oh, my. Yeon Woo. All of a sudden?

868
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,969
But isn't it too early now?

869
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,269
And I'm not sure about this in the car.

870
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:55,010
I mean, still, Yeon Woo... This is too...

871
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,309
So Jin.

872
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:58,079
So Jin?

873
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,079
The switch on the side of your seat.

874
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,150
Press it the other way.

875
00:48:06,889 --> 00:48:08,719
Press it with your index finger.

876
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:10,860
You're here.

877
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,429
Good.

878
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,699
Who are you?

879
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,130
Why did you come all the way here for that little girl?

880
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,039
Her next-door neighbor.

881
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,590
The Lord shines his light on our hearts.

882
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:44,460
We firmly believe in His mercy.

883
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:47,559
Confess the sins you've committed thus far.

884
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:52,969
Father.

885
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:57,239
Do you know why I can't come out...

886
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,110
of the wardrobe?

887
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,079
You can tell me.

888
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,849
I also had...

889
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,159
a friend.

890
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,619
Her name was Yoon Hye.

891
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,360
But I...

892
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,400
just stood by and watched as Yoon Hye died.

893
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:34,139
There were some kids that bullied Yoon Hye.

894
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,510
But that night...

895
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,690
It was the second night of our school trip.

896
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,158
Those girls...

897
00:49:47,159 --> 00:49:50,030
came to the room where Yoon Hye and I were.

898
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,629
- They beat her up like crazy... - That must hurt, Yoon Hye.

899
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,829
And dragged her to the rooftop.

900
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:04,010
I hid inside the wardrobe and contemplated it.

901
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,940
"Should I go outside or not?"

902
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,110
But I couldn't go outside.

903
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,389
I should've gone out.

904
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,650
I should've stopped them.

905
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,099
But then,

906
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,539
Yoon Hye died because I didn't go outside of the wardrobe.

907
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:49,949
I still want to hide.

908
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,889
So no one can find me.

909
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,900
So I don't have to...

910
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,599
decide anything in life.

911
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,989
Sister Anna.

912
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:30,860
Yes, Father.

913
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,960
Some trees don't usually have flowers,

914
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:38,869
but the flowers bloom after they burn in a fire.

915
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,909
If there was a fire of torment in your life,

916
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:47,409
that must've been for your flowers to bloom.

917
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,710
A time when you can smile brightly like flowers...

918
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,219
will come soon.

919
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,659
And if someone you love has passed away,

920
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,329
she will be reborn...

921
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,099
in your heart...

922
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:09,530
as a flower.

923
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:54,679
Honey.

924
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,449
It took a long time.

925
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,179
Packing up my things and leaving this house.

926
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:05,518
I'll send the divorce papers through Secretary Gu.

927
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,860
Sign them and send them back.

928
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:12,730
Honey, why are you doing this?

929
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,099
I never cared...

930
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,198
about you seeing other women.

931
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,000
You never cared? You've always watched me.

932
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,869
Whenever and wherever.

933
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,610
Even while I was on trips abroad.

934
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,880
I'm sorry. I will never do that again.

935
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:30,979
Let's please just not get divorced.

936
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,808
That woman, Heo Ga Hee, isn't around anymore.

937
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,480
That woman who was holding you back with her pregnancy is gone now...

938
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,119
Indeed.

939
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,190
You're the one who wished Ga Hee would die the most.

940
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,329
That was why...

941
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,269
What on earth did you do to Ga Hee?

942
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:54,969
Are you...

943
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,069
suspecting me right now?

944
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,309
How despicable.

945
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:03,679
You've always acted like the victim all your life.

946
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,679
And you kept Yeon Woo tied to your side.

947
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,050
Honey.

948
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,019
I don't care what you say to me right now.

949
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:17,929
What matters...

950
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,000
is that our family can start over.

951
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,500
You just have to come back.

952
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,070
No, that will never happen.

953
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,539
Do you still not get it?

954
00:54:58,199 --> 00:54:59,199
Goodness.

955
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:02,969
Why does the time fly when I'm with you?

956
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,139
Isn't that a good thing?

957
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,510
Not really.

958
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:11,150
I wish time would go by very slowly.

959
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,079
That way, I'd feel like we're together for a long time.

960
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,489
Oh, one moment.

961
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,750
Okay.

962
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:21,119
Yes, Mother.

963
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,559
Yeon Woo.

964
00:55:23,289 --> 00:55:24,829
I have something to say.

965
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,229
If it's not important, can we talk later?

966
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:30,400
- I'm a bit busy. - It is important.

967
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,639
We've decided to get divorced.

968
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:44,079
Oh, that's good news.

969
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,219
You can enjoy your life now, Mother.

970
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,880
I'll hang up now.

971
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,158
Oh, so...

972
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,460
Is something going on with your mother?

973
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,500
It's nothing. You should go inside.

974
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,469
- Bye. - Bye.

975
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:38,869
Hey, Yeon Woo. You're here.

976
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,299
- Yes. - Hey, Yeon Woo.

977
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,670
It's been a while since you stopped by at this hour.

978
00:56:42,739 --> 00:56:43,739
Yes.

979
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:46,710
I took So Jin home and wanted to have a drink.

980
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:00,289
Is something wrong?

981
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,719
You should eat something as you drink.

982
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,130
What is it?

983
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,260
Kang Hoon.

984
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,599
My parents are finally...

985
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,800
getting divorced.

986
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,170
All of a sudden?

987
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:20,780
Well...

988
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,710
It was bound to happen.

989
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,219
And what about you?

990
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,320
I told her that it was good news.

991
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,619
That she should...

992
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,860
try to find...

993
00:57:37,659 --> 00:57:40,500
her own life now. That's what I told her.

994
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:43,730
No, how do you feel?

995
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,070
I'm not sure.

996
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:50,099
Something I've been hoping for so badly...

997
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,679
is actually about to happen. It feels strange.

998
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,579
I thought I wouldn't be surprised...

999
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,949
or feel like it was anything new at all.

1000
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:11,460
What's up with you? I'm fine. It's no big deal.

1001
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,960
No big deal? As if.

1002
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,530
Kang Hoon.

1003
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,699
Do you believe in destiny?

1004
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,539
Destiny?

1005
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,369
All my life, as I watched my parents,

1006
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:29,380
I thought something like destiny didn't exist.

1007
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,579
The moment you believe that it's destiny...

1008
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:37,489
is when the nightmare begins. That's what I thought.

1009
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,090
But oddly enough,

1010
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,090
a woman I want to believe is my destiny...

1011
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:45,460
and want to make her my destiny has appeared.

1012
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,800
You don't know how big a headache she's giving me.

1013
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:54,099
I'm doing something I've never done before in my life.

1014
00:58:58,710 --> 00:58:59,969
You mean So Jin, right?

1015
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,589
A couple's photo is taken...

1016
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,260
with the desire to cherish that moment.

1017
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:23,929
The photo doesn't include anything that might get in the way...

1018
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,039
and simply contains the couple at that moment in time.

1019
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:32,408
If we could show each other our hearts as clearly as a photo,

1020
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,010
would the pains of love disappear?

1021
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:13,610
(Fresh produce)

1022
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:35,139
That darned timing is off again.

1023
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:45,879
- What? - Mi Eun. Wait.

1024
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,250
What brings you here this early in the morning?

1025
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,319
Mom sent me some abalones.

1026
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,719
I wanted to give you some.

1027
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,090
And I have something to say too.

1028
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,690
Can we talk over some coffee?

1029
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
Okay.

1030
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,130
Come in for a minute.

1031
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,500
One, two, three.

1032
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,199
Ta-da.

1033
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,869
No way.

1034
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,038
Dad said you and A Ri should have some invigorating food.

1035
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,380
Indeed. Mr. Seo is the only one who cares for me.

1036
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,179
Should we call Yeon Woo and have him join us?

1037
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:25,349
Oh, okay.

1038
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,690
You should call him over and eat with him.

1039
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:39,469
But what is it you have to say?

1040
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,579
Yeon Woo.

1041
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,050
I actually...

1042
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,289
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

1043
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,659
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

1044
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:07,130
It's So Jin calling you.

1045
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:17,710
Hey, So Jin. What's with the video call in the morning?

1046
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,908
Hi, So Jin.

1047
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,250
I came to give Yeon Woo some abalones.

1048
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,710
Let's meet again next time.

1049
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,119
Is something going on?

1050
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,989
Oh, well...

1051
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:34,759
Oh, I had something to say.

1052
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,789
- What is it? - Nothing.

1053
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,489
I'll tell you next time.

1054
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,900
Then, have a good time with Mi Eun.

1055
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:43,359
So Jin, shall we...

1056
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,170
have lunch together today?

1057
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,939
No, I'm about to go work out...

1058
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,569
at the Han River now.

1059
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:53,769
I'll hang up now, Yeon Woo.

1060
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,379
What kind of friend...

1061
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,479
comes over to a male friend's house where he lives alone...

1062
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,650
on a Sunday morning?

1063
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:07,320
I say that woman slept there last night.

1064
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,489
I'll try calling him.

1065
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,730
What's up with you guys? Is something the matter?

1066
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:15,459
So, Yeon Woo is with Mi Eun...

1067
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,399
looking like he just got out of the shower on a Sunday morning.

1068
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,230
Can he not do that?

1069
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:22,739
I'm sure he has his reasons.

1070
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,209
I say you can't get away from a trashy man...

1071
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,879
if you can't let go of your desire to trust him.

1072
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,038
He's not a trashy man!

1073
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,509
So Jin, shall we go and work out at the Han River?

1074
01:03:30,510 --> 01:03:31,510
Think about it as you run.

1075
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:32,679
I'll go by myself.

1076
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,179
Out of the way!

1077
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:45,630
Mi Eun. Lock up when you leave, okay?

1078
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,199
I'll be going.

1079
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,260
Yeon Woo.

1080
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,669
How strong is his Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

1081
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,869
that even the PGS isn't working?

1082
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,849
Oh, what? Darn it!

1083
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:21,130

1086
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,679
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

1087
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,750
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

(Best Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon)

1089
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:54,630
I said I wanted to be alone.

1090

01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,010
The phone is turned off.

1092
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,289
This is crazy! How did he come here?

1093
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,730
So Jin! Hang on!

1094
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,329
Oh, Yeon Woo. What brings you here?

1095
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,869
Did you come to work out?

1096
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,268
The weather was pretty nice until just now.

1097
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:37,809
But it started raining out of the blue.

1098
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,969
Stop acting nonchalant. It doesn't suit you.

1099
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:44,479
Ask me. I'll explain everything.

1100
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,610
It's all a misunderstanding.

1101
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:52,389
Become uglier.

1102
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,260
I wish you'd become ugly.

1103
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,559
I really wish my DNA lover would be ugly.

1104
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:04,468
Someone who has bad manners, isn't sensible, isn't a doctor,

1105
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:06,368
and doesn't have money.

1106
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:07,800
So he can only look at me.

1107
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:12,139
So Jin.

1108
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,679
Don't you get how much I like you?

1109
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:49,780
There's someone...

1110
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:53,210
who finds Han So Jin before I do.

1111
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:09,960
When I think about it,

1112
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:11,869
I was always late...

1113
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:13,730
to get to So Jin.

1114
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,840
When I went to save Mr. Han,

1115
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:19,369
I was late.

1116
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,750
(Hyangto Warm Porridge)

1117
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,760
You like So Jin, don't you?

1118
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:39,988
So Jin is family to me.

1119
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,800
Then, you should stop paying so much attention.

1120
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:46,800
If I had known how I felt just a little sooner,

1121
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
would things have changed?

1122
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:52,340
Confessing your feelings.

1123
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,308
If you miss your timing,

1124
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:55,980
you'll never get a chance to confess your feelings.

1125
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:02,780
Kang Hoon.

1126
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:05,689
Then, from now on,

1127
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,920
I'll call your name often instead of your mom. Okay?

1128
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:10,059
Stop calling me!

1129
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:15,459
Kang Hoon. Seo Kang Hoon.

1130
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,359
Seo Kang Hoon.

1131
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:08,949
(DNA Lover)

1132
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,750
I love you, Yeon Woo.

1133
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,449
I said, "I love you."

1134
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:13,850
Very much.

1135
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:16,059
Something that's easy for someone...

1136
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,359
might be hard for someone else, So Jin.

1137
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:21,260
It's the worst if an anxious attachment type woman...

1138
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:24,930
meets an avoidant type man.

1139
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,300
He runs away in the critical moment.

1140
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,899
We'll have to wait and see.

1141
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:33,009
Yeon Woo and I are a genetic match.

1142
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,409
We're DNA lovers.

1143
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:35,739
Are you sure?

1144
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,608
If you're really Yeon Woo's destined partner,

1145
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:41,350
you could do a destiny test.
