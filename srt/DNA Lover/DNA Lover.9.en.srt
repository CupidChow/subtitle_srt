Would you be okay?

182
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,269
I'm okay. I'm not very sensitive to pain.

183
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:09,019
I'm behind work, too. It'd be easier to start work as soon as possible.

Hold on. What was it? Well...

188
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:26,449
Right, right. Do you like plants, Yeon Woo?

189

I do like plants.

190
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,519
So, I was wondering,

191
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,119
Shim Hospital's bulletin board said

192
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,449
there's an invasive plant removal volunteer event.

205
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:25,169
The more I see you, the more I become unfamiliar with myself.

206
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:31,229
Is that a good thing?

207
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:36,109
I'm not sure. I'm not used to feeling unfamiliar,

208
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:39,629
but I don't hate it.

209
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:43,919

I regret so many things.

220
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,669
There were these hiking shoes he really wanted.

221

How could you both forget her favorite flowers?

359
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:54,599
I thought you had a plan. What are you doing here?

360
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,449
I'm sorry, Ahjussi. I remembered it was Mother's memorial day a week ago.

361
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,979
It happens when you're busy.

362
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:07,309
Because you always brought these flowers,

363
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,199
I almost didn't give her flowers this time.

364
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,039
I'll prepare them from now on.

365
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,759
I've been waiting for this day since I'm not allergic to these flowers.

366
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,899
Please let me prepare them in the future, too.

367
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,019
Okay, I will. Let's go.

368
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,519
So pretty!

369
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:29,419
I'll take one here, too. One, two, three.

370
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,689
- How pretty. So pretty.
- Do we look okay?

371
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:33,949
That was great.

372
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:37,019
Yes, yes.

373
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:39,949
That's it. That's it.

374
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:41,419
So pretty.

375
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:43,919
You're so pretty.

376
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,719
What? Shim Yeon Woo!

377
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,849
Seriously.

378
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,819
He was going to come, anyway. He's so flaky.

379
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:56,519
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up, Yeon Woo.

380
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,649
We're taking a group photo.

381
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,849
One, two, three.

382
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,269
One more. One, two, three.

383
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,859
So pretty.

384
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:09,919
I thought you couldn't come. You somehow made it.

385
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,439
It just happened so.

386
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:15,179
The plan suddenly got canceled.

387
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:18,829
I'm so happy you're here.

388
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:25,279
So pretty. I love it. Look at the flowers. The flowers.

389
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,809
That's it.

390
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:31,849
I wonder what it's like to look at only one person your whole life.

391
00:25:31,849 --> 00:25:34,689
It means you're legally involved.

392
00:25:34,689 --> 00:25:38,349
And who says they'd only look at each other?

393
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,069
Is that so?

394
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:43,749
But those two...

395
00:25:43,749 --> 00:25:45,229
Nice.

396
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:48,029
look so happy today.

397
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,709
Do you think so?

398
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:54,609
How nice.

399
00:25:56,469 --> 00:26:02,869
His mom and I took photos holding lanterns here, too.

400
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:08,669
You guys, I'll have a date alone with her for a moment, okay?

401
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:09,829
Why don't we go together?

402
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:12,229
Come on. Today's a special day.

403
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:15,899
I need to have a date with her, too.

404
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:17,159
Go ahead, Ahjussi.

405
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,119
You brat. See you.

406
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,549
See you.

407
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:23,639
If you don't come back in an hour, I'll leave him here.

408
00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:26,199
Okay. I'll be back.

409
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,919
Should we look around, too?

410
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,569
Many kings and queens who lived in this palace

411
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,859
were loving toward each other.

412
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,439
After Queen Soheon passed, King Sejong

413
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:53,609
didn't bring in a new queen until he passed away.

414
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:56,929
They had eight sons and two daughters during 22 years.

415
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,309
They were a loving couple.

416
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,969
You could say they were a lovey-dovey couple where the woman is older.

417
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:08,169
- Let's move on.
- He had so many court ladies and concubines.

418
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:11,089
How did he only love her his whole life?

419
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,259
What do you think you'd be like?

420
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:19,379
I think I'd be like that if I fell in love

421
00:27:19,379 --> 00:27:21,359
with someone.

422
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,129
Why are those two there?

423
00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:37,419
You go on ahead.

424
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:39,289
- We'll be down there.
- We'll be taking photos.

425
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,619
Okay. Check the area down there.

426
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:48,159
It's funny to run into you here.

427
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,019
You said you had an important plan. Was it to see Kang Hoon?

428
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:54,569
Pardon? No, the thing is...

429
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,119
We came together because it was my mother's memorial day.

430
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,509
- We come here every year.
- I see.

431
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,249
How about you? What brings you here?

432
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:07,579
A friend from the club is doing a wedding photoshoot today.

433
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:11,269
I came here because you said you couldn't have lunch together.

434
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,559
<i>By the way, why are they wearing matching hanbok?</i>

435
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,679
Where's your father? Why is it just you two?

436
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,179
I suppose he needs time alone.

437
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,199
He'll be here soon.

438
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,579
Should we all have dinner together? Let me treat everyone.

439
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,759
Thank you for the offer,

440
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,869
but we spend Mother's memorial day with the family.

441
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:36,699
Anyway, the four of us ran into each other again.

442
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:39,009
It's nice for many reasons.

443
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,829
"Many reasons"?

444
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,809
Hold on, Yeon Woo.

445
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,879
<i>What is she doing?</i>

446
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,319
<i>Han So Jin, don't let this upset you.</i>

447
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,819
<i>You lose if you're bothered.</i>

448
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,839
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

449
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,989
We'll get going now, then.

450
00:28:56,989 --> 00:28:58,259
Call me when you get home, So Jin.

451
00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,549
Okay, I'll call you later.

452
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:12,129
We should go, too. Father is waiting.

453
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:13,599
Okay.

454
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:20,109
[My Lover Shim Yeon Woo: Just because we couldn't have lunch together,]

455
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:22,829
[you had to see Mi Eun, wearing a matching hanbok?]

456
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,399
If you're so upset, why did you act that way?

457
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,949
Can you tell?

458
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:36,609
It's so obvious.

459
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,449
I don't know.

460
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:46,069
To be honest, I'm more upset with Yeon Woo than Mi Eun.

461
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:54,859
I feel so disappointed and angry,

462
00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:00,359
but it feels different with him for some reason.

463
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:03,179
How is he different?

464
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:04,659
I just like him.

465
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,609
Even when he hurts me.

466
00:30:08,189 --> 00:30:11,019
Will you get hurt again?

467
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,489
So, what I'm feeling is...

468
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:17,649
even if I get hurt like before,

469
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,729
I don't think I'd hate him the same way.

470
00:30:21,729 --> 00:30:23,329
I don't know.

471
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:27,539
Is he special because he's my DNA lover?

472
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,409
<i>Why do I feel so uneasy?</i>

473
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,329
About what?

474
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:42,559
I'm not sure, either.

475
00:30:43,729 --> 00:30:47,329
It might be because of Kang Hoon.

476
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,619
- Kang Hoon?
- Yes.

477
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:55,239
She joins him for his mom's memorial day every year.

478
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:59,029
You don't see that often in male-female relationships.

479
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,319
Is that right?

480
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,709
Of course. You'd have to guard So Jin's side well.

481
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,869
Of course, she'd have to guard your side well, too.

482
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:16,139
We don't have a regular relationship, either.

483
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,199
Hello, ma'am. I'll have tteokbokki and soondae to go.

484
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,889
Minus liver and intestines.

485
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:42,269
Give him a lot of liver and intestines.

486
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:48,009
You fail because you only love one thing.

487
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:51,559
Try to expand your taste.

488
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,339
Would you like liver and intestines?

489
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,969
No, it's okay.

490
00:31:56,969 --> 00:31:59,849
Geez, you're so stubborn.

491
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:02,929
Thank you.

492
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,269
You haven't slept all night, right?

493
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,889
Your face looks so tired.

494
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:10,189
What are you trying to say?

495
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:17,469
"Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly."

496
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,629
You can never do that if you're too serious.

497
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,189
Try to think lightly.

498
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:25,289
About what, exactly?

499
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:28,429
I'm not sure.

500
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,339
What could that be?

501
00:32:31,339 --> 00:32:35,919
What do you think that is?

502
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,589
What do you think? It's tastier than you thought, right?

503
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,599
Here you go, ma'am.

504
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,209
You should tell me what that is, at least.

505
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:54,759
What is the thing you can't do if you're serious?

506
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:58,859
Are you really curious?

507
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,369
Confessing your love.

508
00:33:02,369 --> 00:33:07,239
You might not be able to do so if you miss the timing.

509
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:09,219
I told you too much.

510
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,249
Are you okay? Is it good?

511
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,409
It is.

512
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:28,899
Hello.

513
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,429
- Who's she?
- I don't know her.

514
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:41,359
This is a special treat from me.

515
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,969
I hope you like it.

516
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:53,049
- You must come here often.
- This is my first time.

517
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:08,319
<i>The women's passionate look toward Yeon Woo.</i>

518
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,539
<i>They won't stop paying attention to him.</i>

519
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:12,179
<i>I forgot for a moment.</i>

520
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,469
<i>Seven promiscuous octopus legs.</i>

521
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:18,969
<i>- His promiscuous Octo-gene is still powerful.</i>
- Want to see a movie?

522
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,039
Seriously?

523
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:22,909
So Jin.

524
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,399
So Jin?

525
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,159
- Yes.
- What do you think?

526
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,709
- About what?
- The drive-in theater.

527
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:30,129
You know the film "The Man from Nowhere," right?

528
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:34,149
It's back in theaters. I wanted to watch it with you.

529
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,239
But I can't stand watching blood.

530
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,049
"I'll chew your whole body except for your gold tooth.

531
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,149
I still have one shot left.

532
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,109
This is bulletproof glass, you son of a bitch..." Don't you know that?

533
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:51,969

Come in here.

546
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:15,929
Just one moment.

Yes, I've always wanted to come.

551
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:41,289
You came because of the Meniere's disease, right?

552
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,519
Well, yes.

I'm not sure which hospital told you that,

556
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:04,099
but I don't see a genetic mutant that could cause Meniere's disease.

557
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:10,409
But your melanocyte-stimulating hormone could become a genetic mutant.

558
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:15,339
A genetic mutant that develops melasma might appear, too.

Yes, it started only recently,

576
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:20,579

What do you like about him, So Jin?

It's not like I can pick out one thing I like about him.

579
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,889
He's my destined partner.

580
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,309
Destined partner?

581
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:38,709
You could say we're destined because

582
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:42,549
we're attracted to each other genetically.

I can't tell you everything,

585

but many tests proved it.

586
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:59,279
I don't understand because I don't believe in destiny,

587
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:01,049

like a child. Splash, splash.

711
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:18,239
All of a sudden, Yeon Woo?

712
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,409
Isn't it too soon?

713
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:25,139
And we're in a car, too.

714
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:28,159
But still, Yeon Woo. This is...

715
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,039
So Jin.

716
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:31,719
So Jin?

717
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,799
The seat switch.

718
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:37,849
Press the other way.

719
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,779
You can press with your index finger.

720
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,409
<i>There you are.</i>

721
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:46,139
Like that.

722
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:48,869
<i>Who are you?</i>

723
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,469
<i>You came all the way here because of that girl?</i>

724
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,619
<i>I'm her next-door neighbor.</i>

725
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:15,349
<i>The lord shines the light in our hearts.</i>

726
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:21,289
Have faith in his grace and confess your sin.

727
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:27,319
Father,

728
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:31,129
do you know why I can't...

729
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:33,849
get out of the armoire?

730
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:39,809
Go ahead and tell me.

731
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,469
I once...

732
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:47,359
had a friend, too.

733
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,009
Her name was Yoon Hye.

734
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:52,089
But I...

735
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:57,049
ignored her death.

736
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,799
There were kids who bullied her.

737
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,039
That day was...

738
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,549
<i>the second night of our school trip.</i>

739
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:24,439
<i>They came to the room Yoon Hye and I were in,</i>

740
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:29,589
<i>beat her up like crazy and took her to the rooftop.</i>

741
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:38,289
<i>I kept thinking if I should get out of the armoire.</i>

742
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:41,749
<i>Should I get out or not? Should I get out or not?</i>

743
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,829
<i>But I couldn't get out.</i>

744
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:49,979
I should've gotten out.

745
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:53,389
I should've stopped them.

746
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:04,799
<i>But at that moment...</i>

747
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:13,309
<i>Because I didn't get out of the armoire, Yoon Hye died.</i>

748
00:50:20,129 --> 00:50:23,539
But I still want to hide.

749
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:30,609
So, no one could find me.

750
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:36,589
So...

751
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,499
I don't have to make any decisions.

752
00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:00,549
Sister Anna.

753
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:04,719
Yes, Father.

754
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:09,149
Some trees usually don't have flowers,

755
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:12,579
but they blossom after burning in fire.

756
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:18,049
You had a heartache in life.

757
00:51:18,049 --> 00:51:21,099
But it's probably for you to blossom.

758
00:51:23,249 --> 00:51:28,819
You'll soon be able to smile brightly like a flower.

759
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:35,459
And your loved one who passed...

760
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:43,329
will be resurrected as a flower inside your heart.

761
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:28,299
H-Honey.

762
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,059
It took a long time...

763
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,849
for me to pack my stuff and leave this house.

764
00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:38,459
I'll send the divorce papers through Mr. Goo.

765
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:40,409
Sign it and send it back.

766
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,269
W-What are you doing, Honey?

767
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:50,119
I never cared you dated other women.

768
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:53,419
You never cared? You always watched me.

769
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:55,959
Wherever and whenever.

770
00:52:55,959 --> 00:52:58,399
Even when I traveled abroad.

771
00:52:59,439 --> 00:53:02,259
I'm sorry. I'll never do it again.

772
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:03,939
Please don't divorce me, at least.

773
00:53:03,939 --> 00:53:05,809
Ha Ga Hee is gone, too now.

774
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:09,239
Even the woman who held you back by getting pregnant is gone-

775
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:16,369
You're the one who wanted her to die the most.

776
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:17,959
So...

777
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:25,049
what exactly did you do to her?

778
00:53:26,959 --> 00:53:28,409
Are you...

779
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,019
accusing me right now?

780
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:32,899
How despicable.

781
00:53:34,249 --> 00:53:40,239
You kept Yeon Woo by your side his whole life with a heartbroken face like that.

782
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:49,619
I don't care what you tell me right now.

783
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:54,809
What's important is that our family can start over.

784
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:57,309
Only you need to come back.

785
00:53:57,309 --> 00:53:59,759
No, that's not going to happen.

786
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:05,249
Do you still not get it?

787
00:54:32,879 --> 00:54:36,759
Why does time pass so quickly whenever I'm with you?

788
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,419
Isn't that a good thing?

789
00:54:39,419 --> 00:54:40,639
Not so much.

790
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,289
I want time to pass very slowly.

791
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,829
So it feels like we've been together for a long time.

792
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,749
Just one second.

793
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,049
Okay.

It's nothing.

- Okay.

- You came, Yeon Woo.
- Yes.

807

Hyung, you haven't come at this hour in a while.

808
00:56:15,769 --> 00:56:20,399
I know. I felt like drinking after dropping So Jin off.

809
00:56:32,249 --> 00:56:34,239
Is something going on?

810
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:36,669
You need to eat while drinking.

Kang Hoon,

813
00:56:44,059 --> 00:56:48,469
I think my parents are finally getting divorced.

814
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,619
All of a sudden?

815
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:57,369
It was bound to happen, you know.

816
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,019
So, how about you?

817
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:06,419
I said it's a good thing.

818
00:57:06,419 --> 00:57:14,199
I asked her to finally live her life. That's what I said.

819
00:57:14,199 --> 00:57:17,869
I was asking how you're feeling.

820
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,309
I don't know.

821
00:57:20,309 --> 00:57:28,039
It feels strange because what I've been hoping for is about to happen.

822
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:30,569
I didn't think it'd be...

823
00:57:30,569 --> 00:57:33,649
surprising or different at all.

824
00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:45,689
Come on. I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

825
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:47,569
Not a big deal, my foot.

826
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:51,139
Kang Hoon,

827
00:57:52,179 --> 00:57:54,519
do you believe in destiny?

828
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:55,809
Destiny?

829
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:59,059
Seeing my parents my whole life,

830
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:03,059
I believed there's no such thing as destiny.

831
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:07,349
The moment you believe you're meant to be with someone,

832
00:58:07,349 --> 00:58:11,379
you enter hell together. That's what I thought.

833
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:14,039
But strangely,

834
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,229
I found a woman I want to believe is meant to be with me.
