00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,240
(DNA Lover)

(Choi Si Won)

(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

8
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,979
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,639
You should sober up now.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,908
- Be careful. - I'm really okay.

11
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,548
I can walk straight. Look.

12
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:45,978
- No, I'm fine. - Okay.

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,019
- Hello, Mr. Seo. - Hi. You drank too much.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,258
Thank you for the food.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,389
- See her off. - I'll be back soon.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,890
- Get in. - Okay.

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,489
- Slowly. Yes. - Here?

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,799
I'm going in. In!

19
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:15,349
(Like-attracts-like germ project Han So Jin's Five Meals A Day)

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,379
The uniform...

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,250
was Kang Hoon's?

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,590
It can't be.

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,099
Yeon Woo is a tested man.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,599
No way.

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,599
Pheromone.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,939
I have his pheromone.

27
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,239
Right.

28
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,810
That was definitely him.

29
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,479
If there's a man who smells like this,

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,219
you need to bark.

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Could it be...

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,250
that Shai...

33
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,189
stopped...

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,890
So Jin.

35
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:02,560
Did Shai stop because of Kang Hoon?

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,168
Yes. The Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

37
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,168
Right. If the uniform was Kang Hoon's,

38
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:14,008
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene wouldn't have been there. Right.

39
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,610
So Jin. What have you been doing?

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,650
A Ri.

41
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:25,378
The uniform wasn't Yeon Woo's.

42
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,849
It was Kang Hoon's.

43
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,250
What?

44
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,919
If so, my DNA lover...

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,860
So were you mistaken this whole time?

46
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,228
Then the sewer indecent octopus tentacle...

47
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,099
is Kang Hoon?

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,099
Oh, my goodness.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,210
No. I'm sure there's been a mistake.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,508
There's no way Kang Hoon would have the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

51
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,549
You never know.

52
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,180
It could've been suppressed.

53
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,860
(Pheromone, Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,430
He was my perfect DNA lover.

55
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,168
One, two...

56
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,300
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

57
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,509
So Jin.

58
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,680
So Jin.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,060
Believing what you want to believe isn't what a scientist should do.

60
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,060
You need to prove it.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,779
(Episode 11, The Man My DNA is Attracted to...)

62
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,250
(versus the Man I'm Attracted to)

63
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,929
Ma'am. Please give me some tteokbokki...

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,569
and lots of fish cake broth.

65
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,199
Thank you.

66
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,939
Do you always talk so much when you drink?

67
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,110
Oh, my gosh.

68
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:35,879
Well...

69
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,448
Do you purposefully come here...

70
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:41,388
at the same time as me?

71
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,649
It's not that.

72
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,059
But I did wait for you today.

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,888
Me? Why?

74
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,088
Is that what you usually do when you're drunk?

75
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,089
When I'm drunk...

76
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,360
What are you talking about...

77
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,629
Put it back

78
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,779
Kang Hoon.

79
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,540
Love...

80
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,050
always comes back.

81
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,049
Put it all back

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,359
What are you doing?

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,620
Kang Hoon.

84
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,560
I really...

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,698
am sorry. I'm sorry.

86
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,129
I'm really sorry.

87
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,709
I love you.

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,709
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,980
About Han So Jin.

90
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:44,550
What were you talking about yesterday?

91
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
What did I say?

92
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:46,879
Do you really not remember?

93
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,089
Something about uniforms and genes.

94
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,398
Anyway, don't ever say anything that'll confuse...

95
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,629
Yeon Woo and So Jin.

96
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,069
I even said that.

97
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,680
Okay, Kang Hoon.

98
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,680
Let's be friends.

99
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:17,319
Since we're sharing a secret.

100
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,519
It's incredibly childish, but a secret is a secret.

101
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,990
A secret?

102
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,318
The secret that Yeon Woo isn't destined for So Jin.

103
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,360
And...

104
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,060
the secret...

105
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,100
that you're So Jin's genetic match.

106
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,920
Let's hold hands.

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,189
I want to do so.

108
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,310
(OBGYN Sim Yeon Woo)

109
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,829
Are you okay?

110
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,269
Oh, no. I keep sneezing because of allergies.

111
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,240
Oh, no.

112
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,740
Sorry, So Jin.

113
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:58,219
Kang Hoon got this at a colleague's award ceremony.

114
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,449
Right. The day I got allergies because of Yeon Woo's flowers.

115
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,420
Kang Hoon received flowers too.

116
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,989
Mr. Seo. When will Kang Hoon get back?

117
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,299
Kang Hoon is already back.

118
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,799
He said something about needing to sweat to get back to his senses.

119
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
He went to exercise.

120
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:24,338
I'm done with work now. Where are you?

121
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:28,208
(My Lover Sim Yeon Woo)

122
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,709
Sorry, Yeon Woo.

123
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,350
I have something important today.

124
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,989
Should I wait until you're done?

125
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,320
(My Lover Sim Yeon Woo)

126
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,859
No. I'll call you later.

127
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,000
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

128
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,970
What is this? She's making me curious.

129
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,989
Hey, Kang Hoon! Let's talk.

130
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,519
- Go ahead. - Oh, gosh.

131
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,918
Hey. It's important.

132
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,389
I'm listening.

133
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:16,388
Do you remember bringing back flowers...

134
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,729
to the restaurant on the day of our colleague's award ceremony?

135
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,528
At what time did you receive that bouquet?

136
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,028
I don't know. I don't remember.

137
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,599
Try to remember.

138
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,138
What time was the award ceremony?

139
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,600
I told you that I didn't know.

140
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,470
Hey, stop.

141
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
- What time was it? - Goodness.

142
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,850
- Around 11am. - Around 11am?

143
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,018
If so, at what time did you receive the bouquet?

144
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:43,549
Why do you care?

145
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,189
I'll explain the details later.

146
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,230
So try to remember at what time you received the bouquet.

147
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,500
Jung Tam.

148
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,359
I guess you're all here for lunch.

149
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,369
We went to the fire department's award ceremony today.

150
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,639
We're stopping by on the way back.

151
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,940
I think it was around 12pm.

152
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,980
What?

153
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Jung Tam.

154
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,580
That means there's a possibility...

155
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,519
that I had an allergic reaction because of Kang Hoon.

156
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,019
If so...

157
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,720
It's weird.

158
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:19,158
Are you the kind of guy who comes to the Han River...

159
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,859
around dinnertime by yourself?

160
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,829
I mean, I just wanted to go for a run today!

161
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,898
Gosh, are you satisfied?

162
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,129
If so, the telepathy...

163
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,070
(The possibility that he is Han So Jin's DNA lover)

164
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,419
What's gotten into her?

165
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,389
She's so weird.

166
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,639
(Slow mailbox)

167
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,178
You can write a promise...

168
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,379
you'll keep in a year.

169
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,679
A relationship that can end at any point?

170
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,519
Is that the kind of relationship you want to have?

171
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,289
Half of love...

172
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,929
is waiting from the opposite direction.

173
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,169
I'm slowly doing that.

174
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,299
Let's meet again...

175
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:12,340
in front of the slow mailbox.

176
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,109
(To Han So Jin)

177
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,109
(From Sim Yeon Woo)

178
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,779
(Half of love is waiting from the opposite direction.)

179
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,860
(Missed call)

180
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,899
Until when are you going to do that?

181
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,529
If you were me,

182
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,139
would you accept your girlfriend...

183
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,298
doing a body profile shoot with some other guy?

184
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,840
Well... I even...

185
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,778
tolerated the two of them...

186
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,479
being cute in front of me in matching purple shirts.

187
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,009
That's not the problem.

188
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,878
She didn't discuss it with me at all.

189
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,278
I'm more upset about that.

190
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,749
Don't you think she did that to protect your relationship?

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,919
- No, I don't. - If so, don't answer.

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,128
Even if Sung Mi is hurt,

193
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,399
don't answer.

194
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,700
I should go that far?

195
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,840
- What about you? - Me?

196
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,169
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

197
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,209
Hello? Yeon Woo.

198
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,239
Hi, So Jin.

199
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,950
It's been a while. Should we meet using telepathy?

200
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,720
Let's meet at the Han River or Namsan.

201
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,450
That sounds good. How does 7pm sound?

202
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,719
Oh, if so...

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,360
I have a meeting near Yeongdeungpo-gu Office Station.

204
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,759
I'll take off around 6pm from here.

205
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,129
I'll send you lots of telepathic signals before we meet. Okay?

206
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,518
Why are you doing that?

207
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,519
Jung Tam.

208
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,959
I think you owe me a lot.

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,960
When do you plan to pay me back?

210
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,230
I owe you?

211
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,210
Five years ago,

212
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:31,440
I confessed to newscaster No Min Jung...

213
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:35,149
while consoling her after you dumped her.

214
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,178
I actually liked her before you did.

215
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:39,279
Good job.

216
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,018
But she married into the Global Group,

217
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,148
so you don't need to mention it.

218
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,459
Do you owe me anything else?

219
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,090
I went to the brunch cafe where you're a regular...

220
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,059
and ate some new dishes for free by mentioning you.

221
00:14:52,129 --> 00:14:54,500
- And? - On your desk,

222
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,898
I saw... Why do I have to say all of this?

223
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,499
You've sinned a lot.

224
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,569
I'll give you a chance to make up for it.

225
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,569
If you do me this favour, I'll also give you...

226
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,139
the hotel voucher I couldn't give you last time.

227
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,949
I won't do it, you fox.

228
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,579
Don't you need the hotel voucher? Should we forget about it?

229
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,778
It's a rooftop suite. I'm sure Sung Mi would've loved it.

230
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,049
Bye, then.

231
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,490
Do you need my body or my brain?

232
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,658
Han So Jin has entered the Yeongdeungpo-gu Office Station.

233
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,189
She has entered the Yeongdeungpo-gu Office Station.

234
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,330
Okay. Let's go.

235
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,018
Line two...

236
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,919
heads to Jamsil. Is she going to the Han River?

237
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,418
The Han River isn't only in Jamsil, Jung Tam.

238
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,929
Don't get distracted and follow her closely.

239
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,359
This station is Jamsil, Songpa-gu Office Station.

240
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,700
The doors are on your right.

241
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,700
She's getting off at Jamsil. It was the Han River. Over.

242
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,509
I was right, wasn't I? Hello?

243
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,080
This arrogant punk hung up on me.

244
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,250
I'll tolerate it for the hotel voucher.

245
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,789
Doctor Yeo Jung Tam?

246
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,509
I knew it. It wasn't a coincidence.

247
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,549
Yeon Woo and I did communicate with telepathy before.

248
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:29,519
She should be around here.

249
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,289
Jung Tam.

250
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,390
She's not here yet.

251
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Yes.

252
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,569
Okay. I'll send you the hotel voucher right away.

253
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,200
Have fun with Sung Mi.

254
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,170
Are you sure So Jin got off at Jamsil Station?

255
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:52,539
If so, she should be here by now.

256
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,549
Okay. Bye.

257
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,990
She should be here by now.

258
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,598
Hi, So Jin. Where are you?

259
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:19,599
Well...

260
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:22,410
I'm almost at Namsan.

261
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,079
I can see the octagonal pavilion.

262
00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:27,309
Where are you?

263
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,680
You're at Namsan?

264
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,279
I see.

265
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,190
I'm also on my way there.

266
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,618
It looks like our telepathy worked again.

267
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,220
But what should I do?

268
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,959
There's a car accident ahead,

269
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,700
so I might be a little delayed. Is that okay?

270
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,500
- Yes. - I'm so sorry...

271
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Did you do this last time too?

272
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,588
- So Jin... - Did you use Jung Tam...

273
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:19,029
to find out where I was going?

274
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,200
I wanted to do all I could...

275
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,999
to make you happy.

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,339
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,739
I have a question.

278
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,539
- What? - Was that uniform...

279
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,609
really yours?

280
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
No.

281
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,490
Kang Hoon and I played that day with the same number.

282
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,459
You took Kang Hoon's uniform.

283
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
But...

284
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,529
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

285
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,129
I never meant to lie.

286
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,169
Whatever the reason, we like each other.

287
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,739
I didn't think it was so important when we were getting along.

288
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,339
Whether it was the uniform or telepathy,

289
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,140
you should've been honest with me.

290
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,578
You lied to me.

291
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:08,910
Are you unhappy now?

292
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,519
Aren't you happy?

293
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:16,849
Right.

294
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,420
I'm not unhappy.

295
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,960
But I could become unhappy one day.

296
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,200
Just like my ex-boyfriends who weren't my DNA lovers,

297
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,598
we could have a bad breakup too.

298
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,798
Why are you so attached to your past?

299
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:33,499
Just look at us. Things are going so well.

300
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,440
But it feels like you took advantage of my beliefs.

301
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,539
I guess...

302
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,619
we better take a break to think things over.

303
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,579
- What? - I'm sorry.

304
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:47,950
So Jin.

305
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:50,589
So Jin!

306
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,789
Take advantage of her?

307
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,500
Come on, that's ridiculous.

308
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,940
Even still,

309
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:11,210
how could she say that so easily?

310
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,950
What did I do so wrong?

311
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Excuse me?

312
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,549
Right? My goodness.

313
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,919
She's too much.

314
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,989
- Hey. - Yes?

315
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,059
Are you kidding me?

316
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,490
Are you going to get on or what?

317
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,759
If you're not, don't press the button.

318
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Right.

319
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes. I'm sorry.

320
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,019
Could I get another glass of this?

321
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,519
I'll have the same.

322
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,630
Hey, it's Yeon Woo.

323
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,000
You always have the perfect timing for drinks...

324
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,439
as if you received my telepathy.

325
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,009
Are you on about telepathy too?

326
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,009
What?

327
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,539
Does it actually exist?

328
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,849
What are you talking about?

329
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,289
She wants to take a break.

330
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,970
I won't make an excuse.

331
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,299
I was drinking at Kang Hoon's restaurant,

332
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,200
and I blurted out...

333
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,839
that you and So Jin are not DNA lovers.

334
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,578
I was drunk, but...

335
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,509
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

336
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,849
What really matters between a couple...

337
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,890
isn't whether they're DNA lovers or not.

338
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,990
What's the big deal about it?

339
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,500
It's for the better.

340
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,430
Acting like her DNA lover was starting to bother me.

341
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,640
The important thing...

342
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:25,140
is that I don't want us to break up yet.

343
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,349
Yeon Woo.

344
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,250
Are you sure you won't ever hurt So Jin?

345
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Honestly speaking,

346
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,518
you'll break up with her one day.

347
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,529
Am I wrong?

348
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,829
She's looking for someone she will never break up with.

349
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,999
Someone she can marry and live together forever.

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,039
Can you become...

351
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,599
that someone to her?

352
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,109
If you're not sure about it, you better stop now.

353
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,038
(Incoming call)

354
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,240
(Missed calls)

355
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,119
She doesn't have enough perseverance.

356
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,390
I would've picked up if she had called one more time.

357
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,289
Dr. Yeo, your patient Nam Sung Mi is here.

358
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,569
Please take a seat.

359
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,278
Last time, you were diagnosed with hypothalamus amenorrhoea.

360
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,348
Your leptin level has stabilized.

361
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:15,048
Have you noticed any other symptoms?

362
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,989
Maybe mood swings, headaches, or hot flashes?

363
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,519
I didn't come for medical treatment today.

364
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:27,460
You wouldn't pick up my calls,

365
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,529
so I came to see you.

366
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,868
I'm really sorry a situation called for a misunderstanding.

367
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,480
I want to officially apologize.

368
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,059
Why do you look so drawn?

369
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,818
I feel so bad.

370
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,399
Did you have trouble eating and sleeping because of me?

371
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,459
I'm so sorry.

372
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,500
Don't cry.

373
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:06,900
Will you accept my apology?

374
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:08,469
I'll forget about it.

375
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,069
I'll forget about it, so don't worry.

376
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,179
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

377
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,548
I'm going to get spicy pork.

378
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:17,808
No, not today.

379
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,950
Hey. How about malatang?

380
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,990
- Do you want tanghulu too? - Yes.

381
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,618
- Tanghulu. - Tanghulu.

382
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,789
I wanted to do all I could...

383
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,689
to make you happy.

384
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,890
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,930
But you knew very well how desperate I was!

386
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,599
What? What is it? Are you talking to me?

387
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:37,769
No.

388
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,369
What's with her?

389
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,839
How could you lie about that?

390
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,380
How can you lie about being my DNA lover?

391
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,450
Did I do something wrong?

392
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:05,429
(Sim General Hospital)

393
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,029
(Ambulance)

394
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:12,940
Let's go. Hurry.

395
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,839
Hurry.

396
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,219
(Operating)

397
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,919
(Delivery Room)

398
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,990
Good work.

399
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Hey, Yeon Woo.

400
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:39,130
Both the mother and the baby are okay.

401
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,430
I'm glad.

402
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,869
Are you busy? Can we talk?

403
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,269
Sure.

404
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,680
My goodness, he's just my type.

405
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,709
Seo Kang Hoon is so handsome!

406
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:57,509
Why is he so hot? He gives me butterflies.

407
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,879
Didn't you say the vice director was your favourite?

408
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,720
Are you switching over? How fickle you are.

409
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,588
He has broad shoulders and the perfect body proportions.

410
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:07,959
What a dream.

411
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,528
What should I do?

412
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,489
What should I do?

413
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,459
I'll tell you who has the perfect proportions.

414
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,028
Ever heard of Simvid?

415
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,169
From his hairline to his eyebrow,

416
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,798
from his eyebrow to the tip of his nose,

417
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,899
then from his nose to his chin.

418
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,210
His face is perfectly proportioned with a one-to-one-to-one ratio.

419
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,279
On top of that, he has a sexy brain too.

420
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,749
Dr. Sim wanted to look humane,

421
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,649
so he purposefully answered a question wrong...

422
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,818
during his university entrance exam.

423
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:35,819
Every nurse at our hospital knows this.

424
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,150
But Mr. Seo Kang Hoon is so dreamy.

425
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,189
Did you see him taking care of Ms. Han So Jin?

426
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,618
He's so noble and pure.

427
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:44,588
I'd put an IV in my arm and become a patient for him.

428
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,328
How ridiculous. Hey.

429
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,369
Can you hand me Ms. Kim Ji Yeon's ultrasound result?

430
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,669
Mr. Seo Kang Hoon versus Dr. Sim Yeon Woo.

431
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,268
Who will you choose?

432
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,509
- Drumroll. - Drumroll.

433
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,210
Ultrasound.

434
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,089
How are things with So Jin?

435
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,960
Right.

436
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,430
You two don't have any secrets, do you?

437
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,028
What is it? Did she say something to you?

438
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,670
She didn't say anything to me.

439
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,140
It must be tough for her too. Try talking it out.

440
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Well...

441
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,650
It looks like she needs some time.

442
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,680
You should be understanding of her.

443
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,088
You know why she's looking for her DNA lover.

444
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,089
I do.

445
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,619
That's why it's more difficult.

446
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,099
I don't believe in all that DNA talk either,

447
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,170
but she looks happy when she's with you.

448
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,670
Even I can see that.

449
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,970
Like you say, DNA isn't everything.

450
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,069
It's fine as long as you two are happy.

451
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,079
So you should make a move first.

452
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,930
I took too much of your time.

453
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,690
I'll get going.

454
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,130
Don't worry.

455
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,399
I know many ways to make her feel better.

456
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,599
I'm not worried.

457
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,970
Thank you. Let's go.

458
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,329
So Jin.

459
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:00,859
It's burning.

460
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,630
So Jin?

461
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,589
What happened?

462
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:55,419
Ma'am, one more bottle please.

463
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,450
Okay.

464
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:07,230
We're closing now.

465
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,730
Thank you.

466
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,038
It's time to wrap up.

467
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,039
Yes.

468
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,839
Not on my watch!

469
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,869
I didn't even get to do anything yet.

470
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:19,809
What?

471
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,450
Is it really going to end like this? My DNA lover?

472
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,679
How could he run away...

473
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,848
after stealing my heart?

474
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,549
Sim Yeon Woo, you jerk.

475
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,859
Forget DNAs!

476
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,788
DNA? What is she talking about?

477
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,798
I'm sorry.

478
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,399
She's unwell. I'll take her away.

479
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,368
- That's enough. - Where can I pay?

480
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:45,229
- This way. - So Jin...

481
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,000
I told you.

482
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,508
How could he...

483
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:52,779
Please, let's go after we pay!

484
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,549
Yes. I have somewhere to be tomorrow.

485
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,380
I'll join the gathering next time.

486
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,289
I want to get everything sorted out the way you always wanted.

487
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,589
Come home on Friday at 7pm.

488
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:24,169
How much did I drink last night?

489
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,239
I'm dying.

490
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,538
Don't even mention it.

491
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,508
You drank soju straight like crazy.

492
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:30,808
That's what I'm talking about.

493
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,348
I never knew you drank so well before yesterday.

494
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:37,220
Why didn't you stop me? I feel so sick...

495
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,659
- Hey. - Come on.

496
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,189
It's not like you listen to us.

497
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,730
You were crying and screaming.

498
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,900
I loved that barbecue place.

499
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,028
We can't go there for a while because I'm ashamed.

500
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:52,169
There are so many barbecue places. You can go somewhere else.

501
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,469
But their salted anchovy is something else.

502
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,309
- I'll look for a different place. - It's from Jeju Island.

503
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,009
Ma'am. Hello.

504
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,679
I came to say bye...

505
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
since I won't be able to come here for a while.

506
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,289
I've been visiting often since I took a liking to you.

507
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,590
It's too bad.

508
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,090
Why won't you be coming?

509
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,928
Are you going to stop the anti-ageing treatment?

510
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,800
There's no need now.

511
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,070
I'll be divorcing my husband.

512
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,239
When I think about it,

513
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,340
I've had a crush on my husband for over 30 years.

514
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,139
But I've decided to stop.

515
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,190
Well...

516
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,360
I'm not sure if this will give you any consolation,

517
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,230
but...

518
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,869
I wouldn't call that a crush.

519
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,139
Maybe you chose the wrong person...

520
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,969
thinking he was your destiny.

521
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,880
At a point, you become too old to turn things back.

522
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,989
I have a son.

523
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,960
All of my life,

524
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,130
I thought he was hurt because of my husband.

525
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,699
But these days, I think he was hurt because of me.

526
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,739
Do you know what pains me the most?

527
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,139
My son is unable to fully give his love to someone.

528
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,510
When people told me he dated people without his heart,

529
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,579
I thought he took after my husband.

530
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:53,489
But that wasn't the case. It was because of me.

531
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:58,288
All he saw while growing up was me.

532
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,099
Of course he turned out that way.

533
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,299
You shouldn't think like that.

534
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,939
Loving my husband was so hard...

535
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,010
that I neglected my child.

536
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,440
I don't have much time left,

537
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:18,650
but I want to apologize to my son.

538
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:22,920
What do you mean you don't have much time left?

539
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,260
I'll get going.

540
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,289
Thank you...

541
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,159
for everything.

542
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,099
My pleasure.

543
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,570
Please come visit from time to time so we can have tea together.

544
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,210
I hope...

545
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,650
my son would meet someone...

546
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,849
like you.

547
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,250
So Jin.

548
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,860
I know you don't want to talk to me right now.

549
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,659
Please just hear me out on this.

550
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,299
DNA doesn't matter to me.

551
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,929
I just wanted to become someone you would like.

552
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,570
Unlike what I intended,

553
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,840
I hurt you, and for that, I'm truly sorry.

554
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:51,909
Can't you...

555
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,340
please understand me?

556
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:06,889
I think...

557
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,730
you didn't have bad intentions for doing that.

558
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:14,158
But you said it yourself.

559
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,099
That you only get hurt if you allow yourself to be hurt.

560
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:21,639
I really hate being hurt more than anything now,

561
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,610
but because it's you,

562
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,809
I allowed you to hurt me.

563
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,179
Because I believed you were my destined partner.

564
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,449
But knowing that my destined partner...

565
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,989
wasn't actually my destined partner...

566
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,889
is a little hard to accept.

567
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,500
So, please give me some time.

568
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,239
Are you okay?

569
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,880
I'm not really sure.

570
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,150
About how I feel...

571
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,179
or how Yeon Woo feels.

572
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,480
- Why? - He pretended to be my DNA lover...

573
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:17,949
until now for my sake,

574
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,119
but how is that for me?

575
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,259
It could be.

576
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,059
How could he do that?

577
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,030
I just can't understand it.

578
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,670
You fool.

579
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,300
Don't try to understand it with your head but with your heart.

580
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,578
I'm sure Yeon Woo didn't want to do so.

581
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,309
He must've done so because he liked you.

582
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,779
Would it have been easy for a guy who doesn't believe in destiny...

583
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,650
to pretend to be your DNA lover?

584
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,289
And with his personality?

585
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,260
Do you still not get it?

586
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,369
I don't know.

587
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,379
You're all grown up. You even know how to talk about this stuff.

588
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,749
Don't touch me. I'm all sweaty.

589
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,849
You punk.

590
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:21,119
Hey.

591
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,079
Come to the greenhouse.

592
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,400
(Grass tree)

593
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,260
- Yes? - Is this Mr. Sim Yeon Woo?

594
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,629
This evening, a fire broke out in the greenhouse...

595
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,130
of a home in Seongbuk-dong.

596
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,939
Firefighters were able to put out the fire,

597
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,239
but A, a man in his 50s, lost his life.

598
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:06,259
And B, a woman in her 50s,

599
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,789
still remains unconscious.

600
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,388
According to police investigations,

601
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,259
a diary containing what seems to be a suicide note written by B...

602
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,399
was found on the scene,

603
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,840
leading investigators to believe B attempted to commit suicide.

604
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:23,368
The fire department thinks the fire was started from the inside...

605
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:24,808
and have stated that they are currently investigating...

606
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:27,780
the exact cause of the fire and the scale of the damage.

607
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,679
Mom.

608
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,550
Mom.

609
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,289
Mr. Sim Yeon Woo?

610
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,860
This is Ms. Yeom Jang Mi's diary that we found at the house.

611
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,260
What?

612
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,900
We think she has been planning to take her own life for a while.

613
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,639
Are you all right? I heard it was someone you knew.

614
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,250
Why? Is there a problem?

615
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:18,090
Hello.

616
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,230
You haven't heard, have you?

617
00:45:29,469 --> 00:45:32,599
Yeon Woo's dad passed away in a fire.

618
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,448
We entrust the soul of your follower to you.

619
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,779
Please lead us to hold his funeral gladly...

620
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,989
with hopes of heaven and rebirth.

621
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,558
Comfort the pain of his family...

622
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,559
who will suffer in pain from being apart for the time being.

623
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,530
Let the Holy Spirit be with them and keep away their sorrows.

624
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:03,570
- Amen. - Amen.

625
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I'm sorry for your loss.

626
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,729
By the way, the arsonist who made Director Sim pass away...

627
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,199
was his wife, right?

628
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,428
The motive for murder is obvious.

629
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,070
She suffered all her life because of the director's affairs.

630
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,210
You may not feel mournful, but at least stop the gossip.

631
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,538
How hard would it have been...

632
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,039
for Vice Director Sim to grow up in that family?

633
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,959
Yeon Woo may seem fine on the outside,

634
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,389
but he must be suffering a lot.

635
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,529
Not one of his relatives is here.

636
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:46,469
By the way, you know Yeon Woo's mother, right?

637
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,099
She was your client.

638
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,340
Who...

639
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,039
Ms. Yeom Jang Mi.

640
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,150
Didn't you know that she was Director Sim Sung Hoon's wife?

641
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,579
Oh, right.

642
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:04,919
She didn't fill out anything for her family relations...

643
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,320
when she registered as our client.

644
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,030
She was insistent on keeping it a secret.

645
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,199
There isn't much time left now,

646
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,829
but I want to...

647
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,170
tell my son that I am sorry.

648
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,030
Should I tell Yeon Woo?

649
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,549
If your love was going to change that easily,

650
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,349
you shouldn't have told her you loved her.

651
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:22,690
Excuse me. I must leave. I'm sorry.

652
00:50:23,989 --> 00:50:25,030
Yeon Woo...

653
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,329
Why did you do it?

654
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,530
Even if you despised him...

655
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:59,559
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

656
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:09,840
(Han So Jin in Wonderland)

657
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:18,079
Why aren't you answering my calls?

658
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,449
I'm in front of your mother's hospital room now.

659
00:51:23,449 --> 00:51:24,449
I...

660
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,920
have something I must tell you.

661
00:51:39,769 --> 00:51:41,300
I'm here.

662
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,739
Han So Jin.

663
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,750
The last time you came to see me...

664
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,750
Did you perhaps...

665
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,590
want me to...

666
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,159
hold you back?

667
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,940
(Patient: Yeom)

668
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:35,519
I'm thinking of taking a trip to somewhere warm.

669
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:38,559
I want to reset my memories too.

670
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,159
I need a place where I can dream.

671
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:44,900
(My Lover Sim Yeon Woo)

672
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,800
That goes well together, right?

673
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:51,409
Here.

674
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:56,750
He'll call you. You should eat first.

675
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,550
Okay.

676
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:08,760
Do you not feel like eating?

677
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:11,130
No, I guess not.

678
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:19,599
I want to erase my memories too.

679
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,969
I get a feeling...

680
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,739
that being here will erase my bad memories.

681
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,380
This is the warmest ocean, right?

682
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:34,650
I found him.

683
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:38,519
I think I know where Yeon Woo is.

684
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,460
- Where? - Yangri Port.

685
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:43,629
I'm sure he'll be there. I'll go and see him.

686
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,259
You'll go there at this hour?

687
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,360
Are you sure that's where he is?

688
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,098
Let's hope he is.

689
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,268
Then, call me if something happens. I'll be right there.

690
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,928
Okay. Bye, Mr. Seo.

691
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,030
Okay. Call us.

692
00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,380
Right. There's a red lighthouse by the seawall.

693
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:02,880
People say when couples walk to the lighthouse together,

694
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,880
their love will come true.

695
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:07,280
How about walking to the lighthouse?

696
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,489
Let's just walk while holding hands like this.

697
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:12,590
Shall we go later?

698
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,329
Yeon Woo.

699
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,980
Are you seriously going to make me worry like this?

700
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:41,679
Did you really think...

701
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:44,289
I wouldn't be able to find you?

702
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,760
We can't communicate telepathically.

703
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:52,260
How did you find me?

704
00:54:58,369 --> 00:54:59,670
Are you okay?

705
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Have you...

706
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,468
eaten anything?

707
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,579
Yes.

708
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,940
Let's sit.

709
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,760
Yeon Woo.

710
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,570
Your mother...

711
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:38,670
came to see me right before the accident.

712
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,880
It turns out she was my client.

713
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,980
She must've trusted me,

714
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,190
because she told me a lot about her inner thoughts.

715
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:56,659
And she told me this.

716
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,960
She said she had a son...

717
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:07,239
and that he probably has lots of scars in his heart.

718
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:11,739
But...

719
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:14,940
that they were scars...

720
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
from her, not his father.

721
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,019
So,

722
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:27,860
she wanted to tell you...

723
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,260
that she was sorry.

724
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,500
She also said she didn't have much time.

725
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,409
I'm sorry.

726
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:46,710
If only I had...

727
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,538
held her back at the time...

728
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,579
No.

729
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,280
You don't have to feel sorry about that.

730
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,519
It was my family's issue anyway.

731
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,530
I...

732
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,699
came here without certainty that you'd be here.

733
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:19,139
I worried about you so much that I didn't even care...

734
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:21,510
that you were my DNA lover or not.

735
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,150
Do you know how much I prayed on my way here?

736
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,219
"Please..."

737
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,079
"Please just let me meet Yeon Woo."

738
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:41,130
Yeon Woo.

739
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,539
Yeon Woo, you're burning up.

740
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,110
Thank you.

741
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:25,610
I'm at Yangri Port. I've found Yeon Woo.

742
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,340
We'll spend the night here and go back tomorrow.

743
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,590
Hoon, is something wrong? Are you okay?

744
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:50,000
Dad, let me borrow the car.

745
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:13,690
So Jin.

746
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,030
Yeon Woo.

747
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,130
Are you feeling better?

748
00:59:22,699 --> 00:59:24,230
How long was I asleep?

749
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,440
Just get some more rest.

750
00:59:30,139 --> 00:59:31,670
I'll keep an eye on you.

751
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:36,179
So Jin.

752
00:59:44,449 --> 00:59:46,090
Can I tell you about a long time ago?

753
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:55,030
Was I about 14 years old?

754
00:59:56,969 --> 00:59:58,769
My father told me...

755
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,469
that he had met a woman he loved.

756
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,309
And that he wanted to live with that woman.

757
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,010
And my mother...

758
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,780
became obsessed with my father after that,

759
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,019
as you probably already know.

760
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:23,420
That was when I found out.

761
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,260
The deeper you love someone,

762
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,530
the deeper you get hurt.

763
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,699
That's why I'm afraid.

764
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,510
I can't even tell you...

765
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:42,539
a simple phrase like "I love you."

766
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,549
But whenever I'm with you,

767
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,789
I start acting strangely.

768
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:55,219
I want to tell you that I love you even though I'm afraid.

769
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,828
I had never promised anyone anything before,

770
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:00,559
but I want to make promises to you.

771
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,799
Even if I can't keep them.

772
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,699
Just like how you found the courage to come here today,

773
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:09,599
I'm working up my courage to say this too.

774
01:01:10,139 --> 01:01:11,869
Can you stay by my side?

775
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:22,750
I want to keep hearing your story.

776
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,190
Will you tell me more?

777
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,760
About my mother?

778
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,130
My mother...

779
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,900
My mother...

780
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:46,909
doesn't know that I can't eat spicy foods even now.

781
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:48,710
What?

782
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,380
The worst is...

783
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,420
that she added Habanero seasoning for every meal...

784
01:01:57,449 --> 01:01:58,889
although I couldn't eat it.

785
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:03,559
Why didn't you tell her?

786
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:09,400
It was her only joy to cook for my father who wouldn't even come.

787
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,030
How could I do that?

788
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:17,039
Still, it was bearable.

789
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,469
My mother...

790
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,940
changes her flowers according to her mood.

791
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:36,619
Mom.

792
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,260
Your dad won't come home from now on.

793
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,259
You and I will live...

794
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,328
in this house, just the two of us.

795
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,800
Yeon Woo!

796
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:25,869
(Thanks for everything, So Jin. And I'm sorry.)

797
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,259
You have arrived at Yangri Port.

798
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,369
Ending route guidance.

799
01:05:08,179 --> 01:05:09,179
Goodness.

800
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,780
Why did you come here?

801
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,300
He said to press this in emergencies.

802
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:07,289
Where is Yeon Woo?

803
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:10,769
He's gone.

804
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,969
He's gone?

805
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,400
Yes.

806
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:31,320
I'm hungry.

807
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:33,719
Let's go eat.

808
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:42,230
I'm hungry too.

809
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,269
(Sim Sung Hoon, Yeom Jang Mi)

810
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,310
(Ha Ga Hee)

811
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:36,250
(Sim Yeon Woo)

812
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,960
(DNA Lover)

813
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,759
Mom, I don't know why I keep thinking about her...

814
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,000
since I broke up with her.

815
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,969
You should take good care of her by her side.

816
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:30,770
I hope you won't regret telling me that.

817
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:34,578
Come to think of it, the person who has always been by my side...

818
01:09:34,579 --> 01:09:36,180
was Kang Hoon.

819
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,279
Go on a date with me today.

820
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,249
Look around you.

821
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,278
There are some people who only have their eyes on you, like the moon.

822
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,819
The one who has always stayed by my side.

823
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,390
My DNA lover...

824
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,460
was this man.
