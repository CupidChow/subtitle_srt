1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,925
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:07,949 --> 00:00:09,448
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:10,934
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:11,763
(At left turn signal, At pedestrian signal)

5
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:19,839
Was it because of the last expression on her face?

6
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:24,438
The noises on the familiar street sounded strange to me.

7
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,449
That night's atmosphere,

8
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:29,578
the air,

9
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:31,218
and...

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,118
the street.

11
00:00:42,128 --> 00:00:45,459
I don't know why I went that way when I did.

12
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,769
Ms. Han So Jin!

13
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,097
No...

14
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:54,007
- Help! - Ms. Han.

15
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,409
It's me, Sim Yeon Woo.

16
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:58,638
Ms. Han, are you okay?

17
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:07,819
Was it because of the pouring rain?

18
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:11,695
I was used to accident reports and dispatching,

19
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:14,359
but somehow, they all felt strange that day.

20
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:17,227
A report of an overturned car at the Cheonan Intersection.

21
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:18,659
What is it?

22
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:20,569
Something's bothering me.

23
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:26,668
Jerk.

24
00:01:31,038 --> 00:01:33,239
I should have never left...

25
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,379
because what was really dangerous...

26
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:38,379
was happening there.

27
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:49,788
What is this?

28
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,228
My nose!

29
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,897
What do I do? Mr. Sim, are you okay?

30
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,038
Are you bleeding?

31
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,867
- No, you're not bleeding. - Gosh...

32
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,937
Gosh, what if I broke your nose?

33
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:06,307
I once cracked a walnut with my forehead before.

34
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:07,649
A walnut?

35
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:09,708
A walnut?

36
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,888
By the way, what were you doing?

37
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:16,548
Was that some kind of test?

38
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:19,634
You said you were curious. This is how you find out.

39
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:22,457
Is that how you get to know someone?

40
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:25,057
So? What have you found out about me?

41
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,099
You have a hard forehead.

42
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,737
- I'm sorry... What do I do? - Gosh.

43
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,668
Are you okay? Let me see.

44
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:34,668
It's so red...

45
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,948
- I'll leave it to you. - Okay.

46
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,904
Don't worry. He won't be able to bother you again.

47
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:56,957
Let's go, I'll take you home.

48
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:57,997
I can take her home.

49
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,298
No, wait for me at the restaurant.

50
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:01,728
Let's have a drink.

51
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,569
Okay.

52
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,367
- Bye, then. - See you tomorrow.

53
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:08,668
Let's go.

54
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,217
Oh Sang Min is out of his mind.

55
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:24,059
How can he do something so crazy just because I found out he cheated?

56
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,999
By the way, what's with the long face?

57
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,298
This is why you should be prudent when picking a man.

58
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:37,899
Don't fall for whoever's nice to you.

59
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:41,439
What's up with you?

60
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:45,837
- Is it... - Don't go around late at night.

61
00:03:45,838 --> 00:03:47,485
Make sure you don't take that path again.

62
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,708
Some other pervert might show up.

63
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,347
All right.

64
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:54,718
- Go on now. - I'm leaving.

65
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:28,518
This is how...

66
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,419
you perform a test.

67
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:42,098
Now that I think about it, he's always crossing the line.

68
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:46,739
The Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene is overpowering the healer gene.

69
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:08,158
Look at you. You're more serious than ever.

70
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:13,898
Right. How did you ever meet Ms. Han?

71
00:05:13,999 --> 00:05:16,268
She's someone I want to protect.

72
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,299
"Protect?" Who?

73
00:05:19,598 --> 00:05:21,109
Ms. Han?

74
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:25,477
That woman threw herself from a rooftop to save a mom-to-be.

75
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:27,278
Don't call her a woman. She's a human.

76
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,148
Anyway...

77
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:32,725
I'm curious about her.

78
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,489
So? Are you going to make her cry like all the others?

79
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,258
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

80
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:42,088
Is it okay to kiss someone if you're interested?

81
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,359
Well...

82
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,439
Does So Jin look strong because she saves people?

83
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:54,568
Those who wipe off the tears of others are not strong.

84
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:57,539
They do it to forget their own pains.

85
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,408
So?

86
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:03,124
The first time we met, I saw her tears.

87
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:05,147
She's someone who should never get hurt.

88
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,988
I meet crying babies all the time when I deliver them.

89
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:09,549
- I'm being serious. - All right.

90
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:13,858
(Jang Mi Eun)

91
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:20,629
So forget about So Jin.

92
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,097
- Why? - Why are you interested?

93
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:26,467
I don't know. I'm curious to get to know her.

94
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,768
But you already went through so many of such women already.

95
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,838
Wait.

96
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:36,679
Do you like Ms. Han?

97
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:38,678
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,488
Are you saying you were never attracted to her?

99
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,547
She's like family to me.

100
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,865
Then mind your own business.

101
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,729
Family shouldn't come between a man and a woman.

102
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,229
Right?

103
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:05,338
Did I ask the wrong question?

104
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,848
I should've asked him if he didn't like her.

105
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:15,469
(Always Sushi)

106
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,898
(Telepathy)

107
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:37,838
Beep, beep.

108
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,448
Beep, beep.

109
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:44,018
Beep, beep.

110
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:49,518
(Episode 5: Telepathy)

111
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:52,558
One, two, weave, weave.

112
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:55,859
Good. One, two, weave.

113
00:07:57,129 --> 00:07:59,058
Hey, are you okay?

114
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,167
What are you daydreaming about? You have to focus.

115
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,268
- Did you hit me on purpose? - Perhaps.

116
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,837
You'll get hit again with your head in the clouds.

117
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:05,838
Come on.

118
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,138
By the way,

119
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,139
is Ms. Nam Sung Mi not coming today?

120
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,577
Hold on... Did she have a night shift?

121
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:15,748
I see. If she had a night shift,

122
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,777
she must be tired. She should rest.

123
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:21,248
Are you upset because you won't get to see her?

124
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:22,848
No...

125
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,259
One, two, weave.

126
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,689
Gosh, he ruined my perfect baby skin.

127
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,559
I put so much care into it!

128
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:37,939
I didn't even get to see her face.

129
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,309
I'm low on sugar.

130
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,319
A macaron hits the spot at a time like this.

131
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,399
- Sir! - Ms. Nam!

132
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:10,939
Did you just go to the gym?

133
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,468
Yes.

134
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:14,968
Did you come to buy some macarons?

135
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:17,777
Do you like them? I love macarons.

136
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:20,378
Not really. I usually don't eat them,

137
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,748
but I worked a night shift yesterday.

138
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,177
I dropped by on my way home. I was craving sweets.

139
00:09:24,178 --> 00:09:26,547
I'm totally the same.

140
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:27,787
I see.

141
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,618
I'll see you at the gym, then.

142
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:32,289
- Take care. - Bye.

143
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,399
I got to see her face after all.

144
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:40,598
How cool.

145
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,014
This is how...

146
00:09:47,038 --> 00:09:48,669
you perform a test.

147
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,709
This is how...

148
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,179
you perform a test.

149
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:56,078
A Ri.

150
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,394
What?

151
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,258
You kissed before dating?

152
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:08,559
Quiet down!

153
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:13,968
We didn't kiss. We almost kissed.

154
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:17,569
Exactly. You almost kissed.

155
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:19,598
You almost kissed?

156
00:10:22,609 --> 00:10:26,238
He's not your favourite. He's your fate.

157
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:29,578
Fate is what repeats itself in life.

158
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,279
Well, I guess I'll find out.

159
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:35,248
A Ri.

160
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:38,787
Did anyone ever come to your rescue before?

161
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:41,687
It was as if he received my SOS signal.

162
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,929
An "SOS signal?"

163
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:51,169
No. Never.

164
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:54,069
Wanting such a thing would be a fantasy.

165
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,647
But, I did hear something similar.

166
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:02,807
According to Carl Jung,

167
00:11:02,808 --> 00:11:05,878
something called synchronicity transcends time and space.

168
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,848
Even if you're in two places at two different times,

169
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:11,218
you'd still see the same thing and feel the same way.

170
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:14,728
He must've started off with a hypothesis,

171
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:18,228
just like how I believe there is a telepathic gene.

172
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,804
I'll prove my hypothesis too.

173
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,537
Prove what? Telepathic abilities?

174
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:25,838
Yes.

175
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,269
Go ahead.

176
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,608
I have a half day today. Bye now.

177
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,978
What? Where are you going?

178
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,108
I have a personal life too.

179
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:42,889
"Personal life?"

180
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,259
You?

181
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:50,057
- Hello. - Hello.

182
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,335
- Have some macarons. - Amazing.

183
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,498
- What is this? - Macarons.

184
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:57,368
Hello!

185
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:59,368
- Do you want a macaron? - Hello.

186
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,838
What now? What got you in high spirits?

187
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,468
Me?

188
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:07,277
I was coming out of the gym...

189
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,647
when I suddenly craved macarons.

190
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,947
Out of all the bakeries,

191
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:16,088
this place came to my view so I went in.

192
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:19,718
I ran into her right then and there...

193
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,088
like fate.

194
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:22,458
"Fate?"

195
00:12:23,158 --> 00:12:25,297
Are you on about fate again?

196
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:26,458
There.

197
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,498
Thank you.

198
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:29,628
- There. - Thank you.

199
00:12:29,828 --> 00:12:31,139
And then.

200
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,638
People usually go home...

201
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,738
after a night shift because it tires you out. But...

202
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,238
I usually don't eat them,

203
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,777
but I worked a night shift yesterday.

204
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,708
I dropped by on my way home. I was craving sweets.

205
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:41,008
For some reason,

206
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:44,878
she craved macarons today which she doesn't normally eat.

207
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,547
I've been running into the same girl at the cafe in front...

208
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,618
of our hospital for three years. Are we fate too?

209
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,088
- Really? - Your paths cross...

210
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,557
due to similar routines, you can't avoid it.

211
00:12:54,558 --> 00:12:56,228
Don't try to turn it into something meaningful.

212
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:59,358
You might lose her that way. Okay?

213
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:01,167
- I'll get going. - Okay, Dr. Sim.

214
00:13:01,168 --> 00:13:02,274
Please.

215
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,669
That's not fate.

216
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,269
Rude jerk.

217
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,937
Hey.

218
00:13:09,938 --> 00:13:12,777
Are you looking for someone who'd be your perfect fit?

219
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:15,809
Or are you looking to date someone you can change yourself for?

220
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,779
I recommend this to those who want to date as yourself.

221
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:24,458
This book teaches you how to remain yourself while dating.

222
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,958
Please give this book lots of love.

223
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,789
Also,

224
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,259
it's a handbook, so it's light.

225
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,399
See you during the next live show.

226
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:34,998
Bye.

227
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:36,984
(Live show has ended.)

228
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,937
- Good job today. - Good job today.

229
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:41,008
This must be what they mean...

230
00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:43,307
when they say a writer can permeate the pages.

231
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:46,654
We hope it'll sell a million copies.

232
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:50,248
Not many people are hung up on dating anymore.

233
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,019
See you at the signing event.

234
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:55,689
You're so cool, Ms. Jang!

235
00:14:01,328 --> 00:14:03,088
Have you read the book?

236
00:14:03,428 --> 00:14:05,557
But honestly speaking,

237
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:07,567
isn't the writer boasting about how many boyfriends she has?

238
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:09,468
What a world we live in.

239
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:12,414
Polyamory is a joke. She's just a cheater.

240
00:14:12,438 --> 00:14:13,615
That's true.

241
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,115
How can you love several people at the same time?

242
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,809
Is she trying to test how many she could date at once?

243
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,019
Sorry,

244
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:33,088
but I don't experiment with my life.

245
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:50,167
- Great. - There you go.

246
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:52,039
Please help out with this.

247
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:54,779
Enjoy the food.

248
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,149
Have your fill.

249
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,394
Sister Anna, you're good at cooking.

250
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:04,718
Thank you.

251
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,774
It's because I like eating.

252
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:12,404
Isn't it bland?

253
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:14,205
I like it since it tastes light.

254
00:15:14,229 --> 00:15:16,328
The sauce is sweet and mild.

255
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,838
When I was young, I'd starve the night before...

256
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,937
we were scheduled to have meat.

257
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:24,009
But I usually couldn't eat much because the meat was too salty.

258
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,149
I guess your mother liked salty foods.

259
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,649
I grew up at an orphanage.

260
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,187
My father passed when I was young,

261
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:38,059
and my mother passed in a fire.

262
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:43,259
The pork ribs you made were my orphanage's special meal.

263
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:46,998
Kids would eat too much of it and get sick from it.

264
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,368
I remember they made it salty on purpose because of it.

265
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:55,439
Did you say your mother passed in a fire?

266
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,009
When?

267
00:15:57,678 --> 00:15:59,378
When I was 14.

268
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,955
She used to love her flowers,

269
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,078
but her flower garden caught on fire.

270
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:08,325
Is this finished?

271
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:10,465
Yes.

272
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:11,789
Put it in here.

273
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:13,958
Okay.

274
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,529
Thank you.

275
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,537
Didn't she want to experiment more?

276
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:35,309
Why hasn't she contacted me?

277
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,488
My patient needs to get her gestational diabetes test,

278
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:44,718
so I have to drop by the Iroun Genetic Center.

279
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,519
I have my Botox appointment today. I'm going to be late.

280
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:53,858
Gestational diabetes? Is it Ms. Ko Sung Yoo?

281
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:55,928
She's the one I booked.

282
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,469
I'll go for you.

283
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:00,337
Why are you acting like you're nice?

284
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:01,938
Forget it, she's my patient.

285
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:04,337
No. You should go for your Botox retouch session.

286
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:05,607
You have freckles on your left cheek.

287
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,738
Better go now or it'll be too late.

288
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:08,148
See you later.

289
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,378
- What? - Good luck.

290
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:17,249
Why does he want to go to Iroun Genetic Center so much?

291
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,259
(Iroun Genetic Center)

292
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,739
Ms. Han, this patient is asking for you.

293
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:35,969
Isn't she so pretty? It's weather reporter Yook Jin Hee.

294
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:44,618
Are you...

295
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,655
Ms. Han So Jin?

296
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,725
Yes, I'm Han So Jin.

297
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:52,918
Does it look like I suffer from sexual dysfunction?

298
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,797
What do you mean my ovaries will give out before I'm 40?

299
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,368
What do you mean by that?

300
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:03,867
Also, what is this?

301
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:06,868
What do you mean I was born with a limited number of pregnancies?

302
00:18:06,969 --> 00:18:09,708
Just gather all the viewers of my weather forecasts.

303
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,008
I was born royal.

304
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,309
I wouldn't have something so ridiculous in my genes.

305
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:17,678
You were born with a limited number of pregnancies.

306
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,377
It's directly related to the health of your ovaries.

307
00:18:20,378 --> 00:18:23,049
That's not the issue, is it?

308
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,905
Do you know Pharaoh Group?

309
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:31,405
I'm going to become their daughter-in-law.

310
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,758
They wouldn't want me if they saw this.

311
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,627
First off, please calm down. You can speak with me.

312
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:38,638
- Forget it. - Should I?

313
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:39,844
Hey.

314
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,908
Bring me results that are acceptable, okay?

315
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,779
Go.

316
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:50,208
If you're concerned of any errors in your results,

317
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,148
I'll examine you once again.

318
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:54,918
However, we can't change...

319
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,395
the test results to your liking.

320
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:58,419
Hey!

321
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,864
You! Do you know how much effort I put into this marriage?

322
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,635
How will you compensate me for ruining my marriage and life?

323
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:07,458
Tell me!

324
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:09,398
- Gosh. - You...

325
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,769
- Gosh. - Hey. Goodness...

326
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,938
That hurts.

327
00:19:15,068 --> 00:19:16,367
Hey.

328
00:19:16,368 --> 00:19:18,137
- Are you still hemophobic? - What?

329
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:19,377
- Are you? - Yes.

330
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,479
- Then I apologize in advance. - About what?

331
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:23,509
That stings! Blood...

332
00:19:23,578 --> 00:19:25,277
Wait! Hey, are you okay?

333
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:27,077
Help over here! He's bleeding!

334
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:29,248
- Hurry! He's bleeding! - Hurry!

335
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:30,587
Please put pressure.

336
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:31,988
Excuse me!

337
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,989
Let's leave it at that. You can talk with me.

338
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,299
- Ms. Han, let's go in. - Okay.

339
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,969
I'm fine.

340
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:54,238
Why did he show up at a time like this?

341
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,249
Get in, you look tired.

342
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,978
No, I'm okay.

343
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,118
How cute. She's charming too.

344
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,817
What? What did you just say?

345
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:05,418
I didn't say anything.

346
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:09,857
I know a place that can get rid of a bruise in two hours.

347
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:11,158
Do you want to go?

348
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:14,998
Welcome!

349
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,498
Welcome.

350
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:17,797
- For two, please. - Two?

351
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:19,668
- Hey, show them in. - Yes?

352
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,637
Two? Follow me.

353
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,867
We'll give you a nice room.

354
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,779
This way.

355
00:20:25,979 --> 00:20:27,279
Okay.

356
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,077
You should get rid of the bruise in your heart by destressing.

357
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:35,887
I don't want to be with you for even a second in this state.

358
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,888
I won't look, so just sing.

359
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:42,635
You go first. I'm tone-deaf.

360
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,887
Are you sure you won't regret it?

361
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:46,229
Yes. I like listening.

362
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,368
Okay.

363
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:00,979
Get rid of your heart's bruise...

364
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:03,209
with a song.

365
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:08,587
Please turn up the volume a bit

366
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:12,087
So I can hide myself behind the beats

367
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:16,087
Please act like you don't see it

368
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:19,198
Even if I end up crying

369
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:23,668
I can only imagine how many girls he seduced with that face.

370
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,168
I want to drink to my heart's content

371
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:33,279
Let's sing all night long

372
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,518
I'll get over it after tonight

373
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,989
I'll be sure to stay well like you say

374
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:48,228
So I can stay composed

375
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:54,868
So I can endure it

376
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:59,567
My dear precious love

377
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,309
Goodbye now

378
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:07,208
The beautiful

379
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,949
Sparkling eyes

380
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:12,648
Gosh.

381
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,588
Ta-da.

382
00:22:18,118 --> 00:22:19,688
I haven't sung this in a while.

383
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:32,337
Let's go! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

384
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,238
I I I first

385
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,908
Fell fell fell for you you you baby

386
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,738
Shawty shawty shawty shawty

387
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,508
You are blinding blinding blinding

388
00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:45,377
I can't breathe breathe breathe I'm going crazy crazy baby

389
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:48,148
In your gaze in your gaze

390
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:51,989
I look I look like I am possessed

391
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,488
The way you look the way you look walking toward me

392
00:22:55,489 --> 00:22:59,328
You must have you must have stepped on my heart

393
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:02,768
You confidently smile wherever you go

394
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:03,769
You are attractive

395
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,498
It is normal to think nice women are one dimensional

396
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:11,137
Chic and bold you are really fantastic

397
00:23:11,138 --> 00:23:13,837
It cannot be taken back I have fallen for you

398
00:23:13,838 --> 00:23:14,908
Everyone!

399
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,148
Sorry sorry sorry sorry

400
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:27,117
I thought

401
00:23:27,118 --> 00:23:31,057
I didn't want

402
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:36,598
Such grand destiny

403
00:23:36,969 --> 00:23:38,799
Han So Jin

404
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:42,508
After you left

405
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,637
I cannot fill my days

406
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:51,449
Without destiny

407
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,248
Like stars there are countless people

408
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:59,219
Among them I met you

409
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:02,728
As if we were dreaming

410
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,059
We recognized each other

411
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:09,898
I was overwhelmed just giving love

412
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:14,138
But I received love too

413
00:24:14,638 --> 00:24:17,337
All of that

414
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:21,279
Was a miracle

415
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,949
What are you thinking?

416
00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:29,748
What do you mean?

417
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:32,688
You're suddenly acting like a different person.

418
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,519
You're being warm.

419
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:36,459
It gives me butterflies.

420
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:40,029
Was I warm? Did I give you butterflies?

421
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:44,699
Well, I don't exactly mean that...

422
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,039
Let's keep on with it.

423
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:50,608
Let's keep on with that experiment.

424
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,138
Really?

425
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,238
Can I really?

426
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:56,608
This is how you do experiments.

427
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:00,418
But why all of a sudden?

428
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,188
I suddenly became interested in it.

429
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,547
Why? Do you not like it? Should we not? Forget it, then.

430
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,118
No.

431
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:07,817
I'm really going to do it, then.

432
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:09,104
- Okay. - Oh, my.

433
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:10,428
So Jin!

434
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:13,029
What? A Ri!

435
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,768
Sewer Octopus Tentacle?

436
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,668
You kissed before you started dating?

437
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:19,598
We almost did.

438
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:21,074
Who is that?

439
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:22,408
Well...

440
00:25:23,709 --> 00:25:25,279
What should I do?

441
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:30,277
What... This...

442
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,248
Right. This...

443
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:33,549
Did you...

444
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:36,317
Sewer Octopus Tentacle...

445
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:38,057
- No. - No.

446
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:39,719
It's not like that. A Ri.

447
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:41,287
Where were you today?

448
00:25:41,288 --> 00:25:44,388
I went to volunteer at church.

449
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:46,658
I'm hungry. Do you want sushi?

450
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:56,209
Do you want to go too?

451
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,078
Let's go.

452
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:07,618
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

453
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:12,388
Coming.

454
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,665
Enjoy, Yeon Woo.

455
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,188
Enjoy.

456
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:22,699
So you didn't take your medicine? Really?

457
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:23,929
Three pills.

458
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:27,269
I only took 3 out of 7 pills, So Jin.

459
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,739
And that's because of that priest?

460
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:36,108
When I'm with him, I strangely feel...

461
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:38,148
relaxed.

462
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,347
Isn't this such a miracle?

463
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:44,519
You were always under your desk or in the research lab.

464
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,519
And you're doing volunteer work.

465
00:26:47,318 --> 00:26:50,459
So? What kind of person is that priest?

466
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:54,768
When he was young, his father passed away.

467
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:56,668
His mother passed away in a fire.

468
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,199
So he grew up in an orphanage...

469
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,819
His mother liked growing flowers in a greenhouse.

470
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:17,425
He must take after his mother.

471
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:21,219
When I go near him, I can smell flowers.

472
00:27:31,469 --> 00:27:34,868
Yeon Woo. I think you'll understand me.

473
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:38,539
I want to live my life with the woman I love.

474
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,489
They're grass trees.

475
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:56,858
They don't have flowers right now, right?

476
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,658
That plant only blooms when there's a fire.

477
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:03,069
Isn't that fascinating?

478
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:13,679
(Sim Yeon Woo)

479
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,618
Mom.

480
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:46,338
- Welcome. - Hello.

481
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:51,008
One Americano, please.

482
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,249
- Okay. - Thank you.

483
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:11,228
Do people run into each other even if they don't want to...

484
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,069
if their routines match?

485
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:17,138
No.

486
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,438
Sung Mi and I are destined to be together.

487
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:24,047
One more Americano, please.

488
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,348
Okay.

489
00:29:58,219 --> 00:29:59,519
Sung Mi...

490
00:30:03,189 --> 00:30:04,549
Darn it.

491
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:07,519
Why did he scan me head to toe?

492
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:08,728
Darn it.

493
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:09,758
Get home safely.

494
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,128
- Thank you. - Thank you.

495
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:14,759
(OBGYN Sim Yeon Woo)

496
00:30:22,969 --> 00:30:24,208
What should we have for lunch?

497
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:26,509
A new eel restaurant opened across the street.

498
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:30,307
I'm sorry. I have plans today.

499
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:33,218
With who? If I know them, let's go together.

500
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:35,319
But you...

501
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:38,287
really like eating alone.

502
00:30:38,288 --> 00:30:40,064
- Wait a second. - What?

503
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,387
You disappeared from the centre without a word yesterday.

504
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:44,759
You can't fool me.

505
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,104
You two met up, didn't you?

506
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,327
We did meet up.

507
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:50,098
What did you do together?

508
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,368
We sang songs.

509
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:55,185
- What? - We sang songs.

510
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,067
You... You sang songs?

511
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:00,508
Yes. I'm pretty good at singing. I can rap a bit too.

512
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:01,948
I can even dance a bit.

513
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:05,317
Like stars there are countless people

514
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:08,749
Among them I met you

515
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:16,789
Thank you.

516
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:27,199
Should I bring you some flowers to wrap with those?

517
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:30,009
No. These flowers will kill all of the other flowers.

518
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,277
What kind of woman did you pick this time?

519
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,078
I didn't pick her.

520
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:38,549
She picked me.

521
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,018
Gosh, you scared me.

522
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:49,328
I'm sorry.

523
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,264
- Gosh. - Gosh.

524
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:55,259
Your immune system must be weak because you don't date.

525
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,769
I'm allergic to pollen.

526
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:00,938
Something in here...

527
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:03,608
caused an allergic reaction?

528
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:07,107
Goodness.

529
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:08,809
What's wrong with me?

530
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:12,578
Yook Jin Hee upset you a lot yesterday, didn't she?

531
00:32:13,318 --> 00:32:15,364
I get it. Whenever something like that happens,

532
00:32:15,388 --> 00:32:17,188
I can't sleep for three days.

533
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:19,958
Normally,

534
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,405
I would've been upset for a whole month.

535
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:25,057
But yesterday, someone appeared and made me feel better.

536
00:32:25,058 --> 00:32:26,358
Who?

537
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:32,039
A healer that prevents me from thinking...

538
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,774
sad thoughts?

539
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:35,098
A healer?

540
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,009
It's a man.

541
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:44,377
I'll head out early today.

542
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:45,877
I have a special lecture for my school today.

543
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:47,748
- Okay. You should get ready. - Okay.

544
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:49,049
Wait.

545
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:52,895
I have something I want to eat around my school.

546
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,588
I'm going to eat after the special lecture is done.

547
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,128
Did you... Oh, my.

548
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,969
Sim Yeon Woo. What are you doing here?

549
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,499
Go ahead without me.

550
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:09,537
I didn't have any appointments with outpatients this afternoon.

551
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,607
Gosh. The meaning of sunflowers.

552
00:33:11,608 --> 00:33:14,254
Longing. Worship. Admiration.

553
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:15,278
They must be for me.

554
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:16,578
No.

555
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:57,148
- Boo! - Oh, my goodness!

556
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,688
Why? Were you thinking of how you always cried there?

557
00:34:00,758 --> 00:34:03,358
You used to always skip class. How did you become a teacher?

558
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,927
What? Look who's talking.

559
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,898
You always used to skip club meetings.

560
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,768
How did you become a researcher?

561
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:13,139
Will the students who come to your lecture know?

562
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:14,938
- Know what? - How you...

563
00:34:14,939 --> 00:34:17,407
were rejected by an upper classman you liked so much...

564
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:20,214
and how you cried for all three years of school?

565
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,148
Hey. That was so long ago.

566
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:26,878
By the way, is the club room still there?

567
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,548
Why? Did you still miss that upper classman?

568
00:34:29,549 --> 00:34:31,217
- Hey... - Do you want...

569
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:32,257
a trip down memory lane?

570
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:33,958
It's not like that.

571
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:45,145
Hello. Nice to meet you.

572
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,268
I'm Han So Jin, a graduate of the 52nd class.

573
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:54,239
Why did you become a genetics researcher?

574
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:56,484
DNA...

575
00:34:56,508 --> 00:35:00,478
is a navigation system that helps you find important people.

576
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:14,929
My father was a genetics researcher at the National Forensic Service.

577
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:17,768
He tested the DNA of unidentified people...

578
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:19,969
and helped many of them find their families.

579
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:23,268
Without their DNA,

580
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:26,679
they wouldn't have been able to get back to their loved ones.

581
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:30,708
That's why I wanted to do that work too.

582
00:35:30,709 --> 00:35:33,319
Helping people find those important to them.

583
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:35,349
And finding them myself.

584
00:35:48,198 --> 00:35:49,898
The DNA in our bodies...

585
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:54,668
is long enough to make 1,000 round trips to the sun.

586
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,577
Gyeongjong had a benevolent nature since he was young.

587
00:35:58,578 --> 00:35:59,838
When it came to politics and power,

588
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,507
he was known as the king of...

589
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:04,077
Recently, the research...

590
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:08,049
about Junk DNA, called Intron, is getting very active.

591
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:12,288
Do twins with the same DNA sequences...

592
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,588
live the same lives?

593
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:18,088
The two of us can communicate telepathically.

594
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:21,157
One time, my leg suddenly started hurting badly,

595
00:36:21,158 --> 00:36:24,599
and at the same time, my sister hurt her leg in a car accident.

596
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:27,398
We occasionally observe cases like that...

597
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:30,038
with twins who have the same DNA.

598
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,378
Even if they're in a different place from you,

599
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:36,549
someone can feel the same thing as you at the same time.

600
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,378
I'm researching...

601
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:42,318
whether that's possible with people who aren't twins.

602
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:44,688
I call the person who you can do that communication with...

603
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:47,319
your genetic partner.

604
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:50,757
So people who don't have a twin may still have someone...

605
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:54,628
who they can communicate with as if they were twins?

606
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,304
That's right. If their brainwaves or frequencies get stronger,

607
00:36:58,328 --> 00:36:59,875
and, like this,

608
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:03,469
their signals interfere with each other,

609
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:05,708
their five senses,

610
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,455
feelings, and thoughts can get mixed up.

611
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,608
Like telepathy.

612
00:37:11,448 --> 00:37:15,719
Ms. Han. Could it be the same with guys we like?

613
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:17,987
What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous.

614
00:37:17,988 --> 00:37:18,988
You're so silly.

615
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,558
I'm not sure.

616
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:24,489
Listen closely to your DNA, the prophet from the future.

617
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:27,599
If so, your perfect match...

618
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,268
will come through that door.

619
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:53,634
I heard from BK when I stopped by the centre.

620
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:56,489
Here. I saw that you didn't have any flowers in your lab.

621
00:37:58,189 --> 00:37:59,528
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my.

622
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:02,398
I have a pollen allergy. I'm sorry.

623
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:04,498
I'll wipe it for you. Oh, no.

624
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,438
- Oh, no. - It's okay.

625
00:38:06,499 --> 00:38:08,637
It reminds me of when we first met.

626
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,909
So dynamic. I like it.

627
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:14,608
But seeing as how you reacted as soon as you saw the flowers,

628
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,878
your allergy must be very severe.

629
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,818
I kept having reactions from earlier in the day.

630
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,177
There weren't even flowers around earlier.

631
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:23,088
I was the one in the flower shop, but you had the reactions.

632
00:38:27,758 --> 00:38:29,058
Telepathy?

633
00:38:30,689 --> 00:38:32,057
Telepathy?

634
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:34,159
You haven't had lunch, right? Let's eat together.

635
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:36,329
Wait.

636
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:40,268
Could I stop by my secret place first?

637
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:49,949
- A gift. - Oh, my. He's so cool.

638
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:54,549
This is it.

639
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:57,949
This used to be our club room.

640
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:02,018
Gosh. I spent so much time during evening study hall.

641
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,534
- Really? - It hasn't changed at all.

642
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,128
Oh, a mouse!

643
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:11,628
It's just a model.

644
00:39:12,368 --> 00:39:13,537
Long time no see.

645
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:16,037
Why is that here? Goodness.

646
00:39:16,038 --> 00:39:17,108
Come here.

647
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:19,038
Gosh.

648
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,378
- Ta-da. - Oh, my.

649
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:27,248
This is the spot in the school where stars are most visible.

650
00:39:27,678 --> 00:39:28,764
Okay.

651
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:32,918
Occasionally, my favourite star shows up in the sky over there.

652
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:37,958
I found out later that the star's name was Io.

653
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:40,827
Io is a satellite that orbits Jupiter.

654
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:42,697
It's closest to Jupiter,

655
00:39:42,698 --> 00:39:44,799
so they called it the Star of Hell.

656
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:48,137
- The Star of Hell? - Yes.

657
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:49,907
Because Jupiter is full of storms,

658
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:52,784
the tidal forced made Io a mass of magma.

659
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:54,708
It shoots out lava from one side,

660
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:58,108
and the other side is minus 148 degrees.

661
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:00,818
So it's either a mass of fire or a mass of ice.

662
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:05,088
The two being stuck together made it hell?

663
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:06,788
That's right.

664
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:13,157
But if I were Io,

665
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:16,074
I wouldn't want to separate from Jupiter.

666
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:20,299
If it does, Io would be alone in endless space.

667
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,884
I would've done the same.

668
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,608
Because Jupiter would've wanted it.

669
00:40:29,549 --> 00:40:32,518
Oh, my goodness! This is where that was.

670
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:35,018
Oh, my goodness!

671
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:42,628
Hold on. I'll get it for you.

672
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:57,438
- This is my time capsule. - I see.

673
00:41:11,419 --> 00:41:13,787
I was dating an upper classman.

674
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,958
These are movie tickets I bought to go with him.

675
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,634
But because he was cheating on me,

676
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,898
he had already watched it with some other girl.

677
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,168
How many times have you been rejected?

678
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,569
But they always confess to me first.

679
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:30,768
That MP3 player.

680
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:34,009
What songs are in here?

681
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:38,478
I put one song on here to listen to it...

682
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:40,495
with my destined partner.

683
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,148
This is my theme song.

684
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:44,489
Your theme song?

685
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,734
That's pretty cool.

686
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:49,659
So have you ever listened to it with a guy?

687
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,929
I haven't yet.

688
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,728
Oh, really?

689
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:57,369
Then do you want to listen to it together?

690
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:03,967
Oh, it's out of battery.

691
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:07,409
If it's not broken, should we charge it and listen together?

692
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,378
Well...

693
00:42:13,578 --> 00:42:15,949
Gosh. I'm hungry. Let's go to eat.

694
00:42:15,988 --> 00:42:18,549
What... What should we eat?

695
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:22,288
Well, I did think of something.

696
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:25,458
I do have something I'm craving as well.

697
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,875
Should we say it at the same time?

698
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:28,358
Should we?

699
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:29,867
One, two...

700
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,168
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

701
00:42:32,538 --> 00:42:33,714
Oh, my goodness.

702
00:42:33,738 --> 00:42:35,038
Telepathy.

703
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:38,168
Let's go. I know a delicious mandu soup place.

704
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:41,608
I wanted to eat eel,

705
00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:42,909
but the minimum order is two servings.

706
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:45,648
This is all because of Sim Yeon Woo.

707
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:48,679
He left me alone again because of some woman.

708
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:50,588
That arrogant punk.

709
00:42:55,388 --> 00:42:56,688
Jung Tam.

710
00:42:57,229 --> 00:42:58,929
- Jung Tam. - What?

711
00:42:59,658 --> 00:43:01,375
I guess you're all here for lunch.

712
00:43:01,399 --> 00:43:02,568
Yes.

713
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:05,197
We went to the fire department's award ceremony today.

714
00:43:05,198 --> 00:43:06,768
- We're stopping by on the way back. - I see.

715
00:43:07,299 --> 00:43:09,639
How about Yeon Woo? Why are you eating alone?

716
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:11,639
This is how that punk is.

717
00:43:12,678 --> 00:43:14,038
He left me...

718
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,449
and went to Ms. Han.

719
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,677
So Jin?

720
00:43:18,678 --> 00:43:20,049
Yes.

721
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:38,498
Is that a goddess?

722
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:42,168
Pardon?

723
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,307
Oh, I misspoke...

724
00:43:45,308 --> 00:43:48,884
I meant to say that this was delicious.

725
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:52,677
I see. The sea bream and scallops here are very delicious.

726
00:43:52,678 --> 00:43:53,748
Yes.

727
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:55,318
Well, then. Enjoy your meal.

728
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,148
Yes. Enjoy your meal.

729
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:58,487
Enjoy your meal.

730
00:43:58,488 --> 00:43:59,958
Right. You too.

731
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:05,358
- Good work. - You too.

732
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,498
We ordered this and this.

733
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:08,898
Good job. Let's get this and this too.

734
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:14,355
(Mandu, donuts)

735
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:19,484
Okay. Bon appetit.

736
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:20,808
Wait!

737
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,588
I'm done. It has just been so long.

738
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:34,958
- Can I eat now? - Enjoy.

739
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:41,998
Eating the mandu soup here makes me so happy.

740
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:44,998
Gosh. The mandu is so hefty.

741
00:44:45,428 --> 00:44:47,699
It's so good-looking.

742
00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:53,779
This is good.

743
00:44:59,078 --> 00:45:01,677
By the way, why were you there...

744
00:45:01,678 --> 00:45:03,748
when I was being chased that day?

745
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,887
It was a secluded place.

746
00:45:04,888 --> 00:45:06,219
Right.

747
00:45:06,488 --> 00:45:07,788
Well,

748
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:10,987
I went to Kang Hoon's for a drink,

749
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:13,228
and there was no place to park,

750
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,958
so I ended up going all the way there.

751
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,208
Did you have...

752
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:26,284
some sort of hunch that day?

753
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,424
Did you hear something or flash by your eyes?

754
00:45:29,448 --> 00:45:31,409
I'm not sure.

755
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:35,119
Well, I heard a car honking.

756
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:38,319
It was the same as usual.

757
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,157
What about feeling anxious for no reason or your heart racing?

758
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,659
I'm not sure.

759
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:53,639
I think I was more uncomfortable than anxious.

760
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:55,739
Then those flowers!

761
00:45:55,908 --> 00:45:57,307
Where did you get those flowers?

762
00:45:57,308 --> 00:45:58,608
The flowers?

763
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:00,378
Oh, the sunflowers?

764
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:03,654
Oh, those? There's a flower shop...

765
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,918
that a good friend of mine runs near our centre.

766
00:46:05,919 --> 00:46:07,778
So, I got some fresh ones from there.

767
00:46:07,779 --> 00:46:11,748
Were you perhaps there around 12 o'clock?

768
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:13,257
At the flower shop?

769
00:46:13,258 --> 00:46:16,259
I'm not sure. I may have. Why?

770
00:46:17,689 --> 00:46:21,259
That was when Yeon Woo was at the flower shop?

771
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:25,398
When you saved me while I was being chased,

772
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,097
it might not have been a coincidence.

773
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:30,407
And today, I started having reactions...

774
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:32,037
from the time you were at the flower shop.

775
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:34,237
It was as if I was at that flower shop.

776
00:46:34,238 --> 00:46:35,677
There weren't any flowers near me at the time.

777
00:46:35,678 --> 00:46:37,449
Come on! That's...

778
00:46:37,678 --> 00:46:39,617
It could be that you have...

779
00:46:39,618 --> 00:46:42,148
some other rare allergy instead of a pollen allergy.

780
00:46:42,149 --> 00:46:45,018
And when I saved you,

781
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:46,688
it wasn't telepathy.

782
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:49,565
It was just...

783
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:51,358
a matter of coincidence...

784
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,105
that was close to an inevitability. That's what I think.

785
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:58,528
Don't you think there's some hidden providence...

786
00:46:58,529 --> 00:46:59,869
inside that coincidence?

787
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,478
Fine.

788
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:10,878
Then, shall we do some research...

789
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,918
on coincidence now?

790
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:18,889
Okay.

791
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,628
Eat up.

792
00:47:23,788 --> 00:47:24,788
Thank you.

793
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:26,927
("Will We Be a Good Fit?")

794
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,179
(Author Jang Mi Eun Book Release Signing Event)

795
00:47:31,328 --> 00:47:32,869
- Hello. - Hello.

796
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,978
- Thank you. - Thank you.

797
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,378
- Hello. - Hello.

798
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,179
- These flowers are for you. - Yes, thank you.

799
00:47:47,678 --> 00:47:50,119
I really enjoyed your book.

800
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,787
How do you write so well?

801
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,558
And you even look so smart too.

802
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,599
- I get that compliment a lot. - Yes.

803
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:03,568
- Next? - Oh, I was thinking...

804
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:07,398
of doing that poly thing or whatever.

805
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:08,597
What do you think?

806
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:11,637
Don't you think it'd be nice to have a big fan of yours like me...

807
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,909
as a partner?

808
00:48:13,979 --> 00:48:15,214
Next?

809
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:17,279
You should still answer me.

810
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:21,418
You must not have read my book properly.

811
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:25,849
Just because I date several people doesn't mean I date just anyone.

812
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:28,088
"Anyone..."

813
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:31,489
But I'm not just anyone...

814
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:34,299
Won't you regret it?

815
00:48:38,169 --> 00:48:39,739
Regret? As if.

816
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:45,569
I don't date horny losers who only have one thing in mind.

817
00:48:45,638 --> 00:48:49,324
What? "Horny loser..."

818
00:48:49,348 --> 00:48:51,648
My gosh! You're crossing the line!

819
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:54,518
Do you think you're so great? What? "Horny?" Let go...

820
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,387
- Let go! "Horny loser?" - Next.

821
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:58,688
Hey! I can't believe that...

822
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:00,217
Hey, let go of me!

823
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:01,518
Next person.

824
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:06,528
You've waited for a while, right?

825
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:07,697
Are you okay?

826
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:09,058
I'm fine.

827
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:11,844
I'm such a big fan.

828
00:49:11,868 --> 00:49:13,168
Thank you.

829
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:27,079
That's telepathy?

830
00:49:30,118 --> 00:49:32,387
It hasn't been long since we first met,

831
00:49:32,388 --> 00:49:36,058
but I've never had that kind of connection with other men.

832
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,228
Having a connection is something you say after you learn about...

833
00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:42,827
whether conversations with him are good, what kind of person he is,

834
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:45,327
what his parents are like, and everything there is to know,

835
00:49:45,328 --> 00:49:47,237
you immature girl.

836
00:49:47,238 --> 00:49:51,208
How would you know about what kind of sly snake lies within...

837
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:53,579
a man's heart when you're not even 30 years old yet?

838
00:49:58,348 --> 00:50:01,779
Seeing how stubborn you're acting, you've fallen for him again.

839
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:05,188
That man is Yeon Woo, right?

840
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,759
Listen carefully.

841
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:11,835
I know you and Yeon Woo both very well.

842
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:14,728
The one person who could never be your match is Yeon Woo.

843
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:18,628
Yeon Woo is a guy who could never give you what you want!

844
00:50:18,629 --> 00:50:20,099
Got it?

845
00:50:32,919 --> 00:50:35,918
What's wrong with him? They're close friends.

846
00:50:36,649 --> 00:50:39,617
I bet he feels that way when someone he just rescued...

847
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:41,958
tries so hard to die again.

848
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:43,788
What are you saying?

849
00:50:44,229 --> 00:50:45,858
Let's go if you're done.

850
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:50,427
Oh, gosh.

851
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:53,268
Gosh, sorry about that.

852
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,237
Kang Hoon got this at a commendation ceremony today.

853
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:01,808
I was going to take it home, but I forgot.

854
00:51:02,008 --> 00:51:03,308
Sorry.

855
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,518
Did you say that was today?

856
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,489
Telepathy?

857
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:15,159
Telepathy, as if. That makes no sense.

858
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,029
Gosh, seriously...

859
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:21,458
Why does it itch so much?

860
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:31,739
What are you doing here?

861
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:37,978
Oh, I was just...

862
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:39,579
Oh, right.

863
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,355
Here's a present.

864
00:51:42,379 --> 00:51:46,219
It'll be nice and warm. It just came off the press today.

865
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:50,458
Did you really write all of this?

866
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:53,128
Of course. Take your time to read it.

867
00:51:53,129 --> 00:51:56,505
By the way, did you get a call from the police?

868
00:51:56,529 --> 00:51:59,174
There was a guy who was lurking outside your place.

869
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:00,639
Oh, that?

870
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:04,268
I've had a few perverts trying to break in and running away.

871
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:05,637
Are you not bothered by that?

872
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:08,608
I don't go to my writing studio every day, so it's fine.

873
00:52:10,008 --> 00:52:12,077
What about today? Didn't anything happen?

874
00:52:12,078 --> 00:52:13,378
Today?

875
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:15,847
Do you think you're so great? What? "Horny?" Let go...

876
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:17,048
- Let go! "Horny loser?" - Next.

877
00:52:17,049 --> 00:52:18,117
Hey, let go of me!

878
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:19,418
Right.

879
00:52:20,288 --> 00:52:22,088
- Today... - Give me your number.

880
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:25,128
If that guy was targeting you, he might come back.

881
00:52:27,598 --> 00:52:30,228
What an odd way of asking for my number.

882
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:36,739
Here.

883
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,338
What about Yeon Woo? Isn't he worried?

884
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:42,478
We're not in that kind of relationship.

885
00:52:42,479 --> 00:52:44,148
Then what kind of relationship is it?

886
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,219
Yeon Woo is...

887
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:50,449
my Friday guy?

888
00:52:50,488 --> 00:52:53,134
What? Your Friday guy?

889
00:52:53,158 --> 00:52:56,088
I have different guys I meet on different days of the week.

890
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:01,029
Oh, different days of the week?

891
00:53:04,729 --> 00:53:08,438
I'm sorry. I don't think I'd read the dating column that you wrote.

892
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:11,009
Mr. Seo,

893
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:15,279
do you think that monogamous dating is the only normal relationship?

894
00:53:16,279 --> 00:53:18,347
I don't understand people...

895
00:53:18,348 --> 00:53:20,978
who meet and break up with others easily...

896
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,177
like you or Yeon Woo.

897
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:24,188
Meet and date people who are like you as well.

898
00:53:24,189 --> 00:53:26,449
Don't hurt other innocent people.

899
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,345
(Always Sushi)

900
00:53:40,738 --> 00:53:43,139
Everyone is unkind today.

901
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:49,947
("Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle")

902
00:53:49,948 --> 00:53:53,532
("Psychology of the Unconscious")

903
00:53:56,571 --> 00:53:57,571
Listen carefully.

904
00:53:57,572 --> 00:54:00,487
I know you and Yeon Woo both very well.

905
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:03,411
The one person who could never be your match is Yeon Woo.

906
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:07,311
Yeon Woo is a guy who could never give you what you want!

907
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:08,811
Got it?

908
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,291
Kang Hoon... He usually talks after thinking about it 100 times.

909
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:17,667
And when I saved you, it wasn't telepathy.

910
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:20,467
It was just...

911
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,190
a matter of coincidence...

912
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:26,201
that was close to an inevitability. That's what I think.

913
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,110
Coincidence?

914
00:54:33,111 --> 00:54:34,510
One, two...

915
00:54:34,511 --> 00:54:35,942
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

916
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,342
No way.

917
00:54:38,982 --> 00:54:41,081
Or telepathy?

918
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:45,079
(Telepathy)

919
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:47,991
Hey.

920
00:54:52,261 --> 00:54:54,337
What are you doing, just sitting there with food in front of you?

921
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:55,732
That's bad.

922
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,101
- Sung Mi. - Yes?

923
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,232
- This is about a friend. - Okay.

924
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:05,518
A girl that my friend knows seems to have fallen for a dangerous guy.

925
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:07,371
What should my friend do?

926
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:09,981
A dangerous guy? Is he a criminal?

927
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:13,658
Well, it's not like that. But he hurts women a lot.

928
00:55:13,682 --> 00:55:16,351
When he likes a girl, he makes her totally fall in love with him,

929
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:18,958
but when he has a change of heart? He just kicks her to the curb.

930
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,228
Hey, the woman is a fool for falling for him.

931
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,621
But apparently, they can't help but fall for him.

932
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:26,962
He's handsome, well-mannered, and a doctor...

933
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,491
And he's humorous too.

934
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:32,731
The girls around me seem like they can't fall out of love...

935
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:35,300
once they fall for a guy, even if they know he's a bad guy.

936
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:39,002
And there are always girls who fall for bad guys.

937
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:41,112
What can be done, then?

938
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:44,511
I mean, my friend.

939
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:52,297
Oh, you're here.

940
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:54,451
- Come in. - Hello.

941
00:55:58,162 --> 00:55:59,991
Gosh, thank you.

942
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:02,630
Here is the DNA test report for Ms. Ko Sung Yoo.

943
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:05,408
Thankfully, the fetus has normal genes.

944
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,871
Although, you will have to keep track of...

945
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:11,277
fetal hypoglycemia or polycythemia.

946
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:12,802
That's good.

947
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:14,971
This patient has had diabetes since childhood,

948
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:17,282
so we were keeping a closer eye on her pregnancy.

949
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,058
And we'll have to continue tracking her hormone balance after birth.

950
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:22,251
Would you like a cup of tea?

951
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:23,851
Sure, I'd appreciate that.

952
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:25,380
One moment.

953
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,681
Okay.

954
00:56:27,524 --> 00:56:28,422
("Telepathy Is Not Science Fiction")

955
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:33,061
("Telepathy Is Not Science Fiction")

956
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:34,530
"Telepathy?"

957
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:37,777
Ms. Han, is telepathy really possible?

958
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:39,362
Oh, that?

959
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:44,147
I believe there's some hidden providence inside coincidence.

960
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:48,518
And couldn't there be a gene that affects that providence?

961
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:49,740
I'm researching it.

962
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,041
If it's a coincidence...

963
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:54,010
You mean like when you go somewhere without much thought,

964
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,210
but you meet by coincidence?

965
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,511
No.

966
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:58,627
That's just plain coincidence.

967
00:56:58,651 --> 00:57:00,052
Not like that.

968
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,791
"I want to meet you. I want to meet you so badly."

969
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,822
You send a signal.

970
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,532
Whether that's consciously or subconsciously.

971
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,931
But I'm only researching it too.

972
00:57:22,711 --> 00:57:25,081
- Here you go. - Thank you.

973
00:57:26,711 --> 00:57:28,212
Oh, right.

974
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,282
I heard you went to karaoke with Yeon Woo.

975
00:57:32,122 --> 00:57:35,822
Yeon Woo said he sang with you. But that's a lie, isn't it?

976
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:39,991
Ever since he was totally humiliated at our college retreat,

977
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:42,630
Yeon Woo never sings in front of other people.

978
00:57:42,631 --> 00:57:45,607
What? I doubt that.

979
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:48,070
- He never put down the mic. - What?

980
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:50,402
So I couldn't sing that many songs.

981
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:53,712
Did he put on a consolation show or what?

982
00:57:54,211 --> 00:57:55,772
"A consolation show?"

983
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:58,541
- Let's go! - Ddan-ddan-ddan-dda-da

984
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,610
Dda-dda-ran-ddan

985
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:03,252
Ddan-ddan-ddan-dda-da

986
00:58:07,392 --> 00:58:11,721
Well, his dance moves did console me a bit.

987
00:58:12,392 --> 00:58:14,391
- Dance? - Yes.

988
00:58:14,392 --> 00:58:17,860
You mean when his head and body move in different directions?

989
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,431
- Yes, that. - He must be crazy.

990
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,877
By the way,

991
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,442
that's practically like you guys are dating.

992
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:30,382
Dating...

993
00:58:30,611 --> 00:58:31,687
What?

994
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:34,851
No, we're not dating.

995
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:37,498
If that's not it, what's going on between you two?

996
00:58:37,522 --> 00:58:40,690
Oh, well, so...

997
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:42,221
I'd say...

998
00:58:42,392 --> 00:58:44,161
we're research partners?

999
00:58:47,366 --> 00:58:48,741
Yes, Mother.

1000
00:58:48,765 --> 00:58:50,012
Hey, Yeon Woo.

1001
00:58:50,036 --> 00:58:52,735
Your auntie came back from the US today and is coming over.

1002
00:58:52,736 --> 00:58:55,575
We're having dinner together. Will you come to Seongbuk-dong?

1003
00:58:55,576 --> 00:58:58,206
Oh, is Auntie in Seoul?

1004
00:58:58,406 --> 00:58:59,976
Has it been ten years?

1005
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:02,746
Yes, sure. I'll be there later.

1006
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:08,985
Min Ho!

1007
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:11,224
- Oh, are you okay? - Oh, my. I'm sorry.

1008
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:12,684
- Sorry. - You should be careful.

1009
00:59:12,685 --> 00:59:15,025
- No, it's fine. - Sorry.

1010
00:59:27,276 --> 00:59:29,005
I sneezed again.

1011
00:59:29,506 --> 00:59:30,876
Just like that time.

1012
00:59:32,506 --> 00:59:34,315
- These must be for me. - No.

1013
00:59:39,915 --> 00:59:43,715
I can just do an experiment to see if it's telepathy or coincidence.

1014
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:48,092
(Iroun Center Han So Jin)

1015
00:59:50,903 --> 00:59:52,209
Hey, there.

1016
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:53,803
Let's have dinner tonight.

1017
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:56,303
Sorry, but I have plans tonight...

1018
00:59:56,304 --> 00:59:58,314
I have something to say to you.

1019
00:59:58,574 --> 00:59:59,914
Do you want to...

1020
01:00:00,384 --> 01:00:03,343
meet me by coincidence and have dinner?

1021
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,590
By coincidence?

1022
01:00:06,614 --> 01:00:09,423
The Han River or Mount Nam.

1023
01:00:09,554 --> 01:00:13,030
We'll each choose one right now and go there.

1024
01:00:13,054 --> 01:00:14,663
But on our way,

1025
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:18,263
we'll send each other the place we're going to via telepathy.

1026
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:21,510
And we'll meet there by coincidence.

1027
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:24,249
Why must I do that?

1028
01:00:24,273 --> 01:00:25,774
I want to check.

1029
01:00:25,974 --> 01:00:27,149
What?

1030
01:00:27,173 --> 01:00:30,073
Whether our telepathy really works.

1031
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:36,444
Whether DNA lovers can really communicate via telepathy.

1032
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:41,823
This woman talks about DNA in crucial moments.

1033
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:44,694
This unpredictable fanatic.

1034
01:00:44,923 --> 01:00:46,754
Okay, let's do this experiment.

1035
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:50,524
Well, I was the one who consented to the experiment.

1036
01:00:50,793 --> 01:00:52,093
What should I do?

1037
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:54,263
Then, let's narrow down the area.

1038
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:56,462
At exactly 8pm, we'll either meet at the tower of Mount Nam...

1039
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:59,033
or at the bench looking out at Jamsu Bridge...

1040
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:01,673
at Banpo Hangang Park. How does that sound?

1041
01:01:03,403 --> 01:01:04,774
Okay.

1042
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,823
Where would she have gone?

1043
01:01:24,034 --> 01:01:25,692
- The Han River? - Here it comes.

1044
01:01:25,693 --> 01:01:27,093
- Mount Nam? - Here it comes.

1045
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:28,464
The Han River?

1046
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:30,504
Mount Nam?

1047
01:01:31,503 --> 01:01:32,573
- Oh, I'm getting a headache. - Here it comes.

1048
01:01:32,574 --> 01:01:33,874
This is confusing.

1049
01:01:33,903 --> 01:01:35,203
Here it comes.

1050
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:38,944
We'll arrive at the same spot by communicating telepathically.

1051
01:01:40,983 --> 01:01:43,314
Is it the Han River or Mount Nam?

1052
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:03,363
I have...

1053
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:08,374
an oddly bad feeling about this.

1054
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,032
Yes?

1055
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:49,086
Oh, I'm sorry.

1056
01:02:49,326 --> 01:02:50,657
- Let's go. - Sorry.

1057
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:53,466
Come on.

1058
01:03:08,007 --> 01:03:09,316
Yeon Woo.

1059
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:11,847
Han So Jin!

1060
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:33,805
I'm doing research on whether it's possible...

1061
01:03:33,806 --> 01:03:35,705
- Who are you? - to communicate with others...

1062
01:03:35,706 --> 01:03:37,176
- Oh, right. - even if we're not twins.

1063
01:03:37,177 --> 01:03:41,176
I wanted to listen to Ms. Han So Jin's lecture too.

1064
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:45,046
Are you So Jin's boyfriend or something?

1065
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:48,517
A boyfriend? Well, I'm not her boyfriend,

1066
01:03:49,016 --> 01:03:52,086
but I am a righteous person who helps her with her research.

1067
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:54,986
If you're helping her with her research, you should be in the lab.

1068
01:03:54,987 --> 01:03:57,097
Why would you come all the way here with flowers?

1069
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:01,426
But as her friend, you get a pass on first impressions.

1070
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:02,867
Well...

1071
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:06,613
Oh, then, were you and So Jin friends since high school?

1072
01:04:06,637 --> 01:04:07,937
Yes.

1073
01:04:10,576 --> 01:04:12,676
Then, perhaps,

1074
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:15,946
do you remember which food So Jin liked...

1075
01:04:15,947 --> 01:04:18,216
when she was in school?

1076
01:04:19,317 --> 01:04:20,446
One, two...

1077
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:21,917
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

1078
01:04:23,257 --> 01:04:24,557
No way.

1079
01:04:25,317 --> 01:04:26,756
Telepathy.

1080
01:04:26,887 --> 01:04:29,696
Let's go. I know a really great mandu soup place.

1081
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,936
(DNA Lover)

1082
01:05:16,107 --> 01:05:16,789
Crossed lines.

1083
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,086
With a coincidental connection with someone,

1084
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:20,740
there were mixed signals.

1085
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:21,839
The fireman?

1086
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,487
So Jin!

1087
01:05:23,511 --> 01:05:24,511
Kang Hoon.

1088
01:05:24,512 --> 01:05:25,580
I just came here...

1089
01:05:25,581 --> 01:05:26,786
to see the stars.

1090
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,050
Open wide.

1091
01:05:28,051 --> 01:05:30,450
Why are you doing all this?

1092
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:32,649
So Jin will meet a good guy.

1093
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,126
I will never let you date you.

1094
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,237
How could I meet you here?

1095
01:05:37,261 --> 01:05:39,631
Well, we've always been like that.

1096
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:42,131
I don't play around with someone's sincerity.

1097
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:44,800
Let's do a proper experiment one last time.
