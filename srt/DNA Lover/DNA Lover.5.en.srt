1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,140
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,779
(Choi Si Won)

3
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:15,390
(Jung In Sun)

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,289
(Lee Tae Hwan)

5
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,929
(Jung Eugene)

6
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,968
(DNA Lover)

7
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,468
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

8
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,938
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,939
(At left turn signal, At pedestrian signal)

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,520
Was it because of the last expression on her face?

11
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,119
The noises on the familiar street sounded strange to me.

12
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,130
That night's atmosphere,

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,259
the air,

14
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:57,899
and...

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,799
the street.

16
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,140
I don't know why I went that way when I did.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,450
Ms. Han So Jin!

18
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,078
No...

19
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,988
- Help! - Ms. Han.

20
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,090
It's me, Sim Yeon Woo.

21
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:25,319
Ms. Han, are you okay?

22
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,500
Was it because of the pouring rain?

23
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,540
I was used to accident reports and dispatching,

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,040
but somehow, they all felt strange that day.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,208
A report of an overturned car at the Cheonan Intersection.

26
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,340
What is it?

27
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,250
Something's bothering me.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,349
Jerk.

29
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,920
I should have never left...

30
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,060
because what was really dangerous...

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,060
was happening there.

32
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,469
What is this?

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,209
My nose!

34
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,878
What do I do? Mr. Sim, are you okay?

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,019
Are you bleeding?

36
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,848
- No, you're not bleeding. - Gosh...

37
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,918
Gosh, what if I broke your nose?

38
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,288
I once cracked a walnut with my forehead before.

39
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,330
A walnut?

40
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,389
A walnut?

41
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,869
By the way, what were you doing?

42
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,229
Was that some kind of test?

43
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,370
You said you were curious. This is how you find out.

44
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,438
Is that how you get to know someone?

45
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,038
So? What have you found out about me?

46
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,780
You have a hard forehead.

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,718
- I'm sorry... What do I do? - Gosh.

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,349
Are you okay? Let me see.

49
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,349
It's so red...

50
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,629
- I'll leave it to you. - Okay.

51
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,610
Don't worry. He won't be able to bother you again.

52
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:23,938
Let's go, I'll take you home.

53
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,978
I can take her home.

54
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,279
No, wait for me at the restaurant.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,409
Let's have a drink.

56
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,250
Okay.

57
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,348
- Bye, then. - See you tomorrow.

58
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,349
Let's go.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,198
Oh Sang Min is out of his mind.

60
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,740
How can he do something so crazy just because I found out he cheated?

61
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,680
By the way, what's with the long face?

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,279
This is why you should be prudent when picking a man.

63
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,580
Don't fall for whoever's nice to you.

64
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,120
What's up with you?

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,818
- Is it... - Don't go around late at night.

66
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,360
Make sure you don't take that path again.

67
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,389
Some other pervert might show up.

68
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:19,328
All right.

69
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:21,399
- Go on now. - I'm leaving.

70
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,199
This is how...

71
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,100
you perform a test.

72
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,779
Now that I think about it, he's always crossing the line.

73
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,420
The Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene is overpowering the healer gene.

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,839
Look at you. You're more serious than ever.

75
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,579
Right. How did you ever meet Ms. Han?

76
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,949
She's someone I want to protect.

77
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,980
"Protect?" Who?

78
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,790
Ms. Han?

79
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,458
That woman threw herself from a rooftop to save a mom-to-be.

80
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,959
Don't call her a woman. She's a human.

81
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,829
Anyway...

82
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,560
I'm curious about her.

83
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,170
So? Are you going to make her cry like all the others?

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,239
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

85
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,769
Is it okay to kiss someone if you're interested?

86
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,040
Well...

87
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,120
Does So Jin look strong because she saves people?

88
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:21,549
Those who wipe off the tears of others are not strong.

89
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,220
They do it to forget their own pains.

90
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,089
So?

91
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:30,060
The first time we met, I saw her tears.

92
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,128
She's someone who should never get hurt.

93
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,969
I meet crying babies all the time when I deliver them.

94
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,230
- I'm being serious. - All right.

95
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,839
(Jang Mi Eun)

96
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,310
So forget about So Jin.

97
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,078
- Why? - Why are you interested?

98
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,448
I don't know. I'm curious to get to know her.

99
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,449
But you already went through so many of such women already.

100
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,519
Wait.

101
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you like Ms. Han?

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,659
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,469
Are you saying you were never attracted to her?

104
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,528
She's like family to me.

105
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,769
Then mind your own business.

106
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,410
Family shouldn't come between a man and a woman.

107
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,910
Right?

108
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,019
Did I ask the wrong question?

109
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,529
I should've asked him if he didn't like her.

110
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,199
(Always Sushi)

111
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,879
(Telepathy)

112
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,519
Beep, beep.

113
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,129
Beep, beep.

114
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,999
Beep, beep.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,470
(Episode 5: Telepathy)

116
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,539
One, two, weave, weave.

117
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Good. One, two, weave.

118
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,039
Hey, are you okay?

119
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,148
What are you daydreaming about? You have to focus.

120
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:30,249
- Did you hit me on purpose? - Perhaps.

121
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,818
You'll get hit again with your head in the clouds.

122
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,819
Come on.

123
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,119
By the way,

124
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,820
is Ms. Nam Sung Mi not coming today?

125
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,558
Hold on... Did she have a night shift?

126
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,429
I see. If she had a night shift,

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,758
she must be tired. She should rest.

128
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,229
Are you upset because you won't get to see her?

129
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,529
No...

130
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,940
One, two, weave.

131
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,370
Gosh, he ruined my perfect baby skin.

132
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
I put so much care into it!

133
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,620
I didn't even get to see her face.

134
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,990
I'm low on sugar.

135
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,000
A macaron hits the spot at a time like this.

136
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,080
- Sir! - Ms. Nam!

137
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,620
Did you just go to the gym?

138
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,149
Yes.

139
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,949
Did you come to buy some macarons?

140
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,758
Do you like them? I love macarons.

141
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:47,359
Not really. I usually don't eat them,

142
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,429
but I worked a night shift yesterday.

143
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,158
I dropped by on my way home. I was craving sweets.

144
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,528
I'm totally the same.

145
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,768
I see.

146
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,299
I'll see you at the gym, then.

147
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,970
- Take care. - Bye.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,080
I got to see her face after all.

149
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,279
How cool.

150
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,850
This is how...

151
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,350
you perform a test.

152
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,690
This is how...

153
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,860
you perform a test.

154
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,759
A Ri.

155
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,269
What?

156
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,239
You kissed before dating?

157
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Quiet down!

158
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,949
We didn't kiss. We almost kissed.

159
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,250
Exactly. You almost kissed.

160
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,279
You almost kissed?

161
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,219
He's not your favorite. He's your fate.

162
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,259
Fate is what repeats itself in life.

163
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,960
Well, I guess I'll find out.

164
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:01,929
A Ri.

165
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,768
Did anyone ever come to your rescue before?

166
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:08,668
It was as if he received my SOS signal.

167
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,610
An "SOS signal?"

168
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,850
No. Never.

169
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,750
Wanting such a thing would be a fantasy.

170
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,628
But, I did hear something similar.

171
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,788
According to Carl Jung,

172
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,859
something called synchronicity transcends time and space.

173
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,829
Even if you're in two places at two different times,

174
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,899
you'd still see the same thing and feel the same way.

175
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,709
He must've started off with a hypothesis,

176
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,909
just like how I believe there is a telepathic gene.

177
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,679
I'll prove my hypothesis too.

178
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,518
Prove what? Telepathic abilities?

179
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,519
Yes.

180
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,950
Go ahead.

181
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,289
I have a half day today. Bye now.

182
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,659
What? Where are you going?

183
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,789
I have a personal life too.

184
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,570
"Personal life?"

185
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
You?

186
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,038
- Hello. - Hello.

187
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,139
- Have some macarons. - Amazing.

188
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,179
- What is this? - Macarons.

189
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,049
Hello!

190
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,049
- Do you want a macaron? - Hello.

191
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,519
What now? What got you in high spirits?

192
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,149
Me?

193
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,258
I was coming out of the gym...

194
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,628
when I suddenly craved macarons.

195
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,928
Out of all the bakeries,

196
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,769
this place came to my view so I went in.

197
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,699
I ran into her right then and there...

198
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,069
like fate.

199
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,139
"Fate?"

200
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,278
Are you on about fate again?

201
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,439
There.

202
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,479
Thank you.

203
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,309
- There. - Thank you.

204
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:57,820
And then.

205
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,619
People usually go home...

206
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,719
after a night shift because it tires you out. But...

207
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,219
I usually don't eat them,

208
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,758
but I worked a night shift yesterday.

209
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:06,689
I dropped by on my way home. I was craving sweets.

210
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,989
For some reason,

211
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,859
she craved macarons today which she doesn't normally eat.

212
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,528
I've been running into the same girl at the cafe in front...

213
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,299
of our hospital for three years. Are we fate too?

214
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,069
- Really? - Your paths cross...

215
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,538
due to similar routines, you can't avoid it.

216
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,209
Don't try to turn it into something meaningful.

217
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,339
You might lose her that way. Okay?

218
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,148
- I'll get going. - Okay, Dr. Sim.

219
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,179
Please.

220
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,350
That's not fate.

221
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,950
Rude jerk.

222
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,918
Hey.

223
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,758
Are you looking for someone who'd be your perfect fit?

224
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,490
Or are you looking to date someone you can change yourself for?

225
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,460
I recommend this to those who want to date as yourself.

226
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,439
This book teaches you how to remain yourself while dating.

227
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,939
Please give this book lots of love.

228
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,470
Also,

229
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,940
it's a handbook, so it's light.

230
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,080
See you during the next live show.

231
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,679
Bye.

232
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:03,950
(Live show has ended.)

233
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,918
- Good job today. - Good job today.

234
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,989
This must be what they mean...

235
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,288
when they say a writer can permeate the pages.

236
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,559
We hope it'll sell a million copies.

237
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:16,929
Not many people are hung up on dating anymore.

238
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,700
See you at the signing event.

239
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,370
You're so cool, Ms. Jang!

240
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:29,769
Have you read the book?

241
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:32,538
But honestly speaking,

242
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,548
isn't the writer boasting about how many boyfriends she has?

243
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:36,449
What a world we live in.

244
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:39,320
Polyamory is a joke. She's just a cheater.

245
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,419
That's true.

246
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,919
How can you love several people at the same time?

247
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,490
Is she trying to test how many she could date at once?

248
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Sorry,

249
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,769
but I don't experiment with my life.

250
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,148
- Great. - There you go.

251
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,720
Please help out with this.

252
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,460
Enjoy the food.

253
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,830
Have your fill.

254
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,230
Sister Anna, you're good at cooking.

255
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,399
Thank you.

256
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,639
It's because I like eating.

257
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,309
Isn't it bland?

258
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,110
I like it since it tastes light.

259
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,009
The sauce is sweet and mild.

260
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,819
When I was young, I'd starve the night before...

261
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,918
we were scheduled to have meat.

262
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,690
But I usually couldn't eat much because the meat was too salty.

263
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,830
I guess your mother liked salty foods.

264
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,330
I grew up at an orphanage.

265
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,168
My father passed when I was young,

266
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:04,740
and my mother passed in a fire.

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,940
The pork ribs you made were my orphanage's special meal.

268
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:13,979
Kids would eat too much of it and get sick from it.

269
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,049
I remember they made it salty on purpose because of it.

270
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,120
Did you say your mother passed in a fire?

271
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,690
When?

272
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,059
When I was 14.

273
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,659
She used to love her flowers,

274
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,759
but her flower garden caught on fire.

275
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,129
Is this finished?

276
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,399
Yes.

277
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,470
Put it in here.

278
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,639
Okay.

279
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,210
Thank you.

280
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,518
Didn't she want to experiment more?

281
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,990
Why hasn't she contacted me?

282
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,469
My patient needs to get her gestational diabetes test,

283
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,699
so I have to drop by the Iroun Genetic Center.

284
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,200
I have my Botox appointment today. I'm going to be late.

285
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,539
Gestational diabetes? Is it Ms. Ko Sung Yoo?

286
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,909
She's the one I booked.

287
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,150
I'll go for you.

288
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,318
Why are you acting like you're nice?

289
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,919
Forget it, she's my patient.

290
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,318
No. You should go for your Botox retouch session.

291
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,588
You have freckles on your left cheek.

292
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,719
Better go now or it'll be too late.

293
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,829
See you later.

294
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,059
- What? - Good luck.

295
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,930
Why does he want to go to Iroun Genetic Center so much?

296
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,240
(Iroun Genetic Center)

297
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,420
Ms. Han, this patient is asking for you.

298
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,650
Isn't she so pretty? It's weather reporter Yook Jin Hee.

299
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,299
Are you...

300
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,559
Ms. Han So Jin?

301
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,529
Yes, I'm Han So Jin.

302
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,599
Does it look like I suffer from sexual dysfunction?

303
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,778
What do you mean my ovaries will give out before I'm 40?

304
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,049
What do you mean by that?

305
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,848
Also, what is this?

306
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:33,549
What do you mean I was born with a limited number of pregnancies?

307
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,689
Just gather all the viewers of my weather forecasts.

308
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,989
I was born royal.

309
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,990
I wouldn't have something so ridiculous in my genes.

310
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,659
You were born with a limited number of pregnancies.

311
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,358
It's directly related to the health of your ovaries.

312
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,730
That's not the issue, is it?

313
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,640
Do you know Pharaoh Group?

314
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,339
I'm going to become their daughter-in-law.

315
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,739
They wouldn't want me if they saw this.

316
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,608
First off, please calm down. You can speak with me.

317
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,319
- Forget it. - Should I?

318
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Hey.

319
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:09,589
Bring me results that are acceptable, okay?

320
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
Go.

321
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,189
If you're concerned of any errors in your results,

322
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,829
I'll examine you once again.

323
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,899
However, we can't change...

324
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,200
the test results to your liking.

325
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Hey!

326
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:28,740
You! Do you know how much effort I put into this marriage?

327
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:32,539
How will you compensate me for ruining my marriage and life?

328
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,439
Tell me!

329
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,379
- Gosh. - You...

330
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,450
- Gosh. - Hey. Goodness...

331
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,619
That hurts.

332
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,348
Hey.

333
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,118
- Are you still hemophobic? - What?

334
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,358
- Are you? - Yes.

335
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,160
- Then I apologize in advance. - About what?

336
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,190
That stings! Blood...

337
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,258
Wait! Hey, are you okay?

338
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,058
Help over here! He's bleeding!

339
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,229
- Hurry! He's bleeding! - Hurry!

340
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,568
Please put pressure.

341
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,969
Excuse me!

342
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,670
Let's leave it at that. You can talk with me.

343
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,980
- Ms. Han, let's go in. - Okay.

344
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,650
I'm fine.

345
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,219
Why did he show up at a time like this?

346
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,930
Get in, you look tired.

347
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,959
No, I'm okay.

348
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
How cute. She's charming too.

349
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,798
What? What did you just say?

350
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,099
I didn't say anything.

351
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,838
I know a place that can get rid of a bruise in two hours.

352
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,839
Do you want to go?

353
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,979
Welcome!

354
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,479
Welcome.

355
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,778
- For two, please. - Two?

356
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,649
- Hey, show them in. - Yes?

357
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,618
Two? Follow me.

358
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:49,848
We'll give you a nice room.

359
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,460
This way.

360
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Okay.

361
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,058
You should get rid of the bruise in your heart by destressing.

362
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,868
I don't want to be with you for even a second in this state.

363
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,569
I won't look, so just sing.

364
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,410
You go first. I'm tone-deaf.

365
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,868
Are you sure you won't regret it?

366
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,910
Yes. I like listening.

367
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,049
Okay.

368
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,660
Get rid of your heart's bruise...

369
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,890
with a song.

370
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,568
Please turn up the volume a bit

371
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,068
So I can hide myself behind the beats

372
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:43,068
Please act like you don't see it

373
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,179
Even if I end up crying

374
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,649
I can only imagine how many girls he seduced with that face.

375
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,149
I want to drink to my heart's content

376
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,960
Let's sing all night long

377
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,499
I'll get over it after tonight

378
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,670
I'll be sure to stay well like you say

379
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,209
So I can stay composed

380
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,549
So I can endure it

381
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,548
My dear precious love

382
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,990
Goodbye now

383
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:34,189
The beautiful

384
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,630
Sparkling eyes

385
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,329
Gosh.

386
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,269
Ta-da.

387
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,369
I haven't sung this in a while.

388
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,318
Let's go! Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

389
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,219
I I I first

390
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,889
Fell fell fell for you you you baby

391
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,719
Shawty shawty shawty shawty

392
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,489
You are blinding blinding blinding

393
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,358
I can't breathe breathe breathe I'm going crazy crazy baby

394
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,129
In your gaze in your gaze

395
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,670
I look I look like I am possessed

396
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,469
The way you look the way you look walking toward me

397
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,009
You must have you must have stepped on my heart

398
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,749
You confidently smile wherever you go

399
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,750
You are attractive

400
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:34,479
It is normal to think nice women are one dimensional

401
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,118
Chic and bold you are really fantastic

402
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,818
It cannot be taken back I have fallen for you

403
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,889
Everyone!

404
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,829
Sorry sorry sorry sorry

405
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,098
I thought

406
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,038
I didn't want

407
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:03,279
Such grand destiny

408
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,480
Han So Jin

409
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:09,489
After you left

410
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,618
I cannot fill my days

411
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:18,130
Without destiny

412
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,229
Like stars there are countless people

413
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,900
Among them I met you

414
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,709
As if we were dreaming

415
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,740
We recognized each other

416
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,879
I was overwhelmed just giving love

417
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,819
But I received love too

418
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:44,318
All of that

419
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,960
Was a miracle

420
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,630
What are you thinking?

421
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,729
What do you mean?

422
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,369
You're suddenly acting like a different person.

423
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:01,200
You're being warm.

424
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,140
It gives me butterflies.

425
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:06,710
Was I warm? Did I give you butterflies?

426
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,380
Well, I don't exactly mean that...

427
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,720
Let's keep on with it.

428
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,289
Let's keep on with that experiment.

429
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,819
Really?

430
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,219
Can I really?

431
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,289
This is how you do experiments.

432
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,099
But why all of a sudden?

433
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,169
I suddenly became interested in it.

434
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,528
Why? Do you not like it? Should we not? Forget it, then.

435
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,799
No.

436
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,798
I'm really going to do it, then.

437
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,809
- Okay. - Oh, my.

438
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,109
So Jin!

439
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,710
What? A Ri!

440
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,749
Sewer Octopus Tentacle?

441
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,649
You kissed before you started dating?

442
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,279
We almost did.

443
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Who is that?

444
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,089
Well...

445
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,960
What should I do?

446
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,258
What... This...

447
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,229
Right. This...

448
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,230
Did you...

449
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,298
Sewer Octopus Tentacle...

450
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,038
- No. - No.

451
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,400
It's not like that. A Ri.

452
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,268
Where were you today?

453
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:11,069
I went to volunteer at church.

454
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,339
I'm hungry. Do you want sushi?

455
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,890
Do you want to go too?

456
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,759
Let's go.

457
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,299
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

458
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,069
Coming.

459
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,470
Enjoy, Yeon Woo.

460
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,869
Enjoy.

461
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:49,380
So you didn't take your medicine? Really?

462
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,910
Three pills.

463
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:53,950
I only took 3 out of 7 pills, So Jin.

464
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,420
And that's because of that priest?

465
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:02,789
When I'm with him, I strangely feel...

466
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:04,829
relaxed.

467
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,328
Isn't this such a miracle?

468
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,200
You were always under your desk or in the research lab.

469
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,200
And you're doing volunteer work.

470
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,140
So? What kind of person is that priest?

471
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,749
When he was young, his father passed away.

472
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,649
His mother passed away in a fire.

473
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,880
So he grew up in an orphanage...

474
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,500
His mother liked growing flowers in a greenhouse.

475
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,299
He must take after his mother.

476
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,900
When I go near him, I can smell flowers.

477
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,549
Yeon Woo. I think you'll understand me.

478
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,220
I want to live my life with the woman I love.

479
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,170
They're grass trees.

480
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,539
They don't have flowers right now, right?

481
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,339
That plant only blooms when there's a fire.

482
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,750
Isn't that fascinating?

483
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,660
(Sim Yeon Woo)

484
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,299
Mom.

485
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:13,019
- Welcome. - Hello.

486
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,989
One Americano, please.

487
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,930
- Okay. - Thank you.

488
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,209
Do people run into each other even if they don't want to...

489
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,750
if their routines match?

490
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:43,819
No.

491
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,119
Sung Mi and I are destined to be together.

492
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,028
One more Americano, please.

493
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,029
Okay.

494
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Sung Mi...

495
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,230
Darn it.

496
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,200
Why did he scan me head to toe?

497
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:35,709
Darn it.

498
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,739
Get home safely.

499
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,809
- Thank you. - Thank you.

500
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,740
(OBGYN Sim Yeon Woo)

501
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:51,189
What should we have for lunch?

502
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,190
A new eel restaurant opened across the street.

503
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,288
I'm sorry. I have plans today.

504
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,199
With who? If I know them, let's go together.

505
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,000
But you...

506
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,268
really like eating alone.

507
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:06,900
- Wait a second. - What?

508
00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:09,368
You disappeared from the center without a word yesterday.

509
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,440
You can't fool me.

510
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,809
You two met up, didn't you?

511
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,308
We did meet up.

512
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,779
What did you do together?

513
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,049
We sang songs.

514
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,950
- What? - We sang songs.

515
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,048
You... You sang songs?

516
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,489
Yes. I'm pretty good at singing. I can rap a bit too.

517
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,929
I can even dance a bit.

518
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,298
Like stars there are countless people

519
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:35,430
Among them I met you

520
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,470
Thank you.

521
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,880
Should I bring you some flowers to wrap with those?

522
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,690
No. These flowers will kill all of the other flowers.

523
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,258
What kind of woman did you pick this time?

524
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:01,759
I didn't pick her.

525
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,230
She picked me.

526
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,999
Gosh, you scared me.

527
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,009
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,069
- Gosh. - Gosh.

529
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,940
Your immune system must be weak because you don't date.

530
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm allergic to pollen.

531
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:27,619
Something in here...

532
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,289
caused an allergic reaction?

533
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,088
Goodness.

534
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,490
What's wrong with me?

535
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,259
Yook Jin Hee upset you a lot yesterday, didn't she?

536
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,230
I get it. Whenever something like that happens,

537
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,869
I can't sleep for three days.

538
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:46,939
Normally,

539
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,309
I would've been upset for a whole month.

540
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,038
But yesterday, someone appeared and made me feel better.

541
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,039
Who?

542
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,720
A healer that prevents me from thinking...

543
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,480
sad thoughts?

544
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,779
A healer?

545
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,690
It's a man.

546
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,358
I'll head out early today.

547
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,858
I have a special lecture for my school today.

548
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:14,729
- Okay. You should get ready. - Okay.

549
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,730
Wait.

550
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,700
I have something I want to eat around my school.

551
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,269
I'm going to eat after the special lecture is done.

552
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,809
Did you... Oh, my.

553
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,650
Sim Yeon Woo. What are you doing here?

554
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,180
Go ahead without me.

555
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,518
I didn't have any appointments with outpatients this afternoon.

556
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,588
Gosh. The meaning of sunflowers.

557
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:41,019
Longing. Worship. Admiration.

558
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:42,259
They must be for me.

559
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:43,259
No.

560
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,829
- Boo! - Oh, my goodness!

561
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:27,369
Why? Were you thinking of how you always cried there?

562
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:30,339
You used to always skip class. How did you become a teacher?

563
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,908
What? Look who's talking.

564
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,879
You always used to skip club meetings.

565
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,449
How did you become a researcher?

566
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,820
Will the students who come to your lecture know?

567
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,919
- Know what? - How you...

568
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,388
were rejected by an upperclassman you liked so much...

569
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,059
and how you cried for all three years of school?

570
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,829
Hey. That was so long ago.

571
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,859
By the way, is the club room still there?

572
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,529
Why? Did you still miss that upperclassman?

573
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,198
- Hey... - Do you want...

574
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,238
a trip down memory lane?

575
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:00,639
It's not like that.

576
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,980
Hello. Nice to meet you.

577
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,949
I'm Han So Jin, a graduate of the 52nd class.

578
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,920
Why did you become a genetics researcher?

579
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,230
DNA...

580
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:27,159
is a navigation system that helps you find important people.

581
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,610
My father was a genetics researcher at the National Forensic Service.

582
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,749
He tested the DNA of unidentified people...

583
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,650
and helped many of them find their families.

584
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,249
Without their DNA,

585
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,360
they wouldn't have been able to get back to their loved ones.

586
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,689
That's why I wanted to do that work too.

587
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,000
Helping people find those important to them.

588
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:02,030
And finding them myself.

589
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:16,579
The DNA in our bodies...

590
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,349
is long enough to make 1,000 round trips to the sun.

591
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,558
Gyeongjong had a benevolent nature since he was young.

592
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:26,819
When it came to politics and power,

593
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,488
he was known as the king of...

594
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,058
Recently, the research...

595
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:34,730
about Junk DNA, called Intron, is getting very active.

596
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,969
Do twins with the same DNA sequences...

597
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,269
live the same lives?

598
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:45,069
The two of us can communicate telepathically.

599
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,138
One time, my leg suddenly started hurting badly,

600
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,280
and at the same time, my sister hurt her leg in a car accident.

601
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,379
We occasionally observe cases like that...

602
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,719
with twins who have the same DNA.

603
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,359
Even if they're in a different place from you,

604
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,230
someone can feel the same thing as you at the same time.

605
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,359
I'm researching...

606
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,299
whether that's possible with people who aren't twins.

607
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,669
I call the person who you can do that communication with...

608
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,000
your genetic partner.

609
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,738
So people who don't have a twin may still have someone...

610
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:21,609
who they can communicate with as if they were twins?

611
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,280
That's right. If their brainwaves or frequencies get stronger,

612
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,579
and, like this,

613
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,150
their signals interfere with each other,

614
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,689
their five senses,

615
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,159
feelings, and thoughts can get mixed up.

616
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,289
Like telepathy.

617
00:37:38,429 --> 00:37:42,400
Ms. Han. Could it be the same with guys we like?

618
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,968
What are you talking about? Don't be ridiculous.

619
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:45,969
You're so silly.

620
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,239
I'm not sure.

621
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:51,170
Listen closely to your DNA, the prophet from the future.

622
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,280
If so, your perfect match...

623
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,949
will come through that door.

624
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,500
I heard from BK when I stopped by the center.

625
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,170
Here. I saw that you didn't have any flowers in your lab.

626
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,509
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my.

627
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,379
I have a pollen allergy. I'm sorry.

628
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,479
I'll wipe it for you. Oh, no.

629
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,119
- Oh, no. - It's okay.

630
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,618
It reminds me of when we first met.

631
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,590
So dynamic. I like it.

632
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,289
But seeing as how you reacted as soon as you saw the flowers,

633
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,859
your allergy must be very severe.

634
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,799
I kept having reactions from earlier in the day.

635
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,158
There weren't even flowers around earlier.

636
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,769
I was the one in the flower shop, but you had the reactions.

637
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:55,739
Telepathy?

638
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,038
Telepathy?

639
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,840
You haven't had lunch, right? Let's eat together.

640
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,010
Wait.

641
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,949
Could I stop by my secret place first?

642
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,630
- A gift. - Oh, my. He's so cool.

643
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,230
This is it.

644
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:24,630
This used to be our club room.

645
00:39:25,469 --> 00:39:28,699
Gosh. I spent so much time during evening study hall.

646
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,239
- Really? - It hasn't changed at all.

647
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:32,809
Oh, a mouse!

648
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,309
It's just a model.

649
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,518
Long time no see.

650
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,018
Why is that here? Goodness.

651
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,089
Come here.

652
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,719
Gosh.

653
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,059
- Ta-da. - Oh, my.

654
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,929
This is the spot in the school where stars are most visible.

655
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,659
Okay.

656
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:59,599
Occasionally, my favorite star shows up in the sky over there.

657
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,639
I found out later that the star's name was Io.

658
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,808
Io is a satellite that orbits Jupiter.

659
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:09,678
It's closest to Jupiter,

660
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,480
so they called it the Star of Hell.

661
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:15,118
- The Star of Hell? - Yes.

662
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,888
Because Jupiter is full of storms,

663
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:19,489
the tidal forced made Io a mass of magma.

664
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,689
It shoots out lava from one side,

665
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:25,089
and the other side is minus 148 degrees.

666
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,799
So it's either a mass of fire or a mass of ice.

667
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,769
The two being stuck together made it hell?

668
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,469
That's right.

669
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,138
But if I were Io,

670
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:43,010
I wouldn't want to separate from Jupiter.

671
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,980
If it does, Io would be alone in endless space.

672
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,590
I would've done the same.

673
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,289
Because Jupiter would've wanted it.

674
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,199
Oh, my goodness! This is where that was.

675
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,699
Oh, my goodness!

676
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:09,309
Hold on. I'll get it for you.

677
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,119
- This is my time capsule. - I see.

678
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,768
I was dating an upperclassman.

679
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:43,639
These are movie tickets I bought to go with him.

680
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,340
But because he was cheating on me,

681
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,879
he had already watched it with some other girl.

682
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,849
How many times have you been rejected?

683
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:53,250
But they always confess to me first.

684
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,449
That MP3 player.

685
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,690
What songs are in here?

686
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,459
I put one song on here to listen to it...

687
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,300
with my destined partner.

688
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,829
This is my theme song.

689
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,170
Your theme song?

690
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,440
That's pretty cool.

691
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,340
So have you ever listened to it with a guy?

692
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,610
I haven't yet.

693
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,409
Oh, really?

694
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,050
Then do you want to listen to it together?

695
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,948
Oh, it's out of battery.

696
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:34,090
If it's not broken, should we charge it and listen together?

697
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,059
Well...

698
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,630
Gosh. I'm hungry. Let's go to eat.

699
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:45,230
What... What should we eat?

700
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:48,969
Well, I did think of something.

701
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:52,439
I do have something I'm craving as well.

702
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,840
Should we say it at the same time?

703
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,039
Should we?

704
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,848
One, two...

705
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:57,849
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

706
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:00,519
Oh, my goodness.

707
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:01,719
Telepathy.

708
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,849
Let's go. I know a delicious mandu soup place.

709
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:08,589
I wanted to eat eel,

710
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,590
but the minimum order is two servings.

711
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,329
This is all because of Sim Yeon Woo.

712
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,360
He left me alone again because of some woman.

713
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,269
That arrogant punk.

714
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:23,369
Jung Tam.

715
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:25,610
- Jung Tam. - What?

716
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,179
I guess you're all here for lunch.

717
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,549
Yes.

718
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:32,178
We went to the fire department's award ceremony today.

719
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,449
- We're stopping by on the way back. - I see.

720
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,320
How about Yeon Woo? Why are you eating alone?

721
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:38,320
This is how that punk is.

722
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,719
He left me...

723
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,130
and went to Ms. Han.

724
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,658
So Jin?

725
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:46,730
Yes.

726
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,179
Is that a goddess?

727
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,849
Pardon?

728
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,288
Oh, I misspoke...

729
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:15,820
I meant to say that this was delicious.

730
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,658
I see. The sea bream and scallops here are very delicious.

731
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,729
Yes.

732
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,299
Well, then. Enjoy your meal.

733
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,829
Yes. Enjoy your meal.

734
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,468
Enjoy your meal.

735
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:26,639
Right. You too.

736
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,339
- Good work. - You too.

737
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,479
We ordered this and this.

738
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,579
Good job. Let's get this and this too.

739
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:41,280
(Mandu, donuts)

740
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,360
Okay. Bon appetit.

741
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,489
Wait!

742
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,569
I'm done. It has just been so long.

743
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,639
- Can I eat now? - Enjoy.

744
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:08,979
Eating the mandu soup here makes me so happy.

745
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,679
Gosh. The mandu is so hefty.

746
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,380
It's so good-looking.

747
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,460
This is good.

748
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,658
By the way, why were you there...

749
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,729
when I was being chased that day?

750
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:31,868
It was a secluded place.

751
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:32,900
Right.

752
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:34,469
Well,

753
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,968
I went to Kang Hoon's for a drink,

754
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,209
and there was no place to park,

755
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,639
so I ended up going all the way there.

756
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,889
Did you have...

757
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,159
some sort of hunch that day?

758
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:56,130
Did you hear something or flash by your eyes?

759
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:58,090
I'm not sure.

760
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,800
Well, I heard a car honking.

761
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:05,000
It was the same as usual.

762
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:10,138
What about feeling anxious for no reason or your heart racing?

763
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:11,340
I'm not sure.

764
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,320
I think I was more uncomfortable than anxious.

765
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,420
Then those flowers!

766
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:24,288
Where did you get those flowers?

767
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:25,289
The flowers?

768
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:27,359
Oh, the sunflowers?

769
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,489
Oh, those? There's a flower shop...

770
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:32,899
that a good friend of mine runs near our center.

771
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,759
So, I got some fresh ones from there.

772
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,429
Were you perhaps there around 12 o'clock?

773
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,238
At the flower shop?

774
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,940
I'm not sure. I may have. Why?

775
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,940
That was when Yeon Woo was at the flower shop?

776
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,379
When you saved me while I was being chased,

777
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,078
it might not have been a coincidence.

778
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,388
And today, I started having reactions...

779
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,018
from the time you were at the flower shop.

780
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:01,218
It was as if I was at that flower shop.

781
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:02,658
There weren't any flowers near me at the time.

782
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:04,130
Come on! That's...

783
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,598
It could be that you have...

784
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,129
some other rare allergy instead of a pollen allergy.

785
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,999
And when I saved you,

786
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,369
it wasn't telepathy.

787
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,309
It was just...

788
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,339
a matter of coincidence...

789
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,010
that was close to an inevitability. That's what I think.

790
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,509
Don't you think there's some hidden providence...

791
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,550
inside that coincidence?

792
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:34,159
Fine.

793
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,559
Then, shall we do some research...

794
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:39,599
on coincidence now?

795
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,570
Okay.

796
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,309
Eat up.

797
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,769
Thank you.

798
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,908
("Will We Be a Good Fit?")

799
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:55,280
(Author Jang Mi Eun Book Release Signing Event)

800
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,550
- Hello. - Hello.

801
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,659
- Thank you. - Thank you.

802
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,059
- Hello. - Hello.

803
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:13,860
- These flowers are for you. - Yes, thank you.

804
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:16,800
I really enjoyed your book.

805
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,768
How do you write so well?

806
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:23,239
And you even look so smart too.

807
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,280
- I get that compliment a lot. - Yes.

808
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,549
- Next? - Oh, I was thinking...

809
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,079
of doing that poly thing or whatever.

810
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,578
What do you think?

811
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,618
Don't you think it'd be nice to have a big fan of yours like me...

812
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,590
as a partner?

813
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,090
Next?

814
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,960
You should still answer me.

815
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,099
You must not have read my book properly.

816
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:52,530
Just because I date several people doesn't mean I date just anyone.

817
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:54,769
"Anyone..."

818
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:58,170
But I'm not just anyone...

819
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,980
Won't you regret it?

820
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,420
Regret? As if.

821
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,250
I don't date horny losers who only have one thing in mind.

822
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,219
What? "Horny loser..."

823
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,629
My gosh! You're crossing the line!

824
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,499
Do you think you're so great? What? "Horny?" Let go...

825
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,368
- Let go! "Horny loser?" - Next.

826
00:49:23,369 --> 00:49:25,669
Hey! I can't believe that...

827
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,198
Hey, let go of me!

828
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,199
Next person.

829
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,509
You've waited for a while, right?

830
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:34,678
Are you okay?

831
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,739
I'm fine.

832
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,750
I'm such a big fan.

833
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:39,849
Thank you.

834
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:53,760
That's telepathy?

835
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,368
It hasn't been long since we first met,

836
00:49:59,369 --> 00:50:02,739
but I've never had that kind of connection with other men.

837
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:07,209
Having a connection is something you say after you learn about...

838
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,808
whether conversations with him are good, what kind of person he is,

839
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:12,308
what his parents are like, and everything there is to know,

840
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,218
you immature girl.

841
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:18,189
How would you know about what kind of sly snake lies within...

842
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,260
a man's heart when you're not even 30 years old yet?

843
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,460
Seeing how stubborn you're acting, you've fallen for him again.

844
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,869
That man is Yeon Woo, right?

845
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,440
Listen carefully.

846
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,610
I know you and Yeon Woo both very well.

847
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,709
The one person who could never be your match is Yeon Woo.

848
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,609
Yeon Woo is a guy who could never give you what you want!

849
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,780
Got it?

850
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,599
What's wrong with him? They're close friends.

851
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,598
I bet he feels that way when someone he just rescued...

852
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,939
tries so hard to die again.

853
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,469
What are you saying?

854
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,539
Let's go if you're done.

855
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,408
Oh, gosh.

856
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,949
Gosh, sorry about that.

857
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,218
Kang Hoon got this at a commendation ceremony today.

858
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,489
I was going to take it home, but I forgot.

859
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:29,989
Sorry.

860
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,199
Did you say that was today?

861
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,170
Telepathy?

862
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,840
Telepathy, as if. That makes no sense.

863
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,710
Gosh, seriously...

864
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,139
Why does it itch so much?

865
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,420
What are you doing here?

866
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,659
Oh, I was just...

867
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
Oh, right.

868
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,199
Here's a present.

869
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,900
It'll be nice and warm. It just came off the press today.

870
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,439
Did you really write all of this?

871
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,109
Of course. Take your time to read it.

872
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:23,210
By the way, did you get a call from the police?

873
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,980
There was a guy who was lurking outside your place.

874
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,320
Oh, that?

875
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,949
I've had a few perverts trying to break in and running away.

876
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:32,618
Are you not bothered by that?

877
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:35,289
I don't go to my writing studio every day, so it's fine.

878
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:39,058
What about today? Didn't anything happen?

879
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:40,059
Today?

880
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,828
Do you think you're so great? What? "Horny?" Let go...

881
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,029
- Let go! "Horny loser?" - Next.

882
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,098
Hey, let go of me!

883
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,099
Right.

884
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,069
- Today... - Give me your number.

885
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,809
If that guy was targeting you, he might come back.

886
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:56,909
What an odd way of asking for my number.

887
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,420
Here.

888
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:07,319
What about Yeon Woo? Isn't he worried?

889
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,459
We're not in that kind of relationship.

890
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,829
Then what kind of relationship is it?

891
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,900
Yeon Woo is...

892
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,130
my Friday guy?

893
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:20,070
What? Your Friday guy?

894
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,769
I have different guys I meet on different days of the week.

895
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:27,710
Oh, different days of the week?

896
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:35,119
I'm sorry. I don't think I'd read the dating column that you wrote.

897
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,690
Mr. Seo,

898
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,960
do you think that monogamous dating is the only normal relationship?

899
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,328
I don't understand people...

900
00:53:45,329 --> 00:53:47,659
who meet and break up with others easily...

901
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,158
like you or Yeon Woo.

902
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,169
Meet and date people who are like you as well.

903
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,130
Don't hurt other innocent people.

904
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:06,250
(Always Sushi)

905
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:09,820
Everyone is unkind today.

906
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,928
("Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle")

907
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:19,090
("Psychology of the Unconscious")

908
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,599
Listen carefully.

909
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,340
I know you and Yeon Woo both very well.

910
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,439
The one person who could never be your match is Yeon Woo.

911
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,339
Yeon Woo is a guy who could never give you what you want!

912
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,539
Got it?

913
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:40,019
Kang Hoon... He usually talks after thinking about it 100 times.

914
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,519
And when I saved you, it wasn't telepathy.

915
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,219
It was just...

916
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,218
a matter of coincidence...

917
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,929
that was close to an inevitability. That's what I think.

918
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,138
Coincidence?

919
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,538
One, two...

920
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:02,670
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

921
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,070
No way.

922
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,809
Or telepathy?

923
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,980
(Telepathy)

924
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:14,719
Hey.

925
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:21,090
What are you doing, just sitting there with food in front of you?

926
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:22,460
That's bad.

927
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,829
- Sung Mi. - Yes?

928
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,960
- This is about a friend. - Okay.

929
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:32,530
A girl that my friend knows seems to have fallen for a dangerous guy.

930
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,099
What should my friend do?

931
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:37,009
A dangerous guy? Is he a criminal?

932
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:40,639
Well, it's not like that. But he hurts women a lot.

933
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,379
When he likes a girl, he makes her totally fall in love with him,

934
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,809
but when he has a change of heart? He just kicks her to the curb.

935
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,119
Hey, the woman is a fool for falling for him.

936
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,649
But apparently, they can't help but fall for him.

937
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,690
He's handsome, well-mannered, and a doctor...

938
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,219
And he's humorous too.

939
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,759
The girls around me seem like they can't fall out of love...

940
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,328
once they fall for a guy, even if they know he's a bad guy.

941
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:05,730
And there are always girls who fall for bad guys.

942
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,840
What can be done, then?

943
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,239
I mean, my friend.

944
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:19,110
Oh, you're here.

945
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,179
- Come in. - Hello.

946
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,719
Gosh, thank you.

947
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,658
Here is the DNA test report for Ms. Ko Sung Yoo.

948
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:32,260
Thankfully, the fetus has normal genes.

949
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,899
Although, you will have to keep track of...

950
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,130
fetal hypoglycemia or polycythemia.

951
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:39,530
That's good.

952
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,999
This patient has had diabetes since childhood,

953
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,010
so we were keeping a closer eye on her pregnancy.

954
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,980
And we'll have to continue tracking her hormone balance after birth.

955
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,279
Would you like a cup of tea?

956
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,879
Sure, I'd appreciate that.

957
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,408
One moment.

958
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,409
Okay.

959
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:55,579
("Telepathy Is Not Science Fiction")

960
00:56:57,389 --> 00:56:59,949
("Telepathy Is Not Science Fiction")

961
00:57:00,289 --> 00:57:01,558
"Telepathy?"

962
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:04,659
Ms. Han, is telepathy really possible?

963
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:06,090
Oh, that?

964
00:57:07,099 --> 00:57:11,070
I believe there's some hidden providence inside coincidence.

965
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,400
And couldn't there be a gene that affects that providence?

966
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,768
I'm researching it.

967
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:18,769
If it's a coincidence...

968
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:21,038
You mean like when you go somewhere without much thought,

969
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,238
but you meet by coincidence?

970
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,239
No.

971
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,579
That's just plain coincidence.

972
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,780
Not like that.

973
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:30,519
"I want to meet you. I want to meet you so badly."

974
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,550
You send a signal.

975
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,260
Whether that's consciously or subconsciously.

976
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,659
But I'm only researching it too.

977
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,809
- Here you go. - Thank you.

978
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:54,940
Oh, right.

979
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:58,010
I heard you went to karaoke with Yeon Woo.

980
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,550
Yeon Woo said he sang with you. But that's a lie, isn't it?

981
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,719
Ever since he was totally humiliated at our college retreat,

982
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:09,658
Yeon Woo never sings in front of other people.

983
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,530
What? I doubt that.

984
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:15,098
- He never put down the mic. - What?

985
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,130
So I couldn't sing that many songs.

986
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:20,440
Did he put on a consolation show or what?

987
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:22,500
"A consolation show?"

988
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:25,569
- Let's go! - Ddan-ddan-ddan-dda-da

989
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,638
Dda-dda-ran-ddan

990
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,980
Ddan-ddan-ddan-dda-da

991
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,449
Well, his dance moves did console me a bit.

992
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,419
- Dance? - Yes.

993
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,888
You mean when his head and body move in different directions?

994
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,159
- Yes, that. - He must be crazy.

995
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,670
By the way,

996
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:53,170
that's practically like you guys are dating.

997
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:57,110
Dating...

998
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:58,639
What?

999
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:01,879
No, we're not dating.

1000
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,510
If that's not it, what's going on between you two?

1001
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:07,718
Oh, well, so...

1002
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:08,949
I'd say...

1003
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,889
we're research partners?

1004
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,260
Yes, Mother.

1005
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:16,489
Hey, Yeon Woo.

1006
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,459
Your auntie came back from the US today and is coming over.

1007
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,299
We're having dinner together. Will you come to Seongbuk-dong?

1008
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,630
Oh, is Auntie in Seoul?

1009
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,400
Has it been ten years?

1010
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,170
Yes, sure. I'll be there later.

1011
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,409
Min Ho!

1012
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,948
- Oh, are you okay? - Oh, my. I'm sorry.

1013
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,408
- Sorry. - You should be careful.

1014
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,449
- No, it's fine. - Sorry.

1015
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,429
I sneezed again.

1016
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:57,300
Just like that time.

1017
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:00,739
- These must be for me. - No.

1018
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:10,139
I can just do an experiment to see if it's telepathy or coincidence.

1019
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:14,679
(Iroun Center Han So Jin)

1020
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:18,650
Hey, there.

1021
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,119
Let's have dinner tonight.

1022
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:22,919
Sorry, but I have plans tonight...

1023
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,630
I have something to say to you.

1024
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,230
Do you want to...

1025
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,659
meet me by coincidence and have dinner?

1026
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,199
By coincidence?

1027
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,739
The Han River or Mount Nam.

1028
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:39,570
We'll each choose one right now and go there.

1029
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,279
But on our way,

1030
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,579
we'll send each other the place we're going to via telepathy.

1031
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,019
And we'll meet there by coincidence.

1032
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,750
Why must I do that?

1033
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:52,090
I want to check.

1034
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,590
What?

1035
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,389
Whether our telepathy really works.

1036
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,760
Whether DNA lovers can really communicate via telepathy.

1037
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,139
This woman talks about DNA in crucial moments.

1038
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:11,010
This unpredictable fanatic.

1039
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,070
Okay, let's do this experiment.

1040
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:16,840
Well, I was the one who consented to the experiment.

1041
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,409
What should I do?

1042
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,579
Then, let's narrow down the area.

1043
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,078
At exactly 8pm, we'll either meet at the tower of Mount Nam...

1044
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,649
or at the bench looking out at Jamsu Bridge...

1045
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,989
at Banpo Hangang Park. How does that sound?

1046
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,090
Okay.

1047
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:49,139
Where would she have gone?

1048
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,308
- The Han River? - Here it comes.

1049
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,709
- Mount Nam? - Here it comes.

1050
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,780
The Han River?

1051
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:56,820
Mount Nam?

1052
01:01:58,119 --> 01:01:59,189
- Oh, I'm getting a headache. - Here it comes.

1053
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,190
This is confusing.

1054
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:01,519
Here it comes.

1055
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:05,260
We'll arrive at the same spot by communicating telepathically.

1056
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,630
Is it the Han River or Mount Nam?

1057
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:29,679
I have...

1058
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,690
an oddly bad feeling about this.

1059
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,780
Yes?

1060
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:03,679
Oh, I'm sorry.

1061
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:05,250
- Let's go. - Sorry.

1062
01:03:07,019 --> 01:03:08,059
Come on.

1063
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,909
Yeon Woo.

1064
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,440
Han So Jin!

1065
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,698
I'm doing research on whether it's possible...

1066
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,598
- Who are you? - to communicate with others...

1067
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:52,069
- Oh, right. - even if we're not twins.

1068
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:55,769
I wanted to listen to Ms. Han So Jin's lecture too.

1069
01:03:57,969 --> 01:03:59,639
Are you So Jin's boyfriend or something?

1070
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:03,110
A boyfriend? Well, I'm not her boyfriend,

1071
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:06,679
but I am a righteous person who helps her with her research.

1072
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,879
If you're helping her with her research, you should be in the lab.

1073
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,690
Why would you come all the way here with flowers?

1074
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:16,019
But as her friend, you get a pass on first impressions.

1075
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,460
Well...

1076
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:21,360
Oh, then, were you and So Jin friends since high school?

1077
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,530
Yes.

1078
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:27,269
Then, perhaps,

1079
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:30,839
do you remember which food So Jin liked...

1080
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,809
when she was in school?

1081
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,339
One, two...

1082
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:36,510
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

1083
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:39,150
No way.

1084
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,349
Telepathy.

1085
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,289
Let's go. I know a really great mandu soup place.

1086
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:30,829
(DNA Lover)

1087
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Crossed lines.

1088
01:05:32,001 --> 01:05:34,038
With a coincidental connection with someone,

1089
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:35,669
there were mixed signals.

1090
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,768
The fireman?

1091
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:38,309
So Jin!

1092
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,440
Kang Hoon.

1093
01:05:39,441 --> 01:05:40,509
I just came here...

1094
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,510
to see the stars.

1095
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:42,979
Open wide.

1096
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,079
Why are you doing all this?

1097
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:47,578
So Jin will meet a good guy.

1098
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:49,880
I will never let you date you.

1099
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,090
How could I meet you here?

1100
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,260
Well, we've always been like that.

1101
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:56,760
I don't play around with someone's sincerity.

1102
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,429
Let's do a proper experiment one last time.
