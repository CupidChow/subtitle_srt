A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

10
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,858
Welcome!

11
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,429
Welcome to becoming Han So Jin's experiment!

12
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:03,739
My puzzles...

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,400
Welcome!

14
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,120
Darn it.

15
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,620
- BK. - You didn't have to.

16
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,919
Say hello, Ms. Han. This is Dr. Sim Yeon Woo.

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,590
That Sim Yeon Woo was the Sim Yeon Woo?

18
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,229
A Ri, speak softer.

19
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,598
And this is Ms. Han So Jin on our genetics research team.

20
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,670
I see.

21
00:01:38,269 --> 00:01:39,298
So Jin...

22
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,709
She majored in molecular biology.

23
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,639
She has gotten into pseudoscience and is still writing her thesis,

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,909
- but... - Good to see you.

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,310
We've met, right?

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,348
I think I'm meeting you for the first time.

27
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,450
You must not remember people's faces very well.

28
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,620
What's this? Did he recognize me?

29
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,889
But how could you not remember a face like his?

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,319
I know, right?

31
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,030
You didn't have to bring me anything.

32
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,299
So Jin, did you spray the Super Teol on his sideburn?

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,869
What's up with your sideburn?

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,500
A half retro concept is in right now.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,438
Super Teol was designed just for Oh Sang Min. His hair wouldn't grow.

36
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,468
I'm sure it isn't.

37
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,009
But it's coming in right now.

38
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,250
Indeed, Sim Yeon Woo.

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,419
By the way, your face and name seem very familiar, Ms. Han So Jin.

40
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,848
What? Pardon? Oh, yes. My name?

41
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,689
Where did I see and hear it?

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,888
My name is so common, actually.

43
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:35,729
And my face is really common too.

44
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,300
So, this is how it's going to be?

45
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,628
- By the way, Yeon Woo, - Yes?

46
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,300
I think my meeting will run long.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,168
- Ms. Han. - Yes?

48
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,240
We have all of the prenatal results for Sim Hospital's moms, right?

49
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,969
Of course.

50
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:50,509
- Please come this way. - Sure.

51
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:53,610
Oh, my goodness!

52
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,609
- Come this way. - Yes.

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,650
Take good care of him.

54
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,888
Right, he would never imagine that crazy woman was me.

55
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,300
I will wait until you fess up.

56
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,269
So, I have a question.

57
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,500
Yes, I've been waiting.

58
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,579
About the hair growth on your face,

59
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,240
is it hereditary?

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,580
It didn't happen all of a sudden or anything, did it?

61
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,520
Oh, well...

62
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,888
I have lots of questions when I see unusual hair growth.

63
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,319
That sounds very mysterious to me.

64
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,959
- "Unusual?" - Pardon?

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,628
Our center represents medicine, culture, and life.

66
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:46,930
It is a medical-cultural complex.

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,628
- When an individual is curious... - Excuse me.

68
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,369
- about their DNA, - Pardon me.

69
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,609
- they can come here... - Sorry.

70
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,769
- Gosh. - Out of the way.

71
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,139
- It is a very important thing to... - Gosh.

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,550
My goodness.

73
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:02,849
What was that?

74
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,219
There's a baldness treatment presentation today.

75
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,949
We're developing a DNA-tailored hair growth essence now.

76
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,689
It's called Super Teol.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,818
"Super Teol"?

78
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,628
Super... T-E-O...

79
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,629
(So Jin loves Sang Min, Super Teol)

80
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,398
Super T-E-O-L?

81
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,230
Become hairy!

82
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,569
We're developing a DNA-tailored hair growth essence now.

83
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,199
It's called Super Teol.

84
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,970
"Super Teol"?

85
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,310
"Super Teol"?

86
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,208
Ms. Han So Jin.

87
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,139
Ms. Han.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,979
I think I may have seen that on the market by chance.

89
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,649
I doubt it. Super Teol is only in the clinical trial phase.

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,149
"Clinical trial phase"?

91
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,319
How were those clinical trial results?

92
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,729
We did animal testing, and it was incredible.

93
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,028
A mouse with severe hair loss,

94
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,930
became as furry as a rabbit in seven hours.

95
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,970
A mouse became a rabbit?

96
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,599
It's incredible, right? And it gets absorbed so quickly.

97
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,398
The moment you apply the treatment to the skin,

98
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,369
it seeps right in to the dermal layer.

99
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,610
Very deeply.

100
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,980
I'm so excited to see how it'll affect the human body.

101
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,610
For humans, it'll depend on the person's DNA and hormone levels.

102
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,018
However, if it's a hair loss treatment tailored to one's DNA,

103
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,619
it could cover the whole body with hair from the head, eyebrows,

104
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,689
facial hair, nose hair, stomach, armpits, and everywhere else.

105
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,430
The secrets of DNA exceed our imaginations.

106
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,198
- Oh, my. - Well...

107
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,629
Yes, well, that's...

108
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,439
There are lasers, waxing, and permanent hair removal.

109
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,240
We live in a time where that's possible anytime.

110
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,680
Hair removal?

111
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,310
Why? Your sideburns look cool.

112
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,250
Cool?

113
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,480
No, so I mean that your hair growth...

114
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,919
doesn't look bad, so I don't think you have to worry.

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,119
It doesn't look bad?

116
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,559
Of course, as long as it doesn't spread.

117
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
It could even spread?

118
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:55,588
Oh, we're here.

119
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,759
This is the lab. Come this way.

120
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,529

122
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,268
Should I tell him the truth now? Or should I not?

123
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,740
What do I do?

124
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,939
Should I mention Super Teol now?

125

But what if she acts innocent?

126
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,250
Let's wait until I find concrete evidence.

127
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,719
Right, let's discuss work first.

Among the pregnant women who underwent prenatal testing,

132
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,230
these were in the high risk group.

133
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,969
From Ms. Yoo Young A's amniotic fluid test,

134
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,139
there's a mutation on the 18th chromosome.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,209
Normally, there should be two,

What will Ms. Yoo Young A choose?

141
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,920
The choice is up to the mother, but we'll have to suggest surgery.

142
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,159
- What? - Even before its birth,

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,929
there's a high chance that this baby will die in the womb.

144
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,930
Even if it is born, there is only a five percent chance...

145
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,198
it will live until its first birthday.

146
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,169
Even if it does survive, there will be visible deformities,

147

and its heart, lungs, digestive system, and kidney...

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
won't properly function. Must we discuss this further?

149
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,240
There was another case like this before.

150
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,420
A child was born with anencephaly and lived only a day.

151

However, that child...

152
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,388
was baptized in her mother's arms...

153
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,819
and had a birthday party in the one day of her life.

154
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,528
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

155
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,529
Happy birthday.

156
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,360
Happy birthday!

157
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,430
Let's make a wish.

158
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:41,670
Later, the parents said this.

159
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,569
They may have said goodbye to their child,

160
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,410
but they didn't regret their choice to have their baby.

161
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,009
The issue isn't the condition of the fetus, but Ms. Yoo.

162
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,709
She has pulmonary hypertension.

163
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,220
In the end, the mother and child will say goodbye in either way.

164

I am an OBGYN.

165
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,420
Thinking of the mother's health first and foremost...

166
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,259
is my responsibility.

167
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,029
A mother and child...

168
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,539
start interacting with one another from the first moment...

169
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,569
she becomes aware of her pregnancy.

170
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,920
To some people,

171
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,590
that one moment where they can meet...

172
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,659
could be the most precious thing in the world.

173
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,460
If they could postpone their parting by at least another day,

174
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,559
they might be able to handle any sacrifice.

175
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,759
There are some meetings like that.

176
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,299
Have you ever thought about how desperate...

177
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,499
that meeting might feel?

178
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,110
That's when you say farewell.

179
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,740
When you feel sorry and sad.

180
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,539
Not when you're sick and tired and cursing someone out.

181
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,649
Right.

182
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,860
About your shoe.

183
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,928
You must part with the familiar to meet someone new.

184
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,799
Get rid of the other shoe. The sole was all worn out.

185
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,370
My shoe?

186
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,339
- No, wait! - Again?

187
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,509
- No, I... - You can't!

188
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:33,909
Ms. Han So Jin.

189
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,119
Why are you giving me...

190
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,360
You're in charge of prenatal tests for my hospital.

191
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,230
Of course, I should have your phone number.

192
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,100
Would that be really necessary?

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,759
You can contact me through BK...

194
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,769
Okay.

195
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:05,909
Good.

196
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,879
That's...

197
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,919
A rabbit?

198
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,299
For humans, it'll depend on the person's DNA and hormone levels.

199
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,929
However, if it's a hair loss treatment tailored to one's DNA,

200
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,969
it could cover the whole body with hair from the head, eyebrows,

201
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,168
facial hair, nose hair, stomach, armpits, and everywhere else.

202
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,240
Is that...

203
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,850
Darn it.

204
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,490
No way.

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
I doubt it.

206
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,730
He probably doesn't remember my face, right?

(Chromosomal analysis)

208
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,240
I'm honored to be a part...

209
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,909
of Han So Jin's experiment.

210
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,209
Welcome!

211
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,649
Welcome to becoming Han So Jin's experiment!

212
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,889
It's over.

213
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,690
He knows everything.

214
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,889
Why did he act like he didn't know when he did?

215
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,360
Darn it!

216
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,299
Han So Jin, why did you do it? Why?

217
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:12,669
No.

218
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,070
All I did was...

219
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:15,940
punish a bad guy who hurt a girl.

220
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:20,809
Someone could become traumatized for life when it comes to dating.

221
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:23,250
But he can't be punished legally.

222
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,850
Right. When all considered, I am faultless.

223
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,119
Well, you could call it an interference of justice?

224
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,860
Right. This is a punishment from above!

225
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,788
Shai!

226
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,689
This is a perfume I made with the scents of my favorite things.

227
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,730
All right.

228
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,500
There we go.

229
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,029
If there's a man who smells like this, you have to bark.

230
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,539
You have to bark, okay? Let's go.

231
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,340
Instinctively, human beings try...

232
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,539
to complement their immune system...

233
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,548
through the smell of the opposite gender...

234
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,080
for the sake of their children.

235
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,149
The DNA related to the immune system can be found through smell.

236
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,460
Shai, have you finally found...

237
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,058
- Wait, Shai. - If you're strongly attracted to...

238
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,389
someone of the opposite gender,

239
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,559
that target could be...

240
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,929
your DNA lover.

241
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,299
Hey, So Jin!

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,139
Hi, Shai.

243
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,340
That's Mayo.

244
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,839
Why are you here?

245
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,378
The hair salon was busy.

246
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,009
I said I'd walk Mayo to get some exercise.

247
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,549
Shai, you little brat.

248
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,320
You didn't use to like any boy dogs.

249
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,058
Look at her now. She's totally smitten.

250
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,929
So Jin, this dog looks totally fine,

251
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,360
but he flirts with all the dogs in the neighborhood. Be careful.

252
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,870
That's not about the dog looking fine.

253
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,840
A female finds is great at finding its male partner's smell.

254
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,469
Hey, Mayo. Tell me. Are you our Shai's partner?

255
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,808
And what if he is?

256
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,908
He's not the type to love just one female for life.

257
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,679
Right, Mayo? You're not, are you?

258
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,879
Just you wait. He'll be different when he meets his match.

259
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:06,750
Goodness.

261
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,559
Shai!

262
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,730
Gosh, our Shai. You like me more than her.

263
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,529
Right? Gosh.

264
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:21,570
How pretty.

265
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,070
What are you doing?

266
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,200
Hey!

267
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,779
That's strange. You never smell like anything.

268
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
How about you? Do I smell nice to you?

269
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,710
- Smell me. - Come here.

270
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,819
You smell burnt!

271
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,979
You play with fire so much.

272
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,989
I wasn't playing with fire. I was experimenting.

273
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,889
You should only experiment in a lab.

274
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,690
But if I still smell like that,

275
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,928
you and I must not be DNA lovers.

276
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,830
Gosh, that darned DNA...

277
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,700
- I'm off. - One second.

278
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940

279

280
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:09,509
It's a safety bell.

We've installed new ones recently.

282
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,149
It worked fine from your house to our restaurant.

283
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,590
You're table number zero at our restaurant.

284
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,919
A safety bell?

285
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,789
Ta-da! I can receive the signal from this, instead of at the restaurant.

286
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,859
Want to see? The signal from table number zero?

287
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,730
Press it. in 1, 2, 3.

288
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,570
Ta-da! Table number 21... What?

289

Darn it. What on earth do you use your phone for?

290
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,840
That's because I can't answer my phone at the restaurant.

314

Why do you always appear and disappear like this?

315
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,410
Did you run away from home again?

316
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,740
This was the only place where I could log out from the world.

317

I left the center,

318
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,079
but I came here because I couldn't decide anything from...

319
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,150
whether to take the subway or the bus...

320
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,289

321

322
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,029

A Ri, I'm hungry. Should we cook something?

324
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,170
I'll decline.

325
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,608
I will regret eating anything...

326
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,279

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,440
You can have one.

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,470
By squad mates, do you mean...

363
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,839
you're a soldier?

364
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,809
Oh, I do get mistaken for one quite often.

365
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,009
I'm a firefighter.

366
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,410
- Oh, I see. - Bye, then.

367
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,400
What's wrong with me? I must be crazy.

368
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,599
How cruel.

369
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:40,369
I felt my baby move for the first time today.

370
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:44,609
But even before birth,

371
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,279
my baby was in pain, and I didn't know that.

372
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:52,150
According to an in-depth analysis,

373
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,650
you have some medical issues as well.

374
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,259
(OBGYN Sim Yeon Woo)

375
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,089
Ms. Yoo Young A, you have pulmonary hypertension.

376
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,029
What's that?

377
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,170
It's a rare and incurable disease.

378
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,640
However, with continued medication and treatment,

379
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,970
we can increase your survival rate.

380
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,710
This disease is hard to find early on.

381
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,650
Ms. Yoo, you were quite lucky.

382
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,549
Was I...

383
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,880
really lucky?

384
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:38,329
Is it perhaps...

385
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,629
my fault that Pu Reum is sick?

386
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,869
No, it has nothing to do with the genetic disease Pu Reum has.

387
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,739
However, if you continue with your pregnancy,

388
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,740
your pulmonary hypertension could get worse,

389
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,139
and you'd miss your window of opportunity for treatment,

390
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,379
leading to a critical state.

391
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,849
If that happens, both you and the baby could be in danger.

392
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,689
Also, if a mother with pulmonary hypertension gives birth,

393
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:05,819
6 out of 10...

394
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,460
will die.

395
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,059
So,

396
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,099
if I continue with my pregnancy, I could die.

397
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,369
And even if Pu Reum is born,

398
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,279
her lifespan won't be very long, right?

399
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,410
Then,

400
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,548
what do I do now?

401
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,150
Only you can decide what to do in this situation.

402
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,018
It's your life,

403
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,659
and neither I nor anyone else can live it for you.

404
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,089
However, I cannot suggest a decision in which both mom and baby...

405
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,730
will end up...

406
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,569
in danger.

407
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,279
I...

408
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:02,150
But...

409
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,450
I shouldn't find a woman's biceps pretty, right?

410
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,720
There was a woman I thought was pretty, so I followed her.

411
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:16,990
She's a firefighter.

412
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,630
I went there and did some research. That firefighter...

413
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:25,038
is entering an amateur martial arts competition.

414
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,740
As the Fire Fist of Yeoksam-dong.

415
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,969
So, will you go work out there?

416
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,109
I've never once been attracted by a woman like her.

417
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,149
She's really not my type,

418
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,279
but why did she look sexy drenched in sweat?

419
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,419
Have I become a pervert in my old age?

420
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,048
What? Just try dating her and think of it as an affair.

421
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:46,190
If you date her, you'll go back to your type.

422
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,059
So, who's your type?

423
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,289
My type?

424
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,059
Well...

425
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,440
Why won't you answer?

426
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,768
That's just my type.

427
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:02,038
If it's your type, why won't you answer? Hey.

428
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,640
Hey, Dr. Sim. Tell me how to go back to my type.

429
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,410
Everyone.

430
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:08,450
(Jang Mi Eun, Polyamorist)

431
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,548
When you look at this picture, which word do you think of?

432
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:15,419
Cheating? Gosh, how messy and promiscuous.

433
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,018
Come on. That's not true love.

434
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,390
No, these people are polyamorists.

435
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,789
If I were to explain this word in an easier way,

436
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:28,469
"poly" means multi. "Amor" means love.

437
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,099
These two word roots were combined to make this compound word.

438
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,700
Then, why did polyamory come into existence?

439
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:37,269
I think it's because...

440
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,410
the individual's joy has become important these days.

441
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,180
The pressures of a relationship... How should I put it?

442
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,879
It has become less heavy?

443
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,848
But the main point of polyamory...

444
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,250
isn't that it involves multiple people.

445
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,359
It's about non-exclusivity.

446
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:57,430
That's because love is the most beautiful and amazing...

447
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,200
when that person can be truly themselves.

448
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,768
Side note, as a polyamorist myself,

449
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm also truly in love just as anyone else.

450
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,639
Just like you.

("The Time I Cry For Myself," Yoo Myung Hee Exhibition)

452
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,259
Mom!

453
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:37,969
The coolest mom in the whole world.

454
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,369
You know I came back to Korea during my travels, right?

455
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,470
Really?

456
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,640
I smell sweaty, don't I? I'm so busy right now.

457
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,838
You still can't let anyone else do the work, can you?

458
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,549
It's mine. Of course, I can't.

459
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,980
Come here.

460
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,750
- What do you think? - Gosh.

461
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,319
It's so amazing.

462
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,359
Did you make that tear a diamond?

463
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,230
Mom, you have the best taste.

464
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,329
You can't measure its value in money. It's my ego.

465
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,670
My ego I lost after getting married and raising a child.

466
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,170
You know what?

467
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,669
That self-portrait is my face when I had facial paralysis...

468
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,380
in the middle of recovering from giving birth.

469
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,910
How could I express the tears I shed then?

470
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,190
Is that what the red thread around your body is supposed to mean?

471
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,450
Maybe a vein?

472
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,759
Oh, Mi Eun.

473
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,430
You could quit being a dating columnist...

474
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,230
and write an art column instead.

475
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,029
I'm not that good, Mom.

476
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,130
Whether it's love or art, that's how it should be, Mi Eun.

477
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,839
You have to have a distance you can enjoy it from.

478
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,980
So, will you not invite me or anyone else close to you again?

479
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:53,880
Why should I, on such a good day?

480
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,579
It's stifling and nauseating.

481
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,049
I didn't know either.

482
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,019
How uncomfortable it could be to share blood.

483
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,690
We are mother and daughter, but only socially.

484
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,690
We're free, but sometimes, slightly lonely.

485
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,160
Therefore, we won't lose to freedom.

486
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,859
Either have freedom or be lonely.

487
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,729
What are a social mother and daughter?

488
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,730
Did she give birth some other way?

489
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,369
When did Jang Fox become so close to my mom?

490
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,640
It seems like it's been a while.

491
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,409
Ms. Jang Mi Eun came to my salon with that woman too.

492
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,819
Why does she keep poking around here and there?

493
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,450
She drinks with guys.

494
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,719
She seems to have so much time.

495
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,919
Come on. With her looks and talent, she can't stay home.

496
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,989
I'm a homebody.

497
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,690
So Ri, you look attractive to women.

498
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:46,059
Jang Mi Eun looks attractive to men.

499
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,670
Men follow me even if I don't show off to men.

500
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,500
Goodness, that's why they're no good.

501
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,539
Among the guys who followed you around,

502
00:28:53,769 --> 00:28:55,038
were there any good enough to keep?

503
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,710
What? You want me to battle it out with Jang Fox?

504
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,609
To see who can get a better guy?

505
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,380
Then, I will bet on Jang Mi Eun.

506
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,750
Hey, Hwang Geum Soon.

507
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,049
Free?

508
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,420
Oh, you mean "to seduce?"

509
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,319
When did he learn that?

510
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,518
The pure Korean word...

511
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,690
to attract someone with one's charm and make the other feel confused.

512
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,599
Well, yes, Jake. I seduced you.

513
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,430
Yes, that's right.

514
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,299
So, don't ever think of coming to Korea to see me.

515
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,710
Excuse me.

516
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,440
You must've just broken up with your boyfriend.

517
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:42,289
Do you have a boyfriend, perhaps?

518
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,959
It's fine. I've just found a new boyfriend.

519
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Just now?

520
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:49,589
You've been glancing at me for a while.

521
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,899
I caught you. You're interested in me.

522
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,099
Well, I admit it's true,

523
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,069
but I'm a bit too mature...

524
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,700
to see all the women I'm interested in.

525
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Then...

526
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,970
Why don't we meet only on Thursdays?

527
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,939
I happen to not have any men booked on that day.

528
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,279
That's really cool.

529
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,380
If you're here to see a doctor, I'm afraid it's closed.

530
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,289
Hey, Sim Yeon Woo!

531
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,788
- Is that a real no? - I'm too busy.

532
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:23,430
Are you getting back at me for disappearing for six months?

533
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,229
Didn't you miss me? I didn't know you were that patient.

534
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,059
It's a rule for obstetricians to be patient.

535
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,900
What about a girlfriend? Is the spot vacant?

536
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,399
I want to be serious this time.

537
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
Unfortunately, there's only one spot for it at a time.

538
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,209
I never asked for it.

539
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,410
I didn't offer it either.

540
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:39,910
You've gotten pretty.

541
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,549
I need a hug.

542
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,990
Mi Eun.

543
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,619
- Yes? - You're stepping on me.

544
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:58,559
Sorry.

545
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,528
- What? - Friday.

546
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:04,169
- What is this? - I'm only free that day.

547
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,200
Call me.

548
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,140
Hey, Yeon Woo...

549
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,140
Was it always like that?

550
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,519
(Sim General Hospital's Sim Yeon Woo)

551
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
(Sim General Hospital's Sim Yeon Woo)

552
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,700
Pick up the phone. Pick it up.

553
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,400
- Pick it up. - Right.

554
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,768
- Pick it up. - It's not like...

555
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,069
I can avoid it.

556
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,940
Pick it up. Come on.

557
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,579
Pick it up.

558
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,319
Ms. Han So Jin, I'm so sorry to call you late.

559
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,359
I have something to say to you.

560
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,619
Sure, go ahead.

561
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,788
Your Super Teol is causing my DNA to mutate.

562
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,799
What?

563
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,328
What do you mean?

564
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,900
I'll go to the center tomorrow... Wait, there are too many people.

565
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,899
We can meet in my office tomorrow.

566
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,740
Come and check in person...

567
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,909
why my hair is growing.

568
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,980
- Okay? - Okay, I'll be there.

569
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:28,349
What do I do, Shai?

570
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,250
"Mutate?"

571
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,558
It was custom-made for Oh Sang Min,

572
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,529
so it must cause an abnormal hair growth on others.

573
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,598
Our hospital's OBGYN puts...

574
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,500
the parents and the child first.

575
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:46,099
We'll be with you through the pain and hardships...

576
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,210
of the mothers' pregnancy and delivery...

577
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:50,869
(Sim General Hospital)

578
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,109
- Trust us and... - No...

579
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,578
We provide 24 hours...

580
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,279
- of service... - This is driving me crazy.

581
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,190
Our OBGYN will provide...

582
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,720
all the care you need after giving birth.

583
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,460
This was what was on my face.

584
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,970
Gosh... Why do you have this?

585
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,339
Why...

586
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:23,710
I'm sure you remember.

587
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:25,339
(So Jin and Sang Min)

588
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,348
When you got drunk last year,

589
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:32,720
you couldn't remember a thing from the night before.

590
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:34,719
I've had this thought for a while.

591
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,889
I think you have REM sleep behavior disorder.

592
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,589
It's when people subconsciously act out their dreams!

593
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,589
Actually,

594
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,900
I've had REM sleep behavior disorder since I was a child.

595
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,299
Apparently, I subconsciously act out dreams.

596
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,539
I'm not sure how my Super Teol got on you,

597
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:57,170
but did I do something...

598
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,210
unspeakable?

599
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:03,710
How interesting.

600
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,789
What?

601
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,359
Did you carry it around like this?

602
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,988
That's not important now, is it?

603
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:18,760
I can't see patients like this, nor anyone in general.

604
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,459
I don't intend to permanently remove my sideburn.

605
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,899
There must be a solution, right?

606
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,328
You're the inventor, after all.

607
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:28,639
I assume you have such professional ethics, Ms. Han So Jin.

608
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,578
Well... Could you take off the mask?

609
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:36,150
- Sure. - My goodness!

610
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,919
Can you try turning your face?

611
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,530
Will looking at it help you figure it out?

612
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,198
Could I touch it?

613
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,340
Will touching it help...

614
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,949
Oh.

615
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,189
Please look the other way.

616
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,618
Aren't you examining it right now?

617
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:24,229
I'm asking to look at your other sideburn.

618
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,328
I have to check how it's different from your original hair.

619
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:29,030
There's no need.

620
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,469
I prepared samples for you.

621
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,368
This is my original hair. This is the super hair.

622
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,769
I made sure to get hair follicles so you could test them.

623
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,610
I want these nightmarish days to end as soon as possible.

624
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,530
Polyphenol, catechin, biotin, heartleaf, false daisy.

625
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,799
42.3 percent, 27.6 percent,

626
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,669
0.3 percent, and 0.2 percent.

627
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,769
What are you saying?

628
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:07,170
I'm sorry.

629
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:10,409
It wasn't enough that I ambushed your place drunk,

630
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,879
I also turned you into a hideous hairy guy.

631
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,150
"A hideous hairy guy?"

632
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,749
You look like an Elvis impersonator.

633
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,679
"An Elvis impersonator?"

634
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:25,960
Let's try it. I'll be responsible for everything.

635
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,359
I'm so sorry.

636
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,518
Forget the apology.

637
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,389
It's just regrettable that your Super Teol...

638
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,460
and my DNA were so compatible.

639
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:46,809
All right. Open up.

640
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,110
- What are you doing? - A test.

641
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,050
- Don't be nervous. - Me?

642
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,349
To me, you're the nervous one.

643
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Fine.

644
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,659
Let's do the test.

645
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,000
- Open up. - Here.

646
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,869
A bit wider.

647
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,469
- Here. - Open up.

648
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:13,869
Here.

649
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,339
Wider...

650
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
Open up!

651
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:25,010
Perfect.

652
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,090
There.

653
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
I'll be gentle.

654
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,158
All done.

655
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,690
(Sim General Hospital)

656
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,328
You're good considering it's your first time.

657
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:42,059
- All right, then... - Hey.

658
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,130
I think you have enough.

659
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,868
Are you feeling hot?

660
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,268
Well, a woman I didn't expect...

661
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,139
is approaching so suddenly. Of course, it could make me hot.

662
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,010
I see.

663
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,389
Then let me just dry this.

664
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,099
Why won't this open?

665
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,610
Ms. Han So Jin.

666
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,010
Yes?

667
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:37,550
Find me the antidote...

668
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:39,789
to Super Teol.

669
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,459
I'll give you 24 hours.

670
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,229
Let's meet back here tomorrow night at 8pm.

671
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,129
If you can't find the solution until then,

672
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,759
I'll have to use other means...

673
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,928
to hold you responsible.

674
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,000
Do you understand?

675
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,738
- "Other means?" - Yes.

676
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:54,769
Okay.

677
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,509
Please also check for any other test results...

678
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,110
and major records from Ms. Yoo Young A's DNA test.

679
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,340
I need to prepare for her next appointment.

680
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,078
(Sim General Hospital)

681
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,279
(Dr. Sim Yeon Woo, on break)

682
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,190
How can I make it in a day?

683
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:11,590
That's mission impossible.

684
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,690
No way.

685
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,619
Is this his revenge?

686
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,659
I'm in no place to say that.

687
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,599
Polyamory.

688
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:26,599
It's when one dates several partners at a time.

689
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,070
Have you ever considered one might love several at once?

690
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,839
How is that different from cheating? How is that possible?

691
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,150
Why wouldn't it be possible?

692
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:40,280
Are you afraid you can't be your partner's exclusive lover?

693
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:41,779
No, not at all.

694
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,289
It's just one way of dating out of many.

695
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:47,459
Why bother changing yourself to continue dating the man...

696
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,329
who doesn't love you?

697
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:52,698
But isn't it also a part of the fun to find someone different...

698
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:54,500
to work on being together?

699
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,199
Yes. And that's another way of dating.

700
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,000
But polyamorists share the fact...

701
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,840
that they're polyamorists.

702
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,909
Mom, I'm here.

703
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,690
Did you fire all your helpers again?

704
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,690
I don't want to leave our house in the hands of strangers.

705
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,989
I should clean it with my own hands.

706
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,360
Did you do the gardening yourself too?

707
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
No.

708
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,199
I hired a gardener.

709
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,599
Your father loves flowers.

710
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,280
How did you know I'd be here? You look ready to go out.

711
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,579
Shall we go to a nice place to eat since it has been a while?

712
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,989
I won't go without your father.

713
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,789
Also,

714
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,199
how can I go out when I don't know when your father will be home?

715
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,400
Then let's eat at home.

716
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,869
The table's already set. Go and eat if you're hungry.

717
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,909
I have no appetite.

718
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,510
Okay.

Yeon Woo.

721
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,340
Listen carefully.

722
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,980
Starting from today, your dad won't be coming home.

723
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:56,389
It'll be just you and me...

724
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,460
in this house...

725
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:04,929
from now on.

726
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,530
Some pheromones can draw you in intensely for a moment,

727
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,000
but it might not be a scent that suits you.

728
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,368
Because such pheromones...

729
00:42:14,369 --> 00:42:17,039
intoxicate one another with dangerous chemicals...

730
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:20,139
and lead to tragedy.

731
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:24,349
But if you find a pheromone that brings back happy memories,

732
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,250
some pheromones can be remembered forever.

733
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,119
Each of us has different memories,

734
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:35,219
but a strong passage to memories is the sense of smell.

735
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,400
Such pheromones are engraved deeply in us.

736
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,630
If you've felt such a pheromone,

737
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,000
and if you've met such a person,

738
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:47,769
they're your DNA lover even death can't tear you apart.

739
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:49,239
Here.

740
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,780
Is today the day?

741
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:56,880
It was yesterday. My parents' wedding anniversary.

742
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,219
Your parents' is today, right?

743
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,789
How do you remember that? I should learn from you.

744
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:06,159
They're only a day apart.

745
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,389
Did you visit your mom?

746
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:15,459
I know you go see her twice a year.

747
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,630
On their wedding anniversary and on her birthday.

748
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,198
You should visit her more often since she lives alone.

749
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,610
You're her only child. I bet it makes her upset.

750
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,809
How does it feel?

751
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,210
- What? - To have one person in your heart.

752
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,489
The earth is round.

753
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:39,658
What?

754
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:41,659
Just like how the earth is round,

755
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,889
it's a fact that never changes.

756
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,760
The fact that I love that person...

757
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,369
doesn't change even if either of us dies.

758
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,699
That's a bit scary.

759
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,800
If one side changes, the other side should too.

760
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:59,110
I'd prefer it to change rather than not change.

761
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,440
Is that why you always change?

762
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,449
- Perhaps. - Hey.

763
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,578
Why don't you take the opportunity to stay single?

764
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,718
No way. I love women.

765
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,119
You're so selfish.

766
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,190
You know,

767
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,730
I just wonder how it would've been if they had never met.

768
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:20,659
My mother is still waiting...

769
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,199
for that man I call father.

770
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,239
She must think it's fate.

Kang Hoon.

772
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,550
The moment you think it's fate,

773
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,579
everything will become torture.

774
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:44,019
That's how it works.

775
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:51,030
It's nice.

776
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,619
If I continue with my pregnancy, I could die.

777
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,988
And even if Pu Reum is born,

778
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,190
her lifespan won't be very long, right?

779
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:23,989
I won't recommend a decision that would put both the mother...

780
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,130
and the baby in danger.

781
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:28,729
- Thank you. - Take care.

782

By the way,

when I was a child,

791
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:11,670
my mother committed suicide...

792
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,710
and left me behind.

793
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,880
I used to blame her so much,

794
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:21,480
but strangely enough,

795
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,519
I also have been feeling the desire to die since I was young.

796
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,320

Whether it's giving birth or raising a child,

In order to separate the DNA in someone's blood,

820
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,908
place it in a centrifuge first...

821
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:29,579
and set it to 3,000 rmp for 30 minutes...

822
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,980
to remove the buffy coat on the cytosol.

823
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,480
After removing the buffy coat layer,

824
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,389
add 150 microliter of cell lysis solution before vortexing.

825
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,488
Then set it to 10,000 rpm and repeat the process...

826
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,429
until the three layers turn clear.

827
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,909
Lastly, add about 20 to 50 microliters...

828
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,610
of the DNA rehydration solution...

829
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,449
and incubate it in a heat block...

830
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,550
at 56 degrees Celcius for an hour or two.

00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,559
It was her call.

901
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,659
I have to save her. I have to.

902
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:50,929
Ms. Yoo.

903
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,670
Are you sure...

904
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:56,869
this is the mother you want Pu Reum to see?

905
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,679
For once,

906
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,909
I wanted to live for the first time in my life.

907
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,150
Because now I have a family.

908
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,690
I wanted to give my baby birth.

909
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,460
I wanted to give my baby birth!

910
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,098
This is something...

911
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,500
Only you can decide what to do in this situation.

912
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,538
It's your life,

913
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:30,138
and neither I nor anyone else can live it for you.

914
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:33,380
However, I cannot suggest a decision in which both mom and baby...

915
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,380
will end up...

916
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,880
in danger.

917
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,719
I thought...

918
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,219
I could get a different answer from you.

919
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,059
That it's okay to give Pu Reum birth...

920
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:54,860
and that I can do that.

921
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,599
No matter how dangerous,

922
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,269
there can be miracles.

923
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,840
Just once...

924
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:07,940
Just this once...

925
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,909
Couldn't you have said that to me?

926
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,578
Whether it's giving birth or raising a child,

927
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,489
the mother has to be happy.

928
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:22,489
If the mom isn't happy,

929
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,329
the child won't be either.

930
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,860
- The reason why I said that... - Pu Reum.

931
00:55:30,469 --> 00:55:32,769
They say I can't give birth to you.

932
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,500
But I can't give you up either.

933
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,840
So why don't we go...

934
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,239
to a place...

935
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,110
we can be happy together?

936
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:48,650
Wait... Pu Reum!

937
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,849
I'll...

938
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,519
bring Pu Reum to this world.

939
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:03,469
If that's what it takes to make you happy,

940
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,170
I'll do my best.

941
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:09,739
Please give me the chance. Won't you?

942
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,138
Why is this car still here? Did you call the owner?

943
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,079
They're on their way but they need 10 more minutes.

944
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,739
No, there's no time. We must lift it.

945
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,880
Everyone, get on it!

946
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:18,948
- Hurry and lift it. - Let's go!

947
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,079
We're going to lift it. One, two, three!

948
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,519
One, two, three!

949
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:26,150
One, two, three!

950
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,888
One, two, three!

951
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:31,090
Excuse me. I'm sorry, excuse me.

952
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,699
I'll be...

953
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,300
with Pu Reum forever.

954
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:45,570
I'm not like my mom who left me.

955
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,250
Are you sure you won't regret it?

956
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,389
Ms. Yoo.

957
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,159
From the moment you found out about your pregnancy,

958
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,630
you fell in love with Pu Reum.

959
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,699
That single moment to meet each other...

960
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,139
might be more precious than forever.

961
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,239
To some people,

962
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,809
that one moment where they can meet...

963
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:26,209
could be the most precious thing in the world.

964
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,848
If they could postpone their parting by at least another day,

965
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:31,018
If they could postpone their parting by at least another day,

966
00:57:31,019 --> 00:57:33,149
they might be able to handle any sacrifice.

967
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,260
They might be able to handle any sacrifice.

968
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:40,400
You have a lot more time you could spend with Pu Reum left.

969
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,260
You should hold Pu Reum in your arms and meet eyes with her.

970
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,630
You'll even get to hear Pu Reum's cries.

971
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,500
Are you sure...

972
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,039
you won't regret this decision?

973
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,409
What if...

974
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,019
I have to let go of her after I get to hold her?

975
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,590
It would pain me more.

976
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,599
Do you think Pu Reum thinks the same?

977
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,269
Don't you think...

978
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:25,110
Pu Reum would want to try holding your hand?

979
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,210
No matter how dangerous it might be,

980
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,710
I know you still want the baby.

981
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,150
If that's the path to your happiness,

982
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,889
Dr. Sim is a skilled doctor.

983
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,360
He says he'll try his best.

984
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,760
Are you going to give up like this?

985
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,769
Even if Pu Reum is born,

986
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,940
this poor baby...

987
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:59,610
might not have much time.

988
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,980
I understand...

989
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,039
how you feel.

990
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:05,179
Ms. Yoo.

991
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,579
My...

992
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,050
My family died.

993
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,760
I know how it feels...

994
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,190
to lose the family you love.

995
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,860
If they could breathe again even if it's just for a minute,

996
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,369
I'd do everything for them and tell them I love them.

997
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,070
I could give up my life for them.

998
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,510
I know how it feels.

999
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,570
Dad!

1000
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:34,840
But Pu Reum is still alive.

1001
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,650
Please give Pu Reum a chance...

1002
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:42,019
to seek for a miracle.

1003
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:53,730
Please.

1004
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,869
Keep on living.

1005
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,869
Both you...

1006
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,070
and Pu Reum.

1007
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,010
Please,

1008
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:08,880
keep on living.

1009
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,079
Don't die.

1010
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,010
That was when...

1011
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:26,090
I smelled something nice...

1012
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:28,989
from that man.

1013
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:36,400
I'm in trouble.

1014
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:40,570
Some nerd barged into my lane.

1015
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,980
(DNA Lover)

1016
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:32,989
It's a sweet and dim scent...

1017
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,320
I couldn't find from any of my previous DNA lover candidates.

1018
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:39,530
I'm going to steal...

1019
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,500
- So cool! - that scent.

1020
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,670
He was number seven.

1021
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:45,869
What is she doing?

1022
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,399
Calm yourself, Han So Jin.

1023
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,239
You've only gotten over the first hurdle.

1024
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,039
Then what's the next hurdle?

1025
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:53,808
He must not have...

1026
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:55,939
the cheaters' gene which makes one a cheater.

1027
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,650
The DNA with a scent.

1028
01:02:58,179 --> 01:03:00,480
I really hope you don't have it.
