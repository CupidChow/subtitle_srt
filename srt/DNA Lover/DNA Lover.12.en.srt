(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,968
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:48,636 --> 00:00:49,966
Now,

5
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:52,837
I will never let you go.

6
00:00:55,677 --> 00:01:00,861
(Episode 12: The Oblivion Gene)

7
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,107
Go on inside.

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,037
Keep yourself warm as you sleep.

9
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:26,076
Okay.

10
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,147
Thanks.

11
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:48,934
(Yeon Woo)

12
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:01,206
The phone is turned off.

13
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,676
Please leave a message after the tone.

14
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:18,857
But whenever I'm with you, I start acting strange.

15
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,996
I want to tell you that I love you even though I'm afraid.

16
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:26,866
Gosh, why do I keep...

17
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,537
Just like how you found the courage to come here today,

18
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:36,146
I'm working up my courage to say this too.

19
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:39,046
Can you stay by my side?

20
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,387
Goodness.

21
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,826
I mean, it makes no sense.

22
00:02:52,526 --> 00:02:54,396
After saying all that stuff to me,

23
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,067
how could he do this?

24
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:02,667
He didn't have a secret...

25
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,336
he couldn't tell me about, did he?

26
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:12,743
(World's Best Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon)

27
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:17,986
Hey, Kang Hoon.

28
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,127
Were you sleeping?

29
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,857
No, not yet.

30
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:26,556
I left some medicine outside your front gate.

31
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:29,002
You looked like you had a cold earlier.

32
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,197
Be sure to take it, even if it's a hassle.

33
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:34,866
Okay. Thanks.

34
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:36,907
No need to thank me.

35
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:39,477
Don't think about anything and get some good sleep.

36
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:41,107
I'll call you again tomorrow.

37
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:11,936
There wouldn't have been any pharmacies open at this hour.

38
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,623
(Internal medicine)

39
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,703
Hey, A Ri.

40
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:38,236
Ms. Park Eun Jung is coming early to hear her results today.

41
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,672
Let's have her chart ready.

42
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,806
Okay.

43
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:47,107
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick or something?

44
00:04:48,107 --> 00:04:50,006
You look particularly ugly today.

45
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:53,093
It's nothing. I think I have a bit of a cold.

46
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:54,816
It doesn't seem like nothing.

47
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,527
I'm in front of the center. Let's meet up for a minute.

48
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:07,796
This seemed like something important to you.

49
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:09,967
I wanted to give it back.

50
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:14,013
When you meet your real DNA lover next time,

51
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:15,407
you should give it to him.

52
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,837
Is this the first thing you say to me?

53
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,946
Shouldn't you at least explain to me first...

54
00:05:23,977 --> 00:05:26,316
what happened yesterday...

55
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:28,717
and why you acted like that all of a sudden?

56
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:37,657
How could you do that?

57
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,327
You should at least say something.

58
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,513
Why on earth are you acting like this?

59
00:05:44,537 --> 00:05:45,897
And if you were going to be like this,

60
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,283
why did you do those things that night?

61
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,736
It was for no big reason.

62
00:05:51,037 --> 00:05:52,777
I only truly wish for...

63
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,446
your happiness.

64
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,577
You're saying...

65
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,716
this is for my happiness?

66
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:04,287
It might be hard now, but for later on,

67
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,457
I think this is right.

68
00:06:08,886 --> 00:06:10,357
At least there won't be...

69
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,496
any reason for you to be unhappy.

70
00:06:16,936 --> 00:06:18,536
What does that mean?

71
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:20,136
You said so.

72
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:23,006
If your partner is not your DNA lover,

73
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,337
you may not be unhappy in this moment,

74
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,907
but you might become unhappy someday.

75
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,685
- Yeon Woo, that's... - Besides,

76
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,256
you've discovered...

77
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,573
that your true DNA lover is Kang Hoon.

78
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,827
Will you be able to date me while knowing that?

79
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:01,847
It's clear...

80
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,246
why we're breaking up, right?

81
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:13,616
I wish you well.

82
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:29,754
(Sim Sung Hoon, Yeom Jang Mi)

83
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:34,537
(Sim Yeon Woo, Han So Jin)

84
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,733
(Thanks for everything, So Jin. And I'm sorry.)

85
00:08:56,757 --> 00:08:58,957
Those two phrases ended our relationship?

86
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:00,557
How?

87
00:09:04,236 --> 00:09:07,766
He never put in any emotions, so it's easy to end things too.

88
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:19,592
The aftermath of heartbreak phase has begun once again.

89
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:22,246
Binge eating, insomnia, and mood swings.

90
00:09:24,616 --> 00:09:26,455
How long will it last this time?

91
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:27,702
Don't worry.

92
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:29,286
This time, I'll get over him quickly.

93
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:30,626
Humans have...

94
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:33,332
a gene called CCR5. The Oblivion Gene.

95
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,266
(The Oblivion Gene, CCR5)

96
00:09:35,267 --> 00:09:36,666
In order to block out my unhappiness,

97
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,266
this gene will...

98
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,197
So Jin, you didn't know this, did you?

99
00:09:40,297 --> 00:09:43,406
How desperately I ran to you.

100
00:09:45,137 --> 00:09:47,447
It took me a while, right? I'm sorry.

101
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,506
It will manipulate my memories...

102
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:54,717
So Jin, don't you know how much I like you?

103
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:01,126
It will help me to delete those memories.

104
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,597
So Jin, do you only see me as that kind of man?

105
00:10:08,797 --> 00:10:12,337
A man who will lose interest in a woman he likes because of this?

106
00:10:24,677 --> 00:10:26,575
He's not even your DNA lover!

107
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:27,986
Why can't you get over him?

108
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,217
Take down that darned photo of Sewer first!

109
00:10:38,863 --> 00:10:40,396
(Potato cheese fries)

110
00:10:40,397 --> 00:10:42,026
(Convenience store steak)

111

(Jackson spaghetti)

112

(Beef bone soup)

113
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:48,705
I knew that guy would do this!

114
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,607
That hairy man.

115
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:52,837
He's so ugly too.

116
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,577
What an ugly guy.

117
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:57,816
(Sim Yeon Woo)

118
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,239
(Sim Yeon Woo)

119
00:11:05,287 --> 00:11:07,467
(Sim Yeon Woo)

120
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,376
So Jin! Open up!

121
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,077
So Jin!

122
00:11:29,307 --> 00:11:30,677
Open up!

123
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:35,585
Kang Hoon.

124
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,416
What are you doing right now?

125
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,256
What?

126
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:44,896
Hey!

127
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:48,965
- Goodness. - Hey, you can't put this out.

128
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:50,595
You're playing with fire for an experiment again, aren't you?

129
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,967
No, I'm not.

130
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:54,036
Then what is this?

131
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,448
(Test Results)

132
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:01,712
I was just getting rid of things I should get rid of.

133
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,347
Seriously...

134
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,416
Seriously.

135
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,847
You're such a firefighter.

136
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:13,386
Do you want me to light the fire again?

137
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:15,386
Forget it.

138
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:21,197
Kang Hoon.

139
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,567
Today,

140
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,307
I met Yeon Woo.

141
00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:33,736
And...

142
00:12:36,007 --> 00:12:37,876
we really decided to break up.

143
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:45,557
You've done nothing wrong.

144
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,957
You loved him the best you could.

145
00:13:10,576 --> 00:13:11,993
(18 selected)

146
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,017
(Move to trash)

147
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:14,703
(Deleting)

148
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,186
(No photos)

149
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,696
(Seo Kang Hoon)

150
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:44,717
What do you have to say?

151
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,376
Yeon Woo.

152
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:50,547
Are you really going to break up with So Jin?

153
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:56,587
Yes, we've ended things.

154
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:00,827
"Ended things?"

155
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,266
Is that so easy for you?

156
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,766
Weren't you sincere about So Jin, at least?

157
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,876
I was sincere.

158
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,776
That's why I helped her.

159
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,623
I sincerely wish So Jin to be happy.

160
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,192
What does that mean?

161
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,447
How is that making So Jin happy?

162
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,486
You're saying the same thing.

163
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:28,457
She seems to have been hurt badly.

164
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:32,996
You should take good care of her by her side.

165
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:36,866
I hope you don't regret telling me that.

166
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,477
Kang Hoon.

167
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,746
She was someone I wanted to protect for the first time.

168
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:51,577
So Jin.

169
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:55,246
My affection for her kept growing,

170
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,156
but I became scared.

171
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:02,256
If I can only end up hurting her...

172
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,396
because I get swept up in this emotion called love,

173
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,467
I think it's right...

174
00:15:09,127 --> 00:15:11,567
to let her go now before things get deeper.

175
00:15:13,366 --> 00:15:15,666
I'm not sure I can watch So Jin...

176
00:15:16,436 --> 00:15:18,077
as she grows unhappy by my side.

177
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:22,077
Because there will be no such thing as everlasting love.

178
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:07,756
Where is Yeon Woo?

179
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,727
He's gone.

180
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:29,876
Hey, Kang Hoon.

181
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,047
So Jin, what are you doing tonight?

182
00:16:34,216 --> 00:16:36,286
I just want to rest at home.

183
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:39,193
Don't do that. Come on out. Let's go somewhere together.

184
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:40,557
Bye.

185
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,013
What do you think? Don't you feel so refreshed inside?

186
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,406
You said it was somewhere close.

187
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:02,506
Seoul is close enough.

188
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:05,017
We can go anywhere if there's an emergency.

189
00:17:07,586 --> 00:17:08,946
All right.

190
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:13,017
You know, you should use your body at times like these.

191
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,726
Follow me at my pace.

192
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,186
Okay.

193
00:17:29,437 --> 00:17:31,337
Like this.

194
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:35,277
Time out.

195
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:44,446
The moon is bright.

196
00:17:47,156 --> 00:17:48,886
It's fascinating, isn't it?

197
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,797
You can only tell that the moon is so big...

198
00:17:53,096 --> 00:17:56,396
when you look at the shadows of the moon.

199
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:58,366
So Jin.

200
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,206
Do you know why you can't see the moon during the daytime?

201
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,577
You told me this when I was in elementary school.

202
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:07,622
The moon circles around the Earth,

203
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:09,906
but the Earth circles around the sun.

204
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,946
So, when the sunlight is too bright, you can't see the moon.

205
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,487
The moon is always by the Earth's side,

206
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:20,686
but the Earth doesn't look at the moon.

207
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,287
So, the moon is sad.

208
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:26,325
I told you that because you said science was hard.

209
00:18:26,326 --> 00:18:29,273
Why is science always so sad for you?

210
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:33,396
Hey, everyone without a partner is always sad.

211
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,277
Look around you.

212
00:18:39,876 --> 00:18:42,453
There are some people who only have their eyes on you,

213
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:43,906
like the moon.

214
00:18:45,977 --> 00:18:47,517
At times like these,

215
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:50,963
Kang Hoon seems to be my Healer Gene for sure.

216
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,386
But...

217
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:56,956
It's so strange.

218
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,257
How can you be scentless?

219
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,625
It's odd.

220
00:19:02,626 --> 00:19:05,767
How can you not smell like anything?

221
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:08,365
Isn't it you that can't smell it?

222
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:10,706
- I have the nose of a dog. - My goodness.

223
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:20,176
So Jin. I'll go and buy some water.

224
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:22,023
- Wait here for a minute. - Okay.

225
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:23,916
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

226
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:48,976
So Jin.

227
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,546
What took you so long?

228
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,777
Sorry. Here.

229
00:20:00,557 --> 00:20:02,963
You want me to wear these?

230
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:05,503
They didn't have any slippers at the store here.

231
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,296
I went to an underground shopping mall nearby,

232
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:09,102
but these were the ones they sold at the only open store.

233
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,896
Here, try them on. That way, we can go home. Go on.

234
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,107
What's this?

235
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,607
Why are they lighting up?

236
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:27,017
Anyone would be able to tell it's you from 100m away.

237
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,562
This is funny to you, isn't it?

238
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,386
What if I chase after you with these on?

239
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,056
- What? - Come here.

240
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:34,686
- Hang on. - Come here!

241
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,027
Wait, So Jin!

242
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,773
What are these?

243
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:40,597
- This is so embarrassing! - Bye.

244
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,067
Darn it.

245
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:52,675
Dr. Sim, I came on a hotel vacation with the tickets you gave me.

246
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,506
Who do you think I came with?

247
00:20:54,507 --> 00:20:56,747
(Annoying Punk)

248
00:20:58,616 --> 00:20:59,946
Wait.

249
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:03,446
I can't remember if it was a super single or a double bed.

250
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,757
Isn't a super single bed too small?

251
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:11,997
It's a bit small.

252
00:21:13,826 --> 00:21:15,443
Jung Tam.

253
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,267
What are you doing?

254
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,036
Aren't you going to check in?

255
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:20,966
Oh, yes. Let's go.

256
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:24,136
So...

257
00:21:25,707 --> 00:21:26,976
May I help you with checking in?

258
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:29,406
Whose name is the reservation under?

259
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:34,292
A super single? A double? A super single?

260
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:36,186
I can't wake Sung Mi with my sleeping habits.

261
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:37,686
Still, isn't a double bed too big?

262
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,315
Yes, a super single would be better.

263
00:21:39,316 --> 00:21:41,686
- Sir? - Let's go with the super single.

264
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,132
Jung Tam.

265
00:21:43,156 --> 00:21:44,797
- Yes? - So...

266
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,925
Whose name is the reservation under?

267
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:49,726
Oh, a super single.

268
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,237
Pardon?

269
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,936
Oh, right!

270
00:21:57,166 --> 00:22:00,806
- It'll be under Yeo Jung Tam. - Yes.

271
00:22:00,807 --> 00:22:03,607
- Oh, yes. Mr. Yeo Jung Tam. - Yes.

272
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,517
I'm fine.

273
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:08,847
It's really okay.

274
00:22:09,047 --> 00:22:10,946
- One moment. - So...

275
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:16,186
I feel embarrassed to show you my feet.

276
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:20,027
Why? They're the prettiest feet in the world.

277
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:22,966
This side too.

278
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:29,406
There.

279
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:35,976
- It tickles. - Wait.

280
00:22:35,977 --> 00:22:37,807
You're getting water everywhere. Hold on.

281
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:42,747
Oh, my.

282
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,756
You know how to do things like this?

283
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,696
Of course.

284
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,097
- Is it comfortable? - Yes.

285
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,142
Now, stop looking.

286
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,696
- Okay. - All right.

287
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:08,547
You're not looking, right?

288
00:23:11,076 --> 00:23:13,017
No. Don't look.

289
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,577
Stop it.

290
00:23:20,987 --> 00:23:22,527
Ta-da! It's done.

291
00:23:27,757 --> 00:23:29,196
Oh, my.

292
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,042
It's so cute.

293
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:34,497
Is it okay?

294
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:38,552
- Yes. - I'm glad.

295
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:41,307
If so, can I do...

296
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:43,777
what I want to do?

297
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:47,376
Pardon? What...

298
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:04,226
That was...

299
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:07,297
Wait. Hold on.

300
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,466
Sung Mi.

301
00:24:11,507 --> 00:24:12,837
Sung Mi.

302
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:14,906
Hold on.

303
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:16,376
Sung Mi.

304
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:17,747
Hold on.

305
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:46,507
I knew you wouldn't tell me where you were even if I asked,

306
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:49,747
so I asked So Jin.

307
00:24:51,076 --> 00:24:52,376
I see.

308
00:24:57,316 --> 00:24:58,616
Here.

309
00:25:11,596 --> 00:25:15,607
I hope your mom can hear this music box in her dreams.

310
00:25:25,376 --> 00:25:28,386
How are things with So Jin?

311
00:25:29,646 --> 00:25:31,116
We broke up.

312
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:37,426
Because of me.

313
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:45,396
Do you regret...

314
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:48,936
breaking up?

315
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,406
Have you ever seen me regret a decision?

316
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:01,047
Yeon Woo. Should we go for a drive?

317
00:26:01,247 --> 00:26:03,223
I'll drive. Let's go out for a bit.

318
00:26:03,247 --> 00:26:05,186
You used to like going to Chuncheon.

319
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,257
No.

320
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,527
I feel bad...

321
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,456
leaving my mom here.

322
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,673
Yeon Woo.

323
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:21,936
You think your mom doesn't know that you're staying by her side...

324
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,966
with that sad look on your face, don't you?

325
00:26:25,307 --> 00:26:26,953
She knows.

326
00:26:26,977 --> 00:26:28,605
When the patient is sick,

327
00:26:28,606 --> 00:26:32,116
their guardian should stay strong and eat well. Aren't I right?

328
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:38,557
Thanks.

329
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:10,145
This is a grass tree.

330
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:12,085
It's a flower that only blooms when the tree burns up.

331
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:15,017
It was found in a fire that occurred a month ago.

332
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:16,663
Isn't it a bit strange?

333
00:27:16,687 --> 00:27:19,126
The same flower being found in two different fires?

334
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:23,866
I'm sure it was a coincidence.

335
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:28,297
This photo was found at the site of the fire.

336
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:31,206
Is it someone you know?

337
00:27:35,346 --> 00:27:36,946
It's a grass tree.

338
00:27:37,606 --> 00:27:39,517
It has no flowers right now, right?

339
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:43,923
That tree only blooms when it burns in a fire.

340
00:27:43,947 --> 00:27:45,386
Isn't that fascinating?

341
00:27:48,326 --> 00:27:49,656
Mom.

342
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:08,107
Dad, I'm back.

343
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,049
Hey.

344
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,850
- Give it to me. I got it. - Thanks. Table number two.

345
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,361
Here is your meal.

346
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,131
Enjoy.

347
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:44,928
(So Ri)

348
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,290
Hey, So Ri.

349
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,830
Kang Hoon. Why are you calling so late at night?

350
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,475
Can I ask you for a favour?

351
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,428
So you're going on a date today?

352
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,930
With who?

353
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,438
As long as it's not someone like Han So Jin.

354
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,569
Why? What's wrong with So Jin?

355
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,410
What? Is it really So Jin?

356
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,580
No.

357
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,880
Goodness.

358
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,279
It's a bit off.

359
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,719
- So Ri. - Yes?

360
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,866
Do you smell anything on me?

361
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,228
You don't use cologne.

362
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:27,129
No. I mean, do I give off any smell naturally?

363
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,905
What are you talking about?

364
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,168
Are you becoming like So Jin?

365
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,938
No. Someone told me that I had no smell.

366
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,738
Stop talking about smells.

367
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,139
This won't do. Go and change. Let's go somewhere else.

368
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,109
Just pick something easy for me.

369
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,556
Just leave it up to me.

370
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,626
Go inside.

371
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,319
What time are you meeting her?

372
00:29:58,929 --> 00:29:59,929
Is it okay?

373
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,229
You look handsome.

374
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,340
Here.

375
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,248
It's too normal.

376
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:16,580
Next.

377
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:22,349
This isn't bad.

378
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,749
Let's try the next one.

379
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,660
Hurry.

380
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,469
So Ri.

381
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,626
This is it.

382
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,296
- Is it okay? - Yes.

383
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,660
Look.

384
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,660
You look handsome.

385
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,499
And the cologne you bought.

386
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,529
Okay.

387
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:29,190
This is the Cellular Gene Treatment Seminar.

388
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,559
I'm sure you looked at the chart. It should all be...

389
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,836
content that you already know.

390
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,129
It's nothing difficult.

391
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,135
I think you should just keep two main things in mind.

392
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,100
The first thing...

393
00:31:56,509 --> 00:31:57,725
Do you know him?

394
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,026
He...

395
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,518
is a new breakthrough for So Jin.

396
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,890
A breakthrough.

397
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,999
Here. You're not allergic to these flowers, so don't worry.

398
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,299
Why did you bring flowers...

399
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:22,508
Wait. What's up with you today?

400
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,569
Are you going somewhere?

401
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,978
You said you'd be done early today, right?

402
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:28,779
Yes. I'm almost done with work.

403
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,180
Let's go...

404
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,150
on a date together.

405
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,620
What?

406
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,135
You said you wanted to go to an ice skating rink.

407
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,590
Let's go together.

408
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,576
Are you feeling sick?

409
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,469
No. I'm being serious.

410
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,145
I'll wait until you're done.

411
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,009
You can just go now.

412
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,009
We're almost done with all of the preparations.

413
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,080
A Ri can finish the rest of the work.

414
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,479
Is that okay?

415
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:08,049
I'd be very grateful.

416
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,518
No. But...

417
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,859
No. You should leave early for once.

418
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,405
You should have days like this once in a while.

419
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:16,759
We'll wrap up...

420
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,399
the rest of the work.

421
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,900
We?

422
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,445
Yes. You should go.

423
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,215
Don't worry about us.

424
00:33:26,239 --> 00:33:27,600
Thank you.

425
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,910
So Jin said she was working with great people.

426
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,410
- She was right. - Stop it.

427
00:33:33,739 --> 00:33:36,450
What are you doing? Hurry up and go.

428
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,819
Oh, okay.

429
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,725
I'll get going, then.

430
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:45,989
A Ri. Make sure to finish things up nicely.

431
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,189
I'll see you again next time.

432
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,356
Are you wearing cologne today?

433
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,680
Yes.

434
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:14,426
Can you smell something on me now?

435
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,426
An artificial smell.

436
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,390
It's very different from what Shai smelled.

437
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,290
A date?

438
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,529
What are you doing?

439
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:32,270
Right.

440
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:34,339
It's nothing. Let's go.

441
00:34:37,439 --> 00:34:39,779
- Be careful. - It's been so long.

442
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:47,649
Do you see those kids skating?

443
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,390
You need to be as good as them.

444
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,520
Right foot, left foot.

445
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,790
There you go.

446
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:02,669
That's what you get for teasing me.

447
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:03,799
Here.

448
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,739
Oh, gosh. This is embarrassing.

449
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:19,819
Are you okay?

450
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,120
Yes.

451
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:23,250
Are you okay?

452
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,950
Yes.

453
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,890
What is it?

454
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,399
What? Nothing.

455
00:36:06,459 --> 00:36:07,759
Should we go?

456
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,708
So Jin. I'm going to make a call.

457
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:19,216
Okay. I'll wait for you here.

458
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,779
- Wait here. - Okay.

459
00:36:51,497 --> 00:36:54,367
(Slow mailbox)

460
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,379
Oh, gosh.

461
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,290
What's wrong with me?

462
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:11,960
Hey! Move!

463
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,870
So Jin!

464
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,679
Are you okay?

465
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,009
Yes.

466
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,649
Do you think you can get up?

467
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,080
- There you go. - Slowly.

468
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:34,419
Thank you.

469
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,589
Be careful.

470
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,160
Skate carefully.

471
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,029
Hold on.

472
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,879
Don't get yourself hurt next time.

473
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,455
I didn't have time to think about that before jumping in.

474
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,225
That's why you always get hurt too.

475
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,250
Don't take after me in that way.

476
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,989
Why does it feel like something always happens when I'm with you?

477
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,290
Because you're a troublemaker.

478
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:21,230
I'm okay. Let's go.

479
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,270
Okay.

480
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,350
You need to let go of this first.

481
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,580
Right.

482
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:55,705
I'm really okay.

483
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,969
Mr. Seo is waiting. You should head in now.

484
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,339
I'll see you off first.

485
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,009
What?

486
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:08,986
What is this?

487
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,009
(As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.)

488
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,356
(I'll take them down once the repair is complete. Seo Kang Hoon)

489
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,555
What?

490
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,290
Did you do that?

491
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,620
When I came here the other day to give you medicine...

492
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:31,069
As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.

493
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,100
I'll take them down once the repair is complete.

494
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,770
Seo Kang Hoon.

495
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,239
I did it since I was already here.

496
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,810
It's dangerous at night.

497
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:47,196
You should've told me. I didn't know.

498
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,120
It's no big deal.

499
00:39:50,486 --> 00:39:52,159
(As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.)

500
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,589
(I'll take them down once the repair is complete. Seo Kang Hoon)

501
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,918
(Real-time analysis of 2 million brainwaves per second!)

502
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,328
(We'll find your destined partner by analysing your brainwaves.)

503
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:59,935
Thank you for agreeing to this clinical test.

504
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:01,159
(4 years ago, Hanguk University)

505
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,268
(Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Research Lab)

506
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:05,446
Ms. Han. You really are just friends...

507
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,268
with no romantic feelings...

508
00:40:08,269 --> 00:40:10,538
- with this male friend here, right? - Yes.

509
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:12,555
For this particular test,

510
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,080
we can only use people who aren't couples.

511
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,750
- We're not. - We're not a couple.

512
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,850
I can't believe that.

513
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:22,520
Here. Look.

514
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:25,736
These red areas here...

515
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,288
are the activated parts of the brain.

516
00:40:28,289 --> 00:40:32,930
As you can see, your red areas are identical.

517
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,305
Even the brightness levels are the same.

518
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:39,776
How can they be so identical?

519
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,669
Having the same functional activity in the brain...

520
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,609
means your six senses respond in the same way...

521
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,210
when you see and feel something together.

522
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:52,719
Concerns, excitement, sadness, and fear.

523
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,696
All of your emotions are identical,

524
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,919
as if you were born that way.

525
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,788
Now that I think about it,

526
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:02,189
the person who was always by my side...

527
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,060
was Kang Hoon.

528
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,930
Head inside.

529
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,759
I had fun today.

530
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,610
Aren't you going to go?

531
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,180
You should go in first.

532
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,410
Bye.

533
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,739
Father Andrea.

534
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,290
Did something bad happen?

535
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,049
Do you regret...

536
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,419
breaking up?

537
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,919
Have you ever seen me regret a decision?

538
00:42:40,419 --> 00:42:42,259
Is now the time?

539
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:55,910
Thank you.

540
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,680
Mr. Sim. You're making that face.

541
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,080
That expression you get after a breakup.

542
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,549
Did you break up with Ms. Han?

543
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,350
It feels a bit different this time.

544
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,890
- Really? - What should we do?

545
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,489
Do you want me to set you up on a blind date?

546
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,989
- It's okay. - Don't be like that and try.

547
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,529
I'll set something up.

548
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,106
With someone just your type.

549
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,500
Let's see.

550
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,710
Are you Sim Yeon Woo?

551
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,410
Hello.

552
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,210
Was the traffic really bad?

553
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,788
The traffic was fine, but I was horseback riding today,

554
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:51,689
and Brian was a bit sick.

555
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,660
Brian is the name of my horse.

556
00:43:56,499 --> 00:43:57,930
That must've been tough.

557
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,100
What do you like?

558
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,526
What kind of hobbies do you have?

559
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,549
I don't really have a hobby.

560
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,365
My hobby is visiting good restaurants.

561
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:21,558
I'm getting a little sick of visiting five-star restaurants...

562
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,230
in Korea.

563
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,060
I had a fine dining experience at a hotel recently,

564
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,669
but it tasted so cheap.

565
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,415
Are they selling instant food?

566
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:35,500
Shall I introduce you to a restaurant I go often?

567
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:39,415
Ta-da!

568
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:42,279
It's not as good as a restaurant, but give it a try.

569
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,279
It's delicious.

570
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,918
Isn't it? Isn't it good?

571
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,250
See?

572
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,790
So you know how to smile after all.

573
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,618
- Pardon? - That was the first time...

574
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:56,060
you smiled in front of me.

575
00:44:57,229 --> 00:45:00,029
I see... Right.

576
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:13,856
Yes! Just chew them all up!

577
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,356
Look at what they're doing to So Mi!

578
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,080
Just wipe them out! Kill them all!

579
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:24,589
You must like action films.

580
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,489
I guess so.

581
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:28,989
What about you?

582
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:32,160
I hate anything that is dangerous.

583
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:40,770
What a dangerous date you're on.

584
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,439
Hello.

585
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,285
I'm this man's ex-girlfriend.

586
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:49,478
Right. This guy...

587
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:52,049
has a debt of 34 million dollars.

588
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,520
The hospital doesn't belong to him either.

589
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,790
Are you okay with that?

590
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:16,138
Isn't 34 million dollars too much?

591
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,115
You looked like you were suffering,

592
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:19,580
so I got rid of her for you.

593
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,455
What brought you here?

594
00:46:23,479 --> 00:46:26,196
I came here with the editor of my publishing company.

595
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,879
Then I saw you.

596
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:30,589
Yeon Woo, should we go someplace nice?

597
00:46:33,889 --> 00:46:35,489
The weather is so nice.

598
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:38,560
Isn't this a great place for a walk?

599
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:40,160
It's nice.

600
00:46:40,999 --> 00:46:43,069
You should come here with your boyfriend.

601
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,069
Are you seeing anyone these days?

602
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,575
I broke up with them a while ago.

603
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:50,910
- With who? - With all of them.

604
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,310
Why?

605
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:57,410
I want to give my heart to a single person now.

606
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,520
I plan...

607
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,850
on giving my full attention...

608
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,589
to him and only him.

609
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,140
It's late. Should we go home?

610
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:25,410
Is there any place we can go?

611
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,609
Don't you want to go home?

612
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:30,850
Not really.

613
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:33,919
It feels too empty.

614
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,950
Are you feeling lonely?

615
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,719
If you're feeling lonely,

616
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,489
should I move into your place?

617
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,960
Come on, don't joke.

618
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,469
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

619
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,069
- Stop that. No. - Well?

620
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,640
I mean it!

621
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,390
Seo Kang Hoon has the healer gene for me.

622
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,830
Kang Hoon is my healer,

623
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,069
and I'm his healer.

624
00:48:23,229 --> 00:48:25,469
This means he has both...

625
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,000
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene and the healer gene.

626
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,077
Does that mean...

627
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:32,609
(So Jin's dying gene)

628
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,080
our healer gene relationship...

629
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:37,949
put his Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

630
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:39,748
(Kang Hoon's Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

631
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,179
into dormancy?

632
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,419
(Kang Hoon's Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

633
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,018
(World's Best Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon)

634
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:49,529
How is your wrist?

635
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:52,060
Try not to strain it.

636
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:54,600
Come over to the restaurant tomorrow night for dinner.

637
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,100
Really?

638
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,955
Unfortunately, your heart rate is on the rise.

639
00:49:06,979 --> 00:49:09,649
We can't delay the operation.

640
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,426
I see.

641
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,649
Don't worry. It will go well.

642
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,819
Okay.

643
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,659
When Pu Reum comes out,

644
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,160
you'll suddenly lose a lot of blood and bodily fluids.

645
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:28,100
But I'm certain your heart will endure it.

646
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,230
I'll be beside you so that you can endure it.

647
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,200
Doctor.

648
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,640
When I almost made the wrong choice that night,

649
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,580
Yo Han was the first to find me.

650
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,348
He thought we were fated to be.

651
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:52,836
Actually, my little sibling is sick too.

652
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:54,265
People think...

653
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:57,460
I'm single because of that,

654
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,830
but I suffered depression for years.

655
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,029
It was my sibling who consoled me daily.

656
00:50:06,939 --> 00:50:10,640
Without my sibling, I wouldn't be alive now.

657
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,410
The more I hear about his life,

658
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:16,549
the more...

659
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,750
I feel like...

660
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,480
he's someone meant for me.

661
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:24,850
I feel the same, Young A.

662
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,259
I never expected a situation like this,

663
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,230
but the patient needs to go in. Please finish your talk.

664
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:40,745
- Doctor. - Yes?

665
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:42,600
About that person...

666
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,169
who persuaded me on the rooftop...

667
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,339
It's thanks to her...

668
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,480
Pu Reum and I are alive.

669
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,689
Please, keep on living.

670
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,049
Don't die.

671
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,660
Would you please tell her...

672
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,230
that I'm sincerely thankful?

673
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,529
I will.

674
00:51:23,809 --> 00:51:26,210
It's 4:57pm.

675
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,620
Ms. Yoo.

676
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:31,649
Congratulations.

677
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,120
I'll close you up.

678
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:35,890
Okay.

679
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,210
Doctor, something looks off with the mother.

680
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,438
She's losing consciousness.

681
00:51:55,439 --> 00:51:57,679
Young A, open your eyes. Young A.

682
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,909
Young A, open your eyes!

683
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,850
She lost more than 2,000cc of blood.

684
00:52:00,979 --> 00:52:02,248
Give her some uterotonic,

685
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,549
and prepare the balloon catheter.

686
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,850
Hurry!

687
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,489
Her oxygen saturation is dropping!

688
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,958
She lost more than 3,000cc of blood.

689
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,259
Her blood pressure is 65 to 34.

690
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,458
Yo Han, stay focused.

691
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:12,388
- Start the arteriopressor. - Okay.

692
00:52:12,389 --> 00:52:15,035
Ms. Yoo, aren't you going to hold Pu Reum?

693
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:16,929
You have to meet Pu Reum. Ms. Yoo!

694
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,270
Ms. Yoo!

695
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,069
More.

696
00:52:21,499 --> 00:52:23,910
To some people,

697
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:27,180
that single moment to meet each other...

698
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:30,480
might be more precious than anything in the world.

699
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:33,026
The bleeding won't stop.

700
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,719
- Hurry. - Her uterus is unstable.

701
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:39,859
Keep on living.

702
00:52:40,059 --> 00:52:41,660
Both you...

703
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,830
and Pu Reum.

704
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,100
Please, keep on living.

705
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,469
Don't die.

706
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,438
Her blood pressure is rising,

707
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,986
and her heart rate is dropping.

708
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,509
They're now stable.

709
00:53:03,749 --> 00:53:05,180
Ms. Yoo,

710
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,779
thank you for hanging on.

711
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,049
Good job.

712
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,290
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

713
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,060
Mom.

714
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,000
I met a nerdy woman.

715
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,230
Her name is Han So Jin.

716
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,640
You know her too, don't you?

717
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,370
I hear you know each other.

718
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,350
What do you think of her?

719
00:53:42,579 --> 00:53:44,020
I hear you are close with her.

720
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:52,730
After breaking up with her,

721
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:56,930
I can't help but think of her every day.

722
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,700
This never happened to me before.

723
00:54:06,939 --> 00:54:09,080
What is this I'm feeling?

724
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,950
You must know.

725
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,060
I'll be back.

726
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:25,929
In the last 3 years, 193 accidents happened...

727
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,558
on mud flats,

728
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:30,029
and 27 of them lost their lives.

729
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:33,299
This year, there were 33 accidents up to last month.

730
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:38,768
Here is the next story.

731
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,086
Around 8:33pm this evening,

732
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,149
a fire broke out at a detached house...

733
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,549
in Yongdo-dong, Seoul.

734
00:54:44,709 --> 00:54:47,879
Jeongin firefighters dispatched after receiving the report...

735
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,989
and attempted to rescue the residents of the house,

736
00:54:50,189 --> 00:54:53,066
but firefighter Seo who is in his 20s was trapped inside...

737
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,196
and was transferred to Yeonsung Hospital.

738
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:57,259
The fire first started on the second floor...

739
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,765
and engulfed the whole building.

740
00:54:58,789 --> 00:55:00,859
It was put out in one hour.

741
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,029
Firefighter Seo is currently in a critical state.

742
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,969
- Mister... - No way.

743
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,538
It can't be Kang Hoon.

744
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,690
(My Son)

745
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,446
He was known to have passed the Critical Care Paramedic exam,

746
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,208
which was known to be difficult to pass among firefighters.

747
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:17,310
Many are showing regret to the turn of events.

748
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:20,248
- Fire authorities say... - Won't he pick up?

749
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:23,495
Why isn't he picking up?

750
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:26,836
When the news of his critical state was announced,

751
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,359
the treatment towards firefighters...

752
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,089
The car...

753
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:35,029
The car is over there.

754
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,469
Okay, let's go.

755
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,668
I'm okay.

756
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:39,276
I'm okay...

757
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,098
Hey! Are you okay?

758
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:42,899
- I'm fine. - Are you okay?

759
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,615
Try getting up.

760
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,910
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

761
00:55:46,939 --> 00:55:49,179
- Try getting up. - My legs are weak.

762
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,609
- Mister. - Mister!

763
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,208
- What happened? - Yeon Woo.

764
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:53,319
- Hey, Yeon Woo. - Yes?

765
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,980
- Kang Hoon... - Yes?

766
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:56,765
Kang Hoon was admitted to a hospital.

767
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:58,865
Could you drive us to Yeonsung Hospital?

768
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,688
We better rush there.

769
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:03,129
- He's at the hospital. - Okay.

770
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,759
- He's at the hospital. - We should go.

771
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,230
Mister.

772
00:56:11,269 --> 00:56:14,038
You know Kang Hoon always follows all the safety rules.

773
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,069
I'm sure he's fine. Please don't worry.

774
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:18,915
He's right. Kang Hoon would never die...

775
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:20,680
and leave us behind.

776
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,725
Please breathe slowly.

777
00:56:23,749 --> 00:56:25,049
Gosh.

778
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,080
Hello.

779
00:56:28,979 --> 00:56:30,595
- Kang Hoon... - So Jin.

780
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,149
Sung Mi, did something happen to Kang Hoon?

781
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:33,159
No, you got it wrong.

782
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,495
I have to check for myself.

783
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,888
Please calm down.

784
00:56:36,889 --> 00:56:38,930
Kang Hoon!

785
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,075
- What happened to him? - Sir.

786
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,799
What happened?

787
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,370
Please calm down.

788
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:47,069
You got it wrong.

789
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:54,339
So Jin.

790
00:57:09,516 --> 00:57:11,015
That was when I realized...

791
00:57:13,085 --> 00:57:15,555
the truth I've been struggling to neglect.

792
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:47,055
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:52,595
I'll be good to you in my next life.

794
00:57:53,496 --> 00:57:57,666
But thanks to the time I spent with you and our children,

795
00:57:57,735 --> 00:58:01,606
I enjoyed brief happiness.

796
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:04,905
I could hardly believe...

797
00:58:05,105 --> 00:58:06,606
that the moments belonged to me.

798
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:09,476
I wish to see my family one more time.

799
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:11,675
I love you.

800
00:58:16,656 --> 00:58:18,155
Dad!

801
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,285
No...

802
00:58:22,686 --> 00:58:25,155
Dad!

803
00:58:26,826 --> 00:58:28,825
The worst day of my life happened four years ago.

804
00:58:29,295 --> 00:58:32,865
My forgetful gene erased everything from that day.

805
00:58:37,505 --> 00:58:40,905
Both the sadness and Kang Hoon who was with me.

806
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,675
Hey.

807
00:58:47,445 --> 00:58:49,515
If you die, I'll...

808
00:58:49,516 --> 00:58:51,115
I won't die.

809
00:58:51,286 --> 00:58:52,816
How can I die?

810
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:55,986
I'd never hurt Dad...

811
00:58:56,286 --> 00:58:58,226
or you in that way.

812
00:59:23,045 --> 00:59:24,615
Was that why?

813
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:30,825
I forgot about someone precious who was always beside me.

814
00:59:37,695 --> 00:59:40,436
He was always by my side.

815
00:59:41,465 --> 00:59:43,506
Whenever I was in my worst moments,

816
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:46,606
he made me smile.

817
00:59:49,045 --> 00:59:50,776
My DNA lover...

818
00:59:51,945 --> 00:59:53,816
was him all along.

819
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:58,914
Hey! You jerk!

820
00:59:58,915 --> 01:00:00,856
I thought something happened to you!

821
01:00:01,226 --> 01:00:02,825
I thought something happened,

822
01:00:02,826 --> 01:00:06,356
and I was going to go with you!

823
01:00:07,096 --> 01:00:08,825
Hey.

824
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:11,711
I told you to always be careful.

825
01:00:11,735 --> 01:00:13,604
You have the hero gene,

826
01:00:13,605 --> 01:00:15,535
so death is always near you!

827
01:00:15,536 --> 01:00:17,981
How could I die and leave the two of you behind?

828
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:19,405
More than that,

829
01:00:19,976 --> 01:00:22,445
I'm worried about my colleague Seo Min Kyu.

830
01:00:22,746 --> 01:00:25,916
Right. How is he?

831
01:00:25,945 --> 01:00:27,816
Is he in a bad state?

832
01:01:50,538 --> 01:01:52,037
You're lucky.

833
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,817
(DNA Lover)

834
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:13,333
Did you officially confess?

835
01:03:13,357 --> 01:03:14,604
Not yet.

836
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:16,874
This is your opportunity to snatch her!

837
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:18,657
Love is all about timing.

838
01:03:18,797 --> 01:03:20,097
No.

839
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,597
I care more about how she feels than how I feel at the moment.

840
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:27,767
This volunteer work is full of love.

841
01:03:27,808 --> 01:03:31,313
This is why I never believe it when people say they broke up.

842
01:03:31,337 --> 01:03:32,937
Please stop choking me.

843
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:35,083
He keeps on showing up whenever I'm about to forget...

844
01:03:35,107 --> 01:03:37,148
and gets me shaken up.

845
01:03:37,777 --> 01:03:39,718
I'll wait for you one more time.

846
01:03:40,118 --> 01:03:43,247
Go to So Jin and confess sincerely to her.

847
01:03:43,317 --> 01:03:45,086
But if it doesn't work out again,

848
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,657
you should come to me.
