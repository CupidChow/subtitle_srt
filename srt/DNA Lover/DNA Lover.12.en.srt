(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:16,609
Now,

10
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,480
I will never let you go.

11
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,760
(Episode 12: The Oblivion Gene)

12
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,750
Go on inside.

13
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,680
Keep yourself warm as you sleep.

14
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,719
Okay.

15
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,790
Thanks.

16
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,939
(Yeon Woo)

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,149
The phone is turned off.

18
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,319
Please leave a message after the tone.

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,500
But whenever I'm with you, I start acting strange.

20
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,639
I want to tell you that I love you even though I'm afraid.

21
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,509
Gosh, why do I keep...

22
00:02:56,009 --> 00:03:00,180
Just like how you found the courage to come here today,

23
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,789
I'm working up my courage to say this too.

24
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,689
Can you stay by my side?

25
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,030
Goodness.

26
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,469
I mean, it makes no sense.

27
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,039
After saying all that stuff to me,

28
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,710
how could he do this?

29
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,310
He didn't have a secret...

30
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,979
he couldn't tell me about, did he?

31
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:39,719
(World's Best Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon)

32
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,629
Hey, Kang Hoon.

33
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,770
Were you sleeping?

34
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,500
No, not yet.

35
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,199
I left some medicine outside your front gate.

36
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,770
You looked like you had a cold earlier.

37
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,840
Be sure to take it, even if it's a hassle.

38
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,509
Okay. Thanks.

39
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,550
No need to thank me.

40
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,120
Don't think about anything and get some good sleep.

41
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,750
I'll call you again tomorrow.

42
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,579
There wouldn't have been any pharmacies open at this hour.

43
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,420
(Internal medicine)

44
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,470
Hey, A Ri.

45
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,879
Ms. Park Eun Jung is coming early to hear her results today.

46
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,509
Let's have her chart ready.

47
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,449
Okay.

48
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,750
What's wrong with your face? Are you sick or something?

49
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,649
You look particularly ugly today.

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,759
It's nothing. I think I have a bit of a cold.

51
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,459
It doesn't seem like nothing.

52
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,170
I'm in front of the center. Let's meet up for a minute.

53
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,439
This seemed like something important to you.

54
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,610
I wanted to give it back.

55
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,879
When you meet your real DNA lover next time,

56
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,050
you should give it to him.

57
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,480
Is this the first thing you say to me?

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,589
Shouldn't you at least explain to me first...

59
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,959
what happened yesterday...

60
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,360
and why you acted like that all of a sudden?

61
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,300
How could you do that?

62
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,970
You should at least say something.

63
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,310
Why on earth are you acting like this?

64
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,540
And if you were going to be like this,

65
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,050
why did you do those things that night?

66
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,379
It was for no big reason.

67
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,420
I only truly wish for...

68
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,089
your happiness.

69
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,220
You're saying...

70
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,659
this is for my happiness?

71
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,930
It might be hard now, but for later on,

72
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,100
I think this is right.

73
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,000
At least there won't be...

74
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,139
any reason for you to be unhappy.

75
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,479
What does that mean?

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,779
You said so.

77
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,649
If your partner is not your DNA lover,

78
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,980
you may not be unhappy in this moment,

79
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,550
but you might become unhappy someday.

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,628
- Yeon Woo, that's... - Besides,

81
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,899
you've discovered...

82
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,439
that your true DNA lover is Kang Hoon.

83
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,470
Will you be able to date me while knowing that?

84
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,490
It's clear...

85
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:31,889
why we're breaking up, right?

86
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,259
I wish you well.

87
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,570
(Sim Sung Hoon, Yeom Jang Mi)

88
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,480
(Sim Yeon Woo, Han So Jin)

89
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,600
(Thanks for everything, So Jin. And I'm sorry.)

90
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,600
Those two phrases ended our relationship?

91
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,200
How?

92
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:34,409
He never put in any emotions, so it's easy to end things too.

93
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,419
The aftermath of heartbreak phase has begun once again.

94
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,889
Binge eating, insomnia, and mood swings.

95
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,398
How long will it last this time?

96
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,529
Don't worry.

97
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,229
This time, I'll get over him quickly.

98
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,269
Humans have...

99
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,200
a gene called CCR5. The Oblivion Gene.

100
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,209
(The Oblivion Gene, CCR5)

101
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,609
In order to block out my unhappiness,

102
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,909
this gene will...

103
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,840
So Jin, you didn't know this, did you?

104
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,049
How desperately I ran to you.

105
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,090
It took me a while, right? I'm sorry.

106
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,149
It will manipulate my memories...

107
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,360
So Jin, don't you know how much I like you?

108
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,769
It will help me to delete those memories.

109
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,240
So Jin, do you only see me as that kind of man?

110
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,980
A man who will lose interest in a woman he likes because of this?

111
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,518
He's not even your DNA lover!

112
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,629
Why can't you get over him?

113
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,860
Take down that darned photo of Sewer first!

114
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:07,339
(Potato cheese fries)

115
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,969
(Convenience store steak)

116
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,569
(Jackson spaghetti)

117
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,379
(Beef bone soup)

118
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,648
I knew that guy would do this!

119
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,250
That hairy man.

120
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:19,480
He's so ugly too.

121
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,220
What an ugly guy.

122
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:24,759
(Sim Yeon Woo)

123
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,159
(Sim Yeon Woo)

124
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,129
(Sim Yeon Woo)

125
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:53,019
So Jin! Open up!

126
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
So Jin!

127
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,320
Open up!

128
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,528
Kang Hoon.

129
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,059
What are you doing right now?

130
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,899
What?

131
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,539
Hey!

132
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,908
- Goodness. - Hey, you can't put this out.

133
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,538
You're playing with fire for an experiment again, aren't you?

134
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:18,610
No, I'm not.

135
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,679
Then what is this?

136
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,450
(Test Results)

137
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,250
I was just getting rid of things I should get rid of.

138
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,990
Seriously...

139
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,059
Seriously.

140
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,490
You're such a firefighter.

141
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,029
Do you want me to light the fire again?

142
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,029
Forget it.

143
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Kang Hoon.

144
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,210
Today,

145
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:56,950
I met Yeon Woo.

146
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,379
And...

147
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,519
we really decided to break up.

148
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,200
You've done nothing wrong.

149
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,600
You loved him the best you could.

150
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,820
(18 selected)

151
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
(Move to trash)

152
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:41,928
(Deleting)

153
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,129
(No photos)

154
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,639
(Seo Kang Hoon)

155
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,360
What do you have to say?

156
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,019
Yeon Woo.

157
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,190
Are you really going to break up with So Jin?

158
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,230
Yes, we've ended things.

159
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,470
"Ended things?"

160
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,909
Is that so easy for you?

161
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,409
Weren't you sincere about So Jin, at least?

162
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,519
I was sincere.

163
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,419
That's why I helped her.

164
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,389
I sincerely wish So Jin to be happy.

165
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,889
What does that mean?

166
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,090
How is that making So Jin happy?

167
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,129
You're saying the same thing.

168
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,100
She seems to have been hurt badly.

169
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,639
You should take good care of her by her side.

170
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,509
I hope you don't regret telling me that.

171
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Kang Hoon.

172
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,389
She was someone I wanted to protect for the first time.

173
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,220
So Jin.

174
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,889
My affection for her kept growing,

175
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,799
but I became scared.

176
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,899
If I can only end up hurting her...

177
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,039
because I get swept up in this emotion called love,

178
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,110
I think it's right...

179
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,210
to let her go now before things get deeper.

180
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,309
I'm not sure I can watch So Jin...

181
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,720
as she grows unhappy by my side.

182
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,720
Because there will be no such thing as everlasting love.

183
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,399
Where is Yeon Woo?

184
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,370
He's gone.

185
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,519
Hey, Kang Hoon.

186
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,690
So Jin, what are you doing tonight?

187
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,929
I just want to rest at home.

188
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,059
Don't do that. Come on out. Let's go somewhere together.

189
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,200
Bye.

190
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,779
What do you think? Don't you feel so refreshed inside?

191
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,049
You said it was somewhere close.

192
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,449
Seoul is close enough.

193
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,660
We can go anywhere if there's an emergency.

194
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,589
All right.

195
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,660
You know, you should use your body at times like these.

196
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,369
Follow me at my pace.

197
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,829
Okay.

198
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,980
Like this.

199
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Time out.

200
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,089
The moon is bright.

201
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,529
It's fascinating, isn't it?

202
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,440
You can only tell that the moon is so big...

203
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,039
when you look at the shadows of the moon.

204
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,009
So Jin.

205
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,849
Do you know why you can't see the moon during the daytime?

206
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:31,220
You told me this when I was in elementary school.

207
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,490
The moon circles around the Earth,

208
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,549
but the Earth circles around the sun.

209
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,589
So, when the sunlight is too bright, you can't see the moon.

210
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,130
The moon is always by the Earth's side,

211
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,329
but the Earth doesn't look at the moon.

212
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,930
So, the moon is sad.

213
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:53,268
I told you that because you said science was hard.

214
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,140
Why is science always so sad for you?

215
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,039
Hey, everyone without a partner is always sad.

216
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,920
Look around you.

217
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,220
There are some people who only have their eyes on you,

218
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,549
like the moon.

219
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
At times like these,

220
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,759
Kang Hoon seems to be my Healer Gene for sure.

221
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,029
But...

222
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,599
It's so strange.

223
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,900
How can you be scentless?

224
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,568
It's odd.

225
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,410
How can you not smell like anything?

226
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:35,308
Isn't it you that can't smell it?

227
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,349
- I have the nose of a dog. - My goodness.

228
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,819
So Jin. I'll go and buy some water.

229
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:48,829
- Wait here for a minute. - Okay.

230
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,559
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

231
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,619
So Jin.

232
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,489
What took you so long?

233
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,420
Sorry. Here.

234
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,900
You want me to wear these?

235
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,269
They didn't have any slippers at the store here.

236
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,239
I went to an underground shopping mall nearby,

237
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,869
but these were the ones they sold at the only open store.

238
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,539
Here, try them on. That way, we can go home. Go on.

239
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,750
What's this?

240
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,250
Why are they lighting up?

241
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,660
Anyone would be able to tell it's you from 100m away.

242
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,289
This is funny to you, isn't it?

243
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,029
What if I chase after you with these on?

244
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,999
- What? - Come here.

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,629
- Hang on. - Come here!

246
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,670
Wait, So Jin!

247
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,500
What are these?

248
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,240
- This is so embarrassing! - Bye.

249
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:08,710
Darn it.

250
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,618
Dr. Sim, I came on a hotel vacation with the tickets you gave me.

251
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,449
Who do you think I came with?

252
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,589
(Annoying Punk)

253
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,589
Wait.

254
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,089
I can't remember if it was a super single or a double bed.

255
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:34,400
Isn't a super single bed too small?

256
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,640
It's a bit small.

257
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,109
Jung Tam.

258
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,910
What are you doing?

259
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,979
Aren't you going to check in?

260
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,609
Oh, yes. Let's go.

261
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,779
So...

262
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,919
May I help you with checking in?

263
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,049
Whose name is the reservation under?

264
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,119
A super single? A double? A super single?

265
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,129
I can't wake Sung Mi with my sleeping habits.

266
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,629
Still, isn't a double bed too big?

267
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,258
Yes, a super single would be better.

268
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:08,629
- Sir? - Let's go with the super single.

269
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,869
Jung Tam.

270
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,440
- Yes? - So...

271
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:13,868
Whose name is the reservation under?

272
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,369
Oh, a super single.

273
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,880
Pardon?

274
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,579
Oh, right!

275
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,749
- It'll be under Yeo Jung Tam. - Yes.

276
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,250
- Oh, yes. Mr. Yeo Jung Tam. - Yes.

277
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm fine.

278
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,490
It's really okay.

279
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,589
- One moment. - So...

280
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,829
I feel embarrassed to show you my feet.

281
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,670
Why? They're the prettiest feet in the world.

282
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,609
This side too.

283
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,049
There.

284
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,919
- It tickles. - Wait.

285
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,450
You're getting water everywhere. Hold on.

286
00:23:08,329 --> 00:23:09,390
Oh, my.

287
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,699
You know how to do things like this?

288
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,339
Of course.

289
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,740
- Is it comfortable? - Yes.

290
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,079
Now, stop looking.

291
00:23:25,109 --> 00:23:26,339
- Okay. - All right.

292
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,190
You're not looking, right?

293
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,660
No. Don't look.

294
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,220
Stop it.

295
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,170
Ta-da! It's done.

296
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,839
Oh, my.

297
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,809
It's so cute.

298
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,140
Is it okay?

299
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:05,319
- Yes. - I'm glad.

300
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,950
If so, can I do...

301
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,420
what I want to do?

302
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,019
Pardon? What...

303
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:30,869
That was...

304
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,940
Wait. Hold on.

305
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,109
Sung Mi.

306
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,480
Sung Mi.

307
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,549
Hold on.

308
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,019
Sung Mi.

309
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,390
Hold on.

310
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,150
I knew you wouldn't tell me where you were even if I asked,

311
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,390
so I asked So Jin.

312
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,019
I see.

313
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,259
Here.

314
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:42,250
I hope your mom can hear this music box in her dreams.

315
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,029
How are things with So Jin?

316
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,759
We broke up.

317
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,069
Because of me.

318
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,039
Do you regret...

319
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,579
breaking up?

320
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:18,049
Have you ever seen me regret a decision?

321
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:27,690
Yeon Woo. Should we go for a drive?

322
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,089
I'll drive. Let's go out for a bit.

323
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,829
You used to like going to Chuncheon.

324
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,900
No.

325
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,170
I feel bad...

326
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,099
leaving my mom here.

327
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:45,339
Yeon Woo.

328
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,579
You think your mom doesn't know that you're staying by her side...

329
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:50,609
with that sad look on your face, don't you?

330
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,619
She knows.

331
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,548
When the patient is sick,

332
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:58,759
their guardian should stay strong and eat well. Aren't I right?

333
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,200
Thanks.

334
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,088
This is a grass tree.

335
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,028
It's a flower that only blooms when the tree burns up.

336
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,660
It was found in a fire that occurred a month ago.

337
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,599
Isn't it a bit strange?

338
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,769
The same flower being found in two different fires?

339
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,509
I'm sure it was a coincidence.

340
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,940
This photo was found at the site of the fire.

341
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,849
Is it someone you know?

342
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,589
It's a grass tree.

343
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,160
It has no flowers right now, right?

344
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,690
That tree only blooms when it burns in a fire.

345
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,029
Isn't that fascinating?

346
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:16,299
Mom.

347
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:34,750
Dad, I'm back.

348
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,789
Hey.

349
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,619
- Give it to me. I got it. - Thanks. Table number two.

350
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,130
Here is your meal.

351
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:46,900
Enjoy.

352
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,859
(So Ri)

353
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,390
Hey, So Ri.

354
00:29:13,391 --> 00:29:15,630
Kang Hoon. Why are you calling so late at night?

355
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,329
Can I ask you for a favor?

356
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,528
So you're going on a date today?

357
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,730
With who?

358
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,538
As long as it's not someone like Han So Jin.

359
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,369
Why? What's wrong with So Jin?

360
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,210
What? Is it really So Jin?

361
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,380
No.

362
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,680
Goodness.

363
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,079
It's a bit off.

364
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,519
- So Ri. - Yes?

365
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,759
Do you smell anything on me?

366
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,328
You don't use cologne.

367
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,229
No. I mean, do I give off any smell naturally?

368
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,730
What are you talking about?

369
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,268
Are you becoming like So Jin?

370
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:01,038
No. Someone told me that I had no smell.

371
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,838
Stop talking about smells.

372
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,239
This won't do. Go and change. Let's go somewhere else.

373
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,209
Just pick something easy for me.

374
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,480
Just leave it up to me.

375
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,480
Go inside.

376
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,119
What time are you meeting her?

377
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,029
Is it okay?

378
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,029
You look handsome.

379
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
Here.

380
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,348
It's too normal.

381
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:43,380
Next.

382
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,449
This isn't bad.

383
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,549
Let's try the next one.

384
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,460
Hurry.

385
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,269
So Ri.

386
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,650
This is it.

387
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,220
- Is it okay? - Yes.

388
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,460
Look.

389
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,460
You look handsome.

390
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,299
And the cologne you bought.

391
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,329
Okay.

392
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,990
This is the Cellular Gene Treatment Seminar.

393
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,659
I'm sure you looked at the chart. It should all be...

394
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,690
content that you already know.

395
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,229
It's nothing difficult.

396
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,160
I think you should just keep two main things in mind.

397
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,900
The first thing...

398
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,750
Do you know him?

399
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:25,880
He...

400
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,618
is a new breakthrough for So Jin.

401
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:29,690
A breakthrough.

402
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,799
Here. You're not allergic to these flowers, so don't worry.

403
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,099
Why did you bring flowers...

404
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,608
Wait. What's up with you today?

405
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:50,669
Are you going somewhere?

406
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,078
You said you'd be done early today, right?

407
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,579
Yes. I'm almost done with work.

408
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,980
Let's go...

409
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,950
on a date together.

410
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,420
What?

411
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,160
You said you wanted to go to an ice skating rink.

412
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:11,390
Let's go together.

413
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,599
Are you feeling sick?

414
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,269
No. I'm being serious.

415
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,170
I'll wait until you're done.

416
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,809
You can just go now.

417
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,809
We're almost done with all of the preparations.

418
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,880
A Ri can finish the rest of the work.

419
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,279
Is that okay?

420
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,149
I'd be very grateful.

421
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,618
No. But...

422
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,959
No. You should leave early for once.

423
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,460
You should have days like this once in a while.

424
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:43,559
We'll wrap up...

425
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,499
the rest of the work.

426
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,700
We?

427
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,470
Yes. You should go.

428
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:53,240
Don't worry about us.

429
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:54,400
Thank you.

430
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,710
So Jin said she was working with great people.

431
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,210
- She was right. - Stop it.

432
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,250
What are you doing? Hurry up and go.

433
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,619
Oh, okay.

434
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,719
I'll get going, then.

435
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,789
A Ri. Make sure to finish things up nicely.

436
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,989
I'll see you again next time.

437
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,380
Are you wearing cologne today?

438
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Yes.

439
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,280
Can you smell something on me now?

440
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,389
An artificial smell.

441
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,190
It's very different from what Shai smelled.

442
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,090
A date?

443
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,329
What are you doing?

444
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,070
Right.

445
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,139
It's nothing. Let's go.

446
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,579
- Be careful. - It's been so long.

447
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,449
Do you see those kids skating?

448
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,190
You need to be as good as them.

449
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,320
Right foot, left foot.

450
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,590
There you go.

451
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,469
That's what you get for teasing me.

452
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:30,899
Here.

453
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,539
Oh, gosh. This is embarrassing.

454
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,919
Are you okay?

455
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Yes.

456
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,050
Are you okay?

457
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,750
Yes.

458
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,690
What is it?

459
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,199
What? Nothing.

460
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:34,559
Should we go?

461
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,808
So Jin. I'm going to make a call.

462
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:46,210
Okay. I'll wait for you here.

463
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,579
- Wait here. - Okay.

464
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,409
(Slow mailbox)

465
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,179
Oh, gosh.

466
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,090
What's wrong with me?

467
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,760
Hey! Move!

468
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:48,670
So Jin!

469
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,779
Are you okay?

470
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,809
Yes.

471
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,449
Do you think you can get up?

472
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,880
- There you go. - Slowly.

473
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,219
Thank you.

474
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,389
Be careful.

475
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,960
Skate carefully.

476
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,829
Hold on.

477
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,679
Don't get yourself hurt next time.

478
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,510
I didn't have time to think about that before jumping in.

479
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,280
That's why you always get hurt too.

480
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:33,050
Don't take after me in that way.

481
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,789
Why does it feel like something always happens when I'm with you?

482
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:41,090
Because you're a troublemaker.

483
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,030
I'm okay. Let's go.

484
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,070
Okay.

485
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,150
You need to let go of this first.

486
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,380
Right.

487
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,530
I'm really okay.

488
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,769
Mr. Seo is waiting. You should head in now.

489
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,139
I'll see you off first.

490
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:32,809
What?

491
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,849
What is this?

492
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,109
(As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.)

493
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,750
(I'll take them down once the repair is complete. Seo Kang Hoon)

494
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,579
What?

495
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,090
Did you do that?

496
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,420
When I came here the other day to give you medicine...

497
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:57,869
As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.

498
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,900
I'll take them down once the repair is complete.

499
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,570
Seo Kang Hoon.

500
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,339
I did it since I was already here.

501
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,610
It's dangerous at night.

502
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,119
You should've told me. I didn't know.

503
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,920
It's no big deal.

504
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,259
(As the streetlamp repair was delayed, I installed LED lights.)

505
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,689
(I'll take them down once the repair is complete. Seo Kang Hoon)

506
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,018
(Real-time analysis of 2 million brainwaves per second!)

507
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,428
(We'll find your destined partner by analyzing your brainwaves.)

508
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:26,860
Thank you for agreeing to this clinical test.

509
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:28,259
(4 years ago, Hanguk University)

510
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,368
(Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Research Lab)

511
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,269
Ms. Han. You really are just friends...

512
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:35,368
with no romantic feelings...

513
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,638
- with this male friend here, right? - Yes.

514
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,610
For this particular test,

515
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,880
we can only use people who aren't couples.

516
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,550
- We're not. - We're not a couple.

517
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,650
I can't believe that.

518
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:49,320
Here. Look.

519
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,719
These red areas here...

520
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,388
are the activated parts of the brain.

521
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:59,730
As you can see, your red areas are identical.

522
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,300
Even the brightness levels are the same.

523
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:06,599
How can they be so identical?

524
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,469
Having the same functional activity in the brain...

525
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:12,709
means your six senses respond in the same way...

526
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:16,010
when you see and feel something together.

527
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:19,819
Concerns, excitement, sadness, and fear.

528
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,719
All of your emotions are identical,

529
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,719
as if you were born that way.

530
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,888
Now that I think about it,

531
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:28,989
the person who was always by my side...

532
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,860
was Kang Hoon.

533
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,730
Head inside.

534
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:35,559
I had fun today.

535
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,710
Aren't you going to go?

536
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,980
You should go in first.

537
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,210
Bye.

538
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:21,539
Father Andrea.

539
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,090
Did something bad happen?

540
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,849
Do you regret...

541
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:01,219
breaking up?

542
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,719
Have you ever seen me regret a decision?

543
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,059
Is now the time?

544
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:22,710
Thank you.

545
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,480
Mr. Sim. You're making that face.

546
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,880
That expression you get after a breakup.

547
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,349
Did you break up with Ms. Han?

548
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,150
It feels a bit different this time.

549
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,690
- Really? - What should we do?

550
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,289
Do you want me to set you up on a blind date?

551
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:45,089
- It's okay. - Don't be like that and try.

552
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,629
I'll set something up.

553
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,099
With someone just your type.

554
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,300
Let's see.

555
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,510
Are you Sim Yeon Woo?

556
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,210
Hello.

557
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,010
Was the traffic really bad?

558
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,888
The traffic was fine, but I was horseback riding today,

559
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,489
and Brian was a bit sick.

560
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,460
Brian is the name of my horse.

561
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,730
That must've been tough.

562
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,900
What do you like?

563
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,550
What kind of hobbies do you have?

564
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,349
I don't really have a hobby.

565
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,260
My hobby is visiting good restaurants.

566
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:48,658
I'm getting a little sick of visiting five-star restaurants...

567
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:50,030
in Korea.

568
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:53,860
I had a fine dining experience at a hotel recently,

569
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,469
but it tasted so cheap.

570
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:59,230
Are they selling instant food?

571
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:02,300
Shall I introduce you to a restaurant I go often?

572
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,309
Ta-da!

573
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:09,079
It's not as good as a restaurant, but give it a try.

574
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,379
It's delicious.

575
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,018
Isn't it? Isn't it good?

576
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,050
See?

577
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,590
So you know how to smile after all.

578
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,718
- Pardon? - That was the first time...

579
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,860
you smiled in front of me.

580
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,829
I see... Right.

581
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,710
Yes! Just chew them all up!

582
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,280
Look at what they're doing to So Mi!

583
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
Just wipe them out! Kill them all!

584
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,389
You must like action films.

585
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,289
I guess so.

586
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,089
What about you?

587
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,960
I hate anything that is dangerous.

588
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:07,570
What a dangerous date you're on.

589
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,239
Hello.

590
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,110
I'm this man's ex-girlfriend.

591
00:46:14,409 --> 00:46:16,578
Right. This guy...

592
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,849
has a debt of 34 million dollars.

593
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,320
The hospital doesn't belong to him either.

594
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,590
Are you okay with that?

595
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,238
Isn't 34 million dollars too much?

596
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,039
You looked like you were suffering,

597
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,380
so I got rid of her for you.

598
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,309
What brought you here?

599
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,079
I came here with the editor of my publishing company.

600
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,679
Then I saw you.

601
00:46:55,019 --> 00:46:57,389
Yeon Woo, should we go someplace nice?

602
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:02,289
The weather is so nice.

603
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:05,360
Isn't this a great place for a walk?

604
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,960
It's nice.

605
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,869
You should come here with your boyfriend.

606
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,869
Are you seeing anyone these days?

607
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,440
I broke up with them a while ago.

608
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,710
- With who? - With all of them.

609
00:47:19,110 --> 00:47:20,110
Why?

610
00:47:21,409 --> 00:47:24,210
I want to give my heart to a single person now.

611
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:27,320
I plan...

612
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,650
on giving my full attention...

613
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,389
to him and only him.

614
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,940
It's late. Should we go home?

615
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,210
Is there any place we can go?

616
00:47:54,139 --> 00:47:55,409
Don't you want to go home?

617
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:57,650
Not really.

618
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,719
It feels too empty.

619
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,750
Are you feeling lonely?

620
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,519
If you're feeling lonely,

621
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,289
should I move into your place?

622
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,760
Come on, don't joke.

623
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,569
I'm not joking. I'm serious.

624
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,869
- Stop that. No. - Well?

625
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:22,440
I mean it!

626
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:45,190
Seo Kang Hoon has the healer gene for me.

627
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,630
Kang Hoon is my healer,

628
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,869
and I'm his healer.

629
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:52,569
This means he has both...

630
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:55,800
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene and the healer gene.

631
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,109
Does that mean...

632
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,709
(So Jin's dying gene)

633
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,880
our healer gene relationship...

634
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:05,049
put his Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

635
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,848
(Kang Hoon's Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

636
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:08,279
into dormancy?

637
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,519
(Kang Hoon's Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene)

638
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,118
(World's Best Firefighter Seo Kang Hoon)

639
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,329
How is your wrist?

640
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:18,860
Try not to strain it.

641
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,400
Come over to the restaurant tomorrow night for dinner.

642
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,900
Really?

643
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,980
Unfortunately, your heart rate is on the rise.

644
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,449
We can't delay the operation.

645
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,449
I see.

646
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,449
Don't worry. It will go well.

647
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:45,619
Okay.

648
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,759
When Pu Reum comes out,

649
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,960
you'll suddenly lose a lot of blood and bodily fluids.

650
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,900
But I'm certain your heart will endure it.

651
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,030
I'll be beside you so that you can endure it.

652
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,000
Doctor.

653
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:07,440
When I almost made the wrong choice that night,

654
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,380
Yo Han was the first to find me.

655
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,448
He thought we were fated to be.

656
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:19,650
Actually, my little sibling is sick too.

657
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,260
People think...

658
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:24,260
I'm single because of that,

659
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,630
but I suffered depression for years.

660
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,829
It was my sibling who consoled me daily.

661
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:37,440
Without my sibling, I wouldn't be alive now.

662
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,210
The more I hear about his life,

663
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,349
the more...

664
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,550
I feel like...

665
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,280
he's someone meant for me.

666
00:50:49,949 --> 00:50:51,650
I feel the same, Young A.

667
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,059
I never expected a situation like this,

668
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,030
but the patient needs to go in. Please finish your talk.

669
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,769
- Doctor. - Yes?

670
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,400
About that person...

671
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,969
who persuaded me on the rooftop...

672
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:15,139
It's thanks to her...

673
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,280
Pu Reum and I are alive.

674
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,489
Please, keep on living.

675
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:25,849
Don't die.

676
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:28,460
Would you please tell her...

677
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,030
that I'm sincerely thankful?

678
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,329
I will.

679
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:53,010
It's 4:57pm.

680
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:54,420
Ms. Yoo.

681
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:58,449
Congratulations.

682
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,920
I'll close you up.

683
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:02,690
Okay.

684
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,010
Doctor, something looks off with the mother.

685
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,538
She's losing consciousness.

686
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,779
Young A, open your eyes. Young A.

687
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,009
Young A, open your eyes!

688
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,650
She lost more than 2,000cc of blood.

689
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,348
Give her some uterotonic,

690
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,649
and prepare the balloon catheter.

691
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,650
Hurry!

692
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,589
Her oxygen saturation is dropping!

693
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,058
She lost more than 3,000cc of blood.

694
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,359
Her blood pressure is 65 to 34.

695
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,558
Yo Han, stay focused.

696
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,488
- Start the arteriopressor. - Okay.

697
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,059
Ms. Yoo, aren't you going to hold Pu Reum?

698
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,029
You have to meet Pu Reum. Ms. Yoo!

699
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,070
Ms. Yoo!

700
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:47,869
More.

701
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,710
To some people,

702
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:53,980
that single moment to meet each other...

703
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,280
might be more precious than anything in the world.

704
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,119
The bleeding won't stop.

705
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,519
- Hurry. - Her uterus is unstable.

706
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:06,659
Keep on living.

707
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,460
Both you...

708
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,630
and Pu Reum.

709
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:14,900
Please, keep on living.

710
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,269
Don't die.

711
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,538
Her blood pressure is rising,

712
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:25,840
and her heart rate is dropping.

713
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,309
They're now stable.

714
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:31,980
Ms. Yoo,

715
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,579
thank you for hanging on.

716
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,849
Good job.

717
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,090
- Good work, everyone. - Good work.

718
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,860
Mom.

719
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,800
I met a nerdy woman.

720
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,030
Her name is Han So Jin.

721
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,440
You know her too, don't you?

722
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,170
I hear you know each other.

723
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,150
What do you think of her?

724
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,820
I hear you are close with her.

725
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,530
After breaking up with her,

726
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,730
I can't help but think of her every day.

727
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,500
This never happened to me before.

728
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,880
What is this I'm feeling?

729
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,750
You must know.

730
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,860
I'll be back.

731
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,029
In the last 3 years, 193 accidents happened...

732
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,658
on mud flats,

733
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,829
and 27 of them lost their lives.

734
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,099
This year, there were 33 accidents up to last month.

735
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:05,868
Here is the next story.

736
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:08,010
Around 8:33pm this evening,

737
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,249
a fire broke out at a detached house...

738
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:11,349
in Yongdo-dong, Seoul.

739
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,979
Jeongin firefighters dispatched after receiving the report...

740
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,789
and attempted to rescue the residents of the house,

741
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:20,059
but firefighter Seo who is in his 20s was trapped inside...

742
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,019
and was transferred to Yeonsung Hospital.

743
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,359
The fire first started on the second floor...

744
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,789
and engulfed the whole building.

745
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,959
It was put out in one hour.

746
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,129
Firefighter Seo is currently in a critical state.

747
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,069
- Mister... - No way.

748
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,638
It can't be Kang Hoon.

749
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:35,900
(My Son)

750
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,369
He was known to have passed the Critical Care Paramedic exam,

751
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,308
which was known to be difficult to pass among firefighters.

752
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,110
Many are showing regret to the turn of events.

753
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:47,348
- Fire authorities say... - Won't he pick up?

754
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,349
Why isn't he picking up?

755
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:53,860
When the news of his critical state was announced,

756
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,159
the treatment towards firefighters...

757
00:55:58,829 --> 00:55:59,889
The car...

758
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,129
The car is over there.

759
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,569
Okay, let's go.

760
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,768
I'm okay.

761
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,170
I'm okay...

762
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,198
Hey! Are you okay?

763
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,699
- I'm fine. - Are you okay?

764
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,670
Try getting up.

765
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:13,710
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

766
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,279
- Try getting up. - My legs are weak.

767
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,709
- Mister. - Mister!

768
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,308
- What happened? - Yeon Woo.

769
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,419
- Hey, Yeon Woo. - Yes?

770
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,780
- Kang Hoon... - Yes?

771
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,820
Kang Hoon was admitted to a hospital.

772
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,690
Could you drive us to Yeonsung Hospital?

773
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,788
We better rush there.

774
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:30,229
- He's at the hospital. - Okay.

775
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,559
- He's at the hospital. - We should go.

776
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,030
Mister.

777
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:41,138
You know Kang Hoon always follows all the safety rules.

778
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:43,169
I'm sure he's fine. Please don't worry.

779
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:45,969
He's right. Kang Hoon would never die...

780
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,480
and leave us behind.

781
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,809
Please breathe slowly.

782
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:51,849
Gosh.

783
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:54,880
Hello.

784
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,650
- Kang Hoon... - So Jin.

785
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,249
Sung Mi, did something happen to Kang Hoon?

786
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,259
No, you got it wrong.

787
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,460
I have to check for myself.

788
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,988
Please calm down.

789
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:05,730
Kang Hoon!

790
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,960
- What happened to him? - Sir.

791
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,599
What happened?

792
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,170
Please calm down.

793
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,869
You got it wrong.

794
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:21,139
So Jin.

795
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:37,789
That was when I realized...

796
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:42,329
the truth I've been struggling to neglect.

797
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:13,829
I'm sorry.

798
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,369
I'll be good to you in my next life.

799
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:24,440
But thanks to the time I spent with you and our children,

800
00:58:24,809 --> 00:58:28,380
I enjoyed brief happiness.

801
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,679
I could hardly believe...

802
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,380
that the moments belonged to me.

803
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,250
I wish to see my family one more time.

804
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:38,449
I love you.

805
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,929
Dad!

806
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,059
No...

807
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,929
Dad!

808
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,599
The worst day of my life happened four years ago.

809
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:59,639
My forgetful gene erased everything from that day.

810
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:07,679
Both the sadness and Kang Hoon who was with me.

811
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,449
Hey.

812
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,589
If you die, I'll...

813
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,889
I won't die.

814
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,590
How can I die?

815
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,760
I'd never hurt Dad...

816
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,000
or you in that way.

817
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,389
Was that why?

818
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,599
I forgot about someone precious who was always beside me.

819
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:07,210
He was always by my side.

820
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:10,280
Whenever I was in my worst moments,

821
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:13,380
he made me smile.

822
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,550
My DNA lover...

823
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,590
was him all along.

824
01:00:23,389 --> 01:00:25,988
Hey! You jerk!

825
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,630
I thought something happened to you!

826
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,899
I thought something happened,

827
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,130
and I was going to go with you!

828
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,599
Hey.

829
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,639
I told you to always be careful.

830
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:40,678
You have the hero gene,

831
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,609
so death is always near you!

832
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:44,849
How could I die and leave the two of you behind?

833
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:46,179
More than that,

834
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,219
I'm worried about my colleague Seo Min Kyu.

835
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,690
Right. How is he?

836
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:54,590
Is he in a bad state?

837
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,869
You're lucky.

838
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,949
(DNA Lover)

839
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,219
Did you officially confess?

840
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:41,519
Not yet.

841
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,719
This is your opportunity to snatch her!

842
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,489
Love is all about timing.

843
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:46,929
No.

844
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:50,429
I care more about how she feels than how I feel at the moment.

845
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,599
This volunteer work is full of love.

846
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:58,369
This is why I never believe it when people say they broke up.

847
01:03:58,469 --> 01:03:59,769
Please stop choking me.

848
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,139
He keeps on showing up whenever I'm about to forget...

849
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:03,980
and gets me shaken up.

850
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:06,550
I'll wait for you one more time.

851
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:10,079
Go to So Jin and confess sincerely to her.

852
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:12,218
But if it doesn't work out again,

853
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:13,489
you should come to me.
