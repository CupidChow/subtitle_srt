Where do you keep your paper shopping bags?

00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:44,090
- They're in the drawer. Hang on. - No, I'll do it.

7
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:46,592
Can you just bring me a plastic bag?

8
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:47,932
Okay.

9
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,140
I thought you might need some newspaper too.

Oh, okay. Thanks.

11
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:12,581
I'm sorry. It was a gift from you.

I did send this,

00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,280
but it wasn't what I had ordered. They sent something else.

18
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,682
They must've made a mistake.

19
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,950

give me a little more time?

34
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,879
I wanted to prove my love...

with my DNA Lover Theory.

36
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,035
I'm worried that was the last time with you in my life...

37
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:55,128
and that I may have let that slip away.

38
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,498
I think I made the wrong choice.

39
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,099
Can you please...

40
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,169
give me another chance?

When the one you love looks at another,

44
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,678
many people tend to give up.

45
00:04:47,549 --> 00:04:51,649
However, can giving up become love?

46
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:54,087
I'll wait for you just one more time.

47
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:56,418
And you should go to So Jin now...

48
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,318
to tell her how you truly feel.

49

50

51

by not giving up.

52
00:05:17,809 --> 00:05:19,178
Love.

53
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:22,008
I've never once believed in it in my entire life,

54
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:25,525
and I never knew what that could be like.

55
00:05:25,549 --> 00:05:27,948
If love is when my senses go wild,

56
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,234
I never loved Kang Hoon as a man.

57
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,159
But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

58
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:37,599
was all wrong.

59
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,824

there was sodium and fuel inside the plant?

Yes.

Be careful.

77
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:58,538
If the person who received the plant waters it,

78
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:00,298
it would explode like that.

79
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:03,638
Then, the explosion would lead to a fire.

80
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,079
And this fuel...

81
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,609
would feed into that fire.

sell this plant as well?

I'm not sure about that,

104

but it's a rare species, so I'm sure not many places carry it.

105

The grass tree is an imported plant from Australia,

106
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,498
so it doesn't grow naturally in Korea either.

Well, I'll send you that tomorrow.

00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,928
Have some food too.

184
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,528
- Oh, I like kiwis, though. - Kiwis.

185
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:30,615
Anyway, you all worked hard today, everyone.

186
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,837
- Cheers. - Cheers.

187
00:13:31,838 --> 00:13:33,738
- Cheers. - Let's go.

188
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:40,237
Vice Director, you usually pace yourself well when you drink.

189
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:42,148
But you're drinking quite a lot today.

190
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,378
I know.

191
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,918
I'll get going first.

192
00:13:48,049 --> 00:13:50,418
- I will... - Hey.

193
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,187
- Should I go... - It's fine.

194
00:13:52,188 --> 00:13:54,528
- I was going to take care of... - It's fine.

195
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,689
He hates showing people how he is when he's drunk.

196
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,839
Sir, we've arrived.

197
00:14:14,049 --> 00:14:15,908
Where are we?

198
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,918
I drove to the address you gave me earlier.

199
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:21,947
I asked to come here?

200
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:23,288
Yes.

201
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:34,928
Cheongdam-dong... I mean...

202
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,268
What?

203
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,138
Hang on.

204
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,479
Let's go now.

205
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:03,888
What?

206
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:05,859
What do you think of me?

207
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:08,199
Come on. Seriously.

208
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:09,597
That hurts.

209
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,699
Stop it. Seriously.

210
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,398
You're due soon. Take care of yourself until you give birth.

211
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,199
I'll see you next week.

212
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:43,727
- Thank you. - Get home safely.

213
00:15:43,728 --> 00:15:45,799
Please come this way.

214
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,569
Let's hold hands.

215
00:16:19,968 --> 00:16:21,908
I want to do so.

216
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:26,179
We can't communicate telepathically.

217
00:16:27,478 --> 00:16:29,008
How did you find me?

218
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,418
Are you okay?

219
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:40,418
But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

220
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:43,789
was all wrong.

221
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,928
So, I think this might be what real love is.

222
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,739
So Jin, I...

223
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,849
If you really love So Jin, let her go. That's love too.

224
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:11,459
(Seoul Fire Services)

225
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,688
Jung Tam!

226
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,745
What brings you here without calling ahead?

227
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:25,239
Sung Mi, do you want to go eat macarons?

228
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:26,867
Oh, okay.

229
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:28,408
- Have some. - Okay.

230
00:17:38,378 --> 00:17:41,019
This macaron place...

231
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:46,259
was the place where we first communicated telepathically.

232
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:48,928
Because you weren't coming to the gym,

233
00:17:49,428 --> 00:17:52,559
I sent you a message via telepathy as if I was praying.

234
00:17:52,658 --> 00:17:54,897
- Dr. Yeo! - Sung Mi!

235
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,668
Then, I ran into you again here by chance.

236
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,844
Really?

237
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,168
Someone said that if you can communicate via telepathy,

238
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,678
you're each other's DNA lover.

239
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:08,509
- DNA lover? - Yes.

240
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:12,148
Oh, DNA lovers are fated from the moment you're born.

241
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:18,218
I don't know about fate,

242
00:18:20,118 --> 00:18:22,059
but I don't think I'll ever meet...

243
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:25,099
another man who cherishes me so much...

244
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,999
like you do.

245
00:18:41,108 --> 00:18:43,049
So, Sung Mi.

246
00:18:44,318 --> 00:18:45,618
Yes?

247
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:52,019
I'm unable to have kids.

248
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:57,829
Pardon?

249
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,228
Well...

250
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,499
I'm sterile.

251
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,539
What...

252
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,749
Sterile...

253
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,618
You're sterile?

254
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,218
Well...

255
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:27,789
I don't know about anything else,

256
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:31,059
but as you said before,

257
00:19:31,158 --> 00:19:34,198
I can love you and only you for the rest of my life.

258
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:39,168
Wouldn't that be enough?

259
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,638
Oh, these days,

260
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:49,708
there are many people who live a happy life as just a couple.

261
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,519
Or...

262
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:54,648
some people raise pets as if they're children...

263
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,089
Well...

264
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:09,029
I think I'm going to need...

265
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:12,438
some time to think, Jung Tam.

266
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,638
- Right... - Excuse me.

267
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,978
So, when...

268
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:24,049
When you're done thinking, you'll call me, right?

269
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,394
How can you be so one-sided?

270
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:07,789
You confessed to her that you still loved her even after breaking up?

271
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,935
That's no different from what a stalker would do.

272
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,198
Breakups must be safe.

273
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:16,327
Please don't torment the woman you once loved.

274
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:18,868
So you should've cared more while they were still with you.

275
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:21,069
Having lingering feelings...

276
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:23,337
isn't just bad for you. It can also be hurtful...

277
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:26,079
to the other person.

278
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,978
You should spend that time investing in yourself instead.

279
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:34,249
She's right. There's no need to beg for love...

280
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:36,918
from someone who no longer loves you.

281
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,394
There's a saying, "Know when your time is up."

282
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:44,265
I think now is the time to face that ending.

283
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,728
It takes courage to accept a breakup.

284
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:52,938
If you could stop things as you want,

285
00:21:53,568 --> 00:21:55,438
things would be so easy.

286
00:22:00,939 --> 00:22:02,584
Hi, my daughter.

287
00:22:02,608 --> 00:22:04,384
Did you have a good time in Sokcho?

288
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,819
Yes, Mom.

289
00:22:05,848 --> 00:22:08,089
Should we eat together?

290
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:13,759
I'm eating mandu soup a lot these days.

291
00:22:14,318 --> 00:22:16,859
I didn't know you liked mandu soup too.

292
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,597
I don't,

293
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:21,599
but my husband and daughter used to be mandu soup lovers.

294
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,374
I would only drink water.

295
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,239
Oh, do you mean So Jin?

296
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,039
Do you know So Jin?

297
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:31,638
I met her through Yeon Woo.

298
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,877
A while ago, I whined to you...

299
00:22:33,878 --> 00:22:36,878
about something related to Yeon Woo.

300
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:41,989
About how Yeon Woo liked someone other than me.

301
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:47,718
Do you love him?

302
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,935
I know I shouldn't,

303
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:52,735
but I want him.

304
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,599
That's my daughter.

305
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:58,468
Whether you take him or throw him away, you choose.

306
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,368
So that woman is So Jin?

307
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,978
Are they dating?

308
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:09,408
They've broken up.

309
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:11,178
I see.

310
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,294
Why did they break up?

311
00:23:13,318 --> 00:23:14,678
Well...

312
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:17,624
They feel very different.

313
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,634
Yeon Woo is very independent.

314
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:22,735
When he encounters a problem while dating,

315
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,005
he tends to avoid the relationship.

316
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,269
On the other hand, So Jin is dependent on her relationships.

317
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,867
It's as if she needed more affection.

318
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,299
She gets very worried and anxious.

319
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:41,137
Yeon Woo must've been attracted to So Jin...

320
00:23:41,138 --> 00:23:43,708
because she was strange, right?

321
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:47,148
Maybe he mistook strangeness for something unique.

322
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:50,788
Mom. It must be hard to forget...

323
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:53,789
a strange boyfriend or girlfriend, right?

324
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:57,359
It's not because someone's strange.

325
00:23:57,588 --> 00:23:59,799
It's hard to forget someone when you like them a lot.

326
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,638
Right.

327
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:13,808
(Sim General Hospital)

328
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,279
Yes, Auntie.

329
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:19,079
I bought the ticket this morning.

330
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,789
Yes.

331
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:25,418
Me, another doctor,

332
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,789
and a nurse will be there, so don't worry too much.

333
00:24:31,898 --> 00:24:33,259
Yes.

334
00:24:34,668 --> 00:24:35,999
Okay.

335
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:42,739
The US?

336
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,708
Yes. Well...

337
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:48,579
Things just turned out that way.

338
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,425
I think it would be best for my mom too.

339
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:52,978
I see.

340
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,824
If so, you could go for about a year.

341
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:59,589
You don't need to quit your job at the hospital, Yeon Woo.

342
00:25:01,118 --> 00:25:02,658
I want you...

343
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,158
to run the hospital, Mr. Park.

344
00:25:06,628 --> 00:25:10,829
You were with us since we first opened this hospital.

345
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:13,715
Please do this for me.

346
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,069
Oh, my.

347
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:26,518
Yeon Woo. I just heard from Section Chief Park...

348
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,289
that you were quitting.

349
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:35,188
I guess it makes it easy to have you all here together.

350
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:39,475
Section Chief Park of the paediatric unit...

351
00:25:39,499 --> 00:25:42,499
will be the hospital director.

352
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,298
Doctor Sim.

353
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,897
Thank you for everything.

354
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:48,238
There are so many expecting moms...

355
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:51,508
who want you to deliver their babies after hearing about Ms. Yoo Young A.

356
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:54,137
I'm sure Mr. Park will hire someone even better than me.

357
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:56,548
Have you already decided which hospital you'll go to?

358
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:57,907
You said you had a school friend...

359
00:25:57,908 --> 00:26:00,218
who was very successful in opening a hospital in the US.

360
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:02,094
Are you going to that hospital?

361
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:04,819
If so, when will you come back to Korea?

362
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:08,558
I'm so excited about handing in my resignation right now,

363
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,489
so I'm going to think about when to come back later.

364
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,928
Anyway, we can talk more later.

365
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:15,998
We should get ready for our afternoon appointments.

366
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,599
Okay. Let's go.

367
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,948
You could've at least discussed it with me.

368
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:39,157
How can I discuss it with someone hurting from love?

369
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,887
Who is going to give me dating advice now?

370
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:43,334
I have the perfect person.

371
00:26:43,358 --> 00:26:45,397
A columnist named Jang Mi Eun.

372
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:47,158
I'll introduce you to her before I go.

373
00:26:47,358 --> 00:26:48,597
Take me with you.

374
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,515
Dating in Korea is too tough for DINKs like me.

375
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:55,015
You're going to cry every day because you miss Sung Mi.

376
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,844
I'm tearing up again.

377
00:26:56,868 --> 00:26:59,408
Come on. Don't be like that.

378
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,878
I'm not going to cry, you cold, ruthless person.

379
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:06,218
Did you tell Kang Hoon?

380
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,789
No, net yet. I should soon.

381
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,819
All right.

382
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,459
(Seoul Fire Services)

383
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,269
(Yeon Woo)

384
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:28,468
Hey, Yeon Woo.

385
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:31,938
I'm in front of the fire station. Can we meet for a second?

386
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,708
You're in front of the fire station?

387
00:27:36,078 --> 00:27:37,378
Mi Eun.

388
00:27:37,608 --> 00:27:40,177
If you have time today, do you want to have dinner together?

389
00:27:40,178 --> 00:27:41,449
(Jang Mi Eun)

390
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:47,218
How about the restaurant in Namsan Observatory?

391
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:49,235
It's where we first met.

392
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:50,559
Do you remember?

393
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:01,368
Yeon Woo.

394
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:07,938
Kang Hoon.

395
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:11,648
I'm going to the US.

396
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,618
What? The US?

397
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,618
For how long?

398
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,718
I don't know yet.

399
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:25,398
Come to the restaurant later. Let's have a drink.

400
00:28:26,128 --> 00:28:28,644
I appreciate the thought, but I'm a bit busy.

401
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:31,668
I have to hand over my work because I'm leaving so soon.

402
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,569
Yeon Woo.

403
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,769
Tell your father hi for me.

404
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:37,314
Be happy and healthy.

405
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,678
And...

406
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,208
So Jin...

407
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:44,178
Take good care of her.

408
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,448
Yeon Woo. Did you...

409
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,228
get some sort of flowerpot?

410
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:57,558
A flowerpot?

411
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,359
About your mother.

412
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,728
The real culprit may be someone else.

413
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,468
- What? - I'll let you know when I'm sure.

414
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:08,908
It's always like this.

415
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:12,809
When I like someone, they always leave me.

416
00:29:13,678 --> 00:29:15,178
Seriously.

417
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,607
You don't seem to have...

418
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:18,995
the best luck with dating.

419
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:22,519
I heard people like that are destined to be single forever.

420
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,688
Take that back now.

421
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:26,458
I'm just worried, that's all.

422
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:29,988
Doctor Yeo Jung Tam. What do you think about him?

423
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:31,657
Try and see what happens.

424
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:33,058
Yeo Jung Tam?

425
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,567
You go after Jung Tam.

426
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,529
I'm not interested in Doctor Yeo either.

427
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,938
I miss him.

428
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:42,515
Going to the US isn't a big deal.

429
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,309
If you miss him, you can go and see him.

430
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,077
If you save time on sleep,

431
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,478
you can go to the US even over a weekend.

432
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,309
We live in a modern world.

433
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:53,755
That's true.

434
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:55,148
Right?

435
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:01,489
Yeon Woo.

436
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,499
The traffic was bad, wasn't it?

437
00:30:07,158 --> 00:30:08,529
A bit.

438
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,569
Did you wait for long?

439
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,299
A bit.

440
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:16,668
This reminds me of that day.

441
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:18,468
That day?

442
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:23,607
(4 years ago)

443
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,819
- How many of you are there? - One.

444
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,519
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

445
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:13,857
Can I sit?

446
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:15,158
Go ahead.

447
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,609
I saw you at the aquarium.

448
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:26,177
Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Mi Eun.

449
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:27,678
I'm Sim Yeon Woo.

450
00:31:40,719 --> 00:31:43,888
Coming here really brings back old memories.

451
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:48,898
Why did you suddenly ask to see me here?

452
00:31:49,428 --> 00:31:51,698
Is something wrong?

453
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,739
I'm going to quit my job at the hospital...

454
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:55,839
and leave Korea.

455
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,708
- What? - I'm going to go to the US.

456
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,938
Suddenly? Why?

457
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:05,749
I want to take this chance to cool my head.

458
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,918
I thought a lot...

459
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:15,458
about what you said the other day.

460
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:17,089
And...

461
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,829
I went to So Jin...

462
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:22,668
and asked her to start over.

463
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:26,499
But I was rejected.

464
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:29,408
She was so stern.

465
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:32,309
If the guy by her side wasn't Kang Hoon,

466
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:36,249
I would've continued to try.

467
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:39,918
But...

468
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:42,249
why?

469
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:46,559
I've concluded...

470
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:51,529
that giving up is the way for me to prove my love.

471
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,099
Giving up?

472
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:55,829
If me going away...

473
00:32:56,029 --> 00:32:59,069
can make So Jin happy,

474
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:03,868
I'll do so.

475
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:09,049
How about you?

476
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:11,509
Will you be okay?

477
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:18,489
Let's go together.

478
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:22,688
- What? - I want to go with you.

479
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,658
- Mi Eun. - I love you.

480
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,475
I prove my love by not giving up.

481
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:30,569
Until you start yelling because you're tired of me,

482
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:33,039
I'm going to stay by your side.

483
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:36,839
That's the only way I can give up on you. How else could I?

484
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:42,748
You shook up my philosophy on relationships...

485
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:45,049
and changed my life.

486
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:55,728
Won't you give me a chance?

487
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,088
- No. - What about understanding?

488
00:33:57,089 --> 00:33:59,705
I don't want to see someone get hurt because of me ever again.

489
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:01,029
I...

490
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:07,114
I'm already hurting.

491
00:34:07,138 --> 00:34:09,409
I want to see you for a long time.

492
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,378
You're the only person...

493
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,648
and friend who understands me.

494
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:30,889
That really hurts.

495
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,219
I finally said it.

496
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:16,069
Mi Eun.

497
00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:21,779
Use this.

498
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:24,648
Kang Hoon.

499
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:30,188
Why do you always show up wherever I am?

500
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:31,589
Why?

501
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:35,119
Do you know that your house is on my way home from work?

502
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,297
Is something wrong?

503
00:35:40,298 --> 00:35:41,799
Nothing's wrong.

504
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:44,098
You can go.

505
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:47,038
I'll take you home.

506
00:35:48,198 --> 00:35:50,069
Do as you want.

507
00:35:50,368 --> 00:35:53,808
That's alcohol dependence. That'll turn into an addiction.

508
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:57,109
Do you know how many times I've seen you drunk?

509
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:01,018
If you knew how much an appropriate amount of alcohol...

510
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,318
contributed to the progress of art and science,

511
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:05,265
you'll be so surprised.

512
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,719
Oh, it stopped raining.

513
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,088
Oh, it did.

514
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,504
- Do you want another drink? - Yes.

515
00:36:10,528 --> 00:36:11,858
See?

516
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:14,535
You're addicted to alcohol. Art and science, my foot.

517
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:16,605
What? Were you teasing me just now?

518
00:36:16,629 --> 00:36:19,799
I don't know if you're an addict or if you're just weak.

519
00:36:39,459 --> 00:36:40,759
So Jin.

520
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:45,429
So Jin. It's me, Kang Hoon.

521
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,299
Are you okay?

522
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,828
Oh, gosh.

523
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:55,969
You dummy.

524
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:59,308
It does no good to just hold the stick like this.

525
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:00,609
Look, So Jin.

526
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:02,577
You're walking down the street,

527
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:05,518
and suddenly, you feel someone's gaze on you.

528
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,177
Then you whip out the stick right away.

529
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:10,824
If he's really there before you,

530
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:12,818
you say, "You punk."

531
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,389
No. I'm supposed to be you.

532
00:37:16,888 --> 00:37:19,498
"You punk. I'm going to break every bone in your body."

533
00:37:19,499 --> 00:37:21,128
"Unless you have a death wish, get out of my face!"

534
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,898
Say that. Okay?

535
00:37:22,899 --> 00:37:25,469
If he still doesn't leave,

536
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:27,898
then right away...

537
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,038
Bam!

538
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:32,268
Bam!

539
00:37:35,548 --> 00:37:38,179
- Okay? - Okay.

540
00:37:41,649 --> 00:37:43,518
You really scared me.

541
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,018
Sorry. Here.

542
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:47,958
- Let's go. - Okay.

543
00:37:47,988 --> 00:37:49,288
What do you do?

544
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:51,359
- Bam. - There you go. And then?

545
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:54,498
There you go. Like this.

546
00:38:00,638 --> 00:38:02,239
Like this?

547
00:38:02,368 --> 00:38:03,685
There you go.

548
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:06,609

624

On top of that, they wrote my name as the sender.

626

your parents' incident and So Jin's incident...

629
00:44:46,801 --> 00:44:48,440
might be connected.

632
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,610
the culprit is a meticulous planner.

633
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:57,909

660

668

00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:52,228
- Father. - You're back.

734
00:55:01,606 --> 00:55:04,315
Hey, what is it?

735
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:05,975
Gosh...

736
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:16,256
Father.

737
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:18,654
Where did you get this plant from?

738
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:21,326
A customer gave it to me as a gift.

739
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:24,196
- When? - Just now.

740
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,006
Excuse me!

741
00:55:33,402 --> 00:55:34,471
(Always Sushi)

742
00:56:17,793 --> 00:56:19,054
(Andrea)

743
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,125
(Haeoreum Catholic Church)

744
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,585
Haeoreum Catholic Church.

745
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:30,535
"Just as the Father knows me..."

746
00:56:30,796 --> 00:56:33,366
"and I know the Father,"

747
00:56:35,235 --> 00:56:38,776
"and I lay down my life for the sheep."

748
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:44,975
"I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen."

749
00:56:45,416 --> 00:56:49,015
"I must bring them also."

750
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:54,855
"They too will listen to my voice,"

751
00:56:55,086 --> 00:56:57,056
"and there shall be one flock..."

752
00:56:57,195 --> 00:57:00,196
Father Andrea's mass is at 7pm.

753
00:57:02,235 --> 00:57:03,335
(Haeoreum Catholic Church)

754
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,855
(7:25pm)

755
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:09,306
I saw him a bit after seven in front of our restaurant.

756
00:57:10,106 --> 00:57:12,375
"No one takes it from me..."

757
00:57:12,376 --> 00:57:13,904
But the mass started at 7pm.

758
00:57:13,905 --> 00:57:16,105
"But I lay it down of my own accord."

759
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:18,514
- "Jews who heard these words..." - Excuse me.

760
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:19,944
"were again divided."

761
00:57:19,945 --> 00:57:21,484
I came in a little late, so I'm asking.

762
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:23,732
Did the mass start on time?

763
00:57:23,756 --> 00:57:26,955
No. The priest had a personal affair to take care of.

764
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:28,525
It just started.

765
00:57:28,526 --> 00:57:30,696
I see. Thank you.

766
00:57:31,655 --> 00:57:35,395
"Only to take it up again."

767
00:57:36,226 --> 00:57:38,835
"I have authority to lay it down..."

768
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:41,105
"and authority to take it up again."

769
00:57:42,106 --> 00:57:45,252
"This is the command I received..."

770
00:57:45,276 --> 00:57:47,745
"from my Father.”

771
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:07,966
Who are you?

772
00:58:08,865 --> 00:58:10,596
Can I help you?

773
00:58:10,996 --> 00:58:14,134
Kang Hoon, what brought you here?

774
00:58:14,135 --> 00:58:16,651
Enough with the act. Just answer my question.

775
00:58:16,675 --> 00:58:19,875
I said, who are you?

776
00:58:20,075 --> 00:58:22,122
What are you scheming?

777
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:24,546
What are you talking about?

778
00:58:27,316 --> 00:58:29,085
Why did you just leave...

779
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:31,585
that grass tree plant at our restaurant?

780
00:58:31,785 --> 00:58:34,386
Why? To harm my father?

781
00:58:34,485 --> 00:58:35,525
Or me?

782
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:38,926
Kang Hoon, what's wrong with you?

783
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,764
I went to the greenhouse where the grass trees...

784
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:47,765
behind all the fire accidents were grown.

785
00:58:47,865 --> 00:58:49,736
And there, I found his bible.

786
00:58:51,206 --> 00:58:54,105
There were pictures of the people he's killed so far,

787
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:57,546
and the people he was planning to kill soon.

788
00:59:01,686 --> 00:59:03,915
I'm not sure what's going on,

789
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:06,484
but please calm down.

790
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,525
It sounds like a misunderstanding.

791
00:59:08,526 --> 00:59:11,625
Father Andrea was with me all day long.

792
00:59:11,626 --> 00:59:13,194
He wasn't feeling well,

793
00:59:13,195 --> 00:59:15,426
so the mass started late.

794
00:59:15,865 --> 00:59:17,571
All that aside,

795
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:20,682
why would he scheme such a thing?

796
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:23,435
That's what I mean. He should have the answer to that.

797
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:25,182
What is it that you want?

798
00:59:25,206 --> 00:59:29,076
Why are you circling around us and killing people?

799
00:59:38,055 --> 00:59:40,285
Why are the lights off?

800
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:43,926
What is this?

801
00:59:46,865 --> 00:59:48,665
It looks like someone broke them.

802
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:10,919
Mom.

803
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:14,088
I'll pay them back for you,

804
01:00:15,228 --> 01:00:17,698
so make sure you watch from where you are.

805
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:19,599
You'll be smiling in no time.

806
01:00:21,128 --> 01:00:23,238
Father Andrea, are you all right?

807
01:00:23,239 --> 01:00:25,175
- What's wrong? - We must stop it.

808
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:26,939
If we don't,

809
01:00:27,338 --> 01:00:29,269
there will be another fire,

810
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:31,178
and someone else will die.

(Han So Jin)

813
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:53,698
(I'm in front of your work. Let's meet for a minute.)

814
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:55,129
I'm not a thief.

815
01:00:55,969 --> 01:00:59,238
You're the thief. You stole my happiness.

816
01:00:59,398 --> 01:01:02,539
I'll steal everything of yours so that you're left with nothing.

817
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:04,979
Han So Jin.

(DNA Lover)

819
01:01:54,588 --> 01:01:56,829
If you want to save her, come alone.

820
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:00,698
Meet me where we met for the first time.

821
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:03,129
"Where we met for the first time?"

822
01:02:04,568 --> 01:02:06,068
They're twins?

823
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:07,838
Then who did I see?

824
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:10,109
Let's report both of them to the police.

825
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:12,979
So Jin...

826
01:02:13,608 --> 01:02:15,048
She's in danger.

827
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:16,979
There's no time.

828
01:02:17,748 --> 01:02:19,379
A fire will start soon.

829
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,019
So Jin!

830
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,129
I'll put everything back in place.

831
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:29,088
Let's get out of here alive.
