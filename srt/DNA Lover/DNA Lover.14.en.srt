with my DNA Lover Theory.

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm worried that was the last time with you in my life...

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,769
and that I may have let that slip away.

43
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,139

58
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,649
I've never once believed in it in my entire life,

59
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,360

But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

63
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:04,240
was all wrong.

64
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:09,938

If the person who received the plant waters it,

83
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,939
it would explode like that.

84
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,279
Then, the explosion would lead to a fire.

85

86
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,250

I'm not sure about that,

but it's a rare species, so I'm sure not many places carry it.

110

The grass tree is an imported plant from Australia,

111

Well, I'll send you that tomorrow.

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,628
I think you two make such a great couple...

185
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,789
Have some of this.

186
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,469
Vice Director, I'll take good care of you until the end today.

187
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,239
- Drink as much as you want. - Thanks.

188
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,869
Have some food too.

189
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,469
- Oh, I like kiwis, though. - Kiwis.

190
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,470
Anyway, you all worked hard today, everyone.

191
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,778
- Cheers. - Cheers.

192
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,379
- Cheers. - Let's go.

193
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,178
Vice Director, you usually pace yourself well when you drink.

194
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,789
But you're drinking quite a lot today.

195
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,019
I know.

196
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,559
I'll get going first.

197
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,059
- I will... - Hey.

198
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,128
- Should I go... - It's fine.

199
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:21,169
- I was going to take care of... - It's fine.

200
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,330
He hates showing people how he is when he's drunk.

201
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:36,480
Sir, we've arrived.

202
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,549
Where are we?

203
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,559
I drove to the address you gave me earlier.

204
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,888
I asked to come here?

205
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,929
Yes.

206
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:01,869
Cheongdam-dong... I mean...

207
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,909
What?

208
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,779
Hang on.

209
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,120
Let's go now.

210
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,529
What?

211
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,500
What do you think of me?

212
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Come on. Seriously.

213
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,538
That hurts.

214
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,340
Stop it. Seriously.

215
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,039
You're due soon. Take care of yourself until you give birth.

216
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,840
I'll see you next week.

217
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,668
- Thank you. - Get home safely.

218
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,440
Please come this way.

219
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,210
Let's hold hands.

220
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,549
I want to do so.

221
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,820
We can't communicate telepathically.

222
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,649
How did you find me?

223
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:03,059
Are you okay?

224
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:07,059
But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

225
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,430
was all wrong.

226
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,569
So, I think this might be what real love is.

227
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,380
So Jin, I...

228
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,490
If you really love So Jin, let her go. That's love too.

229
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,400
(Seoul Fire Services)

230
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,329
Jung Tam!

231
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,470
What brings you here without calling ahead?

232
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,880
Sung Mi, do you want to go eat macarons?

233
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,808
Oh, okay.

234
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:55,049
- Have some. - Okay.

235
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,660
This macaron place...

236
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:12,900
was the place where we first communicated telepathically.

237
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,569
Because you weren't coming to the gym,

238
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,200
I sent you a message via telepathy as if I was praying.

239
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,838
- Dr. Yeo! - Sung Mi!

240
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,309
Then, I ran into you again here by chance.

241
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,539
Really?

242
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,809
Someone said that if you can communicate via telepathy,

243
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,319
you're each other's DNA lover.

244
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,150
- DNA lover? - Yes.

245
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:38,789
Oh, DNA lovers are fated from the moment you're born.

246
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,859
I don't know about fate,

247
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,700
but I don't think I'll ever meet...

248
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,740
another man who cherishes me so much...

249
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,640
like you do.

250
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,690
So, Sung Mi.

251
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:12,259
Yes?

252
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,660
I'm unable to have kids.

253
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,470
Pardon?

254
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,869
Well...

255
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,140
I'm sterile.

256
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,180
What...

257
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,390
Sterile...

258
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,259
You're sterile?

259
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,859
Well...

260
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,430
I don't know about anything else,

261
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,700
but as you said before,

262
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,839
I can love you and only you for the rest of my life.

263
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,809
Wouldn't that be enough?

264
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,279
Oh, these days,

265
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,349
there are many people who live a happy life as just a couple.

266
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,160
Or...

267
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,289
some people raise pets as if they're children...

268
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,730
Well...

269
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,670
I think I'm going to need...

270
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,079
some time to think, Jung Tam.

271
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,279
- Right... - Excuse me.

272
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,619
So, when...

273
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,690
When you're done thinking, you'll call me, right?

274
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,059
How can you be so one-sided?

275
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,430
You confessed to her that you still loved her even after breaking up?

276
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,730
That's no different from what a stalker would do.

277
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,839
Breakups must be safe.

278
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,268
Please don't torment the woman you once loved.

279
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,509
So you should've cared more while they were still with you.

280
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,710
Having lingering feelings...

281
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:50,278
isn't just bad for you. It can also be hurtful...

282
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,720
to the other person.

283
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,619
You should spend that time investing in yourself instead.

284
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,890
She's right. There's no need to beg for love...

285
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,559
from someone who no longer loves you.

286
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,200
There's a saying, "Know when your time is up."

287
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,130
I think now is the time to face that ending.

288
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,369
It takes courage to accept a breakup.

289
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,579
If you could stop things as you want,

290
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,079
things would be so easy.

291
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,319
Hi, my daughter.

292
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,190
Did you have a good time in Sokcho?

293
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:32,460
Yes, Mom.

294
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,730
Should we eat together?

295
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm eating mandu soup a lot these days.

296
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,500
I didn't know you liked mandu soup too.

297
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,538
I don't,

298
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,240
but my husband and daughter used to be mandu soup lovers.

299
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,140
I would only drink water.

300
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,880
Oh, do you mean So Jin?

301
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
Do you know So Jin?

302
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,279
I met her through Yeon Woo.

303
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,818
A while ago, I whined to you...

304
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:03,519
about something related to Yeon Woo.

305
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,630
About how Yeon Woo liked someone other than me.

306
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,659
Do you love him?

307
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,599
I know I shouldn't,

308
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,440
but I want him.

309
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,240
That's my daughter.

310
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:25,109
Whether you take him or throw him away, you choose.

311
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,009
So that woman is So Jin?

312
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,619
Are they dating?

313
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,049
They've broken up.

314
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,819
I see.

315
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,160
Why did they break up?

316
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:41,319
Well...

317
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,329
They feel very different.

318
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,299
Yeon Woo is very independent.

319
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,599
When he encounters a problem while dating,

320
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,869
he tends to avoid the relationship.

321
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,910
On the other hand, So Jin is dependent on her relationships.

322
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,808
It's as if she needed more affection.

323
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,940
She gets very worried and anxious.

324
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,078
Yeon Woo must've been attracted to So Jin...

325
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,349
because she was strange, right?

326
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,789
Maybe he mistook strangeness for something unique.

327
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,729
Mom. It must be hard to forget...

328
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,430
a strange boyfriend or girlfriend, right?

329
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,000
It's not because someone's strange.

330
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,440
It's hard to forget someone when you like them a lot.

331
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,279
Right.

332
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,749
(Sim General Hospital)

333
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,920
Yes, Auntie.

334
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,720
I bought the ticket this morning.

335
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,430
Yes.

336
00:24:49,829 --> 00:24:52,059
Me, another doctor,

337
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,430
and a nurse will be there, so don't worry too much.

338
00:24:58,839 --> 00:24:59,900
Yes.

339
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:02,640
Okay.

340
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,380
The US?

341
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,349
Yes. Well...

342
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,220
Things just turned out that way.

343
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,089
I think it would be best for my mom too.

344
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,919
I see.

345
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,690
If so, you could go for about a year.

346
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:26,230
You don't need to quit your job at the hospital, Yeon Woo.

347
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,299
I want you...

348
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,799
to run the hospital, Mr. Park.

349
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:37,470
You were with us since we first opened this hospital.

350
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,380
Please do this for me.

351
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,710
Oh, my.

352
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,459
Yeon Woo. I just heard from Section Chief Park...

353
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,930
that you were quitting.

354
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,829
I guess it makes it easy to have you all here together.

355
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:06,140
Section Chief Park of the pediatric unit...

356
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,140
will be the hospital director.

357
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,239
Doctor Sim.

358
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,838
Thank you for everything.

359
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,179
There are so many expecting moms...

360
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,449
who want you to deliver their babies after hearing about Ms. Yoo Young A.

361
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,078
I'm sure Mr. Park will hire someone even better than me.

362
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,489
Have you already decided which hospital you'll go to?

363
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,848
You said you had a school friend...

364
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:26,859
who was very successful in opening a hospital in the US.

365
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,960
Are you going to that hospital?

366
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,460
If so, when will you come back to Korea?

367
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,499
I'm so excited about handing in my resignation right now,

368
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,130
so I'm going to think about when to come back later.

369
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,569
Anyway, we can talk more later.

370
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,939
We should get ready for our afternoon appointments.

371
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,240
Okay. Let's go.

372
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,889
You could've at least discussed it with me.

373
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,098
How can I discuss it with someone hurting from love?

374
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:08,828
Who is going to give me dating advice now?

375
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:10,029
I have the perfect person.

376
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,338
A columnist named Jang Mi Eun.

377
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,799
I'll introduce you to her before I go.

378
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,538
Take me with you.

379
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,380
Dating in Korea is too tough for DINKs like me.

380
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,680
You're going to cry every day because you miss Sung Mi.

381
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,609
I'm tearing up again.

382
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,049
Come on. Don't be like that.

383
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,519
I'm not going to cry, you cold, ruthless person.

384
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,859
Did you tell Kang Hoon?

385
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,430
No, net yet. I should soon.

386
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
All right.

387
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,400
(Seoul Fire Services)

388
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,210
(Yeon Woo)

389
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,409
Hey, Yeon Woo.

390
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,579
I'm in front of the fire station. Can we meet for a second?

391
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,349
You're in front of the fire station?

392
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,019
Mi Eun.

393
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,118
If you have time today, do you want to have dinner together?

394
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,390
(Jang Mi Eun)

395
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,859
How about the restaurant in Namsan Observatory?

396
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,069
It's where we first met.

397
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Do you remember?

398
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,009
Yeon Woo.

399
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,579
Kang Hoon.

400
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,289
I'm going to the US.

401
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,259
What? The US?

402
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,259
For how long?

403
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,359
I don't know yet.

404
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,039
Come to the restaurant later. Let's have a drink.

405
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:55,509
I appreciate the thought, but I'm a bit busy.

406
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,309
I have to hand over my work because I'm leaving so soon.

407
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,210
Yeon Woo.

408
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,410
Tell your father hi for me.

409
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:04,009
Be happy and healthy.

410
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,319
And...

411
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:07,849
So Jin...

412
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,819
Take good care of her.

413
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,089
Yeon Woo. Did you...

414
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,869
get some sort of flowerpot?

415
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,499
A flowerpot?

416
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,000
About your mother.

417
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,369
The real culprit may be someone else.

418
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,109
- What? - I'll let you know when I'm sure.

419
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,549
It's always like this.

420
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,450
When I like someone, they always leave me.

421
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:41,819
Seriously.

422
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,548
You don't seem to have...

423
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,720
the best luck with dating.

424
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,160
I heard people like that are destined to be single forever.

425
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,629
Take that back now.

426
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,099
I'm just worried, that's all.

427
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:56,929
Doctor Yeo Jung Tam. What do you think about him?

428
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,598
Try and see what happens.

429
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,999
Yeo Jung Tam?

430
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,508
You go after Jung Tam.

431
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,170
I'm not interested in Doctor Yeo either.

432
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,579
I miss him.

433
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,380
Going to the US isn't a big deal.

434
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,950
If you miss him, you can go and see him.

435
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,018
If you save time on sleep,

436
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,119
you can go to the US even over a weekend.

437
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,950
We live in a modern world.

438
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,519
That's true.

439
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,789
Right?

440
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,130
Yeon Woo.

441
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,140
The traffic was bad, wasn't it?

442
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,170
A bit.

443
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:37,210
Did you wait for long?

444
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
A bit.

445
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,309
This reminds me of that day.

446
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:45,109
That day?

447
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:50,548
(4 years ago)

448
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,460
- How many of you are there? - One.

449
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,160
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

450
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:40,798
Can I sit?

451
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,799
Go ahead.

452
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,250
I saw you at the aquarium.

453
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,118
Nice to meet you. I'm Jang Mi Eun.

454
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,319
I'm Sim Yeon Woo.

455
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,529
Coming here really brings back old memories.

456
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,539
Why did you suddenly ask to see me here?

457
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,339
Is something wrong?

458
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,380
I'm going to quit my job at the hospital...

459
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,480
and leave Korea.

460
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,349
- What? - I'm going to go to the US.

461
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,579
Suddenly? Why?

462
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,390
I want to take this chance to cool my head.

463
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,559
I thought a lot...

464
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:42,099
about what you said the other day.

465
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,730
And...

466
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,470
I went to So Jin...

467
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,309
and asked her to start over.

468
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:53,140
But I was rejected.

469
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,049
She was so stern.

470
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,950
If the guy by her side wasn't Kang Hoon,

471
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,890
I would've continued to try.

472
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,559
But...

473
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:08,890
why?

474
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
I've concluded...

475
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,170
that giving up is the way for me to prove my love.

476
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Giving up?

477
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,470
If me going away...

478
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,710
can make So Jin happy,

479
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,509
I'll do so.

480
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,690
How about you?

481
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,150
Will you be okay?

482
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,130
Let's go together.

483
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:49,329
- What? - I want to go with you.

484
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,299
- Mi Eun. - I love you.

485
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:54,200
I prove my love by not giving up.

486
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,210
Until you start yelling because you're tired of me,

487
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,680
I'm going to stay by your side.

488
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,480
That's the only way I can give up on you. How else could I?

489
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,389
You shook up my philosophy on relationships...

490
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,690
and changed my life.

491
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,669
Won't you give me a chance?

492
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,029
- No. - What about understanding?

493
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,570
I don't want to see someone get hurt because of me ever again.

494
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,670
I...

495
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,940
I'm already hurting.

496
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,050
I want to see you for a long time.

497
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,019
You're the only person...

498
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,289
and friend who understands me.

499
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:57,530
That really hurts.

500
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,860
I finally said it.

501
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,710
Mi Eun.

502
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,420
Use this.

503
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:51,289
Kang Hoon.

504
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,829
Why do you always show up wherever I am?

505
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,530
Why?

506
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,760
Do you know that your house is on my way home from work?

507
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,238
Is something wrong?

508
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,440
Nothing's wrong.

509
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,739
You can go.

510
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,679
I'll take you home.

511
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,710
Do as you want.

512
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,449
That's alcohol dependence. That'll turn into an addiction.

513
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,750
Do you know how many times I've seen you drunk?

514
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,959
If you knew how much an appropriate amount of alcohol...

515
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,259
contributed to the progress of art and science,

516
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,059
you'll be so surprised.

517
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,360
Oh, it stopped raining.

518
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,029
Oh, it did.

519
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,230
- Do you want another drink? - Yes.

520
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:38,799
See?

521
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,400
You're addicted to alcohol. Art and science, my foot.

522
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,469
What? Were you teasing me just now?

523
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,440
I don't know if you're an addict or if you're just weak.

524
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
So Jin.

525
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,070
So Jin. It's me, Kang Hoon.

526
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,940
Are you okay?

527
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,469
Oh, gosh.

528
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,610
You dummy.

529
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,249
It does no good to just hold the stick like this.

530
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,250
Look, So Jin.

531
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,518
You're walking down the street,

532
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:32,459
and suddenly, you feel someone's gaze on you.

533
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,118
Then you whip out the stick right away.

534
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,530
If he's really there before you,

535
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,759
you say, "You punk."

536
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,030
No. I'm supposed to be you.

537
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:46,439
"You punk. I'm going to break every bone in your body."

538
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,069
"Unless you have a death wish, get out of my face!"

539
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,839
Say that. Okay?

540
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,110
If he still doesn't leave,

541
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,839
then right away...

542
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,679
Bam!

543
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,909
Bam!

544
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,820
- Okay? - Okay.

545
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,459
You really scared me.

546
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,659
Sorry. Here.

547
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,599

I thought she'd have a good life,

733
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:43,819
but when her adoptive parents gave her up,

734
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,949
she set their house on fire.

735
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,989
Ever since then, she committed serial arson.

736
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:54,429
Where is she right now?

737
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,929
I mean, Andrea's twin.

738
00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:19,119
- Father. - You're back.

739
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,269
Hey, what is it?

740
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:32,929
Gosh...

741
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:43,210
Father.

742
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,908
Where did you get this plant from?

743
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,280
A customer gave it to me as a gift.

744
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,150
- When? - Just now.

745
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,960
Excuse me!

746
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,929
(Always Sushi)

747
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,308
(Andrea)

749
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,539
Haeoreum Catholic Church.

750
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,489
"Just as the Father knows me..."

751
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,320
"and I know the Father,"

752
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:05,730
"and I lay down my life for the sheep."

753
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,929
"I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen."

754
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,969
"I must bring them also."

755
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:21,809
"They too will listen to my voice,"

756
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,010
"and there shall be one flock..."

757
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:27,150
Father Andrea's mass is at 7pm.

758
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:30,589
(Haeoreum Catholic Church)

759
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,289
(7:25pm)

760
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:36,260
I saw him a bit after seven in front of our restaurant.

761
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,629
"No one takes it from me..."

762
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,158
But the mass started at 7pm.

763
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:43,059
"But I lay it down of my own accord."

764
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:45,768
- "Jews who heard these words..." - Excuse me.

765
00:57:45,769 --> 00:57:47,198
"were again divided."

766
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:48,738
I came in a little late, so I'm asking.

767
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:50,909
Did the mass start on time?

768
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:54,209
No. The priest had a personal affair to take care of.

769
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,779
It just started.

770
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,650
I see. Thank you.

771
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:02,349
"Only to take it up again."

772
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,089
"I have authority to lay it down..."

773
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,059
"and authority to take it up again."

774
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,230
"This is the command I received..."

775
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:14,699
"from my Father.”

776
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:34,920
Who are you?

777
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:37,550
Can I help you?

778
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:41,388
Kang Hoon, what brought you here?

779
00:58:41,389 --> 00:58:43,690
Enough with the act. Just answer my question.

780
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:46,829
I said, who are you?

781
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:49,300
What are you scheming?

782
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,500
What are you talking about?

783
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:56,339
Why did you just leave...

784
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,539
that grass tree plant at our restaurant?

785
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,340
Why? To harm my father?

786
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:02,779
Or me?

787
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,880
Kang Hoon, what's wrong with you?

788
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:13,018
I went to the greenhouse where the grass trees...

789
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,719
behind all the fire accidents were grown.

790
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,690
And there, I found his bible.

791
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,059
There were pictures of the people he's killed so far,

792
00:59:22,099 --> 00:59:24,500
and the people he was planning to kill soon.

793
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,869
I'm not sure what's going on,

794
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,738
but please calm down.

795
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,779
It sounds like a misunderstanding.

796
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,879
Father Andrea was with me all day long.

797
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,448
He wasn't feeling well,

798
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,380
so the mass started late.

799
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,820
All that aside,

800
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:47,860
why would he scheme such a thing?

801
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,389
That's what I mean. He should have the answer to that.

802
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,159
What is it that you want?

803
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,030
Why are you circling around us and killing people?

804
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:07,239
Why are the lights off?

805
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,880
What is this?

806
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:15,619
It looks like someone broke them.

807
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,070
Mom.

808
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,239
I'll pay them back for you,

809
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:44,849
so make sure you watch from where you are.

810
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:46,750
You'll be smiling in no time.

811
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:50,689
Father Andrea, are you all right?

812
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,389
- What's wrong? - We must stop it.

813
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,090
If we don't,

814
01:00:54,789 --> 01:00:56,420
there will be another fire,

815
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,329
and someone else will die.

818
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:21,149
(I'm in front of your work. Let's meet for a minute.)

819
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,280
I'm not a thief.

820
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,389
You're the thief. You stole my happiness.

821
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,690
I'll steal everything of yours so that you're left with nothing.

822
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,130

(DNA Lover)

824
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,980
If you want to save her, come alone.

825
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,849
Meet me where we met for the first time.

826
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,280
"Where we met for the first time?"

827
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,219
They're twins?

828
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:34,989
Then who did I see?

829
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:37,260
Let's report both of them to the police.

830
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,130
So Jin...

831
01:02:41,059 --> 01:02:42,199
She's in danger.

832
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,130
There's no time.

833
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,530
A fire will start soon.

834
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:51,170
So Jin!

835
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:54,280
I'll put everything back in place.

836
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,239
Let's get out of here alive.
