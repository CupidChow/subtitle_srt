00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,928
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:09,411
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:10,947
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:42,528
If...

5
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:45,569
only I hadn't made that decision back then,

6
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,268
would I have not regretted it?

7
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:59,008
(Episode 13: Regrets)

8
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,154
I said, I don't need you to walk me home.

9
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:02,855
It's just for today.

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,849
I'd feel uneasy otherwise.

11
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:06,819
You're so stubborn.

12
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:08,418
You little...

13
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,588
What do I do? Are you okay? Are you hurt?

14
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,998
- It hurts. - My goodness.

15
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,829
Let's go.

16
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,769
Come on, let's go.

17
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,039
But it's what you always do for me.

18
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,638
You always walk me home,

19
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,209
look after every little thing for me,

20
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:35,019
and always wait right here whenever I'm in need.

21
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:37,819
I realized...

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,989
that you always did all those...

23
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:41,789
for me.

24
00:01:45,128 --> 00:01:48,328
It's nothing new, so what's the big deal?

25
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:49,728
I guess you're right.

26
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,168
I took it for granted.

27
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,208
Thank you,

28
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:03,909
Kang Hoon.

29
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:08,219
I guess...

30
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:10,594
you were really scared today.

31
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:11,918
Of course.

32
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,089
I thought I'd never see you again.

33
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:19,988
I never imagined a life...

34
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:23,159
without you.

35
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,279
That won't ever happen,

36
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:40,649
so don't worry.

37
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:45,789
Was it really because of my oblivion gene?

38
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:50,629
I forgot about Kang Hoon's scent for a while.

39
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:57,999
Kang Hoon promised me sincerely...

40
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:59,798
that he'd never leave my side.

41
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,708
I could truly feel them now.

42
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:07,279
Maybe...

43
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:10,247
(Seo Kang Hoon)

44
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:13,478
it was because I finally found my true DNA lover.

45
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:25,688
It's me.

46
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:28,159
How is Ms. Yoo Young A doing?

47
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,588
She gained consciousness two hours ago.

48
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,228
She just fell asleep.

49
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,187
The baby is also doing okay.

50
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,734
It's under intensive care.

51
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:36,058
I'm glad.

52
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,529
Call me if anything happens.

53
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:42,238
Okay.

54
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,000
(Happiness will surely come.)

55
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,974
I like this one.

56
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:46,127
Would you like to take it with you?

57
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,738
I'll give you my address.

58
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:49,938
Please deliver it there.

59
00:06:02,118 --> 00:06:03,118
(Grass Tree)

60
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:24,108
(Han So Jin)

61
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,620
(Sim Yeon Woo)

62
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,659
She stepped out for a moment.

63
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:43,659
I'll just leave this here then.

64
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,534
A Ri, this is a new menu my father is developing.

65
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:49,275
He told me to deliver it to So Jin.

66
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:51,404
We packed enough for you too.

67
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:52,829
Please share it with her.

68
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,068
Did the chef send me food too?

69
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,914
I'm an expert at reviewing new menus.

70
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:02,038
I'll be bold and honest.

71
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,278
I'll get going.

72
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,484
What? Wait.

73
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,695
Since you're already here, I should offer you some tea.

74
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,789
I have to return the favour for this precious food.

75
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,058
So Jin taught me to have good manners.

76
00:07:15,258 --> 00:07:16,858
It's not necessary,

77
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:19,864
but I'll bug you for some tea.

78
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:21,599
- Sure. - Okay.

79
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,538
(Pheromone)

80
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,077
(Different scents according to personality)

81
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:38,648
(Healer gene)

82
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,149
(Seo Kang Hoon)

83
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,269
Do you like her that much?

84
00:07:58,198 --> 00:08:01,015
Well... Sure. Thank you.

85
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,139
Did you officially confess?

86
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:06,739
- Not yet. - Not yet? Why not?

87
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:10,208
I'll do it when her heart...

88
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,854
has fully healed.

89
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:12,878
Kang Hoon,

90
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,925
this is your opportunity to snatch her!

91
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,364
You'll end up regretting it. Love is all about timing.

92
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,688
No.

93
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,789
I care more about how she feels than how I feel at the moment.

94
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,889
I'll wait until she's okay.

95
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:28,729
I see.

96
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:32,428
When did you two first meet?

97
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,844
I was 7, and she was 11.

98
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:38,968
We met for the first time then.

99
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,308
If that's the case,

100
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:42,608
you might not get butterflies...

101
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:44,685
since you're so used to each other.

102
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,009
That's not true.

103
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,519
I still...

104
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,818
get butterflies, and my heart races.

105
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,989
I hope it's the same for So Jin.

106
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,188
It's okay even if that's not the case now.

107
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,328
Kang Hoon.

108
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,144
I know So Jin's dating history,

109
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,037
and if her heart never raced during the first meeting,

110
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:10,568
it won't ever race.

111
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:13,838
That means her heart rate difference between someone she sees as a man...

112
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,139
and someone she sees as a human is huge.

113
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,749
You need to play hard to get or put her under a spell.

114
00:09:20,048 --> 00:09:21,354
You need to devise a plan.

115
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:24,448
It's the only way to kick Sewer out from her heart...

116
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:27,989
and to secure yourself a spot as her man.

117
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:32,259
Anyway, I'm rooting for you.

118
00:09:46,109 --> 00:09:48,009
- You're here. - Hey.

119
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,254
How's your mother doing?

120
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:55,718
She's doing better.

121
00:09:56,018 --> 00:09:57,665
She looks happier too.

122
00:09:57,689 --> 00:09:59,019
I'm glad.

123
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:12,297
If you're not taking outpatients, how about some fresh air?

124
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,668
It's nice out.

125
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:16,668
- Sure. - I didn't bring my car.

126
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:20,009
I'll drive.

127
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,917
I'm staying quiet,

128
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,889
and I'm even driving for you.

129
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,358
What's with the long face?

130
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,529
Me? That's not true.

131
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,198
It's nice out today.

132
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,474
This won't do.

133
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:47,098
I'll help you change your mood.

134
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:49,369
Here, pick one.

135
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,438
Let's see if this can cheer me up.

136
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:54,609
All right.

137
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:08,519
The engine sounds different in sports mode.

138
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:15,428
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

139
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:21,099
(Seventh: Yeo Jung Tam)

140
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,308
I know you worked the night shift.

141
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,779
Sorry to call you out so early.

142
00:11:33,918 --> 00:11:35,218
It's okay.

143
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,494
If I can be with you,

144
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:40,119
it doesn't matter what time of day it is.

145
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,588
- Is that so? Okay. - Yes.

146
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,374
- Lee Ye Ji? - Yes.

147
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:48,759
Let's go.

148
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:52,027
- What should we eat? - A sausage.

149
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,729
Are you going to eat a sausage only?

150
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,568
Aren't they beautiful?

151
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:03,109
It's exactly what I dream of.

152
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,109
What do you mean?

153
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:10,948
If I ever get married,

154
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,789
I want to have a lot of kids.

155
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:15,588
Three would be nice.

156
00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:17,659
Four would be nice too.

157
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,029
Even five would be okay.

158
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,668
Is that too many?

159
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:29,298
No. That's not it...

160
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:33,109
Yeo Jung Tam!

161
00:12:33,268 --> 00:12:35,208
- Yeo Jung Tam? - That's us.

162
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:44,519
- Aren't you coming? - Coming.

163
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,359
(Mandu)

164
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,509
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

165
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:06,415
The mandu soup here always makes me happy.

166
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,648
This mandu is plump and beautiful.

167
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,778
Look.

168
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,499
Yeon Woo. Sorry for keeping you.

169
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,905
This place looks old. How do you know this place?

170
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,844
Their mandu is plump and beautiful.

171
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:34,015
"Beautiful?"

172
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,408
It was why I ended up liking it.

173
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,538
Did the drive cheer you up?

174
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:42,579
It was nice. Thank you.

175
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:51,888
I went to a high school friend's housewarming party recently.

176
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:55,629
She used to be against marriage, but she recently got married.

177
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,859
I got curious and asked her...

178
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,935
why she got married.

179
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:01,329
What was the reason?

180
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,967
Having someone at home...

181
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,839
to welcome her and keep her company makes her very happy.

182
00:14:07,608 --> 00:14:08,908
Well...

183
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,278
She says it gives her heart peace.

184
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,438
- I can understand that. - Yes.

185
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:18,619
I must be getting old.

186
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,795
Returning home to a dark, empty place...

187
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,219
makes me feel lonely.

188
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,018
Does it ever happen to you?

189
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,459
Of course.

190
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,875
When I'm sitting alone in an empty living room,

191
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:38,545
I miss the warmth of others.

192
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:39,938
Really?

193
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:45,609
I don't know if I can give your heart peace,

194
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:50,178
but at least you won't have to be alone in your living room.

195
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,278
What?

196
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:55,048
I suggested that we live together last time.

197
00:14:55,718 --> 00:14:57,048
Did you give it some thought?

198
00:15:01,388 --> 00:15:03,888
If you repeat a joke, it's no longer a joke.

199
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:13,469
I'm being serious.

200
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:15,668
I'm not joking.

201
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:18,285
Whenever you feel lonely or sad,

202
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,908
I want to be by your side. No strings attached.

203
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,418
I can be somewhere closest to you and be at your beck and call.

204
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:35,129
You don't have to answer me now.

205
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:39,359
So just give it some serious thought.

206
00:15:43,628 --> 00:15:44,938
Let's eat.

207
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:00,048
Seo Kang Hoon!

208
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:02,194
Next week's schedule is out. Did you see it?

209
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:03,918
No, not yet.

210
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,259
- Did you see it? - Why did I only see it now?

211
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:09,729
It's only until today.

212
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:11,558
Why am I so forgetful?

213
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,068
- What is it? - A few days ago,

214
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:16,444
I applied to a contest, and I won.

215
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:17,844
It's a free full-course date.

216
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:19,369
How did they describe it again?

217
00:16:19,498 --> 00:16:21,538
They say the date location is a hot attraction...

218
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:25,379
that will help even old couples revive their spark.

219
00:16:26,608 --> 00:16:28,009
It's going to go to waste.

220
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:29,879
- Sung Mi. - Yes?

221
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:31,278
Can I take a look at it?

222
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,619
Sure.

223
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,118
What a waste.

224
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,148
(Heart rate up!)

225
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,159
(Congratulations, you won!)

226
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,659
Did you officially confess?

227
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:41,728
Not yet.

228
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,004
Kang Hoon.

229
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,328
I know So Jin's dating history,

230
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,997
and if her heart never raced during the first meeting,

231
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:48,544
it won't ever race.

232
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:51,797
That means her heart rate difference between someone she sees as a man...

233
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:55,009
and someone she sees as a human is huge.

234
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,188
(Heart rate up!)

235
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,548
Dear respectful colleague,

236
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,425
won't you let me have this?

237
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,749
What?

238
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,219
What will you do with that?

239
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:16,028
Hey, Kang Hoon!

240
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:25,237
Yes, what is it?

241
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:27,439
Hey, So Jin. What are you doing after work today?

242
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,444
Me? Nothing.

243
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:31,855
Let's go on a date.

244
00:17:31,879 --> 00:17:32,984
What?

245
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,709
You'll like it. I'll pick you up after work.

246
00:17:36,209 --> 00:17:38,118
No, I can go there directly.

247
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,648
Okay. I'll text you the address.

248
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,219
Meet me there after work.

249
00:17:42,718 --> 00:17:44,489
Okay.

250
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,378
Kang Hoon!

251
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,009
Hey.

252
00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:20,459
What a beautiful place!

253
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:22,689
It feels like we're abroad.

254
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,828
Wait, So Jin.

255
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,459
Yes?

256
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:28,528
Gosh.

257
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:45,618
Be more tidy when you eat.

258
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,689
Why is my heart racing so much?

259
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:53,719
Wait for me.

260
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,858
Who was your first love? Was it me?

261
00:18:57,189 --> 00:18:58,659
Of course.

262
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,499
Hey, who was your first love?

263
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,469
My first love?

264
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:06,669
Do I have one?

265
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:09,068
What? Do you mean you don't have one?

266
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,939
I thought I didn't,

267
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:16,284
but one kid comes to mind.

268
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:18,118
She was beautiful when she cried.

269
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,895
What?

270
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,547
Are you saying she was beautiful when she cried...

271
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:23,224
and not when she smiled?

272
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:24,558
Yes.

273
00:19:24,718 --> 00:19:26,318
She was beautiful in my eyes.

274
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,534
Is she your ideal type?

275
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:31,858
"Ideal type?"

276
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:38,568
I know your type is the typical church girl.

277
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,284
Someone with long straight hair who can play the piano.

278
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:44,538
Someone pure and innocent.

279
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,524
- Am I wrong? - I don't know about that.

280
00:19:47,548 --> 00:19:49,679
My ideal type is a woman who cries well.

281
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,878
Stop joking around. Tell me.

282
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:54,378
I'm not joking.

283
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,548
Someone cried on my behalf once.

284
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:27,788
(Sorry I didn't recognize you.)

285
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:32,759
Mom, don't be sorry.

286
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:34,858
I'm okay.

287
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:38,959
I couldn't cry even if I wanted to.

288
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:41,298
Before she passed,

289
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:45,169
my mother felt sorry for not recognizing me.

290
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:49,068
I didn't want her last image of me...

291
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,608
to be a crying child.

292
00:20:56,748 --> 00:20:58,078
Are you crying again?

293
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:02,088
It's your mother's death anniversary today.

294
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,764
I went to your restaurant, and your dad drank all day long.

295
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,929
He cried so much he could hardly breathe.

296
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:13,229
What if something happens to him?

297
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,098
He was always known to cry a lot.

298
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:21,139
How come you never cry?

299
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,868
Even I'm feeling heartbroken.

300
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:29,308
Do you still remember that?

301
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:31,818
How could I forget it?

302
00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,618
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't,

303
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,618
and you cried on my behalf.

304
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:45,828
So?

305
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:49,669
Are you grateful that I cried on your behalf?

306
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:51,768
Is that it?

307
00:21:52,869 --> 00:21:55,939
So Jin. Are you still troubled because of Yeon Woo?

308
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,608
Well,

309
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,678
I just think he might be someone...

310
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:08,987
who would run away at my lowest moments.

311
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,489
I'm asking if you're troubled.

312
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,828
I won't be...

313
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:17,828
from now on.

314
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:22,999
Honey, this artwork is called "The Temperature of Love."

315
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:25,237
Put your hand on the sensor, and depending on your temperature,

316
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:27,068
these roses will light up in six different colours.

317
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,939
Gosh, I don't buy it.

318
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:31,439
I won't do it.

319
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,538
What's stopping you?

320
00:22:35,048 --> 00:22:37,548
We have to hold hands to test how much we love each other.

321
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,689
All right, you go first.

322
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,219
Okay.

Your temperature of love is love.

324
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:51,259
It's love.

325
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:56,075
Your temperature of love is love.

326
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,227
- It's love. - I told you.

327
00:22:57,228 --> 00:22:58,939
There's no need to test it.

328
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:04,878
- Don't you trust me? - I want to trust you.

329
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,479
So please prove it to me.

330
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:08,878
I want to hear it.

331
00:23:09,078 --> 00:23:10,479
I want to hear you say...

332
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:12,518
that you love me.

333
00:23:19,788 --> 00:23:21,588
Should we try it too?

334
00:23:22,689 --> 00:23:24,058
Next time.

335
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,429

- Sponsoring? - Yes.

You just found out, right?

359

He didn't want anyone to find out.

360
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,399
Maybe it was because he had such a handsome son like you...

361
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:09,229
that he especially cared for that boy.

362

Yes.

He asked us to take special care of one boy.

365
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,639
It must've been because that boy reminded him of you.

00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,709
You. What's the reason you're doing this to us?

372
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:57,278
You thieves.

373
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:58,919
What did you say?

374
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,018
Your family are shameless thieves.

375
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:04,649
- Thieves? - Go! Go and ask...

376
00:26:04,788 --> 00:26:06,717
what your family stole from my family.

377
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,429
Ask your mom.

378
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:15,229
Even though his mother passed away in a fire,

379
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:18,068
he grew up well in our orphanage...

380
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:20,699
and became a priest.

381
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:25,009
He led the funeral mass for Chief Director Sim.

382
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,484
It's Father Andrea.

383
00:26:27,508 --> 00:26:29,108
Please lead us.

384
00:26:30,349 --> 00:26:32,648
Please console those of us who loved this follower of Christ...

385
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:34,378
with your heavenly consolation.

386
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:36,165
I heard a lot about you.

387
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:38,489
I'm Haeng Un's doctor, Sim Yeon Woo.

388
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:40,889
I'm Andrea.

389
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:47,534
Could I know which church Father Andrea is at?

390
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:51,899
He comes to volunteer at our orphanage once a month.

391
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:55,469
Luckily, he'll be here today.

392
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,709
That's Father Andrea there.

393
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:03,878
- Father Andrea! - Father Andrea!

394
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,178
Father Andrea. Why haven't you been here for so long?

395
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:07,247
- We missed you. - We missed you.

396
00:27:07,248 --> 00:27:09,088
- What should we do today? - Let's play soccer.

397
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:12,419
- Let's play dodgeball. - We definitely should play soccer.

398
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:39,878
- I heard you were looking for me. - Yes. Please sit.

399
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:45,889
You helped me a lot...

400
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:47,889
at the funeral.

401
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:51,328
Not at all. I just did what I needed to do.

402
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,798
Could you take a look...

403
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:56,098
at this picture?

404
00:27:57,669 --> 00:28:00,768
It was found at the scene of the accident.

405
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:05,538
You're the child in the picture, right?

406
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:14,649
I don't know how you found out,

407
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:17,018
but it is me.

408
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:20,159
So you've been seeing my father...

409
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,828
all this time.

410
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,204
No.

411
00:28:24,228 --> 00:28:27,229
But I'm grateful to Chief Director Sim.

412
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:29,798
He personally sponsored me through the orphanage.

413
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:32,439
That's how I was able to go to theology school.

414
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:38,578
I didn't know you were holding on to this picture still.

415
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,178
We met 20 years ago.

416
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,679
Do you remember it?

417
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:46,719
It could be said that it was an ill-fated relationship.

418
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,588
I'm a priest.

419
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:55,827
The day I became a priest,

420
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,858
I erased all of the things I had experienced in the world.

421
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,169
I understand.

422
00:29:03,268 --> 00:29:04,568
Well then.

423
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,338
Haeng Un was adopted to a good place.

424
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,278
It was all thanks to you.

425
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,649
Haeng Un?

426
00:29:17,808 --> 00:29:19,149
Don't you remember?

427
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:24,018
Since there are so many children like that, I sometimes forget.

428
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,358
- I understand. - Goodbye.

(Get ready for volunteering, 6:30pm)

431
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,048
Volunteering?

432
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:50,709
What volunteering?

433
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,448
(May)

434
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:57,517
(Volunteer work to remove invasive plant species)

435
00:29:57,518 --> 00:29:59,889
Do you like plants?

436
00:30:00,018 --> 00:30:02,128
I saw on the Sim General Hospital bulletin board...

437
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:05,459
a notice about volunteer work to remove invasive plants.

438
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:08,528
Do you want to go together?

439
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:16,108
- Vice Director Sim. - Oh, my.

440
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:18,777
I'm leading the volunteer work...

441
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:21,139
to remove invasive plants.

442
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,577
You're coming to volunteer this week, right?

443
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:24,979
Oh, the volunteer work...

444
00:30:25,879 --> 00:30:27,249
Oh, no.

445
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:30,389
I don't think I can go because I have other plans.

446
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:34,494
There will be a post on our website on this volunteer day.

447
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,458
For the promotion of our hospital,

448
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,528
I think it would be right for you to come.

449
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,798
There are many other impressive people besides me.

450
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:48,368
You're worried about Ms. Han So Jin, aren't you?

451
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:51,009
I saw her name on the volunteer list.

452
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:53,007
But Doctor Sim. Don't worry too much.

453
00:30:53,008 --> 00:30:56,408
From what I saw, she didn't seem strong enough...

454
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:59,078
to spend two days in a place...

455
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:01,494
crawling with her ex-boyfriend's employees.

456
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:04,689
It's not just because of that.

457
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:09,358
Should I discreetly see whether she's coming or not?

458
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:12,259
I could even stop her from coming.

459
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,469
I'll do the dirty work.

460
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:22,239
Wait.

461
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,078
I'll go.

462
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:29,078
I'm going.

463
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,088
If so,

464
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:40,734
I'll see you at the hospital at 9am this weekend.

465
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,658
- Okay. - I really hope you'll come.

466
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:43,959
Sure.

467
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,154
What's up with Ms. Han?

468
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,194
She has to go to Gangwon Province...

469
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,765
on the weekend for the invasive plant removal,

470
00:31:57,766 --> 00:31:59,535
- but Sewer... - What?

471
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:03,166
I mean, Sim Yeon Woo will be there too, I guess.

472
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:06,752
I guess it's hard for her to cancel.

473
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:09,105
If you make too many plans while dating someone,

474
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,005
these types of problems can occur.

475
00:32:12,816 --> 00:32:14,545
Then should you not make any plans?

476
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,015
Find someone to date first.

477
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,546
Here she comes.

478
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,002
What are you all doing this weekend?

479
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:31,664
I was thinking we should make a special group. It's been a while.

480
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:34,096
Hello? My lovely grandma.

481
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:35,935
Shai?

482
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,205
You're only available on the weekend?

483
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,906
That's perfect.

484
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,052
Then I'll come by on the weekend.

485
00:32:43,076 --> 00:32:45,576
Yes. I love you, Grandma.

486
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,215
A Ri.

487
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,262
I have to go do a test.

488
00:32:49,286 --> 00:32:51,316
Please hear me out at least...

489
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:54,032
I also want to see my grandma.

490
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,325
I need to see my grandma.

491
00:32:55,326 --> 00:32:58,394
BK. I can't cancel but only add to the volunteer sign-up.

492
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,724
Does that make any sense?

493
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:01,825
How can I spend two days with my ex-boyfriend?

494
00:33:01,826 --> 00:33:03,796
I don't know anyone there.

495
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:05,435
You'll go with me, right?

496
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,035

502
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:19,575
Please!

503
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:21,886
- Please don't abandon me! - Ms. Han.

504
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:24,691
When did I abandon you?

505
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:28,455
Please just help me out once.

506
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:30,485

00:35:32,476 --> 00:35:35,322
We have finally arrived. We have to go to work.

536
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:38,555
We need to go over there and change into work clothes.

537

Along this river...

542
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:49,995
are many invasive plants.

543
00:35:50,266 --> 00:35:52,566
But don't be surprised.

544
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,135
This isn't a jungle.

545
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:58,081

546
00:35:58,105 --> 00:36:01,012
by various invasive plants such as star-cucumber...

547
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,146
and buffalo weed.

548
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:07,092
Please do your best to remove them.

549
00:36:07,116 --> 00:36:10,222
There aren't many of those.

Not that. Why are you cutting a perfectly safe plant?

552

Look at you in those work clothes.

553
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:22,466
What a great style.

Well...

561
00:36:48,116 --> 00:36:49,756
I should do this part.

562
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,322
Oh, no.

563
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:12,274
Slowly walk backward, and listen to me.

564
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:13,575
Okay?

565
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,446
We have to run.

What? If we do, the bees...

567
00:37:18,255 --> 00:37:20,015
If we don't run away, we'll become the beehive.

568
00:37:22,025 --> 00:37:24,802
Slowly put down your sickle.

569

I don't see the bee's stinger,

589
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,084
so it must be a wasp, not a bumble bee.

00:39:04,085 --> 00:39:06,395
- You need to go to the hospital. - What? A wasp?

591
00:39:06,396 --> 00:39:07,696
Hold on.

592
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:10,365
It hurts.

593
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,995
Is this the hospital? Someone was stung by a bee.

Yes. I'll walk.

It's okay. I just need a short break.

606

If you keep moving, your blood circulation...

607
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:52,176
will spread the poison more.

- Get on my back now. - But...

609
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,476

00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:27,984
From the size of the tumour,

735
00:48:27,985 --> 00:48:29,756
it seems like it's stage two adenocarcinoma.

736
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,626
You must've felt shortness of breath, pain in your bones,

737
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:34,495
and a drastic loss in weight.

738
00:48:36,626 --> 00:48:38,126
I should quit now.

739
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:51,805
Hey, Mi Eun.

740
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,546
Do you have time today?

741
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:56,185
Oh, today?

742
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:59,756
I'm on my way to Sokcho now for some family business.

743
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:03,756
All right, then. I'll see you next time.

744
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:06,555
Didn't you come with a guardian?

745
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:09,055
You should come with someone next time.

746
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:12,412
You need a full-body PET-CT scan to see if it has metastasized.

747
00:49:12,436 --> 00:49:14,035
And we need to schedule your surgery.

748
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,705
It's hard to do that on your own.

749
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:24,575
(Calls)

750
00:49:24,576 --> 00:49:26,544
(Search)

751
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,415
(Han)

752
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:34,054
(Han So Ri, Han So Jin)

753
00:49:36,755 --> 00:49:38,432
How depressing must it have been?

754
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:41,325
Something awful was growing inside your belly every day.

755
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:44,526
Hey,

756
00:49:44,996 --> 00:49:47,566
why do you always get your hopes up?

757
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,682
Do you still not get that there's no love in our family?

758
00:49:50,706 --> 00:49:52,035
Fine.

759
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:53,935
I was wrong.

760
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,044
We're the surviving family of someone who committed suicide.

761
00:49:56,045 --> 00:49:58,322
And we're accomplices in making Dad do that.

762
00:49:58,346 --> 00:49:59,845
Just for today,

763
00:50:02,445 --> 00:50:04,646
I thought we could pretend to be a normal family.

764
00:50:13,855 --> 00:50:15,825
I should've eaten with them more often.

765
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:21,785
Enjoy.

766
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:23,816
Excuse me. Can we get another sake?

767
00:50:23,817 --> 00:50:25,117
Okay.

768
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:27,727
- Here you go. What is it? - Okay.

769
00:50:30,157 --> 00:50:32,397
So Jin. Kang Hoon...

770
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,037
Do you know what he's been learning since yesterday?

771
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,097
He's learning to knit at the yarn shop out front.

772
00:50:39,567 --> 00:50:41,012
He's learning to knit?

773
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:42,336
Do you want to see?

774
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:46,307
Hey, he's only been doing this at the restaurant the whole time.

775
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:49,915
Kang Hoon made this himself?

776
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,216
Yes.

777
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,147
Gosh, seriously.

778
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:54,816
Dad!

779
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:57,017
- Hey... - Seriously?

780
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:00,403
Hey, that's apparently a scarf.

781
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:03,526
He says he'll make it for his girlfriend at Christmas.

782
00:51:04,297 --> 00:51:06,997
I mean, he doesn't even have a girlfriend. What's he on about?

783
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:11,167
But why is it red?

784
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,265
Is it red for Christmas?

785
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:17,636
No, I said that red thread was the colour of destiny.

786
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:21,176
Kang Hoon's mom made me a red scarf too.

787
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:23,145
A connection you can't even forget on your way to the afterlife.

788
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,176
Red thread.

789
00:51:24,177 --> 00:51:26,147
- Then, he keeps... - Enough.

790
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:27,463
That's enough, Dad.

791
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,216
- Kang Hoon, make me one too. - Come here.

792
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:30,557
Eat up.

793
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,386
I think you have talent.

794
00:51:33,556 --> 00:51:34,585
I'll make one too.

795
00:51:34,586 --> 00:51:36,997
- That guy is like a big puppy. - All right.

796
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:41,767
He's doing everything for me that I wanted to do with Yeon Woo.

797
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:47,437
I hope Mr. Seo, Kang Hoon, and I can live happily for a long time.

798
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:50,564
(Heart rate up!)

799
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,977
Try it. A red light will turn on now.

800
00:51:55,077 --> 00:51:56,377
Here.

801
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:10,733
Your temperature of love is a guy friend.

802
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,597
- A guy friend. - That's wrong.

803
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,727
No, I'll try it again.

804
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,236
Okay.

805
00:52:22,367 --> 00:52:25,182
Your temperature of love is a guy friend.

806
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:26,776
- A guy friend. - But that's wrong.

807
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,383
This isn't right.

808
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:31,216
- But... - No. A younger brother.

809
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:36,316
A younger brother.

810
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:40,827
No. That can't happen.

811
00:52:42,387 --> 00:52:44,673
- Are you done? - What? Yes.

812
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:45,903
Get up. I'll take you home.

813
00:52:45,927 --> 00:52:47,497
Okay. Let's go.

814
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,566
- Dad, I'll leave this to you. - Okay.

815
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,636
- I'll be going now, Mr. Seo. - All right.

816
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,676
I'm really fine.

817
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:03,247
It's dangerous at night.

818
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:04,977
You made it so bright.

819
00:53:18,126 --> 00:53:19,667
- We're here. - Oh, right.

820
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:22,327
- Bye. - Okay, bye.

821
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:23,836
Thanks.

822
00:53:56,996 --> 00:53:59,206
(Once the lamp post is fixed...)

823
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:41,506
(Dear Han So Jin)

824
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:46,147
(Seo Kang Hoon)

825
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,167
What's wrong this time?

826
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:10,736
Did you break up with Sung Mi?

827
00:55:12,606 --> 00:55:15,006
It sounds like you wanted that to happen.

828
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,392
I just had a gut feeling when I saw your face.

829
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:19,117
Your breathing is rapid too.

830
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,517
I think I won't be happy if we break up.

831
00:55:24,317 --> 00:55:27,057
But I don't think we'll be happy even if we stay together.

832
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:29,673
What do I do?

833
00:55:29,697 --> 00:55:31,097
What's the problem?

834
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,597
You know I'm sterile, right?

835
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:38,667
I've never once been unhappy about that in my life.

836
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:41,966
Because I'm fine with not having kids.

837
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:43,276
But...

838
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,906
from the moment I met Sung Mi,

839
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:49,176
I've started to resent my sterile gene so much.

840
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:53,617
Sung Mi wants to get married...

841
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,756
and have lots of kids.

842
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:59,926
Your lifestyles are different too. It's a tough problem.

843
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,327
But...

844
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,327
is it worth all this worrying?

845
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:09,773
Right. I know.

846
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:12,236
I should break up because that's always been your conclusion.

847
00:56:12,237 --> 00:56:13,537
But...

848
00:56:15,367 --> 00:56:19,207
To do that, I've never liked any woman this much in my life.

849
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,647
There wasn't anyone like her in my past...

850
00:56:23,476 --> 00:56:25,816
and there probably won't be anyone like her in the future either.

851
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,586
How does it feel to meet your DNA lover?

852
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,296
Isn't that like achieving your life's goal?

853
00:56:38,226 --> 00:56:39,526
I'm so...

854
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,497
happy.

855
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:51,836
Go to Sung Mi.

856
00:56:52,206 --> 00:56:53,577
Go...

857
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:56,816
and tell her that you're sterile.

858
00:56:57,476 --> 00:56:59,377
Ask if that's okay with her.

859
00:57:00,586 --> 00:57:02,086
And if she says no,

860
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,086
try clinging on to her.

861
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,756
Tell her that you love her,

862
00:57:08,956 --> 00:57:10,597
and tell her that again.

863
00:57:11,197 --> 00:57:12,897
Try clinging to her until the end.

864
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,173
What's up with you? You're scaring me.

865
00:57:16,197 --> 00:57:18,367
You said you'd regret letting her go for the rest of your life.

866
00:57:19,806 --> 00:57:21,336
You should try whatever you can.

867
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:36,287
You haven't eaten, right?

868
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:37,687
No.

869
00:57:38,686 --> 00:57:41,187
Ta-da. I shopped for groceries.

870
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:43,397
Let's have doenjang jjigae and rice.

871
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:45,627
Go to bed after you eat.

872
00:58:00,606 --> 00:58:01,977
Your cooking skills are...

873
00:58:02,507 --> 00:58:03,616
still the best.

874
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:05,517
Do I pass as someone you live with?

875
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:10,356
About the cohabitation contract.

876
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:13,386
I have two things I want to add.

877
00:58:14,887 --> 00:58:16,187
First,

878
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:20,296
we should go grocery shopping and eat dinner together twice a week.

879
00:58:20,527 --> 00:58:23,497
Second, we should recommend movies on streaming sites and watch them.

880
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:28,466
And if the rules become a hassle as we go on,

881
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:30,512
we can fix them whenever.

882
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:32,176
Do you want to add anything else?

883
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:40,147
Mi Eun.

884
00:58:42,146 --> 00:58:43,856
I don't think I can do this.

885
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,303
Because of So Jin?

886
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:56,026
Even at this moment,

887
00:58:57,097 --> 00:58:59,196
I'm only thinking about...

888
00:59:00,306 --> 00:59:02,406
how nice it would be for her to be here. I'm sorry.

889
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:05,336
It's okay. I knew you'd feel that way.

890
00:59:08,907 --> 00:59:13,117
Even in this cruel moment, I understand you.

891
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:16,287
Because I was like that.

892
00:59:17,556 --> 00:59:21,756
I only saw your face in the faces of all the other men I met.

893
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,356
Yeon Woo.

894
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:28,727
If I had...

895
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:32,566
only confessed my feelings to you a little bit earlier,

896
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:37,676
would our relationship have changed?

897
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:48,762
I'll give you just one more chance.

898
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:50,187
- Mi Eun. - No.

899
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:55,003
I'll wait for you just one more time.

900
00:59:55,027 --> 00:59:59,057
And you should go to So Jin now to tell her how you truly feel.

901
01:00:01,626 --> 01:00:03,367
But if things don't work out again this time,

902
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:08,636
come to me.

903
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,742
(Dear Han So Jin, Seo Kang Hoon)

904
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:41,182
What's up with this plant?

905
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,392
I should water it.

906
01:01:17,081 --> 01:01:19,082
How much water does it need?

907
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:44,872
Yes?

908
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,062
What is it you have to say?

909
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,761
I know it's too late for you,

910
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:13,071
but I just had to say this.

911
01:02:16,371 --> 01:02:18,571
I keep having the same dream lately.

912
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,441
I go back to the night we broke up,

913
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:25,312
and I keep making a different choice.

914
01:02:26,681 --> 01:02:28,151
But when I open my eyes,

915
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:31,191
the reality is the same.

916
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:34,761
I'm worried that was the last time with you in my life...

917
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:37,562
and that I may have let that slip away.

918
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:45,401
I think I made the wrong choice.

919
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:47,441
Can you please...

920
01:02:50,211 --> 01:02:51,571
give me another chance?

921
01:02:54,311 --> 01:02:56,582
Just like the selfish decision he made...

922
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:59,381
If only I hadn't made that decision back then...

923
01:02:59,411 --> 01:03:04,352
I only hope that this decision doesn't return to me as regret.

924
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:06,452
Would I have not regretted it?

925
01:03:06,621 --> 01:03:07,961
I'm sorry.

926
01:03:09,092 --> 01:03:10,492
From now on,

927
01:03:11,431 --> 01:03:12,861
we should really go our separate ways.

928
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:19,502
Do you mean that?

929
01:03:20,141 --> 01:03:21,772
If I were me from the past,

930
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:24,841
I would've accepted you in this kind of situation.

931
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,372
But not now.

932
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:36,352
Do you love him? Kang Hoon?

933
01:03:36,891 --> 01:03:39,091
If love is when my senses go wild,

934
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:42,361
I never loved Kang Hoon as a man.

935
01:03:42,561 --> 01:03:45,091
But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

936
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:48,602
was all wrong.

937
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:51,801
So,

938
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:54,801
I think this might be what real love is.

939
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,071
- So Jin, I... - Yeon Woo.

940
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:06,582
If you really love So Jin, let her go. That's love too.

941
01:04:29,912 --> 01:04:31,281
Are you okay?

942
01:04:33,552 --> 01:04:34,852
Yes.

943
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:40,162
I didn't think...

944
01:04:40,992 --> 01:04:43,292
I'd say this in this kind of situation.

945
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:47,401
If not today,

946
01:04:48,061 --> 01:04:49,932
I might be too late again.

947
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:52,171
So, I'm going to say it now.

948
01:04:54,501 --> 01:04:56,971
- What? - I like you, So Jin.

949
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:00,611
No, I love you.

950
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,622
This is...

951
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:13,292
the most important treasure in my life.

952
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:17,991
It's the fire hose I first grabbed when I went to work on scene.

953
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:22,531
Here.

954
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,312
To me,

955
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,281
you are that precious and special to me.

956
01:05:40,581 --> 01:05:42,281
I know I can cherish you...

957
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:45,921
and be an even better man to you than now.

958
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:49,221
I will never make you cry like all the other guys.

959
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:54,432
So,

960
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,232
please come to me now.

961
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,437
- Oh, my! - Stand back. You might get hurt.

962
01:06:20,461 --> 01:06:23,761
Oh, okay. I'll go get a broom.

963
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:58,474
(DNA Lover)

964
01:07:58,552 --> 01:08:00,721
I wanted to prove my love...

965
01:08:01,262 --> 01:08:03,562
with my DNA Lover Theory.

966
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:06,032
And there is a man who proves his love...

967
01:08:06,762 --> 01:08:09,001
by protecting someone.

968
01:08:09,432 --> 01:08:12,208
When the one you love looks at another,

969
01:08:12,232 --> 01:08:14,318
many people tend to give up.

970
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:18,072
I prove my love by not giving up.

971
01:08:18,371 --> 01:08:19,871
I'm going to go stay in the US.

972
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:21,482
I've concluded...

973
01:08:21,711 --> 01:08:24,687
that giving up is the way for me to prove my love.

974
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:27,022
Dad, what's up with this plant?

975
01:08:27,052 --> 01:08:28,952
A customer gave it to me as a present.

976
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:30,992
Someone broke it.

977
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:34,261
You were very lucky, weren't you?
