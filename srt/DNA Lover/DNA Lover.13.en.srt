00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,270
(DNA Lover)

(Choi Si Won)

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,820

(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

8
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,909
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,239
If...

10
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,280
only I hadn't made that decision back then,

11
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,279
would I have not regretted it?

12
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,019
(Episode 13: Regrets)

13
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,989
I said, I don't need you to walk me home.

14
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:29,590
It's just for today.

15
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,560
I'd feel uneasy otherwise.

16
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,530
You're so stubborn.

17
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,129
You little...

18
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,299
What do I do? Are you okay? Are you hurt?

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,709
- It hurts. - My goodness.

20
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
Let's go.

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,480
Come on, let's go.

22
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,750
But it's what you always do for me.

23
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,349
You always walk me home,

24
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,920
look after every little thing for me,

25
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,730
and always wait right here whenever I'm in need.

26
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,530
I realized...

27
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,700
that you always did all those...

28
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
for me.

29
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:15,039
It's nothing new, so what's the big deal?

30
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,439
I guess you're right.

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
I took it for granted.

32
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,919
Thank you,

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
Kang Hoon.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,930
I guess...

35
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,500
you were really scared today.

36
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:38,629
Of course.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,800
I thought I'd never see you again.

38
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,699
I never imagined a life...

39
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,870
without you.

40
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,990
That won't ever happen,

41
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,360
so don't worry.

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,500
Was it really because of my oblivion gene?

43
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:17,340
I forgot about Kang Hoon's scent for a while.

44
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,710
Kang Hoon promised me sincerely...

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,509
that he'd never leave my side.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,419
I could truly feel them now.

47
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:33,990
Maybe...

48
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,258
(Seo Kang Hoon)

49
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,189
it was because I finally found my true DNA lover.

50
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,399
It's me.

51
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,870
How is Ms. Yoo Young A doing?

52
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,599
She gained consciousness two hours ago.

53
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,939
She just fell asleep.

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,198
The baby is also doing okay.

55
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,509
It's under intensive care.

56
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,769
I'm glad.

57
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,240
Call me if anything happens.

58
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:08,949
Okay.

59
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,959
(Happiness will surely come.)

60
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,740
I like this one.

61
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,138
Would you like to take it with you?

62
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,449
I'll give you my address.

63
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,649
Please deliver it there.

64
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,129
(Grass Tree)

65
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,119
(Han So Jin)

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,519
(Sim Yeon Woo)

67
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,370
She stepped out for a moment.

68
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,370
I'll just leave this here then.

69
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,410
A Ri, this is a new menu my father is developing.

70
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:16,209
He told me to deliver it to So Jin.

71
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,310
We packed enough for you too.

72
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,540
Please share it with her.

73
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,779
Did the chef send me food too?

74
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,779
I'm an expert at reviewing new menus.

75
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,049
I'll be bold and honest.

76
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,289
I'll get going.

77
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,360
What? Wait.

78
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,629
Since you're already here, I should offer you some tea.

79
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,500
I have to return the favour for this precious food.

80
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,769
So Jin taught me to have good manners.

81
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:43,569
It's not necessary,

82
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,639
but I'll bug you for some tea.

83
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,310
- Sure. - Okay.

84
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:02,549
(Pheromone)

85
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,088
(Different scents according to personality)

86
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:05,659
(Healer gene)

87
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,160
(Seo Kang Hoon)

88
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,980
Do you like her that much?

89
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,879
Well... Sure. Thank you.

90
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,850
Did you officially confess?

91
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,450
- Not yet. - Not yet? Why not?

92
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,919
I'll do it when her heart...

93
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,690
has fully healed.

94
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:39,889
Kang Hoon,

95
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,759
this is your opportunity to snatch her!

96
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,259
You'll end up regretting it. Love is all about timing.

97
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,399
No.

98
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,500
I care more about how she feels than how I feel at the moment.

99
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll wait until she's okay.

100
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I see.

101
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,139
When did you two first meet?

102
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,779
I was 7, and she was 11.

103
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,979
We met for the first time then.

104
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,019
If that's the case,

105
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,619
you might not get butterflies...

106
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,519
since you're so used to each other.

107
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
That's not true.

108
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,230
I still...

109
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,529
get butterflies, and my heart races.

110
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,700
I hope it's the same for So Jin.

111
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,899
It's okay even if that's not the case now.

112
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,039
Kang Hoon.

113
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,080
I know So Jin's dating history,

114
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,048
and if her heart never raced during the first meeting,

115
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,579
it won't ever race.

116
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,849
That means her heart rate difference between someone she sees as a man...

117
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,850
and someone she sees as a human is huge.

118
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,460
You need to play hard to get or put her under a spell.

119
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,230
You need to devise a plan.

120
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,459
It's the only way to kick Sewer out from her heart...

121
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,700
and to secure yourself a spot as her man.

122
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,970
Anyway, I'm rooting for you.

123
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
- You're here. - Hey.

124
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,029
How's your mother doing?

125
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,429
She's doing better.

126
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:24,429
She looks happier too.

127
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,730
I'm glad.

128
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,308
If you're not taking outpatients, how about some fresh air?

129
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,379
It's nice out.

130
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,379
- Sure. - I didn't bring my car.

131
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:46,720
I'll drive.

132
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,928
I'm staying quiet,

133
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,600
and I'm even driving for you.

134
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,369
What's with the long face?

135
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,240
Me? That's not true.

136
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,909
It's nice out today.

137
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,340
This won't do.

138
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,809
I'll help you change your mood.

139
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:16,080
Here, pick one.

140
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,149
Let's see if this can cheer me up.

141
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,320
All right.

142
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,230
The engine sounds different in sports mode.

143
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,139
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

144
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,110
(Seventh: Yeo Jung Tam)

145
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,319
I know you worked the night shift.

146
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,490
Sorry to call you out so early.

147
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,929
It's okay.

148
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,429
If I can be with you,

149
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,830
it doesn't matter what time of day it is.

150
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,299
- Is that so? Okay. - Yes.

151
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,110
- Lee Ye Ji? - Yes.

152
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,470
Let's go.

153
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,038
- What should we eat? - A sausage.

154
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,440
Are you going to eat a sausage only?

155
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,279
Aren't they beautiful?

156
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,820
It's exactly what I dream of.

157
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:31,820
What do you mean?

158
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,659
If I ever get married,

159
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,500
I want to have a lot of kids.

160
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,299
Three would be nice.

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,370
Four would be nice too.

162
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,740
Even five would be okay.

163
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,379
Is that too many?

164
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:56,009
No. That's not it...

165
00:12:58,419 --> 00:12:59,820
Yeo Jung Tam!

166
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,919
- Yeo Jung Tam? - That's us.

167
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,230
- Aren't you coming? - Coming.

168
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,370
(Mandu)

169
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,250
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

170
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,450
The mandu soup here always makes me happy.

171
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,389
This mandu is plump and beautiful.

172
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,519
Look.

173
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,240
Yeon Woo. Sorry for keeping you.

174
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,809
This place looks old. How do you know this place?

175
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,740
Their mandu is plump and beautiful.

176
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:00,909
"Beautiful?"

177
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,149
It was why I ended up liking it.

178
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,279
Did the drive cheer you up?

179
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:09,320
It was nice. Thank you.

180
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,629
I went to a high school friend's housewarming party recently.

181
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,370
She used to be against marriage, but she recently got married.

182
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,600
I got curious and asked her...

183
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,940
why she got married.

184
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,070
What was the reason?

185
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,008
Having someone at home...

186
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:33,580
to welcome her and keep her company makes her very happy.

187
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,649
Well...

188
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,019
She says it gives her heart peace.

189
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,179
- I can understand that. - Yes.

190
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,360
I must be getting old.

191
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,559
Returning home to a dark, empty place...

192
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,960
makes me feel lonely.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,759
Does it ever happen to you?

194
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Of course.

195
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,669
When I'm sitting alone in an empty living room,

196
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,539
I miss the warmth of others.

197
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,679
Really?

198
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,350
I don't know if I can give your heart peace,

199
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:16,919
but at least you won't have to be alone in your living room.

200
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,019
What?

201
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,789
I suggested that we live together last time.

202
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,789
Did you give it some thought?

203
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,629
If you repeat a joke, it's no longer a joke.

204
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,210
I'm being serious.

205
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,409
I'm not joking.

206
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,049
Whenever you feel lonely or sad,

207
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,649
I want to be by your side. No strings attached.

208
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,159
I can be somewhere closest to you and be at your beck and call.

209
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,870
You don't have to answer me now.

210
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:06,100
So just give it some serious thought.

211
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,679
Let's eat.

212
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,089
Seo Kang Hoon!

213
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,059
Next week's schedule is out. Did you see it?

214
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:30,659
No, not yet.

215
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,000
- Did you see it? - Why did I only see it now?

216
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,470
It's only until today.

217
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,299
Why am I so forgetful?

218
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:41,109
- What is it? - A few days ago,

219
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,269
I applied to a contest, and I won.

220
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:44,710
It's a free full-course date.

221
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,110
How did they describe it again?

222
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,579
They say the date location is a hot attraction...

223
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,120
that will help even old couples revive their spark.

224
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:54,750
It's going to go to waste.

225
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
- Sung Mi. - Yes?

226
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,319
Can I take a look at it?

227
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
Sure.

228
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,159
What a waste.

229
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,189
(Heart rate up!)

230
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,200
(Congratulations, you won!)

231
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,400
Did you officially confess?

232
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:08,769
Not yet.

233
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,799
Kang Hoon.

234
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,069
I know So Jin's dating history,

235
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,038
and if her heart never raced during the first meeting,

236
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,539
it won't ever race.

237
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,838
That means her heart rate difference between someone she sees as a man...

238
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,750
and someone she sees as a human is huge.

239
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,109
(Heart rate up!)

240
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,289
Dear respectful colleague,

241
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,289
won't you let me have this?

242
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,490
What?

243
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:34,960
What will you do with that?

244
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,769
Hey, Kang Hoon!

245
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,278
Yes, what is it?

246
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,180
Hey, So Jin. What are you doing after work today?

247
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,210
Me? Nothing.

248
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,720
Let's go on a date.

249
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
What?

250
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:02,450
You'll like it. I'll pick you up after work.

251
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,859
No, I can go there directly.

252
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:07,689
Okay. I'll text you the address.

253
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,960
Meet me there after work.

254
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,230
Okay.

255
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,119
Kang Hoon!

256
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,750
Hey.

257
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,200
What a beautiful place!

258
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,430
It feels like we're abroad.

259
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,569
Wait, So Jin.

260
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Yes?

261
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,269
Gosh.

262
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,359
Be more tidy when you eat.

263
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,430
Why is my heart racing so much?

264
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,460
Wait for me.

265
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,599
Who was your first love? Was it me?

266
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,400
Of course.

267
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,240
Hey, who was your first love?

268
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,210
My first love?

269
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,410
Do I have one?

270
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,809
What? Do you mean you don't have one?

271
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,680
I thought I didn't,

272
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,250
but one kid comes to mind.

273
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,859
She was beautiful when she cried.

274
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:46,859
What?

275
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,588
Are you saying she was beautiful when she cried...

276
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,130
and not when she smiled?

277
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,299
Yes.

278
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,059
She was beautiful in my eyes.

279
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,400
Is she your ideal type?

280
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,599
"Ideal type?"

281
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,309
I know your type is the typical church girl.

282
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,210
Someone with long straight hair who can play the piano.

283
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:11,279
Someone pure and innocent.

284
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,420
- Am I wrong? - I don't know about that.

285
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,420
My ideal type is a woman who cries well.

286
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,619
Stop joking around. Tell me.

287
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,119
I'm not joking.

288
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,289
Someone cried on my behalf once.

289
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,829
(Sorry I didn't recognize you.)

290
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,500
Mom, don't be sorry.

291
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,599
I'm okay.

292
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:05,700
I couldn't cry even if I wanted to.

293
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,039
Before she passed,

294
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,910
my mother felt sorry for not recognizing me.

295
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,809
I didn't want her last image of me...

296
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,349
to be a crying child.

297
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,819
Are you crying again?

298
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,829
It's your mother's death anniversary today.

299
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,630
I went to your restaurant, and your dad drank all day long.

300
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,670
He cried so much he could hardly breathe.

301
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,970
What if something happens to him?

302
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,839
He was always known to cry a lot.

303
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,880
How come you never cry?

304
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,609
Even I'm feeling heartbroken.

305
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,049
Do you still remember that?

306
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,559
How could I forget it?

307
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,359
I wanted to cry, but I couldn't,

308
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,359
and you cried on my behalf.

309
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:12,569
So?

310
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,410
Are you grateful that I cried on your behalf?

311
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,509
Is that it?

312
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,680
So Jin. Are you still troubled because of Yeon Woo?

313
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,349
Well,

314
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,719
I just think he might be someone...

315
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,028
who would run away at my lowest moments.

316
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:37,230
I'm asking if you're troubled.

317
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,569
I won't be...

318
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,569
from now on.

319
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,740
Honey, this artwork is called "The Temperature of Love."

320
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:52,278
Put your hand on the sensor, and depending on your temperature,

321
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,809
these roses will light up in six different colours.

322
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,680
Gosh, I don't buy it.

323
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,180
I won't do it.

324
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,279
What's stopping you?

325
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,289
We have to hold hands to test how much we love each other.

326
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,430
All right, you go first.

327
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

328
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,400
Your temperature of love is love.

329
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,000
It's love.

330
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,839
Your temperature of love is love.

331
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,268
- It's love. - I told you.

332
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,680
There's no need to test it.

333
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:31,619
- Don't you trust me? - I want to trust you.

334
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,220
So please prove it to me.

335
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,619
I want to hear it.

336
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,220
I want to hear you say...

337
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,259
that you love me.

338
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,329
Should we try it too?

339
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,799
Next time.

340
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,170
Let's do it next time.

The Tree Orphanage that we're sponsoring...

345
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,930
contacted us about attending their Family Month event.

346
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,140
- Sponsoring? - Yes.

347
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,210
Chief Director Sim has been sponsoring it for 20 years.

348
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,409
Didn't you know?

349
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,909
Chief Director Sim used to attend every event.

350
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,410
- What should we do? - Right.

351
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,349
I'll go.

352
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:39,779
Okay.

353
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,690
Sponsor?

354
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:47,019

Thank you for coming all the way.

359

Thank you for continuing to sponsor our orphanage...

in a time of loss.

It's nothing.

362
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,559
I heard Chief Director Sim sponsored this place for 20 years.

363
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,690
You just found out, right?

364
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,099
He didn't want anyone to find out.

365
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,140
Maybe it was because he had such a handsome son like you...

366
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,970
that he especially cared for that boy.

367
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,480
A boy?

368
00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:40,109
Yes.

369
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,380
He asked us to take special care of one boy.

370
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,380
It must've been because that boy reminded him of you.

376
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,450
You. What's the reason you're doing this to us?

377
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:24,019
You thieves.

378
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
What did you say?

379
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,759
Your family are shameless thieves.

380
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,390
- Thieves? - Go! Go and ask...

381
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:33,758
what your family stole from my family.

382
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,170

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,809
he grew up well in our orphanage...

385
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,440
and became a priest.

386
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,750
He led the funeral mass for Chief Director Sim.

387
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,279
It's Father Andrea.

I'm Andrea.

394
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,369
Could I know which church Father Andrea is at?

395

Luckily, he'll be here today.

397

That's Father Andrea there.

398

- Father Andrea! - Father Andrea!

399
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,219
Father Andrea. Why haven't you been here for so long?

400
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,288
- We missed you. - We missed you.

401

- What should we do today? - Let's play soccer.

402
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,160
- Let's play dodgeball. - We definitely should play soccer.

403

406
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:18,069
Not at all. I just did what I needed to do.

407
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,539
Could you take a look...

408
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,839
at this picture?

409
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,509
It was found at the scene of the accident.

410
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,279
You're the child in the picture, right?

411
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,390
I don't know how you found out,

412
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,759
but it is me.

413
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:46,900

414

all this time.

415

No.

416
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:53,970
But I'm grateful to Chief Director Sim.

417
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,539
He personally sponsored me through the orphanage.

418
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,180
That's how I was able to go to theology school.

Do you remember it?

422
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,460
It could be said that it was an ill-fated relationship.

I'm a priest.

424
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,868
The day I became a priest,

425
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,599
I erased all of the things I had experienced in the world.

426
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,910
I understand.

427
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,309

Don't you remember?

432
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,759
Since there are so many children like that, I sometimes forget.

442

a notice about volunteer work to remove invasive plants.

I don't think I can go because I have other plans.

451
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:01,329

I saw her name on the volunteer list.

But Doctor Sim. Don't worry too much.

458
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,449
From what I saw, she didn't seem strong enough...

459
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,819

460
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,390
crawling with her ex-boyfriend's employees.

461
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,430
It's not just because of that.

462
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,099
Should I discreetly see whether she's coming or not?

463
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,000
I could even stop her from coming.

464

There aren't many of those.

Ms. Choi.

556
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,840
Not that. Why are you cutting a perfectly safe plant?

557
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,309
Look at you in those work clothes.

558
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,550
What a great style.

559
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,110

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,389
You should go where everyone is. Why are you here...

- You can keep going. - Sure.

565
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Well...

566
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,840
I should do this part.

567
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,530
Oh, no.

568
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,658
Slowly walk backward, and listen to me.

569
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:40,659
Okay?

570
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:42,530
We have to run.

571
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,638
What? If we do, the bees...

572
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,099
If we don't run away, we'll become the beehive.

573
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:51,909
Slowly put down your sickle.

574
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,210
Okay.

And on the count of three,

576
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,079
we'll slowly turn right and run away. Okay?

- Are you okay? - I...

591
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,238
I think I was stung.

592
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,269
Let me see.

593
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,308
I don't see the bee's stinger,

594
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,468
so it must be a wasp, not a bumble bee.

595
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,779
- You need to go to the hospital. - What? A wasp?

596
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
Hold on.

597
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:37,449
It hurts.

598
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,079
Is this the hospital? Someone was stung by a bee.

I understand. Thank you.

So Jin.

605
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:59,400
I think walking there will be faster than waiting for an ambulance.

Do you think you can move?

607
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,570
Yes. I'll walk.

608

Get on my back.

610
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:16,549
It's okay. I just need a short break.

611
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,089
If you keep moving, your blood circulation...

612
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,260
will spread the poison more.

613
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,960
- Get on my back now. - But...

614
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I said I was fine.

615
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:25,030

Can you go a bit faster?

627
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,820
I told you that running could make the poison spread faster.

631
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:38,670

You really don't listen.

00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,538
It hurts.

00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,340
And why are you so heavy, So Jin?

635
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,179

670
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,309
All right, then.

- I was stung by a bee. - Are you all right?

673
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,819
Yes, I applied some ointment.

You know you have to do the dishes, right?

682
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:54,869
- Okay... - But that's too mean.

Don't exaggerate.

685
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,609
I asked the village foreman,

686
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,980
and it's only 2km from the hospital to here.

687
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,610
Well...

688
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,550
I'll do the dishes.

Okay, then.

00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:11,320
Then, Ms. Han, you can rest.

00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,860
Let's have Vice Director Sim and Dr. Ji do it.

693
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,159
- Okay. - Nice.

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,289
She's so cool, indeed.

695
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,158
Have some potatoes. Why are you so angry?

696
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,598
I was supposed to avoid water.

697
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,059
Be quiet!

698
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,610
You should go inside.

699
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,119
I'll go inside after I help you rinse the dishes.

700
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:45,719
It was because of me that people thought you were skipping work.

701

Don't work too long in the dark like this.

You don't have to worry.

704
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:08,510
I mean, you should take care of your own health.

I'm glad you're happy.

00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:54,989
Sure.

How does it feel to meet your DNA lover?

713
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,820
I was holding back so well.

714
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,488
Why does he show up whenever I'm about to forget...

715
00:46:26,489 --> 00:46:28,489
and shake me up on the inside?

716
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,469
I'm so...

717
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,510
happy.

718

You should've been careful. You must've been shocked.

731
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,299
I'll give you medication. You should carry it around.

732
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,199
Okay. Let's go.

734
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,639
Yes. You look amazing.

735
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,079
- Let's go. - Okay.

736
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:47,530
(Cancer Center)

737
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,130
You have lung cancer.

738
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,039
Didn't you feel any symptoms?

739
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,368
From the size of the tumour,

740
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:56,840
it seems like it's stage two adenocarcinoma.

741
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,710
You must've felt shortness of breath, pain in your bones,

742
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,579
and a drastic loss in weight.

743
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,210
I should quit now.

744
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,889
Hey, Mi Eun.

745
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,630
Do you have time today?

746
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,269
Oh, today?

747
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,840
I'm on my way to Sokcho now for some family business.

748
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,840
All right, then. I'll see you next time.

749
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,639
Didn't you come with a guardian?

750
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,139
You should come with someone next time.

751
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,510
You need a full-body PET-CT scan to see if it has metastasized.

752
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,119
And we need to schedule your surgery.

753
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:43,789
It's hard to do that on your own.

754
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,959
(Calls)

755
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,928
(Search)

756
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:55,799
(Han)

757
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,369
(Han So Ri, Han So Jin)

758
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,739
How depressing must it have been?

759
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,409
Something awful was growing inside your belly every day.

760
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,610
Hey,

761
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,650
why do you always get your hopes up?

762
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:18,019
Do you still not get that there's no love in our family?

763
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,119
Fine.

764
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,019
I was wrong.

765
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,428
We're the surviving family of someone who committed suicide.

766
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:25,530
And we're accomplices in making Dad do that.

767
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,929
Just for today,

768
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,730
I thought we could pretend to be a normal family.

769
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,909
I should've eaten with them more often.

770
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,218
Enjoy.

771
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,249
Excuse me. Can we get another sake?

772
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,250
Okay.

773
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,860
- Here you go. What is it? - Okay.

774
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,530
So Jin. Kang Hoon...

775
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,170
Do you know what he's been learning since yesterday?

776
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,230
He's learning to knit at the yarn shop out front.

777
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,400
He's learning to knit?

778
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:09,469
Do you want to see?

779
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:13,440
Hey, he's only been doing this at the restaurant the whole time.

780
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,348
Kang Hoon made this himself?

781
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:18,349
Yes.

782
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,280
Gosh, seriously.

783
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,949
Dad!

784
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:24,150
- Hey... - Seriously?

785
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,659
Hey, that's apparently a scarf.

786
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,659
He says he'll make it for his girlfriend at Christmas.

787
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,130
I mean, he doesn't even have a girlfriend. What's he on about?

788
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,300
But why is it red?

789
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,698
Is it red for Christmas?

790
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:44,769
No, I said that red thread was the colour of destiny.

791
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:48,309
Kang Hoon's mom made me a red scarf too.

792
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,578
A connection you can't even forget on your way to the afterlife.

793
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:51,609
Red thread.

794
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,280
- Then, he keeps... - Enough.

795
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,650
That's enough, Dad.

796
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,649
- Kang Hoon, make me one too. - Come here.

797
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,690
Eat up.

798
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,519
I think you have talent.

799
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:02,018
I'll make one too.

800
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:04,130
- That guy is like a big puppy. - All right.

801
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,900
He's doing everything for me that I wanted to do with Yeon Woo.

802
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:14,570
I hope Mr. Seo, Kang Hoon, and I can live happily for a long time.

803
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:17,940
(Heart rate up!)

804
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,110
Try it. A red light will turn on now.

805
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:23,510
Here.

806
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,989
Your temperature of love is a guy friend.

807
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,730
- A guy friend. - That's wrong.

808
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:41,860
No, I'll try it again.

809
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,369
Okay.

810
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,440
Your temperature of love is a guy friend.

811
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,209
- A guy friend. - But that's wrong.

812
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,710
This isn't right.

813
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,349
- But... - No. A younger brother.

814
00:52:58,949 --> 00:53:03,449
A younger brother.

815
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,960
No. That can't happen.

816
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,929
- Are you done? - What? Yes.

817
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,329
Get up. I'll take you home.

818
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,630
Okay. Let's go.

819
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,999
- Dad, I'll leave this to you. - Okay.

820
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,769
- I'll be going now, Mr. Seo. - All right.

821
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,809
I'm really fine.

822
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,380
It's dangerous at night.

823
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:32,110
You made it so bright.

824
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,800
- We're here. - Oh, right.

825
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:49,460
- Bye. - Okay, bye.

826
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:50,969
Thanks.

827
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:26,639
(Once the lamp post is fixed...)

828
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:08,939
(Dear Han So Jin)

829
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,480
(Seo Kang Hoon)

830
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,300
What's wrong this time?

831
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,869
Did you break up with Sung Mi?

832
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,139
It sounds like you wanted that to happen.

833
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,710
I just had a gut feeling when I saw your face.

834
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:46,250
Your breathing is rapid too.

835
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,650
I think I won't be happy if we break up.

836
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,190
But I don't think we'll be happy even if we stay together.

837
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,889
What do I do?

838
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,230
What's the problem?

839
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,730
You know I'm sterile, right?

840
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:05,800
I've never once been unhappy about that in my life.

841
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:09,399
Because I'm fine with not having kids.

842
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,409
But...

843
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,339
from the moment I met Sung Mi,

844
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,309
I've started to resent my sterile gene so much.

845
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,750
Sung Mi wants to get married...

846
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,889
and have lots of kids.

847
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,059
Your lifestyles are different too. It's a tough problem.

848
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,460
But...

849
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,460
is it worth all this worrying?

850
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,070
Right. I know.

851
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,669
I should break up because that's always been your conclusion.

852
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,670
But...

853
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,340
To do that, I've never liked any woman this much in my life.

854
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,780
There wasn't anyone like her in my past...

855
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,949
and there probably won't be anyone like her in the future either.

856
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,719
How does it feel to meet your DNA lover?

857
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,429
Isn't that like achieving your life's goal?

858
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:06,659
I'm so...

859
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,630
happy.

860
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,969
Go to Sung Mi.

861
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:20,710
Go...

862
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,949
and tell her that you're sterile.

863
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,510
Ask if that's okay with her.

864
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:29,219
And if she says no,

865
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,219
try clinging on to her.

866
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:34,889
Tell her that you love her,

867
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:37,730
and tell her that again.

868
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:40,030
Try clinging to her until the end.

869
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,460
What's up with you? You're scaring me.

870
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,500
You said you'd regret letting her go for the rest of your life.

871
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,469
You should try whatever you can.

872
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,420
You haven't eaten, right?

873
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,820
No.

874
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,320
Ta-da. I shopped for groceries.

875
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,530
Let's have doenjang jjigae and rice.

876
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,760
Go to bed after you eat.

877
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:29,110
Your cooking skills are...

878
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,049
still the best.

879
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,650
Do I pass as someone you live with?

880
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,489
About the cohabitation contract.

881
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:40,519
I have two things I want to add.

882
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,320
First,

883
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,429
we should go grocery shopping and eat dinner together twice a week.

884
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,630
Second, we should recommend movies on streaming sites and watch them.

885
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,599
And if the rules become a hassle as we go on,

886
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:57,840
we can fix them whenever.

887
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,309
Do you want to add anything else?

888
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
Mi Eun.

889
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:10,989
I don't think I can do this.

890
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,500
Because of So Jin?

891
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,159
Even at this moment,

892
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:26,329
I'm only thinking about...

893
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:29,539
how nice it would be for her to be here. I'm sorry.

894
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,469
It's okay. I knew you'd feel that way.

895
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:40,250
Even in this cruel moment, I understand you.

896
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,420
Because I was like that.

897
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:48,889
I only saw your face in the faces of all the other men I met.

898
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,489
Yeon Woo.

899
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,860
If I had...

900
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:59,699
only confessed my feelings to you a little bit earlier,

901
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:04,809
would our relationship have changed?

902
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,019
I'll give you just one more chance.

903
01:00:16,219 --> 01:00:17,320
- Mi Eun. - No.

904
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,289
I'll wait for you just one more time.

905
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:26,190
And you should go to So Jin now to tell her how you truly feel.

906
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,500
But if things don't work out again this time,

907
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:35,769
come to me.

908
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,300
(Dear Han So Jin, Seo Kang Hoon)

909
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,440
What's up with this plant?

910
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:23,650
I should water it.

911
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,340
How much water does it need?

912
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:12,130
Yes?

913
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,320
What is it you have to say?

914
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:36,019
I know it's too late for you,

915
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:40,329
but I just had to say this.

916
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,829
I keep having the same dream lately.

917
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:49,699
I go back to the night we broke up,

918
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,570
and I keep making a different choice.

919
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:55,409
But when I open my eyes,

920
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,449
the reality is the same.

921
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,019
I'm worried that was the last time with you in my life...

922
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:04,820
and that I may have let that slip away.

923
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,659
I think I made the wrong choice.

924
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,699
Can you please...

925
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:18,829
give me another chance?

926
01:03:21,869 --> 01:03:23,840
Just like the selfish decision he made...

927
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,639
If only I hadn't made that decision back then...

928
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:31,610
I only hope that this decision doesn't return to me as regret.

929
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,710
Would I have not regretted it?

930
01:03:34,179 --> 01:03:35,219
I'm sorry.

931
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,750
From now on,

932
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,119
we should really go our separate ways.

933
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:46,760
Do you mean that?

934
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,030
If I were me from the past,

935
01:03:50,099 --> 01:03:52,399
I would've accepted you in this kind of situation.

936
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,630
But not now.

937
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:03,610
Do you love him? Kang Hoon?

938
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:06,349
If love is when my senses go wild,

939
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:09,619
I never loved Kang Hoon as a man.

940
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,349
But I've discovered that what I believed to be love until now...

941
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,860
was all wrong.

942
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:19,059
So,

943
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,059
I think this might be what real love is.

944
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,329
- So Jin, I... - Yeon Woo.

945
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,840
If you really love So Jin, let her go. That's love too.

946
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:58,599
Are you okay?

947
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,170
Yes.

948
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,480
I didn't think...

949
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,610
I'd say this in this kind of situation.

950
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,719
If not today,

951
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,250
I might be too late again.

952
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,489
So, I'm going to say it now.

953
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,289
- What? - I like you, So Jin.

954
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:27,929
No, I love you.

955
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,940
This is...

956
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:40,610
the most important treasure in my life.

957
01:05:42,409 --> 01:05:45,309
It's the fire hose I first grabbed when I went to work on scene.

958
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:49,849
Here.

959
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,630
To me,

960
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,599
you are that precious and special to me.

961
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:09,599
I know I can cherish you...

962
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,239
and be an even better man to you than now.

963
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:16,539
I will never make you cry like all the other guys.

964
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:21,750
So,

965
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,550
please come to me now.

966
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,880
- Oh, my! - Stand back. You might get hurt.

967
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,079
Oh, okay. I'll go get a broom.

968
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:26,010
(DNA Lover)

969
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:28,039
I wanted to prove my love...

970
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,880
with my DNA Lover Theory.

971
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:33,350
And there is a man who proves his love...

972
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,319
by protecting someone.

973
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,649
When the one you love looks at another,

974
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:41,760
many people tend to give up.

975
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,390
I prove my love by not giving up.

976
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:47,189
I'm going to go stay in the US.

977
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:48,800
I've concluded...

978
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:52,069
that giving up is the way for me to prove my love.

979
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:54,340
Dad, what's up with this plant?

980
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:56,270
A customer gave it to me as a present.

981
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:58,310
Someone broke it.

982
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,579
You were very lucky, weren't you?
