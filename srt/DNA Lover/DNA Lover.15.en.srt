It's good to see you all.

More people came to Sharing Hope Fundraiser...

12
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:47,519
than I had expected.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,789
Thank you.

14
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,460
I would like to introduce to you one of our hospital's prides.

15
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,060
It's this tree.

16
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,159
The tree you see here is a wish tree.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,298
If you write down a wish and hang it on here,

18
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,429
your wish will definitely come true,

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,299
just like how mine came true.

20
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,909
My wish is the same every year.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,340
I wish that I can be happy for a long time...

22
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,879
with my family, whom I love.

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,818
I hope your wishes can also come true...

24
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,819
through this wish tree.

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,420

I'm not a thief.

28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,330
You're the thief.

29
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:38,529
You stole my happiness.

30
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,929
(I will end that happiness with my own hands.)

31
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,770
I'll steal everything of yours so that you're left with nothing.

32

33
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,250
If you want to save her, come alone.

34
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,789

36
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,610
Yes, sister.

You're not Father Andrea, are you?

38
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:08,750
Who are you?

39
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,089
Why are you doing this to me? What is it that you want?

40
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm waiting for the person who will come to save you.

41
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,800
Let's wait together, sister.

42

I'm sure you're mistaken!

53
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,899
It must be my younger brother.

54
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,230
I have a twin brother who looks just like me.

55
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,628
I don't know where he is.

56
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,439
I haven't had contact with him in a while.

57
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,439
Darn it.

58
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,240
But...

59
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,379
my brother will get up to something bad again.

60
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,109
I can be sure of that.

61
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,649

then this is Ha Ga Hee's house.

106

He marked down the locations where he committed arson.

107
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,219
Then, this is our neighborhood. So Jin's house.

108
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,519
The location where he plans to commit arson.

109
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,490
Then, here and here...

110
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,549
are either places he already committed arson...

111
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,590

Please take a close look.

119
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,110
If you look at it,

120
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,819
it seems to be a map where he marked the locations...

121
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,279
of the arson cases he committed.

122
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,120
Every other place is either where he committed arson or planned one,

123
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,860
but I'm not sure about two locations.

124
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:08,059
One of them is Pojin City, and the other is Yeoncheong-gun.

125

Pojin City...

126
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,029
Do you suspect anything?

127
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,298
It must be the location of the camping site...

128
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,329
where he committed arson on the adoptive family...

129
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,370
who sent him back when he was 16.

130
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
What?

131
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,179
Then, that's somewhere he committed arson.

That was where Yi Myung first saw an arson case.

137
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,750
Pardon?

138
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:43,259
Yi Myung saw our mother pass away in a fire...

to my mom's greenhouse and broke all the flower pots,

161
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,750

What did you say?

165
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,360
Your family are a bunch of shameless thieves.

166
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,190
- Thieves? - Go! Go and ask.

167
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,929
Go and ask your mom what you stole from my family.

168
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,440
You said he was going to become our dad.

169
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,409
You said we were going to become a complete family.

170
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,879
Don't worry, Yi Myung.

171
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,820
That man is your father.

172
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,549
He'll get divorced soon and come to us.

173

176
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,509
You know...

177
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,210
how much he loves you guys and me, right?

178
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:18,120
What was your late father like? He hit you and So Myung every day.

179
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,589
It was a nightmare for all of us.

180
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,120

182

It's dirty and nasty.

183
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,658
What did you just say to me?

184
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,459
I'm going to go to him right away.

185
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,500
I'll go...

186
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:37,298
and tell him to get lost from our lives.

187
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,999
No, Yi Myung!

188
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,138
- Let go! - You can't!

189
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,870
- Let go of me! - No!

190
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,888
- Oh, dear! - Hurry up!

191
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,418
- Mom! - She's still in there!

192
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,229
- Mom! - No!

193
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,200
Let go of me! Mom!

194
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,599
Mom!

195
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,500
My mom died.

196
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,769
Because of you.

197
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,000
You remember, don't you?

198
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,640
You say that was because of me?

199
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,410
Of course it was.

200
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,409
If you hadn't come here, I wouldn't have known about that.

201
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,480
Then, my mom wouldn't have had to die.

202
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,778
Still, I'm not trying to kill you and get revenge...

203
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,390
because I'm so sad.

204
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,619
I was sad at first.

205
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,930
I was sad,

206
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,529
but as I looked on...

207
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,839
My mom was being purified in the fire.

208
00:17:49,509 --> 00:17:51,240
Bright, like a saint.

209
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,210
Blindingly bright.

210
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,150
Painfully.

211
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,480
It's a shame to make just my mom go through that.

212
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,089
Were you the one who made my father pass away too?

213
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,000
That's right! You should've asked me that sooner!

214
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,568
Your father, who was disloyal yet shameless all his life,

215
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,710
and Ha Ga Hee who got pregnant so she could have his money.

216
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,809
I bet all of them died while repenting in that fire.

217
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,940
Ha Ga Hee?

218
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,848
Why? Are you afraid?

219
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,410
Because your house and hospital will all become mine and Sinhon's?

220
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,650
Ga Hee and my baby died.

221
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,390
Wasn't their death an accident?

222
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,758
Crazy jerk.

223
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,489
I wasn't planning on doing that from the beginning,

224
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,200
but I didn't know that your mother would...

225
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,000
run into the fire.

226
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,009
Honey!

227
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,609
I was touched by...

228
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,150
how you doubted your mother.

229
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,759
What about you?

230
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,490
What did you do?

231
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,599
As you said, my mother ran into the fire.

232
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,599
She must've wanted to save my father.

233
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:28,869
Because she loved him.

234
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:30,039
But what about you?

235
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:33,680
What were you doing when your mother passed away?

236
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:35,279
Why?

237
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,980
Were you afraid of getting hurt?

238
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,578
Were you scared?

239
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,890
When your mother was dying in the hot fire?

240
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,258
- Shut it. - You couldn't even do anything...

241
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,789
except watch as the person you loved was dying.

242
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,990
But now, you're acting as if you're a psychopath...

243
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,500
and some great murderer. Doesn't it make you sick?

244
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,130
You're nothing but a pathetic and pitiful child...

245
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,140
who can't admit what he did wrong or overcome his trauma,

246
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,508
so you're just rambling on about nonsense, you fool.

247
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,209
Shut it!

248
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,949
No, please!

249
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,380
- Die. - Please stop!

250
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:12,249
Shut your mouth.

251
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,548
- Shut it. Die. - Please don't!

252
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,288
- Die! - Please!

253
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,960
Please, just stop.

254
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,309
I'm sorry, Sister Anna.

255
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,880
Why are you sorry, Father?

256
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,519
Everything that my brother has done...

257
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,420
I should've stopped it.

258
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,159
Even after Yi Myung was sent back by his adoptive family...

259
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,660
and went to prison for arson,

260
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,160
all I told him was to repent.

261
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,298
I know what you're thinking now.

262
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,230
Do you think that will be able to save you?

263
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,239
You can only be saved through repentance.

264
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,539
Please stop.

265
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I may be...

266
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,940
an even worse person than my brother.

267
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,049
I became a priest to repent for my brother's sins,

268
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,119
but actually, I was just running away.

269
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,859
To a place where I couldn't hear Yi Myung's voice.

270
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,500
You know,

271
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,970
I was able to overcome the self-blame and guilt...

272
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,670
which had been following me around for over ten years...

273
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,539
thanks to you, Father.

274
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,119
Just like how that incident was my fault,

275
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:00,420
this incident isn't your fault either, Father.

276
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,329
No.

277
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,329
Even if those things were our fault,

278
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,039
we just have to stop committing those sins from now on.

279
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,579
So Jin will be all right.

280
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,450
I'm sure...

281
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
she will be.

282
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,559
Are you okay?

283
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,730
I was beaten up too much...

284
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,700
to seem okay, wasn't I?

285
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
So,

286
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:51,309
why did you come here?

287
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,519
I know.

288
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,450
It's not like we communicated telepathically.

289
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:06,259
But that crazy buddy told me where you were.

290
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,730
Can you still make jokes in this kind of situation?

291
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,369
Why did you come to me when I was by the sea?

292
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
That was because...

293
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,210
It's the same thing.

294
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,740
You're here.

295
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:28,849
That's why I came here.

296
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,420
Even though there was no telepathy.

297
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,319
Even though...

298
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:38,019
you're not my DNA Lover.

299
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,240
I thought looking at the world through DNA...

300
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,680
would make life easier.

301
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,818
Mine was filled with misfortunes and unhappiness,

302
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,849
and I wasn't sure I could survive.

303
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,519
I believed that...

304
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,660
if all this was fate predestined by my DNA,

305
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:21,000
then one day, thanks to that DNA,

306
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,640
I'd become happy once again.

307
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,309
So I proved it with my DNA and those of the people around me,

308
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,209
and I even tried to enclose future incidents...

309
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,750
within my prediction range.

310
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:42,819
That's how I believed I'd be happy.

311
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,460
But...

312
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,859
whenever I see you,

313
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,869
my world that was built on DNA keeps crumbling.

314
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,539
You always fall outside my prediction range,

315
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:11,880
but I keep wanting to believe what you say.

316
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,150
- So Jin. - I know.

317
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,118
You don't believe things like this.

318
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,119
I do.

319
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,660
I wondered all the way here.

320
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,470
I lied and pretended to be your DNA Lover.

321
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,910
I kept hanging around you.

322
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Could that be what got you in danger?

323
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,710
I was full of regret.

324
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,420
I'm truly sorry...

325
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:52,319
I put you through all this.

326
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,660
No.

327
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,929
Yeon Woo. Actually, today I...

328
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,029
So I'll put everything back in place.

329
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:04,369
Let's get out of here alive.

330
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:12,009
Did either of our DNA say we'd die young?

331
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:16,809
Did it?

332
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,049
I think I read something.

333
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,789
No.

334
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,900
Hello, Mother. It's Mi Eun.

335
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,910
I greeted you once last time.

336
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,970
Do you remember?

337
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,339
I didn't come to see Yeon Woo today.

338
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:25,849
I heard you'd go to the US, so I came to say goodbye.

339
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:32,460
Promise me you'll get better there.

340
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,660
You'll miss Korean food.

341
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:43,230
I'll give Yeon Woo a list of good Korean restaurants.

342
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:51,778
Forget all the bad things that happened...

343
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,380
and live there happily with Yeon Woo.

344
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,329
Nurse!

345
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,430
Nurse!

346
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,180
Ms. Yeom. Do you hear me?

347
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,778
Do you know where you are?

348
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,980
Pick up.

349
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:36,619
The person you have reached is unavailable.

350
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,099
Yeon Woo, your mother's awake.

351
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,410
Call as soon as you get this. Your mother's waiting for you.

352
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:04,009
That's enough. Let her go.

353
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,579
She has nothing to do with me.

354
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,619
I'm the one you want to kill.

355
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,259
Both father and son are habitual liars.

356
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,859
What do you think? It's not bad, is it?

357
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,899
Father. I need to go to the restroom.

358
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,400
- Okay. - I won't be long.

359
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,089
Hello. I'm Yi Myung.

360
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,630
You remember, don't you? Shin Yi Myung.

361
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:01,269
Who could that be? I have no memory.

362
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,740
You don't remember me?

363
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,250
I don't know who you are, but could you excuse us?

364
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,579
I'm with my family.

365
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,269
Who was that?

366
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,970
A complete stranger.

367
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,200
I knew he wouldn't accept me as family,

368
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,240
but I was shocked to be called a stranger.

369
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,048
Don't you think...

370
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,450
your dad's way more of a jerk than me?

371
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,859
One last question.

372
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,029
I have a lot to tell you, but so little time.

373
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,269
You needed a family, didn't you?

374
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,579
I asked a question. Now answer.

375
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,049
No. I'm done answering.

376
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,920
You wasted the last question.

377
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:27,819
That's a lie.

378
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
What?

379
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Right.

380
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:35,499
Are you a good liar because you're also his son?

381
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
But you know,

382
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,339
lying isn't hereditary.

383
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,409
What trick is this?

384
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,910
You want to be happy.

385
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,539
You needed a family to love you.

386
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,318
I felt the same my whole life,

387
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,880
so I know the feeling.

388
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,250
See?

389
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,288
How can I let her go?

390
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,559
So Jin.

391
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,289
But you have a family.

392
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:05,599
Your twin brother.

393
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,160
Why do you think he became a priest?

394
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,869
You don't seem happy to see me at all.

395
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,869
I've been hearing your voice.

396
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,240
What sin are you going to commit now?

397
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,309
That's not a hallucination. You and I are one.

398
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,919
I know what it is you're thinking.

399
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,019
Do you think confessing your sins will save you?

400
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,689
I saw Mom's soul get saved...

401
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,559
as her body burned.

402
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,759
I'll cleanse everything my way.

403
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,170
I'll save people.

404
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,099
Do you think that will save you?

405
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,598
Atonement is the only way.

406
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,109
Please stop what you're doing.

407
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,170
Please.

408
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,709
While you set fires and kill people...

409
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,980
and justify it with your scars,

410
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,019
Father Andrea spent his whole life praying for the wound to heal.

411
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,818
You're twins who share the same DNA.

412
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:07,960
Don't you think you're too different?

413
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,460
Stop it, So Jin.

414
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,929
Hey. Talk to me instead.

415
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,460
She has nothing to do with it!

416
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,240
The accident.

417
00:33:30,349 --> 00:33:31,750
It wasn't your fault.

418
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,190
It was just an accident.

419
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,259
It was an accident,

420
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,329
and you're blaming yourself for your mother's death.

421
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:50,329
So what?

422
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:54,869
You want me to return to my family and live happily?

423
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,170
Yes.

424
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,309
Stop right here.

425
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,180
You can turn it back.

426
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,519
It's too late.

427
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,159
Four, three, two, one.

428
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,768
No! Help!

429
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,939
- So Jin. - Hurry!

430
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,969
So Jin!

431
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,190
So Jin, get yourself together. Are you okay?

432
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,619
Get it together.

433
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,198
- Oh, gosh. - Get up.

434
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,500
Let's go, So Jin.

435
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,670
Be careful. Keep walking.

436
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:45,348
- Yeon Woo... - So Jin. Go ahead.

437
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:46,380
You go first.

438
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,460
So Jin! Yeon Woo!

439
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:28,889
Kang Hoon.

440
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,179
Yi Myung.

441
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,619
Yi Myung.

442
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,598
- Yi Myung! - No!

443
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,229
- Yi Myung! - Stay here.

444
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,230
Yi Myung!

445
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,809
You must die to end this.

446
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,949
- Get out of here! - So Jin.

447
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,289
So Jin.

448
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,329
Careful.

449
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,630
So Jin.

450
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:44,500
So Jin! Are you okay?

451
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,569
- Are you all right? - So Jin.

452
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,768
- A Ri. - Yes?

453
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,038
Keep talking to her so she doesn't pass out, okay?

454
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,170
Okay.

455
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,738
Wake up, So Jin.

456
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:53,940
Stop him!

457
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,809
- Stop him. - Seo Kang Hoon!

458
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,210
I missed you, Mom.

459
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,750
Let's get out of here.

460
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:39,559
Live and pay for your crimes.

461
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:43,789
Let's go.

462
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,050
Shin Yi Myung.

463
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,889
Shin Yi Myung!

464
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,130
Stop them.

465
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,630
- Over here! - Okay.

466
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,538
- Excuse us. - Let us help.

467
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,669
- Wake up! - Hang on.

468
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,709
Let's take her.

469
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,239
- One, two, three. - Let's move her.

470
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,679
- Let's lift her. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

471
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,960
Where's my brother?

472
00:39:48,989 --> 00:39:50,889
Let's move in!

473
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,229
Stay here.

474
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,669
- Hey, get him. - My brother's in there.

475
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,828
- Yi Myung! - You can't go inside.

476
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,198
- Yi Myung! - You can't go.

477
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,739
- Yi Myung! - Grab him.

478
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,939
Yi Myung!

479
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,069
I said my brother's in there!

480
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,308
- Yi Myung! - Please don't do this.

481
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:07,609
- Are you okay? - Yi Myung!

482
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,649
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

483
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,480
- So Jin... - Yeon Woo!

484
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,078
- Take his legs. - Okay.

485
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,789
- Let's go. - One, two, three.

486
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,519
Excuse us! Coming through.

487
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,389
- Hey! - Move!

488
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,468
In Yeoncheon today, a man in his 30s...

489
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:34,800
set fire to a vinyl greenhouse...

490
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,739
before taking his own life.

491
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,678
Two were badly injured in the fire...

492
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,480
and taken to a hospital.

493
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,749
- The dead arsonist... - Coming through.

494
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,149
turned out to be the culprit...

495
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,149
- Can someone help? - of the studio apartment fire...

496
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,848
- One, two, three. - that killed a pregnant woman...

497
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,488
as well as the Seongbuk-dong incident,

498
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,360
which is truly shocking.

499
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:05,469
Yeon Woo.

500
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,070
No.

501
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,869
Yeon Woo!

502
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,178
Yeon Woo.

503
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,550
- So Jin. - Yeon Woo.

504
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,179
Yeon Woo. Is he okay?

505
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,849
He's in surgery.

506
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,789
Surgery?

507
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,460
You should stay in bed.

508
00:41:37,469 --> 00:41:38,630
Yeon Woo.

509
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,440
Yeon Woo.

510
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
No.

511
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:49,210
Yeon Woo.

512
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:52,780
Please. No.

513
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,820
Yeon Woo.

514
00:41:56,019 --> 00:41:57,550
Yeon Woo.

515
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,730
Please. Yeon Woo.

516
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,630
(Operating Center)

517
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,999
Are you Sim Yeon Woo's family?

518
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,799
Yes. He's okay, isn't he?

519
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,839
The other burns weren't serious,

520
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,169
but his right arm's was bad.

521
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,210
His muscles and ligaments were badly damaged.

522
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,009
We tried to preserve them through emergency surgery,

523
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,379
but we must see how things go.

524
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,549
The burn and inflammation must go down...

525
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,178
if we're to transplant ligaments or skin.

526
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,280
Did he regain consciousness?

527
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,089
His oxygen saturation dropped due to smoke inhalation,

528
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,559
so he's on a ventilator.

529
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:36,090
People usually wake up as their lungs clear.

530
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,829
But not Mr. Sim, which is odd.

531
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,340
So Jin.

532
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:25,309
You can go home tomorrow if you feel well enough.

533
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:28,408
I must go to the police station to give a statement.

534
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,948
This is red snow crab porridge.

535
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:32,449
Eat this if you don't like the hospital food.

536
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:34,018
Don't worry about me...

537
00:43:34,019 --> 00:43:36,750
and go home from the police station.

538
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,059
A Ri will come tomorrow with some clothes.

539
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,558
Both you and Yeon Woo are in hospital.

540
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,630
Do you think I can sleep well at home?

541
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,469
Ms. Jang said she'd come by tomorrow.

542
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,840
There's no one else to look after Yeon Woo.

543
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,369
You should still sleep.

544
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,139
We really can't have you getting sick too.

545
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,809
I heard you got stabbed.

546
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,650
I wasn't stabbed.

547
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,050
I'm all healed and well. Look.

548
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,019
Where were you hurt? How bad is it?

549
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:15,759
See? It was a bad cut, wasn't it?

550
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,289
It's not like that.

551
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:22,130
Don't mind me and focus on getting well.

552
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,440
Why did you come to me when I was by the sea?

553
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,110
It's the same thing.

554
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,639
You're here.

555
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:10,780
That's why I came here.

556
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,480
Even though there was no telepathy.

557
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,389
Even though...

558
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,889
you're not my DNA Lover.

559
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:31,699
Hello.

560
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,440
Oh, Yeon Woo?

561
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,369
(Registration and Payment)

562
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,250
(Room 506, Sim)

563
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:13,539
Yeon Woo.

564
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,510
Wake up, will you?

565
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,650
I still have...

566
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,190
a lot to tell you.

567
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,650
Hey.

568
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,590
Hey.

569
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,730
Hey.

570
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,730
Yeon Woo.

571
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,670
Are you all right? Are you awake?

572
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,069
How's So Jin?

573
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,440
She's fine.

574
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,909
Wait right here. I'll get the doctor.

575
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:31,249
My clothes are down there.

576
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,448
You're not done yet?

577
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,619
I'm almost done.

578
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,960
Come in.

579
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,369
Mom.

580
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,099
So Ri called.

581
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,909
I had an event in the area.

582
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,979
So I dropped by.

583
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,380
Does she have to talk like that?

584
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,110
Don't mind me. Finish what you were doing.

585
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,250
Yes. Please sit here.

586
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,819
We have drinks in the refrigerator. Do you want something...

587
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,489
No, I'm okay.

588
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,729
Kang Hoon told me...

589
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,428
that So Jin was almost killed several times by the kidnappers.

590
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:19,530
Incidents like this can become a trauma.

591
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,199
I'm worried.

592
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,750
I'm fine.

593
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,948
If things are tough, you can stay at my place.

594
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,150
For a month or two.

595
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:44,159
Well... I have to go overseas for work.

596
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:46,900
I need someone to take care of the puppies.

597
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,738
I'll be right back.

598
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,209
Why? I took care of the discharge procedures.

599
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,480
It's not that. Well...

600
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,579
I want to say goodbye.

601
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,090
Hold on. I'll be right back.

602
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,360
Kidnapped? Can you believe it?

603
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,559
What were the police doing?

604
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,900
Goodness.

605
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,699
How could...

606
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:27,739
Pardon?

607
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,268
What did you say?

608
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:30,969
Well...

609
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:34,539
I'll get going now.

610
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,949
Tell So Jin to eat something nutritious.

611
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:42,849
She looks awful.

612
00:49:52,429 --> 00:49:53,658
- So Jin. - Hey.

613
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,428
I was on my way to see you.

614
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:57,969
Yeon Woo just woke up.

615
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,570
What?

616
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,239
Yeon Woo.

617
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,449
So Jin.

618
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,149
Are you okay?

619
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,288
What did the doctors say? Your arm...

620
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:18,650
I think it's okay.

621
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,989
How about you?

622
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:24,429
I was so scared...

623
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,760
that you wouldn't make it.

624
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:41,110
I'm sorry that you got hurt because of me.

625
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:43,809
You don't need to be sorry.

626
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,250
It all happened because of me.

627
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Thank you...

628
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,449
for hanging on in there.

629
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,090
And...

630
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,420
for being alive.

631
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:06,328
What did they say about your arm?

632
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:08,599
Is it really okay?

633
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:11,969
It'll get better soon with reconstructive treatment.

634
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:13,679
Don't worry.

635
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,079
Once you recover, what happens after that?

636
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:28,420
Do you still plan...

637
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,130
to go to the US?

638
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,599
If you're...

639
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:41,300
leaving because of me,

640
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,940
I wanted to tell you not to.

641
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:52,179
I always thought I was the only one who got hurt in relationships,

642
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,679
but I thought I was the one...

643
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:58,690
who hurt you in this relationship.

644
00:52:00,019 --> 00:52:03,189
I was the one who suddenly entered your life,

645
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,630
and I was the one who asked to do the experiment.

646
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,199
So I no longer want...

647
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,070
things to be uncomfortable for you because of me.

648
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,070
I wasn't going to the US...

649
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,610
just because of you.

650
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:26,880
I said I'd put everything back in place.

651
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,849
And my mother...

652
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,190
and I...

653
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,460
want to start fresh...

654
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,559
in a new place.

655
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,360
Who knows?

656
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,869
Maybe I'll meet my real DNA lover there.

657
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,880
Yeon Woo. I...

658
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:01,079
You came.

659
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,690
"You came?" Don't you know you almost died?

660
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,448
What in the world happened? Are you okay?

661
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:08,090
As you can see, I'm fine.

662
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,760
I can't believe it. How could something like this happen?

663
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,460
Hey.

664
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,469
Who did this?

665
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,239
Should I teach them a lesson?

666
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,340
I'm in good form lately.

667
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:38,420
Where Yi Myung used to be was a book.

668
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,558
My Bible I didn't even notice he took.

669
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:46,389
(The Holy Bible)

670
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,860
In the place where everything burned,

671
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,369
only this book survived unscathed.

672
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:55,699
Could it be...

673
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,739
because he desperately wanted to return it to me?

674
00:54:04,949 --> 00:54:08,280
In your Bible, the word, "Father," is mentioned hundreds of times.

675
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,989
I had three fathers in my life.

676
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,289
Although they all left me in the end.

677
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:19,889
But my second father was a bit different.

678
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,730
He gave me a dream...

679
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,130
and cheered for my dream.

680
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,369
It was a short time,

681
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:33,309
but he was the one person I happily called father.

682
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:38,510
I wanted to ask him one last time.

683
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:42,119
Whether he really didn't remember me.

684
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,619
Whether I was really...

685
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,590
nothing to him.

686
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:49,789
Who...

687
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,238
How did you come here?

688
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,579
You told me to call you father.

689
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,409
Why didn't you say you had...

690
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,579
a wife and a son?

691
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,219
We're not even connected by blood. How am I your father?

692
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:27,158
What does something that happened 20 years ago...

693
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,460
have anything to do with me?

694
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,698
Did you know that Mother passed away?

695
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:35,800
I know.

696
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,009
I sponsored the orphanage...

697
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,739
so you and your brother could eat and grow up well.

698
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,250
I thought I made up for everything with that.

699
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,150
What more can I do?

700
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:52,789
Right.

701
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,619
Do you need money?

702
00:55:57,929 --> 00:55:59,590
If you were going to forget that easily,

703
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,799
why did you start something so meaningless?

704
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,729
If you don't leave right away, I'll call the police.

705
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,800
I never had a son like you.

706
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:09,969
So don't ever come to me again. Do you understand?

707
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,440
Get out.

708
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,449
I'll never come back again.

709
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:25,250
Goodbye, sir.

710
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:38,529
(I wanted to ask. Whether he really didn't remember me.)

711
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,070
(Whether I was really nothing to him.)

712
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,289
Come in.

713
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,489
- Hello. - Hello, Doctor.

714
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,630
How are you feeling? You must feel some pain.

715
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:09,099
It's bearable.

716
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,530
How am I looking?

717
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,138
The emergency treatment went well.

718
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,469
To tell you about your current condition,

719
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,908
you got a burn on your palm, and the muscle and ligament...

720
00:57:18,909 --> 00:57:22,238
connecting your elbow to your fingers were damaged.

721
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,150
That means you might see stiffening of the finger muscles.

722
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,448
Stiffening?

723
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:30,190
To explain it in simple terms,

724
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:34,389
you might not be able to move the damaged area.

725
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,959
Of course, in the worst-case scenario.

726
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,760
Not be able to move?

727
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,959
When will I start to see symptoms?

728
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,029
The stiffening might not happen right away,

729
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,869
but it could gradually get worse.

730
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,639
You should get specialized care at Sim General Hospital.

731
00:57:48,869 --> 00:57:50,809
They'll need to monitor your condition.

732
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,880
Yeon Woo.

733
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:05,750
You shouldn't stand up like that yet, Mom.

734
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,920
Did you...

735
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,229
Did you get hurt?

736
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,530
It's nothing.

737
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:13,900
Please sit.

738
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,110
I didn't know,

739
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:28,639
but I guess people suspected that I killed your dad.

740
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:32,280
I was told that the culprit was caught.

741
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,579
They want to hear what happened that day.

742
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:38,690
When you were unconscious,

743
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,889
you were always smiling. You didn't know that, did you?

744
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,530
I saw your dad in my dream.

745
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:54,840
Was it because of the sound of that music box?

746
00:58:57,809 --> 00:58:59,769
It's the piece I played...

747
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,409
on the first day I met your dad.

748
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:08,018
He was just as young and handsome...

749
00:59:08,019 --> 00:59:09,420
as he was the first day we met.

750
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:13,819
Your father said he fell for me when he came...

751
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,119
to my first solo recital.

752
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,599
He kept saying that in my dream.

753
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,829
Mi Eun gave you a nice gift.

754
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:25,769
Mi Eun?

755
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh, your friend?

756
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,638
She was pretty. She's the girl you like, isn't she?

757
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:32,639
She's a friend.

758
00:59:34,639 --> 00:59:35,639
Yeon Woo.

759
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,510
I resented...

760
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,179
your father so much.

761
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,179
But all I thought...

762
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,260
in that moment was that I should save him.

763
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,599
Honey!

764
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,030
Honey!

765
00:59:58,869 --> 00:59:59,869
Don't come.

766
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,138
Honey!

767
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:03,139
Honey.

768
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:17,719
That's how our last moments went.

769
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,920
Because we wanted to save each other,

770
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:25,889
we weren't afraid of dying at all.

771
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,999
Yeon Woo. Your hand!

772
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,239
- Your hand. - So Jin. Go first.

773
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,800
After that,

774
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:40,440
I got the courage to live my life.

775
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,050
The thing that was tying me down my whole life...

776
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,150
wasn't love.

777
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,019
It was resentment.

778
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,699
I'm almost all better, right?

779
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,469
What happened to your arm?

780
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:12,209
It's really nothing.

781
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,280
It looks like something.

782
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,510
This...

783
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:23,519
I'm sorry.

784
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,130
I wasn't a good mom.

785
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,130
The fact that I don't remember spending time with you...

786
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,099
means I didn't do anything for you.

787
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,719
It's all in the past.

788
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:03,460
And I've forgotten it all.

789
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:07,460
Have you really forgotten it all?

790
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,000
When you get out of the hospital,

791
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,940
make me home-cooked food.

792
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:16,900
Nothing too spicy.

793
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,280
Okay.

794
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:27,519
(Iroun Genetic Center)

795
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,860
I'm back here again.

796
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,130
On my way here,

797
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:44,829
I thought a lot about whether or not I was overstepping my bounds.

798
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:48,840
But I've changed a bit.

799
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,300
Yeon Woo...

800
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,110
will go to the US today on the 8pm flight.

801
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,750
I see.

802
01:03:02,619 --> 01:03:05,488
From this accident, I thought...

803
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:09,019
Yeon Woo might really love you.

804
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,759
He knows better than anyone...

805
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,159
that hands are everything to a surgeon.

806
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:17,599
But he gave up his hand for you.

807
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,369
That seems like a miracle.

808
01:03:23,869 --> 01:03:25,940
Gave up his hand?

809
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:30,280
Didn't you know?

810
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,780
Because of the burn,

811
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,449
Yeon Woo might not be able to hold a scalpel ever again.

812
01:03:37,889 --> 01:03:38,889
What?

813
01:03:40,389 --> 01:03:42,718
He definitely said it was okay...

814
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,929
I'm sure he didn't want to tell you.

815
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,960
You said it was the 8pm flight, right?

816
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:58,369
Attention, please. Announcement for the flight...

817
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,849
Why? Are you waiting for someone?

818
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,309
Oh, no.

819
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:11,389
Doctor.

820
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:12,848
Hello.

821
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,059
Ms. Yoo.

822
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:17,889
This is my mother.

823
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:19,059
- Hello. - Hello.

824
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,929
My princess. You've gotten so healthy.

825
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:26,029
You can't travel overseas yet...

826
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,840
We're not going anywhere.

827
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:33,569
As soon as I heard from Yo Han that you were going to the US,

828
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,840
I came running.

829
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,880
So Pu Reum could see you.

830
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:43,949
We might not be able to meet again.

831
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:47,150
What are you talking about? We can do video calls.

832
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,359
Pu Reum. Let's see each other every year.

833
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,488
Until then, you need to stay healthy, okay?

834
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,900
Pu Reum and I...

835
01:04:56,929 --> 01:04:58,670
will never be able to forget you.

836
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Ever.

837
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:05,469
Same for me.

838
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,480
Thank you.

839
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,489
Make sure to see Yeon Woo.

840
01:05:19,389 --> 01:05:22,260
Yeon Woo having a woman he can never forget about.

841
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,289
That would bother me even more.

842
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,000
Sir. Please drive a bit faster.

843
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,709
(Departures)

844
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:40,638
Attention, please.

845
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,380
Southwest Airlines...

846
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,110
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

847
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,309
I think we need to head in now.

848
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:49,349
- Is it already time? - Yes.

849
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:40,170
Yeon Woo said...

850
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:44,909
that he learned about love because of Han So Jin.

851
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,079
So make sure to meet Yeon Woo...

852
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,610
and say what you want to say, So Jin.

853
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:04,289
Yeon Woo.

854
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,230
Yeon Woo.

855
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:09,260
Yeon Woo!

856
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:15,000
No way. Yeon Woo.

857
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:18,039
Yeon Woo.

858
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,010
Yeon Woo.

859
01:07:30,889 --> 01:07:32,489
Yeon Woo.

860
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,269
Yeon Woo.

861
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:32,810
(DNA Lover)

862
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:35,818
You gave your soul to loving one woman.

863
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:37,419
It's a successful life.

864
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,289
I hope Doctor Sim arrived safely.

865
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,619
I'm sure he'll be fine there.

866
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,960
If someone engineers life using DNA,

867
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:49,500
there will be people you shouldn't meet.

868
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:53,868
I guess everyone from Sim Hospital is coming today.

869
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:55,670
I think so.

870
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:58,210
In coincidence, there is providence.

871
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:01,408
And there are genes that affect providence.

872
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:03,640
DNA lovers that the universe supports...

873
01:09:03,909 --> 01:09:06,479
always meet in the end.
