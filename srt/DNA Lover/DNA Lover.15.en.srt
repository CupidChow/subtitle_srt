Thank you.

00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:24,692
I would like to introduce to you one of our hospital's prides.

It's this tree.

11
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:29,368
The tree you see here is a wish tree.

12
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:32,230
If you write down a wish and hang it on here,

13
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:35,538
your wish will definitely come true,

14
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:37,531
just like how mine came true.

15
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:42,141
My wish is the same every year.

16
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:45,572
I wish that I can be happy for a long time...

17
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:49,111
with my family, whom I love.

18
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:52,750
I hope your wishes can also come true...

19
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:56,051
through this wish tree.

20
00:00:56,352 --> 00:00:57,652

00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,562
You're the thief.

24
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:11,579
You stole my happiness.

25
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:15,861
(I will end that happiness with my own hands.)

26
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:19,002
I'll steal everything of yours so that you're left with nothing.

You're not Father Andrea, are you?

33

Who are you?

34
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:45,021
Why are you doing this to me? What is it that you want?

35
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:47,692
I'm waiting for the person who will come to save you.

36
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:54,032
Let's wait together, sister.

It must be my younger brother.

49
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:01,437
I have a twin brother who looks just like me.

50
00:05:01,461 --> 00:05:02,560
I don't know where he is.

51
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,671
I haven't had contact with him in a while.

54
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,611
my brother will get up to something bad again.

He marked down the locations where he committed arson.

102
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,151
Then, this is our neighbourhood. So Jin's house.

The location where he plans to commit arson.

104

Then, here and here...

105
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,781
are either places he already committed arson...

Please take a close look.

114

If you look at it,

115
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,751
it seems to be a map where he marked the locations...

116
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,228
of the arson cases he committed.

117
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:36,228
Every other place is either where he committed arson or planned one,

118
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:38,092
but I'm not sure about two locations.

119
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,291
One of them is Pojin City, and the other is Yeoncheong-gun.

- Thieves? - Go! Go and ask.

162
00:14:56,292 --> 00:15:00,161
Go and ask your mom what you stole from my family.

163

You said he was going to become our dad.

164

Don't worry, Yi Myung.

166

167
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:22,781
He'll get divorced soon and come to us.

172
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,442
how much he loves you guys and me, right?

173
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:51,352
What was your late father like? He hit you and So Myung every day.

174

175

179
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,391
I'm going to go to him right away.

180
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,732
I'll go...

181
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,230
and tell him to get lost from our lives.

182
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,931

00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,820
- Oh, dear! - Hurry up!

186
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:33,350
- Mom! - She's still in there!

187
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,161
- Mom! - No!

188
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:38,432
Let go of me! Mom!

189
00:16:38,461 --> 00:16:39,831
Mom!

190
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:42,732
My mom died.

191
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:45,001
Because of you.

192
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:47,048
You remember, don't you?

193
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,872
You say that was because of me?

194
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:50,642
Of course it was.

195
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:53,341
If you hadn't come here, I wouldn't have known about that.

196
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:55,712
Then, my mom wouldn't have had to die.

197
00:16:56,412 --> 00:16:58,710
Still, I'm not trying to kill you and get revenge...

198
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:01,622
because I'm so sad.

199
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:05,851
I was sad at first.

200
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,162
I was sad,

201
00:17:11,132 --> 00:17:12,761
but as I looked on...

202
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:20,071
My mom was being purified in the fire.

203
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,472
Bright, like a saint.

204
00:17:24,872 --> 00:17:26,442
Blindingly bright.

205
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:28,382
Painfully.

206
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:33,712
It's a shame to make just my mom go through that.

207
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:41,321
Were you the one who made my father pass away too?

208
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,232
That's right! You should've asked me that sooner!

209
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:51,500
Your father, who was disloyal yet shameless all his life,

210
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:54,942
and Ha Ga Hee who got pregnant so she could have his money.

211
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,848
I bet all of them died while repenting in that fire.

212
00:17:57,872 --> 00:17:59,148
Ha Ga Hee?

213
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:00,780
Why? Are you afraid?

214
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,642
Because your house and hospital will all become mine and Sinhon's?

215
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:09,882
Ga Hee and my baby died.

216
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,622
Wasn't their death an accident?

217
00:18:13,352 --> 00:18:14,690
Crazy jerk.

218
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,421
I wasn't planning on doing that from the beginning,

219
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:19,432
but I didn't know that your mother would...

220
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,232
run into the fire.

221
00:18:30,201 --> 00:18:32,241
Honey!

222
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,841
I was touched by...

223
00:18:36,312 --> 00:18:38,382
how you doubted your mother.

224
00:18:43,682 --> 00:18:44,991
What about you?

225
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,722
What did you do?

226
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:54,831
As you said, my mother ran into the fire.

227
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,831
She must've wanted to save my father.

228
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,917
Because she loved him.

229
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,271
But what about you?

230
00:19:04,441 --> 00:19:06,912
What were you doing when your mother passed away?

231
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,511
Why?

232
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,212
Were you afraid of getting hurt?

233
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,510
Were you scared?

234
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,122
When your mother was dying in the hot fire?

235
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:18,190
- Shut it. - You couldn't even do anything...

236
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,838
except watch as the person you loved was dying.

237
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:23,222
But now, you're acting as if you're a psychopath...

238
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:26,732
and some great murderer. Doesn't it make you sick?

239
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:30,362
You're nothing but a pathetic and pitiful child...

240
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:34,372
who can't admit what he did wrong or overcome his trauma,

241
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,440
so you're just rambling on about nonsense, you fool.

242
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,141
Shut it!

243
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,881
No, please!

244
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,612
- Die. - Please stop!

245
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,181
Shut your mouth.

246
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,480
- Shut it. Die. - Please don't!

247
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:49,220
- Die! - Please!

248
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,192
Please, just stop.

249
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,541
I'm sorry, Sister Anna.

250
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:15,112
Why are you sorry, Father?

251
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:18,751
Everything that my brother has done...

252
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,652
I should've stopped it.

253
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,091
Even after Yi Myung was sent back by his adoptive family...

254
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,892
and went to prison for arson,

255
00:20:30,392 --> 00:20:32,267
all I told him was to repent.

256
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,230
I know what you're thinking now.

257
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,277
Do you think that will be able to save you?

258
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,171
You can only be saved through repentance.

259
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,771
Please stop.

260
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,472
I may be...

261
00:20:44,672 --> 00:20:47,172
an even worse person than my brother.

262
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:53,281
I became a priest to repent for my brother's sins,

263
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:59,351
but actually, I was just running away.

264
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,091
To a place where I couldn't hear Yi Myung's voice.

265
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:07,732
You know,

266
00:21:10,362 --> 00:21:12,202
I was able to overcome the self-blame and guilt...

267
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,902
which had been following me around for over ten years...

268
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:20,771
thanks to you, Father.

269
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,351
Just like how that incident was my fault,

270
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:33,652
this incident isn't your fault either, Father.

271
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,561
No.

272
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:40,561
Even if those things were our fault,

273
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:46,271
we just have to stop committing those sins from now on.

274
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,811
So Jin will be all right.

275
00:21:55,342 --> 00:21:56,682
I'm sure...

276
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,351
she will be.

277
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,791
Are you okay?

278
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,962
I was beaten up too much...

279
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,932
to seem okay, wasn't I?

280
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,472
So,

281
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,541
why did you come here?

282
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,751
I know.

283
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:34,682
It's not like we communicated telepathically.

284
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:39,491
But that crazy buddy told me where you were.

285
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,962
Can you still make jokes in this kind of situation?

286
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:50,601
Why did you come to me when I was by the sea?

287
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:53,872
That was because...

288
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,442
It's the same thing.

289
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,972
You're here.

290
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,081
That's why I came here.

291
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,652
Even though there was no telepathy.

292
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,551
Even though...

293
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,251
you're not my DNA Lover.

294
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:30,472
I thought looking at the world through DNA...

295
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,912
would make life easier.

296
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:40,750
Mine was filled with misfortunes and unhappiness,

297
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,081
and I wasn't sure I could survive.

298
00:23:45,221 --> 00:23:46,751
I believed that...

299
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,892
if all this was fate predestined by my DNA,

300
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,232
then one day, thanks to that DNA,

301
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,872
I'd become happy once again.

302
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:04,541
So I proved it with my DNA and those of the people around me,

303
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:08,141
and I even tried to enclose future incidents...

304
00:24:08,142 --> 00:24:10,982
within my prediction range.

305
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:16,051
That's how I believed I'd be happy.

306
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,692
But...

307
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:26,091
whenever I see you,

308
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:32,101
my world that was built on DNA keeps crumbling.

309
00:24:35,971 --> 00:24:39,771
You always fall outside my prediction range,

310
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:45,112
but I keep wanting to believe what you say.

311
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:49,382
- So Jin. - I know.

312
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,050
You don't believe things like this.

313
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:53,351
I do.

314
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,892
I wondered all the way here.

315
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:06,702
I lied and pretended to be your DNA Lover.

316
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:11,142
I kept hanging around you.

317
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,212
Could that be what got you in danger?

318
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,942
I was full of regret.

319
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,652
I'm truly sorry...

320
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,551
I put you through all this.

321
00:25:27,322 --> 00:25:28,892
No.

322
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:30,861
Yeon Woo. Actually, today I...

323
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,261
So I'll put everything back in place.

324
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,601
Let's get out of here alive.

325
00:25:41,471 --> 00:25:45,241
Did either of our DNA say we'd die young?

326
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,041
Did it?

327
00:25:51,812 --> 00:25:53,281
I think I read something.

328
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,021
No.

329
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:46,132
Hello, Mother. It's Mi Eun.

330
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:49,142
I greeted you once last time.

331
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:51,202
Do you remember?

332
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:54,571
I didn't come to see Yeon Woo today.

333
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:59,081
I heard you'd go to the US, so I came to say goodbye.

334
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:05,692
Promise me you'll get better there.

335
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:12,737
You'll miss Korean food.

336
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:16,462
I'll give Yeon Woo a list of good Korean restaurants.

337
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,710
Forget all the bad things that happened...

338
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,612
and live there happily with Yeon Woo.

339
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:48,561
Nurse!

340
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,662
Nurse!

341
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:03,412
Ms. Yeom. Do you hear me?

342
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,710
Do you know where you are?

343
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:07,212
Pick up.

344
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,851
The person you have reached is unavailable.

345
00:28:22,932 --> 00:28:25,331
Yeon Woo, your mother's awake.

346
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:28,642
Call as soon as you get this. Your mother's waiting for you.

347
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,241
That's enough. Let her go.

348
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:39,811
She has nothing to do with me.

349
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,851
I'm the one you want to kill.

350
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,491
Both father and son are habitual liars.

351
00:28:50,322 --> 00:28:54,091
What do you think? It's not bad, is it?

352
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,831
Father. I need to go to the restroom.

353
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:01,632
- Okay. - I won't be long.

354
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:18,321
Hello. I'm Yi Myung.

355
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,862
You remember, don't you? Shin Yi Myung.

356
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:34,501
Who could that be? I have no memory.

357
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:39,972
You don't remember me?

358
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:43,482
I don't know who you are, but could you excuse us?

359
00:29:43,711 --> 00:29:45,811
I'm with my family.

360
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:02,338
Who was that?

361
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,202
A complete stranger.

362
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:07,432
I knew he wouldn't accept me as family,

363
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,472
but I was shocked to be called a stranger.

364
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:14,980
Don't you think...

365
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:17,682
your dad's way more of a jerk than me?

366
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:35,091
One last question.

367
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:38,261
I have a lot to tell you, but so little time.

368
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,501
You needed a family, didn't you?

369
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,811
I asked a question. Now answer.

370
00:30:55,182 --> 00:30:57,058
No. I'm done answering.

371
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,152
You wasted the last question.

372
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:01,051
That's a lie.

373
00:31:02,392 --> 00:31:03,392
What?

374
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:04,692
Right.

375
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:08,431
Are you a good liar because you're also his son?

376
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,732
But you know,

377
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:12,571
lying isn't hereditary.

378
00:31:14,632 --> 00:31:16,341
What trick is this?

379
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,142
You want to be happy.

380
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:21,771
You needed a family to love you.

381
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:25,250
I felt the same my whole life,

382
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:27,112
so I know the feeling.

383
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:30,482
See?

384
00:31:30,751 --> 00:31:32,220
How can I let her go?

385
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,667
So Jin.

386
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,521
But you have a family.

387
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,831
Your twin brother.

388
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,392
Why do you think he became a priest?

389
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,101
You don't seem happy to see me at all.

390
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,101
I've been hearing your voice.

391
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:53,247
What sin are you going to commit now?

392
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,541
That's not a hallucination. You and I are one.

393
00:31:57,711 --> 00:31:59,851
I know what it is you're thinking.

394
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:03,251
Do you think confessing your sins will save you?

395
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,621
I saw Mom's soul get saved...

396
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,791
as her body burned.

397
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,991
I'll cleanse everything my way.

398
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:16,138
I'll save people.

399
00:32:16,162 --> 00:32:18,331
Do you think that will save you?

400
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,530
Atonement is the only way.

401
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:22,341
Please stop what you're doing.

402
00:32:23,102 --> 00:32:24,247
Please.

403
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,641
While you set fires and kill people...

404
00:32:26,642 --> 00:32:29,212
and justify it with your scars,

405
00:32:29,842 --> 00:32:34,251
Father Andrea spent his whole life praying for the wound to heal.

406
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,750
You're twins who share the same DNA.

407
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:41,167
Don't you think you're too different?

408
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:42,692
Stop it, So Jin.

409
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,861
Hey. Talk to me instead.

410
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:47,692
She has nothing to do with it!

411
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,472
The accident.

412
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,982
It wasn't your fault.

413
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,422
It was just an accident.

414
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:12,491
It was an accident,

415
00:33:13,721 --> 00:33:17,561
and you're blaming yourself for your mother's death.

416
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:23,561
So what?

417
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:28,101
You want me to return to my family and live happily?

418
00:33:30,102 --> 00:33:31,402
Yes.

419
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:33,541
Stop right here.

420
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:36,412
You can turn it back.

421
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,751
It's too late.

422
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:27,391
Four, three, two, one.

423
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,700
No! Help!

424
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:35,871
- So Jin. - Hurry!

425
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:37,201
So Jin!

426
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,422
So Jin, get yourself together. Are you okay?

427
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:51,851
Get it together.

428
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,130
- Oh, gosh. - Get up.

429
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,732
Let's go, So Jin.

430
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,902
Be careful. Keep walking.

431
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,280
- Yeon Woo... - So Jin. Go ahead.

432
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,612
You go first.

433
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,692
So Jin! Yeon Woo!

434
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,121
Kang Hoon.

435
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:25,411
Yi Myung.

436
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:30,851
Yi Myung.

437
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,530
- Yi Myung! - No!

438
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,161
- Yi Myung! - Stay here.

439
00:36:41,162 --> 00:36:42,462
Yi Myung!

440
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:52,041
You must die to end this.

441
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,958
- Get out of here! - So Jin.

442
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:06,521
So Jin.

443
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:11,561
Careful.

444
00:37:13,562 --> 00:37:14,862
So Jin.

445
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,732
So Jin! Are you okay?

446
00:37:17,801 --> 00:37:19,501
- Are you all right? - So Jin.

447
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:20,700
- A Ri. - Yes?

448
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,970
Keep talking to her so she doesn't pass out, okay?

449
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:24,177
Okay.

450
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,670
Wake up, So Jin.

451
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:26,947
Stop him!

452
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:29,041
- Stop him. - Seo Kang Hoon!

453
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:02,442
I missed you, Mom.

454
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:10,982
Let's get out of here.

455
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:12,791
Live and pay for your crimes.

456
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,021
Let's go.

457
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,282
Shin Yi Myung.

458
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,121
Shin Yi Myung!

459
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,362
Stop them.

460
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:58,862
- Over here! - Okay.

461
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,470
- Excuse us. - Let us help.

462
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:03,601
- Wake up! - Hang on.

463
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:04,641
Let's take her.

464
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,471
- One, two, three. - Let's move her.

465
00:39:08,372 --> 00:39:10,911
- Let's lift her. One, two, three. - One, two, three.

466
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,192
Where's my brother?

467
00:39:21,921 --> 00:39:24,121
Let's move in!

468
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,161
Stay here.

469
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,601
- Hey, get him. - My brother's in there.

470
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:31,760
- Yi Myung! - You can't go inside.

471
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:33,130
- Yi Myung! - You can't go.

472
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,808
- Yi Myung! - Grab him.

473
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:35,871
Yi Myung!

474
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:38,001
I said my brother's in there!

475
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,240
- Yi Myung! - Please don't do this.

476
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:40,541
- Are you okay? - Yi Myung!

477
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,581
Are you all right? Were you hurt?

478
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:44,712
- So Jin... - Yeon Woo!

479
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:47,010
- Take his legs. - Okay.

480
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,998
- Let's go. - One, two, three.

481
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,751
Excuse us! Coming through.

482
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,621
- Hey! - Move!

483
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,400
In Yeoncheon today, a man in his 30s...

484
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:07,947
set fire to a vinyl greenhouse...

485
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,947
before taking his own life.

486
00:40:10,971 --> 00:40:13,610
Two were badly injured in the fire...

487
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,518
and taken to a hospital.

488
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:16,681
- The dead arsonist... - Coming through.

489
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:19,081
turned out to be the culprit...

490
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:21,081
- Can someone help? - of the studio apartment fire...

491
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,780
- One, two, three. - that killed a pregnant woman...

492
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:26,420
as well as the Seongbuk-dong incident,

493
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:28,592
which is truly shocking.

494
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,701
Yeon Woo.

495
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,302
No.

496
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:42,101
Yeon Woo!

497
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:49,110
Yeon Woo.

498
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:50,782
- So Jin. - Yeon Woo.

499
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,411
Yeon Woo. Is he okay?

500
00:40:55,312 --> 00:40:57,081
He's in surgery.

501
00:40:58,582 --> 00:41:00,021
Surgery?

502
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,692
You should stay in bed.

503
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,862
Yeon Woo.

504
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:13,672
Yeon Woo.

505
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:15,732
No.

506
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:22,442
Yeon Woo.

507
00:41:23,281 --> 00:41:26,012
Please. No.

508
00:41:26,212 --> 00:41:28,052
Yeon Woo.

509
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:30,782
Yeon Woo.

510
00:41:32,392 --> 00:41:35,962
Please. Yeon Woo.

511
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:39,562
(Operating Center)

512
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:42,931
Are you Sim Yeon Woo's family?

513
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:45,731
Yes. He's okay, isn't he?

514
00:41:45,732 --> 00:41:47,771
The other burns weren't serious,

515
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,101
but his right arm's was bad.

516
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,442
His muscles and ligaments were badly damaged.

517
00:41:51,571 --> 00:41:53,941
We tried to preserve them through emergency surgery,

518
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:55,311
but we must see how things go.

519
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,481
The burn and inflammation must go down...

520
00:41:57,482 --> 00:41:59,110
if we're to transplant ligaments or skin.

521
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:01,328
Did he regain consciousness?

522
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,021
His oxygen saturation dropped due to smoke inhalation,

523
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,791
so he's on a ventilator.

524
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:09,138
People usually wake up as their lungs clear.

525
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:12,061
But not Mr. Sim, which is odd.

526
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:52,572
So Jin.

527
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:58,541
You can go home tomorrow if you feel well enough.

528
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:01,340
I must go to the police station to give a statement.

529
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:02,880
This is red snow crab porridge.

530
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,418
Eat this if you don't like the hospital food.

531
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,950
Don't worry about me...

532
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,982
and go home from the police station.

533
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:13,291
A Ri will come tomorrow with some clothes.

534
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,490
Both you and Yeon Woo are in hospital.

535
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:19,862
Do you think I can sleep well at home?

536
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,701
Ms. Jang said she'd come by tomorrow.

537
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,072
There's no one else to look after Yeon Woo.

538
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:29,518
You should still sleep.

539
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:32,371
We really can't have you getting sick too.

540
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:36,041
I heard you got stabbed.

541
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:38,882
I wasn't stabbed.

542
00:43:39,252 --> 00:43:41,282
I'm all healed and well. Look.

543
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:44,251
Where were you hurt? How bad is it?

544
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,691
See? It was a bad cut, wasn't it?

545
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:51,521
It's not like that.

546
00:43:51,991 --> 00:43:55,362
Don't mind me and focus on getting well.

547
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:34,672
Why did you come to me when I was by the sea?

548
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:37,342
It's the same thing.

549
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,871
You're here.

550
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:44,012
That's why I came here.

551
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:47,712
Even though there was no telepathy.

552
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:49,621
Even though...

553
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:53,121
you're not my DNA Lover.

554
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:04,931
Hello.

555
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:07,672
Oh, Yeon Woo?

556
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:12,542
(Registration and Payment)

557
00:45:22,704 --> 00:45:24,182
(Room 506, Sim)

558
00:45:45,471 --> 00:45:46,771
Yeon Woo.

559
00:45:47,741 --> 00:45:49,742
Wake up, will you?

560
00:45:52,582 --> 00:45:53,882
I still have...

561
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:58,422
a lot to tell you.

562
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:30,882
Hey.

563
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:33,822
Hey.

564
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:39,962
Hey.

565
00:46:40,662 --> 00:46:41,962
Yeon Woo.

566
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:45,902
Are you all right? Are you awake?

567
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:47,001
How's So Jin?

568
00:46:47,002 --> 00:46:48,478
She's fine.

569
00:46:48,502 --> 00:46:51,141
Wait right here. I'll get the doctor.

570
00:47:03,082 --> 00:47:04,181
My clothes are down there.

571
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:05,380
You're not done yet?

572
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:06,851
I'm almost done.

573
00:47:06,892 --> 00:47:08,192
Come in.

574
00:47:17,232 --> 00:47:19,478
Mom.

575
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:21,331
So Ri called.

576
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,141
I had an event in the area.

577
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,911
So I dropped by.

578
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:27,612
Does she have to talk like that?

579
00:47:28,642 --> 00:47:31,342
Don't mind me. Finish what you were doing.

580
00:47:34,212 --> 00:47:36,482
Yes. Please sit here.

581
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:40,751
We have drinks in the refrigerator. Do you want something...

582
00:47:40,752 --> 00:47:42,721
No, I'm okay.

583
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:45,661
Kang Hoon told me...

584
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:49,360
that So Jin was almost killed several times by the kidnappers.

585
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:52,762
Incidents like this can become a trauma.

586
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:54,431
I'm worried.

587
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,918
I'm fine.

588
00:48:03,942 --> 00:48:05,880
If things are tough, you can stay at my place.

589
00:48:05,881 --> 00:48:07,382
For a month or two.

590
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:17,237
Well... I have to go overseas for work.

591
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,132
I need someone to take care of the puppies.

592
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:35,670
I'll be right back.

593
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:38,141
Why? I took care of the discharge procedures.

594
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:40,658
It's not that. Well...

595
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:42,627
I want to say goodbye.

596
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:45,322
Hold on. I'll be right back.

597
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:53,592
Kidnapped? Can you believe it?

598
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,791
What were the police doing?

599
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,132
Goodness.

600
00:48:57,562 --> 00:48:58,931
How could...

601
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:00,808
Pardon?

602
00:49:00,832 --> 00:49:02,200
What did you say?

603
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,201
Well...

604
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,771
I'll get going now.

605
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:13,181
Tell So Jin to eat something nutritious.

606
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:16,081
She looks awful.

607
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:26,590
- So Jin. - Hey.

608
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,360
I was on my way to see you.

609
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:31,201
Yeon Woo just woke up.

610
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:32,802
What?

611
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:42,471
Yeon Woo.

612
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,681
So Jin.

613
00:49:46,812 --> 00:49:48,081
Are you okay?

614
00:49:48,082 --> 00:49:50,220
What did the doctors say? Your arm...

615
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,882
I think it's okay.

616
00:49:52,692 --> 00:49:54,221
How about you?

617
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:57,661
I was so scared...

618
00:49:58,062 --> 00:49:59,992
that you wouldn't make it.

619
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:14,342
I'm sorry that you got hurt because of me.

620
00:50:14,841 --> 00:50:17,041
You don't need to be sorry.

621
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,482
It all happened because of me.

622
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:21,152
Thank you...

623
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:23,681
for hanging on in there.

624
00:50:24,022 --> 00:50:25,322
And...

625
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:27,652
for being alive.

626
00:50:36,031 --> 00:50:39,260
What did they say about your arm?

627
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:41,831
Is it really okay?

628
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:45,201
It'll get better soon with reconstructive treatment.

629
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:46,911
Don't worry.

630
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:54,311
Once you recover, what happens after that?

631
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,652
Do you still plan...

632
00:51:02,591 --> 00:51:04,362
to go to the US?

633
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,831
If you're...

634
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,532
leaving because of me,

635
00:51:15,332 --> 00:51:18,172
I wanted to tell you not to.

636
00:51:21,272 --> 00:51:25,411
I always thought I was the only one who got hurt in relationships,

637
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,911
but I thought I was the one...

638
00:51:29,551 --> 00:51:31,922
who hurt you in this relationship.

639
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:36,121
I was the one who suddenly entered your life,

640
00:51:36,122 --> 00:51:38,862
and I was the one who asked to do the experiment.

641
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:41,431
So I no longer want...

642
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:44,302
things to be uncomfortable for you because of me.

643
00:51:48,832 --> 00:51:50,302
I wasn't going to the US...

644
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,842
just because of you.

645
00:51:56,741 --> 00:52:00,112
I said I'd put everything back in place.

646
00:52:00,352 --> 00:52:02,081
And my mother...

647
00:52:02,582 --> 00:52:04,422
and I...

648
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,692
want to start fresh...

649
00:52:07,951 --> 00:52:09,791
in a new place.

650
00:52:13,261 --> 00:52:14,592
Who knows?

651
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:19,101
Maybe I'll meet my real DNA lover there.

652
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,112
Yeon Woo. I...

653
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,058
You came.

654
00:52:34,082 --> 00:52:36,922
"You came?" Don't you know you almost died?

655
00:52:37,022 --> 00:52:39,380
What in the world happened? Are you okay?

656
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:41,322
As you can see, I'm fine.

657
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:46,992
I can't believe it. How could something like this happen?

658
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:49,692
Hey.

659
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,607
Who did this?

660
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:54,471
Should I teach them a lesson?

661
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:56,572
I'm in good form lately.

662
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:11,652
Where Yi Myung used to be was a book.

663
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:16,490
My Bible I didn't even notice he took.

664
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,399
(The Holy Bible)

665
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:22,092
In the place where everything burned,

666
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,601
only this book survived unscathed.

667
00:53:27,171 --> 00:53:28,848
Could it be...

668
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,971
because he desperately wanted to return it to me?

669
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,512
In your Bible, the word, "Father," is mentioned hundreds of times.

670
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:45,221
I had three fathers in my life.

671
00:53:45,852 --> 00:53:48,521
Although they all left me in the end.

672
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:53,121
But my second father was a bit different.

673
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:55,962
He gave me a dream...

674
00:53:56,031 --> 00:53:58,362
and cheered for my dream.

675
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:01,601
It was a short time,

676
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:06,541
but he was the one person I happily called father.

677
00:54:08,042 --> 00:54:11,742
I wanted to ask him one last time.

678
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:15,351
Whether he really didn't remember me.

679
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:17,851
Whether I was really...

680
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:20,822
nothing to him.

681
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:23,021
Who...

682
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:39,170
How did you come here?

683
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:41,811
You told me to call you father.

684
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:45,641
Why didn't you say you had...

685
00:54:46,352 --> 00:54:47,811
a wife and a son?

686
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,451
We're not even connected by blood. How am I your father?

687
00:54:58,221 --> 00:55:00,090
What does something that happened 20 years ago...

688
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:01,692
have anything to do with me?

689
00:55:04,131 --> 00:55:07,630
Did you know that Mother passed away?

690
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:09,032
I know.

691
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,941
I sponsored the orphanage...

692
00:55:10,942 --> 00:55:14,971
so you and your brother could eat and grow up well.

693
00:55:16,712 --> 00:55:19,482
I thought I made up for everything with that.

694
00:55:21,212 --> 00:55:23,382
What more can I do?

695
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,021
Right.

696
00:55:26,252 --> 00:55:27,851
Do you need money?

697
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,822
If you were going to forget that easily,

698
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,731
why did you start something so meaningless?

699
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,661
If you don't leave right away, I'll call the police.

700
00:55:37,662 --> 00:55:39,777
I never had a son like you.

701
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:43,201
So don't ever come to me again. Do you understand?

702
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,672
Get out.

703
00:55:52,312 --> 00:55:54,681
I'll never come back again.

704
00:55:56,781 --> 00:55:58,482
Goodbye, sir.

705
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:11,461
(I wanted to ask. Whether he really didn't remember me.)

706
00:56:11,462 --> 00:56:14,042
(Whether I was really nothing to him.)

707
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,521
Come in.

708
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:36,668
- Hello. - Hello, Doctor.

709
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:39,862
How are you feeling? You must feel some pain.

710
00:56:40,261 --> 00:56:42,138
It's bearable.

711
00:56:42,162 --> 00:56:43,762
How am I looking?

712
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:47,070
The emergency treatment went well.

713
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,701
To tell you about your current condition,

714
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:51,840
you got a burn on your palm, and the muscle and ligament...

715
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:55,170
connecting your elbow to your fingers were damaged.

716
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:58,382
That means you might see stiffening of the finger muscles.

717
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:01,380
Stiffening?

718
00:57:01,381 --> 00:57:03,422
To explain it in simple terms,

719
00:57:03,522 --> 00:57:07,621
you might not be able to move the damaged area.

720
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,891
Of course, in the worst-case scenario.

721
00:57:09,892 --> 00:57:11,992
Not be able to move?

722
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:13,891
When will I start to see symptoms?

723
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:15,961
The stiffening might not happen right away,

724
00:57:15,962 --> 00:57:18,101
but it could gradually get worse.

725
00:57:18,432 --> 00:57:21,777
You should get specialized care at Sim General Hospital.

726
00:57:21,801 --> 00:57:24,041
They'll need to monitor your condition.

727
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,618
Yeon Woo.

728
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:38,488
You shouldn't stand up like that yet, Mom.

729
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:40,658
Did you...

730
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:42,667
Did you get hurt?

731
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,268
It's nothing.

732
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:46,638
Please sit.

733
00:57:55,207 --> 00:57:56,848
I didn't know,

734
00:57:57,207 --> 00:58:01,377
but I guess people suspected that I killed your dad.

735
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:05,018
I was told that the culprit was caught.

736
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:07,317
They want to hear what happened that day.

737
00:58:09,157 --> 00:58:11,428
When you were unconscious,

738
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:15,627
you were always smiling. You didn't know that, did you?

739
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:23,268
I saw your dad in my dream.

740
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,578
Was it because of the sound of that music box?

741
00:58:30,247 --> 00:58:32,507
It's the piece I played...

742
00:58:33,017 --> 00:58:35,147
on the first day I met your dad.

743
00:58:37,148 --> 00:58:40,456
He was just as young and handsome...

744
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:42,158
as he was the first day we met.

745
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:46,257
Your father said he fell for me when he came...

746
00:58:46,258 --> 00:58:48,857
to my first solo recital.

747
00:58:52,198 --> 00:58:54,337
He kept saying that in my dream.

748
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,567
Mi Eun gave you a nice gift.

749
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:58,507
Mi Eun?

750
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:00,738
Oh, your friend?

751
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:04,076
She was pretty. She's the girl you like, isn't she?

752
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:05,377
She's a friend.

753
00:59:07,077 --> 00:59:08,377
Yeon Woo.

754
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:10,248
I resented...

755
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,917
your father so much.

756
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:15,917
But all I thought...

757
00:59:18,287 --> 00:59:20,998
in that moment was that I should save him.

758
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,337
Honey!

759
00:59:29,468 --> 00:59:30,768
Honey!

760
00:59:31,307 --> 00:59:32,307
Don't come.

761
00:59:32,308 --> 00:59:34,576
Honey!

762
00:59:34,577 --> 00:59:35,877
Honey.

763
00:59:48,457 --> 00:59:50,457
That's how our last moments went.

764
00:59:50,557 --> 00:59:52,658
Because we wanted to save each other,

765
00:59:56,327 --> 00:59:58,627
we weren't afraid of dying at all.

766
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:06,437
Yeon Woo. Your hand!

767
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:07,977
- Your hand. - So Jin. Go first.

768
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,538
After that,

769
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:13,178
I got the courage to live my life.

770
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:19,788
The thing that was tying me down my whole life...

771
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,888
wasn't love.

772
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:26,757
It was resentment.

773
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:38,437
I'm almost all better, right?

774
01:00:40,238 --> 01:00:43,207
What happened to your arm?

775
01:00:43,448 --> 01:00:44,647
It's really nothing.

776
01:00:44,648 --> 01:00:46,924
It looks like something.

777
01:00:46,948 --> 01:00:48,248
This...

778
01:00:54,787 --> 01:00:56,257
I'm sorry.

779
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:05,868
I wasn't a good mom.

780
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:09,868
The fact that I don't remember spending time with you...

781
01:01:12,438 --> 01:01:14,837
means I didn't do anything for you.

782
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:32,457
It's all in the past.

783
01:01:34,628 --> 01:01:36,198
And I've forgotten it all.

784
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:40,198
Have you really forgotten it all?

785
01:01:40,898 --> 01:01:42,738
When you get out of the hospital,

786
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:46,678
make me home-cooked food.

787
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:49,638
Nothing too spicy.

788
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:55,018
Okay.

789
01:01:57,858 --> 01:02:04,487
(Iroun Genetic Center)

790
01:02:07,698 --> 01:02:10,598
I'm back here again.

791
01:02:12,267 --> 01:02:13,868
On my way here,

792
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,567
I thought a lot about whether or not I was overstepping my bounds.

793
01:02:19,707 --> 01:02:21,578
But I've changed a bit.

794
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,038
Yeon Woo...

795
01:02:23,477 --> 01:02:25,848
will go to the US today on the 8pm flight.

796
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,488
I see.

797
01:02:35,057 --> 01:02:37,926
From this accident, I thought...

798
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:41,757
Yeon Woo might really love you.

799
01:02:42,457 --> 01:02:44,197
He knows better than anyone...

800
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:45,897
that hands are everything to a surgeon.

801
01:02:46,367 --> 01:02:50,337
But he gave up his hand for you.

802
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:54,107
That seems like a miracle.

803
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,678
Gave up his hand?

804
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,018
Didn't you know?

805
01:03:04,747 --> 01:03:06,518
Because of the burn,

806
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:09,187
Yeon Woo might not be able to hold a scalpel ever again.

807
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:11,627
What?

808
01:03:12,827 --> 01:03:15,156
He definitely said it was okay...

809
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:17,667
I'm sure he didn't want to tell you.

810
01:03:20,398 --> 01:03:22,698
You said it was the 8pm flight, right?

811
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:31,107
Attention, please. Announcement for the flight...

812
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:37,230
Why? Are you waiting for someone?

813
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,690
Oh, no.

814
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,707
Doctor.

815
01:03:43,731 --> 01:03:44,929
Hello.

816
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:46,440
Ms. Yoo.

817
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:49,970
This is my mother.

818
01:03:49,971 --> 01:03:51,317
- Hello. - Hello.

819
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:55,187
My princess. You've gotten so healthy.

820
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:58,110
You can't travel overseas yet...

821
01:03:58,111 --> 01:04:01,221
We're not going anywhere.

822
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:05,650
As soon as I heard from Yo Han that you were going to the US,

823
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:07,221
I came running.

824
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:11,261
So Pu Reum could see you.

825
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,330
We might not be able to meet again.

826
01:04:16,370 --> 01:04:19,531
What are you talking about? We can do video calls.

827
01:04:20,341 --> 01:04:22,440
Pu Reum. Let's see each other every year.

828
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,569
Until then, you need to stay healthy, okay?

829
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,281
Pu Reum and I...

830
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:31,051
will never be able to forget you.

831
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,181
Ever.

832
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:37,850
Same for me.

833
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:40,861
Thank you.

834
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:50,870
Make sure to see Yeon Woo.

835
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,641
Yeon Woo having a woman he can never forget about.

836
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:57,670
That would bother me even more.

837
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:05,381
Sir. Please drive a bit faster.

838
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:10,790
(Departures)

839
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:12,719
Attention, please.

840
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,736
Southwest Airlines...

841
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,491
- Yeon Woo. - Yes?

842
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:18,690
I think we need to head in now.

843
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,730
- Is it already time? - Yes.

844
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:12,551
Yeon Woo said...

845
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:17,290
that he learned about love because of Han So Jin.

846
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:21,460
So make sure to meet Yeon Woo...

847
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,991
and say what you want to say, So Jin.

848
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:36,670
Yeon Woo.

849
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:38,611
Yeon Woo.

850
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,641
Yeon Woo!

851
01:06:44,251 --> 01:06:47,381
No way. Yeon Woo.

852
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,420
Yeon Woo.

853
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,391
Yeon Woo.

854
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,870
Yeon Woo.

855
01:07:19,081 --> 01:07:20,650
Yeon Woo.

856
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,946
(DNA Lover)

857
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,899
You gave your soul to loving one woman.

858
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,500
It's a successful life.

859
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:12,670
I hope Doctor Sim arrived safely.

860
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm sure he'll be fine there.

861
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:19,341
If someone engineers life using DNA,

862
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,881
there will be people you shouldn't meet.

863
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:25,949
I guess everyone from Sim Hospital is coming today.

864
01:08:25,950 --> 01:08:28,051
I think so.

865
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,591
In coincidence, there is providence.

866
01:08:31,051 --> 01:08:33,489
And there are genes that affect providence.

867
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:35,966
DNA lovers that the universe supports...

868
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,860
always meet in the end.
