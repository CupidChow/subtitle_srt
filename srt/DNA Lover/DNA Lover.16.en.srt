(Departures)

11
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:45,497
I let him leave without any promise of return.

12
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:48,936
I didn't even get to say my final goodbye.

13
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:52,307
I just feel infinitely powerless.

14
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:58,546
For a long time, I believed I made the right choice.

15
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:00,946
I only realized...

16
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:04,086
I was wrong after he left.

17
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:09,126
If I think about it, it could've been fate,

18
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:10,996

That's why I'm leaving.

26
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,286
Because I started to believe in fate.

Hey.

So Jin.

30
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:57,096
What's wrong, So Jin? Are you okay?

31
00:02:57,436 --> 00:02:58,436
So Jin!

32
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:21,087
Are you awake?

33
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:24,557
What happened?

34
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,997
Thankfully, your fever has gone down a bit.

35
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,767
You had a 38-degree fever earlier.

36
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,906
I guess the accident is just now hitting me.

37
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,647
I bought some medicine, so make sure to take it.

38
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,017
Now that you're awake, I'll go.

39
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:47,416
You're going to go?

40
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,126
Thanks, Kang Hoon.

41
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:01,797
So Jin.

42
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,737
I don't want you to hurt so much.

43
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:14,946
I'll go.

44
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,337

(Sim General Hospital)

46
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:14,336
This punk should let me know whether or not he arrived safely.

47

He's still the same, even now that he has left.

48
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,777
I hope Doctor Sim arrived safely.

49
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:21,947
Me too.

50
00:05:22,877 --> 00:05:26,876
Doesn't the hospital feel empty and gloomy without him?

51
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:28,346
Why does it feel gloomy? I'm here.

52
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,016
Right.

53

00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:35,655
How sad.

56
00:05:35,656 --> 00:05:36,926
What are you talking about?

57
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,866
It is boring without him.

58
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,437
But I'm sure he'll be fine there.

59
00:05:57,277 --> 00:05:59,676
- One order of sundae to go, please. - Okay.

60
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,387
What are you thinking so hard about?

61
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:09,957
Right.

62
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,856
When did you get here?

63
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:20,397
Are things going well with So Jin?

64
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:24,937
Yes.

65
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:29,707
That's good.

66
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:34,387
- Here you go. - Thank you.

67
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:37,086
I gave you lots of liver and lung.

68
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:38,387
Thank you.

69
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:40,887
See you later, then.

70
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:44,327
It's not going well.

71
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:47,627
What?

72
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:50,596
It's not going well.

73
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,837
Do you want a drink?

74
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:12,587
Eating like this is pretty nice.

75
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:14,027
It's kind of romantic.

76
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:17,155
Do you come here often?

77
00:07:17,156 --> 00:07:20,496
Yes. I have some special memories here.

78
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,296
When I was young,

79
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:28,707
I met So Jin here for the first time.

80
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,007
Is it okay for me to be here with you?

81
00:07:39,346 --> 00:07:40,986
Yeon Woo is not here anymore.

82
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:44,017
Everything should be good with So Jin now.

83
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:47,786
But you don't seem very happy.

84
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,397
Seriously.

85
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:56,527
Feelings are so strange.

86
00:07:58,637 --> 00:07:59,837
I thought Yeon Woo leaving...

87
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,707
would solve everything.

88
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,306
But when that situation actually came,

89
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,106
I lost my confidence.

90
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:13,317
"Can I really make..."

91
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:17,017
"So Jin happy? Can I fill her heart?"

92
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:20,986
I asked myself those questions for a long time.

93
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:24,327
Actually,

94
00:08:25,627 --> 00:08:27,996
I've known the answer for a long time,

95
00:08:30,397 --> 00:08:32,036
but I tried to deny it.

96
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,177
How are you so similar to me?

97
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,846
I was the same.

98
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,646
I think I demanded their love to feel happy...

99
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,817
even though that person didn't want me.

100
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:53,557
Looking back, I was so selfish and bad.

101
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:56,827
That's why I let him go.

102
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:59,827
I don't know about the other things,

103
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:02,396
but you're wrong about one thing.

104
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:04,636
- What? - You're not...

105
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,396
a selfish and bad person.

106
00:09:08,807 --> 00:09:10,106
I know that.

107
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,447
I didn't know...

108
00:09:16,547 --> 00:09:18,317
you could say things like that.

109
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,986
They say when people suddenly change, they die.

110
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,846
Are you sick?

111
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:27,927
- I'm not. - Are you sure?

112
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:29,526
You seem strange.

113
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,557
What?

114
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,626
Where did all of my liver and lung pieces go?

115
00:09:39,837 --> 00:09:40,866
That's strange.

116
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:46,077
I only had one piece each. Where did they go?

117
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:49,875
It wasn't me. It really wasn't.

118
00:09:49,876 --> 00:09:51,676
Are you acting innocent?

119
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,886
What? I only ate one. Hold on.

120
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:57,956
Goodness.

121
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,856
- Where did they go? - What is this?

122
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:02,827
It wasn't me. Did I eat the wrong thing?

123
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:05,657
I guess I ate the innards. Did I mistake it for sundae?

124
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:08,296
That's strange. Why do you keep denying it?

125
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:09,966
- Where did they go? - What?

126
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:12,236
- Come on. - There's one left, Mi Eun.

127
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,476
Father Andrea.

128
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:31,557
I'm Sister Anna.

129
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:37,927
Where did he go?

130
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,726
There's no mass.

131
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,417
Father Andrea.

132
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,457
Sister Anna. What brings you here?

133
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,837
I was worried because you didn't come to mass.

134
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:03,577
Were you here the whole time?

135
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:12,856
Sister Anna.

136
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,657
Yes, Father.

137
00:12:18,557 --> 00:12:20,896
I'm a priest who claims to love God...

138
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,797
but can't love people.

139
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,907
God tells us to love people.

140
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:34,876
I don't deserve to be a priest.

141
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:40,077
What do you mean by that?

142
00:12:41,246 --> 00:12:43,746
I knew Yi Myung was struggling,

143
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:47,827
but I never offered a helping hand.

144
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:51,697
Yi Myung...

145
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:56,626
killed the family who abused him and sent him back to the orphanage.

146
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,567
While he was in prison,

147
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,236
he sent me dozens of letters.

148
00:13:04,506 --> 00:13:05,677
But I...

149
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:10,577
didn't respond to a single one.

150
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:14,986
I just put...

151
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,917
the responsibility on God to take care of Yi Myung,

152
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:24,526
and I turned away from him.

153
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,457
Yi Myung.

154
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,096
Yi Myung!

155
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:30,996
Yi Myung!

156
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:34,166
Yi Myung may have stolen...

157
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,307
my robes and Bible...

158
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:38,736
because he missed me.

159
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:44,376
But I didn't even look in his direction.

160
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:47,746
I was worried that I would drown...

161
00:13:49,717 --> 00:13:52,486
in the darkness inside of him if I met him.

162
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,787
- I was afraid of that... - No.

163
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,557
You...

164
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:02,427
love people.

165
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:08,067
Didn't you come into the closet to save me...

166
00:14:09,037 --> 00:14:11,606
because of your love for a person?

167
00:14:12,337 --> 00:14:13,437
Even then,

168
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:17,677
I was the one being consoled.

169
00:14:18,317 --> 00:14:19,616
By you.

170
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:29,526
As long as I remain a priest,

171
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:35,697
I won't be able to love anyone.

172
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:28,646
All done. Let's go.

173
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,596
Why are you working on that scarf in the middle of the summer?

174
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,666
You don't actually believe what I said...

175
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,996
about the thread of fate, do you?

176
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,606
I just want to give it to her as a present.

177
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,006
She gets cold easily.

178
00:15:51,207 --> 00:15:52,207
Who?

179
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,476
So Jin.

180
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,947
- Kang Hoon, do you... - It's not like that.

181
00:15:58,746 --> 00:15:59,947
I want So Jin...

182
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,787
to wear this scarf and meet a good guy.

183
00:16:05,557 --> 00:16:07,016
So Jin should meet...

184
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:11,827
someone she can't forget even after they're gone, like you.

185
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,356
What about you?

186
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:28,307
(In-hospital Pharmacy)

187
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:29,345
Hello.

00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,176
Ms. Eo. Big news.

189
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:32,476
Do you know what I just saw?

190
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,817
Look at this.

191
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:37,515
Hello.

192
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:39,456
- Ta-da. - Oh, my.

193
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,687
Does Dr. Yeo look great on TV?

194
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:44,356
He's a celebrity. I'm going to get an autograph later.

195
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:45,526
Don't be dramatic.

196
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,956
He's introducing himself.

197
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:49,096
- Let's see. - I'm Kwang Su...

198
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:50,827
of Solo Land Season 23.

199
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:55,667
I was born in 1988, and I'm 36 years old.

200
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,807
I live in Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

201
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:02,975
I'm a doctor of endourology at Sim General Hospital...

202
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:04,177
in Cheongdam-dong.

203
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,147
I have...

204
00:17:07,717 --> 00:17:10,447
a house, a car,

205
00:17:10,816 --> 00:17:12,417
and many friends,

206
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:14,457
but I'm missing one thing.

207
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,555
That's...

208
00:17:16,556 --> 00:17:19,555
("I Am Solo")

209
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:20,627
Well...

210
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:22,566
I actually...

211
00:17:22,567 --> 00:17:24,295
(A surprise confession)

212
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:25,897
I have aspermia.

213
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,006
But I plan...

214
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,377
to use all of the money and time I would've spent on my kids...

215
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,647
on myself and my wife.

216
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:39,346
I want to meet someone who would like to live...

217
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:41,646
a DINK lifestyle with me.

218
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:42,647
Thank you.

219
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:49,026
What is your ideal type?

220
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,397
Well, I like...

221
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,396
small, fragile,

222
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:55,967
and feminine women.

223
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:58,697
Oh, my.

224
00:17:59,697 --> 00:18:00,867
I used to.

225
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,967
But not too long ago,

226
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:07,876
I changed a lot after being in a relationship...

227
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:09,177
that completely changed my life.

228
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,416
Now, I don't have an ideal type.

229
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:13,877
All of you sitting here...

230
00:18:14,447 --> 00:18:16,947
can become my ideal type.

231
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,785
What kind of hobbies do you have?

232
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:21,957
Do you like to exercise?

233
00:18:22,387 --> 00:18:25,756
I didn't like to exercise, but I like it now.

234
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:29,296
I tend to take care of myself well.

235
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,136
When I get a girlfriend, I want to go...

236
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:34,736
to a foot spa with her.

237
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:39,475
I'm embarrassed of my feet.

238
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:42,776
Why? They're the prettiest feet in the world.

239
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:53,255
I want to go to a drive-in theater once a week.

240
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:54,857
Call me Jung Tam.

241
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:57,226
Don't call me doctor.

242
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,056
Or my lovely cutie-pie.

243
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,627
Even after getting married,

244
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,296
I want to spend every day like we're on...

245
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:07,836
a romantic date.

246
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:12,707
I'm actually a DINK too.

247
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:14,946
I see.

248
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:18,177
("I Am Solo")

249
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,745
We just broke up!

250
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:22,647
(Sim General Hospital)

251
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:24,616
Our celebrity.

252
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:26,217
No pictures!

253
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,086
Hello.

254
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,427
Doctor Yeo. Why do you look so great on TV?

255
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:33,495
Are you going to be a cool kid now?

256
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:35,666
Wait. Please give me an autograph.

257
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,266
I'm not a cool kid.

258
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:38,937
Why do you look so sad?

259
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,835
Because I'm lonely.

260
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,566
- Did you not get a match? - What?

261
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,776
What happened? Give us a spoiler.

262
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,137
Did it not work out?

263
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,806
I don't know.

264
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,876
Why did you bring up the aspermia thing?

265
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:53,575
Seriously. Why did he do that?

266
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,386
Here is your drink.

267
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:56,486
Thank you.

("Artist Yoo Myung Hee, Who is Fighting Lung Cancer,")

269
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:08,867
("Will Hold a Retrospective Exhibit on Death")

270
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:11,596
("A Kiss with Death, a Retrospective by Yoo Myung Hee")

271
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:12,867
(Arist Yoo Myung Hee will hold an exhibit on June 15.)

272
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:17,467
Is the project going well?

273
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:21,746
I'm sorry. You must be going through a lot.

274
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,377
It's okay. I should separate my personal life from work.

275
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:28,417
I'm a bit worried about the topic.

276
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:32,555
How about you choose a topic that you're an expert in?

277
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:33,556
Romance.

278
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,826
You should take this chance to do it officially.

279
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:38,826
Right...

280
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:41,097
I'm not sure.

281
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,167
One second.

282
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:48,167
(So Ri)

283
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:50,306
Hello?

284
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,836
What's going on?

285
00:20:56,207 --> 00:20:57,246
What?

286
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,617
Okay. I'll be right there.

287
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:12,296
Ms. Han.

288
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,867
Did something happen? What's wrong?

289
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,427
Oh, I...

290
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,236
I...

291
00:21:18,637 --> 00:21:21,937
Well, I will... I'll head home early today.

292
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:23,366
Let's talk about the details tomorrow.

293
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,906
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

294
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:25,907
Okay.

295
00:21:35,316 --> 00:21:36,347
Mom.

296
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:39,556
You're here.

297
00:21:42,127 --> 00:21:43,687
Why didn't you tell me?

298
00:21:45,326 --> 00:21:48,667
It's nothing. You don't need to worry.

299
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:52,597
Nothing?

300
00:21:52,996 --> 00:21:54,937
You should've at least told me.

301
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,035
Who else can you talk to other than me?

302
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:59,076
Mi Eun.

303
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,707
Death isn't a tragedy but a providence.

304
00:22:05,177 --> 00:22:06,377
I'm so happy...

305
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,516
that I'm a painter who gets inspiration from death.

306
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,356
I need you to understand me.

307
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,417
Mom.

308
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:16,056
Understand what?

309
00:22:16,657 --> 00:22:19,295
Did I have to hear about you dying through a news article?

310
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,926
Mi Eun. You should go for today.

311
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,697
Okay, Mom. I'll be back another day.

312
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:31,505
What's with the exhibition?

313
00:22:31,506 --> 00:22:33,907
You don't even have enough time to get surgery and chemotherapy.

314
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:38,147
Why are you holding this dumb exhibit?

315
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:39,847
Do you want me...

316
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,046
to get my lung cut out,

317
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:47,316
get anti-cancer injections, vomit, pass out,

318
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:49,325
while I wither away in fear...

319
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,056
of the cancer spreading...

320
00:22:51,526 --> 00:22:53,957
to my organs, bones, and brain?

321
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:55,826
Why are you already thinking of dying?

322
00:22:56,526 --> 00:22:57,725
Many people live healthy lives...

323
00:22:57,726 --> 00:22:59,466
after getting surgery and making a full recovery.

324
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:00,566
I'm going to get surgery...

325
00:23:01,536 --> 00:23:03,505
after the exhibition is over.

326
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:06,005
What if the cancer spreads in that time?

327
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:08,877
It's my cancer. It doesn't have anything to do with you two.

328
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:10,746
What?

329
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:14,647
If you feel that bad,

330
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:17,786
hold an exhibit for me after I die.

331
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:21,387
You're so selfish...

332
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,927
until the end.

333
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,526
Don't you care about me and So Ri?

334
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,467
I haven't done anything for you.

335
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:39,677
How can I burden you now?

336
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:43,546
I've just lived my life fighting my fate.

337
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,976
Although that fate...

338
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,647
eventually brought me here.

339
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:52,457
You two don't need to be swallowed up by my fate.

340
00:23:54,086 --> 00:23:56,526
I won't apologize...

341
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,996
to you or anyone.

342
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:01,127
So...

343
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:05,796
don't suddenly ask me to be a mom now.

344
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,107
We can just live our own lives.

345
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,236
As we've always done.

346
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,196
Catch me if you can.

347
00:24:33,197 --> 00:24:35,096
- Catch me if you can. - Dad!

348
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:37,097
Come and catch me.

349
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,097
- Be careful. - I'm going to catch you.

350
00:24:43,937 --> 00:24:45,377
I'm going to catch you.

351
00:24:45,937 --> 00:24:47,107
I'm going to catch you.

352
00:24:48,847 --> 00:24:51,177
I caught you!

353
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,766
We ended up as you said.

354
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:14,697
So Ri and I...

355
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:16,836
aren't weak.

356
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:25,576
Even if you leave this world,

357
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,086
we will never fall.

358
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:34,887
So...

359
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:39,197
please live.

360
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:50,707
Whether it be fighting or whatever you did so far,

361
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,976
don't force us to watch you...

362
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:57,506
give into your destiny.

363
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:12,326
Mom.

364
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,197
Are you filming a melodrama?

365
00:26:26,677 --> 00:26:28,137
You're so annoying.

366
00:26:49,326 --> 00:26:50,866
When you introduced yourself,

367
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:53,765
- you said you'd met your true love. - Yes.

368
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:55,636
Why did you break up?

369
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:56,637
Oh, well...

370
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:58,735
(I'm Alone)

371
00:26:58,736 --> 00:26:59,937
I was confident...

372
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,476
I could love her for the rest of my life.

373
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,117
But I guess that wasn't...

374
00:27:08,147 --> 00:27:09,447
good enough.

375
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:15,286
Actually...

376
00:27:17,226 --> 00:27:19,255
Just looking at this reminds me of her.

377
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:20,826
(I miss my ex so much.)

378
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,667
I miss her...

379
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:26,166
like crazy.

380
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,235
(He burst into tears.)

381
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:28,536
(Flustered)

382
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:31,707
Watch him cry. Isn't he hilarious?

383
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:33,877
How can a crying guy look this pathetic?

384
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,407
My gosh.

385
00:27:37,246 --> 00:27:38,617
Seriously?

386
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:40,045
Oh, no.

387
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:41,316
This is funny?

388
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:44,286
Do you think this is funny?

389
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:47,086
What's her problem?

390
00:27:49,056 --> 00:27:50,756
Why did I even come here?

391
00:27:55,266 --> 00:27:57,796
Why did he cry on national television?

392
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:13,447
Darn it.

393
00:28:19,986 --> 00:28:21,016
Goodbye.

394
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,555
- Wait. Let's... - Let go of me.

395
00:28:23,556 --> 00:28:24,656
Let's talk.

396
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:26,556
Do we have anything left to say?

397
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,466
Oh, do you have good news to share...

398
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:32,536
about the new DINK partner you met?

399
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:35,266
Did you see me on "I'm Alone?"

400
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:40,575
No. I'm way too busy...

401
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,476
to watch stuff like "I'm Alone."

402
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:45,377
Goodbye.

403
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:47,245
No, wait.

404
00:28:47,246 --> 00:28:49,147
I didn't go on because I wanted to.

405
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:51,786
A friend of mine produces the show,

406
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:54,285
and a guy backed out at the last minute.

407
00:28:54,286 --> 00:28:56,856
He begged me to fill in, and I had no choice.

408
00:28:56,857 --> 00:28:58,555
You don't have to explain that to me.

409
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,157
I don't want my feelings to be misconstrued.

410
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:06,367
I thought of you throughout the whole thing.

411
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,607
I didn't care for any of the women.

412
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:17,447
Did you really not miss me at all?

413
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,246
I missed you a lot,

414
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,246
Sung Mi.

415
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:31,586
I did not miss you.

416
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:40,437
Could you look at me as you say that?

417
00:29:43,306 --> 00:29:44,336
I did not...

418
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:46,536
miss you.

419
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:54,276
Sung Mi.

420
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:57,516
I love you.

421
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,657
What are you doing?

422
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:10,967
You know what I'm doing.

423
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:14,667
Let me go.

424
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:18,006
- Stay still. - Okay.

425
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:31,417
(The Bible)

426
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,617
I don't consider this apostasy.

427
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:13,056
I finally broke free of the fence that held me in.

428
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:17,496
I know, Father.

429
00:31:18,697 --> 00:31:22,467
This is just another path to finding God.

430
00:31:23,207 --> 00:31:24,207
Yes.

431
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,976
(Always Sushi)

432
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:45,187
Kang Hoon.

433
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:46,556
So Jin.

434
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:48,197
Well...

435
00:31:49,427 --> 00:31:52,766
It's nice in the evening. Shall we go somewhere?

436
00:31:53,836 --> 00:31:54,897
You know...

437
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:59,006
whenever I broke up with someone,

438
00:31:59,677 --> 00:32:02,876
I came up here to chew out and curse...

439
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:05,276
the guy who hurt me.

440
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,276
But this time...

441
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:13,986
I found myself resenting me.

442
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,796
I thought...

443
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:24,566
Yeon Woo had left me to run away.

444
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:25,937
But...

445
00:32:27,836 --> 00:32:31,036
I was the one who had run away.

446
00:32:34,806 --> 00:32:36,707
Because our DNA didn't match,

447
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:41,147
I ignored the feelings I had for him.

448
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,617
Out of fear that I'd get hurt again if it wasn't destiny,

449
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,657
I didn't even believe...

450
00:32:51,026 --> 00:32:52,496
how he felt about me.

451
00:33:00,296 --> 00:33:01,496
So I've decided...

452
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,006
to have some courage.

453
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:12,246
I'll forget about DNA and destiny...

454
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:16,086
and follow...

455
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,357
my heart.

456
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:24,857
What if Yeon Woo never returns?

457
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:26,427
No.

458
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:29,796
What if he does...

459
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:32,496
and he no longer loves you?

460
00:33:32,766 --> 00:33:33,967
Then...

461
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:37,167
I'll cry.

462
00:33:38,707 --> 00:33:41,137
I'll cry and suffer.

463
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:44,006
And get over it.

464
00:34:15,436 --> 00:34:16,506
Can I...

465
00:34:18,577 --> 00:34:19,847
give you a hug?

466
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,916
I'm free!

467
00:34:54,017 --> 00:34:56,985
Han So Jin finally set me free!

468
00:34:56,986 --> 00:34:58,186
Yes!

469
00:35:00,117 --> 00:35:01,316
You go ahead.

470
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,157
Go on.

471
00:35:13,097 --> 00:35:15,166
- Go. - I'll go ahead.

472
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,006
Hey.

473
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:55,177
I guess I came at the right time.

474
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,506
Why are you here?

475
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:02,546
Well...

476
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:05,416
I couldn't sleep.

477
00:36:06,756 --> 00:36:09,125
I was feeling a bit lonely,

478
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,927
and this place came to mind.

479
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:16,896
I came by wondering if you'd be here too,

480
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:18,796
and here you are.

481
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,367
We must have a connection.

482
00:36:29,506 --> 00:36:31,106
I saw the movie "The Notebook."

483
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:38,586
"I might be someone easy to forget,"

484
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:42,157
"but I gave my soul to loving one woman."

485
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,356
"It's a successful life."

486
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:49,597
That's what you're like.

487
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:54,236
So Jin's a real idiot.

488
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:55,867
To reject someone like you.

489
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:05,046
Well, I guess you're right.

490
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,787
My heart does hurt bad.

491
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:13,117
But deep inside, I'm relieved.

492
00:37:13,217 --> 00:37:15,557
See? I was right.

493
00:37:16,626 --> 00:37:19,526
I hope So Jin will be happy.

494
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:21,126
She will be.

495
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:24,697
She's quite resilient.

496
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:28,137
How about...

497
00:37:28,697 --> 00:37:31,206
the two people who got rejected...

498
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:32,677
drink together?

499
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:35,037
We can't drink here.

500
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:38,747
- Sorry. You're all wet. - I'm sorry.

501
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:40,146
Here.

502
00:37:41,646 --> 00:37:42,717
Thank you.

503
00:37:48,756 --> 00:37:53,026
You're much more thoughtful than I expected.

504
00:37:53,657 --> 00:37:55,026
You even have a handkerchief.

505
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:57,827
That's because...

506
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:01,836
So Jin's clumsy and scatterbrained.

507
00:38:02,666 --> 00:38:04,807
I started carrying around a handkerchief.

508
00:38:06,977 --> 00:38:08,537
I won't need it anymore.

509
00:38:10,347 --> 00:38:11,506
You never know.

510
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:15,646
You might meet someone else whom you'd want to look after.

511
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,327
Shall we go?

512
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:34,997
Do you want to watch a late-night movie?

513
00:38:36,436 --> 00:38:38,407
It will cheer you up.

514
00:38:39,376 --> 00:38:40,506
Right now?

515
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:44,307
There's no limit to time or location when it comes to cheering up.

516
00:38:45,407 --> 00:38:47,117
- But... - Let's go.

517
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:50,517
A toast?

518
00:38:50,617 --> 00:38:52,816
You can't drink in public parks.

519
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,657

520
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:10,907
(Seo Kang Hoon)

521
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:15,037
I've been looking for and finding answers...

522
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:17,606
to the difficult problems I'd faced in life.

523
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:23,117
(Seo Kang Hoon)

524
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,685
There's still one assignment...

525
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:29,356
in my heart that I've yet to solve.

526
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:47,477
(1 year later)

527
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:33,685
Ta-da.

528
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:34,756
Yeon Woo.

529
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:37,786
I made gopchang tteokbokki that you love.

530
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:38,826
Have a look.

531
00:40:38,827 --> 00:40:39,827
Here.

532
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:41,427
How does it look?

533
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:45,395
Mom. Gopchang tteokbokki is best when it's spicy.

534
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:47,066
Is it?

535
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:50,137
Is that why you didn't eat much of mine?

536
00:40:50,606 --> 00:40:53,276
You can't eat spicy food.

537
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:55,406
When I visit you in Korea next time,

538
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:57,347
I'll make you royal tteokbokki...

539
00:40:57,606 --> 00:40:59,517
with beef and soy sauce.

540
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,545
You'll visit?

541
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:03,486
Of course, I should.

542
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,017
I heard you'll open a clinic in the countryside.

543
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:09,386
You'll be tired. I should look after you.

544
00:41:09,387 --> 00:41:10,886
It's not my clinic.

545
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:13,656
I get paid a monthly salary.

546
00:41:13,657 --> 00:41:14,756
What?

547
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:17,367
You're on a salary?

548
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:20,335
Why? Is it because of your hand?

549
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:21,396
No.

550
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:25,307
It's because I need time to settle in here.

551
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:27,936
See you soon, Mom.

552
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:29,276
Pass.

553
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:31,006
Pass!

554
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,977
Hey. Are they serving curry today?

555
00:41:37,186 --> 00:41:38,586
The kids must be happy.

556
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,456
- Hi. - Hello.

557
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:46,126
- Goodness. - Oh, thank you.

558
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,665
You look much happier here.

559
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:50,767
Do I?

560
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:57,206
The children cheer me up and give me strength.

561
00:41:58,166 --> 00:42:00,776
I also feel closer to the God...

562
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,876
I searched for all along.

563
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:05,706
I can tell.

564
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:09,517
This suits you way more than your priest uniform.

565
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:12,686
I'm a bit envious that you look happier.

566
00:42:13,287 --> 00:42:15,256
Yes. I'm happy.

567
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:19,156
Thanks for coming to volunteer every time.

568
00:42:19,157 --> 00:42:20,356
Don't thank me.

569
00:42:20,927 --> 00:42:23,526
I come once a month for some inner healing.

570
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,767
In the end, everyone just wants to be happy.

571
00:42:28,736 --> 00:42:31,637
Me, all the kids here,

572
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:33,907
you,

573
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:36,177
and Yi Myung.

574
00:42:38,546 --> 00:42:40,517
- You can't go. - I really have to.

575
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:42,046
Please. Let go of me.

576
00:42:42,077 --> 00:42:44,286
- Why are you doing this to me? - Come back inside.

577
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:46,186
- Let's play. - Play with us.

578
00:42:46,586 --> 00:42:47,657
So Jin!

579
00:42:48,057 --> 00:42:50,057
What took you so long?

580
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,686
Kids. Aunt So Jin's here.

581
00:42:53,157 --> 00:42:55,057
You should say hi.

582
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,227
Charge!

583
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:01,896
Long time no see. How have you been?

584
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,566
Wait. I can't drop this.

585
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:05,565
- Were you having fun? - I'll take that for you.

586
00:43:05,566 --> 00:43:06,636
Thank you.

587
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:08,276
- Take your time. - Okay.

588
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:12,177
A Ri.

589
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:16,046
She has changed.

590
00:43:17,816 --> 00:43:19,986
Shall we start with Min Jae?

591
00:43:20,586 --> 00:43:21,586
Min Jae.

592
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:24,256
I told you last time to eat lots of vegetables.

593
00:43:24,356 --> 00:43:25,656
Did you do so last month?

594
00:43:25,657 --> 00:43:26,697
No.

595
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:29,096
Why not? You promised.

596
00:43:29,097 --> 00:43:31,696
But there are so many tasty things...

597
00:43:31,697 --> 00:43:34,296
other than vegetables out there.

598
00:43:34,497 --> 00:43:35,796
I love meat.

599
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:39,676
Even so, you made a promise, so let's try to stick to it.

600
00:43:39,677 --> 00:43:40,836
Okay? Promise.

601
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:44,077
Ms. Han. I kept my promise.

602
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:46,947
I skipped rope a hundred times every day.

603
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,146
My height gene will grow, right?

604
00:43:49,247 --> 00:43:51,316
Nice, Yoon Soo.

605
00:43:51,486 --> 00:43:53,057
You deserve a high-five.

606
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,985
Good job. But you must keep it up.

607
00:43:55,986 --> 00:43:57,287
- Okay. - Promise.

608
00:43:58,287 --> 00:44:00,227
- Next. - Let's break up.

609
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,597
What?

610
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:04,526
You said we were meant to be.

611
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,665
How can love change?

612
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,165
Why are you so childish?

613
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,037
We both like beans stewed in soy sauce.

614
00:44:10,436 --> 00:44:11,936
We both like teddy bears.

615
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:14,435
We both like the same color...

616
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,576
and star signs. You said it was fate.

617
00:44:16,577 --> 00:44:18,006
How is that important?

618
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:20,517
There's no such thing as fate, silly.

619
00:44:21,477 --> 00:44:22,776
Then what's important?

620
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:25,247
Whether you truly like each other.

621
00:44:25,546 --> 00:44:27,117
Don't you know that?

622
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,427
Oh, right.

623
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:33,927
I don't like beans stewed in soy sauce anymore.

624
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:38,267
It can't be.

625
00:44:47,807 --> 00:44:49,847
Shall we get started?

628
00:45:21,206 --> 00:45:24,346
For the last year, I've been working on...

629
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,275
the Iroun Project.

(Parkinson's disease gene GPR27)

632
00:45:29,546 --> 00:45:30,916
In 2023,

633
00:45:31,247 --> 00:45:34,056
it was reported that GPR27, a gene in Koreans...

634
00:45:34,057 --> 00:45:37,456
that causes Parkinson's disease was discovered.

635
00:45:37,856 --> 00:45:39,996
So for the past year, to predict...

636
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:42,355
future cases and provide gene-specific treatments,

637
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,926
our team has been visiting...

638
00:45:43,927 --> 00:45:46,697
the elderly living in areas with less medical coverage...

639
00:45:46,896 --> 00:45:48,936
to test their genes.

640
00:45:49,336 --> 00:45:52,536
Because this project targets the elderly,

641
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:55,005
the cases must be managed locally.

642
00:45:55,006 --> 00:45:57,676
We plan to cooperate with local elderly care centers...

643
00:45:57,677 --> 00:46:00,045
and organizations that provide home care...

644
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:01,676
in the future.

645
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:02,947
Nice.

648

653
00:46:23,106 --> 00:46:25,565
I'll join you this time.

654
00:46:25,566 --> 00:46:27,276
I like that, BK.

655
00:46:27,637 --> 00:46:31,406
Remember it's hard to look after the elderly.

656
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:32,407
Okay.

657

We'll give you this cup with a funnel.

672

of your cheek five times on each side.

674
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:31,966
Then collect a lot of saliva...

675
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:34,036

- Say "ah." - Sweetie.

Well...

00:48:09,506 --> 00:48:10,577

but his facial bone structure is symmetrical...

699
00:48:39,106 --> 00:48:41,976
and his eyes, nose, and mouth are harmoniously placed.

Is there a doctor...

705
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:58,525

since Mr. Kim Sang Eun came in for an appointment.

729
00:50:09,327 --> 00:50:10,395
We should have him come today.

He won't come today.

It's his wife's birthday.

732
00:50:16,236 --> 00:50:20,037
Everyone in this village knows about his wife's birthday.

He's been cooking a birthday meal for ten years.

734
00:50:24,077 --> 00:50:27,376
Then, I should try to sneak into...

735

- that birthday party too. - Pardon?

738
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,597
- when we get to Seoul. - All right.

742
00:51:02,347 --> 00:51:04,616
- You should come next year too. - Yes, come again.

743
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:07,157
- Yes, I will. - Thanks for coming.

744
00:51:11,456 --> 00:51:12,557
Sir.

745
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,197
Sir?

746
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:17,966
- Who is it? - Oh, it's me.

747
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,496
I wanted to congratulate your wife's birthday too.

748
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:23,637
- Here's some pork belly. - Goodness, thank you.

749
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:27,006
I've been needing someone to eat my seaweed soup.

750
00:51:27,577 --> 00:51:29,576
You look great today.

751
00:51:29,577 --> 00:51:31,347
- Do I? I look good, right? - Yes.

752
00:51:31,947 --> 00:51:33,206
- Come in. - Thank you.

753
00:51:36,347 --> 00:51:39,316
It feels like yesterday when my wife passed away.

754
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:42,516
I can't remember how many birthdays it's been.

755
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,387
Sir, have you taken the medicine I prescribed for you?

756
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:47,697
The medicine you prescribed me...

757
00:51:47,796 --> 00:51:49,727
made me sleepy, so I didn't take them.

758
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:52,466
Come on. You still have to take them.

759
00:51:52,467 --> 00:51:56,436
If things get worse, you might have to go to a big hospital in Seoul.

760
00:51:56,537 --> 00:51:59,807
Where would I go? I won't leave this place.

761
00:52:00,776 --> 00:52:02,506
My wife's name was Hyang Mi.

762
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,706
This village is called Hyangmi-ri.

763
00:52:05,307 --> 00:52:06,307
That was why she was called Hyang Mi.

764
00:52:07,276 --> 00:52:10,486
She was born in Hyangmi-ri and lived her whole life with me.

765
00:52:10,986 --> 00:52:12,247
So, how would I leave this place?

766
00:52:14,356 --> 00:52:16,586
Sir, could I see your phone for a minute?

767
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:18,057
Sure.

768
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:25,226
From now on, you have to take your medicine...

769
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:27,096
whenever you hear this alarm.

770
00:52:27,097 --> 00:52:28,137
Three times a day.

771
00:52:28,236 --> 00:52:31,436
If you don't, you'll keep forgetting about your wife.

772
00:52:32,967 --> 00:52:35,006
That will never happen.

773
00:52:35,436 --> 00:52:37,476
I know the day I will die.

774
00:52:37,477 --> 00:52:40,276
The day I forget about Hyang Mi is the day that I'll die.

775
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:50,686
You two must've been a very loving couple.

776
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:53,827
I'm a sensitive and stubborn man.

777
00:52:53,856 --> 00:52:56,296
Hyang Mi was like a teenage girl.

778
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,026
Since the beginning of our marriage,

779
00:52:59,497 --> 00:53:02,037
we fought practically every day.

780
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:06,566
I thought we wouldn't fight when we got older,

781
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:08,936
but we fought so often when we were together.

782
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:13,077
So, I spent several years at my son's house in Suwon too.

783
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:18,017
All throughout our lives, we said we couldn't live with each other,

784
00:53:18,046 --> 00:53:20,456
bringing up divorce several times when we were angry.

785
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:24,356
But I wonder what was in here.

786
00:53:25,227 --> 00:53:26,626
Even when we'd split apart,

787
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,327
we'd end up getting back together again.

788
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:33,537
We said it was such a tenacious relationship.

789
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:36,666
But I only just found out that was...

790
00:53:36,907 --> 00:53:38,367
all a connection and fate.

791
00:53:41,537 --> 00:53:43,407
- Sir. - Yes?

792
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:44,677
Have you...

793
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:47,646
ever thought...

794
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:50,546
that it might've been better...

795
00:53:52,447 --> 00:53:55,456
for you to separate...

796
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,626
for good?

797
00:53:57,856 --> 00:53:58,927
What?

798
00:53:59,626 --> 00:54:01,597
Oh, it's nothing. I...

799
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,966
I haven't married yet, so I said the wrong thing.

800
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:06,026
I'm sorry.

801
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:08,997
What's so important about being happy or not?

802
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:13,166
The fact that there was someone to spend every moment with,

803
00:54:13,577 --> 00:54:16,037
and the fact that it was Hyang Mi, is what makes me happy.

804
00:54:22,117 --> 00:54:23,117
Here.

805
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:25,486
Oh, right.

806
00:54:25,646 --> 00:54:26,686
There.

807
00:54:27,617 --> 00:54:28,617
Thank you.

809
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,006
Sometimes, in that direction,

810
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,037
you can see my favorite star.

811
00:54:49,236 --> 00:54:52,177
I found out later that the star was called Io.

812
00:54:52,677 --> 00:54:54,477
Io is a moon of Jupiter.

813
00:54:54,677 --> 00:54:57,346
It became a nightmare star because it was the closest to Jupiter.

814
00:54:57,347 --> 00:54:59,246
Lava explodes on one side,

815
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:02,557
and the other side without lava is minus 148°C.

816
00:55:02,686 --> 00:55:05,126
So, it's either a ball of fire or a ball of ice.

817
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:07,727
So, that star became a nightmare...

818
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:09,356
because they're stuck together?

819
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:13,666
Still, if I were Io,

820
00:55:13,796 --> 00:55:16,367
I'd never want to get far away from Jupiter.

821
00:55:16,697 --> 00:55:18,205
If they weren't close together,

822
00:55:18,206 --> 00:55:20,506
Io would wander around the endless outer space alone.

823
00:55:24,276 --> 00:55:25,947
I like being alone.

824
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:29,677
I liked being alone.

826
00:55:37,387 --> 00:55:38,456
Hey, Jung Tam.

827
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:47,165
- Thank you. Oh, you came. - Congratulations.

828
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:48,197
Hey.

829
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:49,236
Oh, my.

830
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:50,907
It's great to see you.

831
00:55:51,106 --> 00:55:53,205
- Goodness. - Congratulations.

832
00:55:53,206 --> 00:55:54,876
- Why do you look so cool? - Gosh, no.

833
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,307
- Congratulations. - Hey, little one.

834
00:55:57,546 --> 00:55:58,847
You're so cute.

- Congratulations on your wedding. - Oh, thank you.

- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

842
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:15,626
Yes, thank you.

843
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:17,665
Hey, what is all this?

844
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,866
Oh, hey.

845
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:20,496
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

846
00:56:20,497 --> 00:56:22,137
Yes, thank you.

847
00:56:41,256 --> 00:56:42,316
My goodness.

848
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,956
The wedding just had to be on the same day as your business trip.

849
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:48,556
The reception seems like it'll go on for a while.

850
00:56:48,557 --> 00:56:49,697
Why don't you just leave tomorrow?

851
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,196
When I looked at the elders' test results,

852
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:54,497
there was someone with a predictor for Parkinson's.

853
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,935
I thought explaining it in person would be better than a letter.

854
00:56:57,936 --> 00:56:58,966
I'll make it quick.

855
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,006
Yes, you should.

856
00:57:03,606 --> 00:57:04,606
By the way,

857
00:57:05,747 --> 00:57:08,346
everyone from Sim Hospital must be coming today.

858
00:57:08,347 --> 00:57:09,376
I'm not sure.

859
00:57:10,276 --> 00:57:12,287
I'm guessing they will.

860
00:57:12,546 --> 00:57:14,956
Gosh, won't Vice Director Sim come today?

861
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:17,756
Why do you keep liking him? You know it's no use.

862
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,026
Hello.

863
00:57:19,657 --> 00:57:23,296
I'm the MC for today's wedding. I'm Seo Kang Hoon.

864
00:57:23,427 --> 00:57:25,826
Before we begin today's ceremony,

865
00:57:25,827 --> 00:57:27,496
Yeo Jung Tam, the groom,

866
00:57:27,497 --> 00:57:30,335
says he has something he must say to the guests.

867
00:57:30,336 --> 00:57:32,936
So, I will deliver his message instead.

868
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:44,416
"Today,"

869
00:57:45,217 --> 00:57:47,486
"I am going to marry..."

870
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:49,157
"my DNA lover who I met through destiny."

871
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:52,787
"Someone told me once..."

872
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,096
"that providence is in coincidence..."

873
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:57,727
"and that there's a gene that acts on providence."

874
00:57:59,227 --> 00:58:02,296
Ms. Han, is telepathy really possible?

875
00:58:02,497 --> 00:58:03,637
Well...

876
00:58:04,836 --> 00:58:08,637
I think there's providence in some coincidences.

877
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,977
And there could be a gene...

878
00:58:11,447 --> 00:58:14,077
that acts on that providence. I'm doing research on that.

879
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:16,315
Like when you go somewhere without much thought,

880
00:58:16,316 --> 00:58:17,347
but you run into someone?

881
00:58:17,447 --> 00:58:19,287
That's simply a coincidence.

882
00:58:19,947 --> 00:58:21,117
"I want to meet someone."

883
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:22,986
"I really want to meet someone."

884
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:25,126
You send a signal.

885
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:27,126
"Like Sung Mi and me,"

886
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:30,057
"DNA lovers who have help from upon high..."

887
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,896
"are destined to meet someday."

888
00:58:42,006 --> 00:58:44,375
"Today, before all of you,"

889
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:47,477
"I will see that connection bear fruit."

890
00:59:08,867 --> 00:59:11,506
Acting like I don't care

891
00:59:12,936 --> 00:59:16,307
I've been hiding it well

892
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:18,077
Oh, yes

893
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:23,146
Because of you, I can't even sleep

894
00:59:23,177 --> 00:59:27,516
Because of you, my heart flutters all night

895
00:59:27,517 --> 00:59:31,326
Now, I want to say it

896
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:34,196
Honestly

897
00:59:34,197 --> 00:59:37,166
I'll only let you walk on a flowery path

898
00:59:38,497 --> 00:59:41,197
I'll act just how you want me to

899
00:59:42,896 --> 00:59:45,466
From the moment I first got to know you

900
00:59:45,467 --> 00:59:47,276
Inside my mind

901
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:08,157
Grandma.

902
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:10,726
- Grandma. - You're here, Foreman.

903
01:00:10,727 --> 01:00:12,097
Yes, hello.

904
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:13,795
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

905
01:00:13,796 --> 01:00:15,466
- Have you been well? - Yes.

906
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:16,767
That's enough.

907
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:23,205
- Ms. Baek Se Mi. - Yes, thank you.

908
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:26,176
Read it through, and call me if you have any questions.

909
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:27,247
Okay.

910
01:00:28,646 --> 01:00:29,876
Now,

911
01:00:30,347 --> 01:00:32,116
shall we go to Mr. Kim Sang Eun's place?

912
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:33,316
Oh, that old man?

913
01:00:33,787 --> 01:00:35,816
He went to the handsome fellow.

914
01:00:38,586 --> 01:00:40,355
"The handsome fellow?"

915
01:00:40,356 --> 01:00:44,066
Mr. Kim must have gone to the hospital.

916
01:00:44,796 --> 01:00:45,827
I see.

917
01:00:48,566 --> 01:00:51,907
Then, could you tell me the name of the hospital?

918
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:55,836
I have to deliver this to Mr. Kim today.

919
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:14,557
- Hello, sir. - Yes.

920
01:01:14,856 --> 01:01:16,427
- You remember me, don't you? - Of course.

921
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:18,467
You know, last time,

922
01:01:18,997 --> 01:01:20,967
I came to run a DNA test for you.

923
01:01:21,066 --> 01:01:22,736
I have your results.

924
01:01:23,436 --> 01:01:26,005
But when I looked at the results,

925
01:01:26,006 --> 01:01:27,735
you have a risk of...

926
01:01:27,736 --> 01:01:29,677
I know my own illness.

927
01:01:30,307 --> 01:01:31,947
I'll deal with it myself, so leave.

928
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:37,685
You know that you can't just leave it untreated.

929
01:01:37,686 --> 01:01:39,416
It can't be fixed.

930
01:01:39,717 --> 01:01:42,716
No, we'll be able to fix it someday soon.

931
01:01:42,717 --> 01:01:44,656
That's why we're working hard to do research and...

932
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:45,727
And if you fix it?

933
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:48,157
- What? - What will I do if you fix it?

934
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:50,456
If you fix my illness, and I live longer,

935
01:01:50,997 --> 01:01:52,767
it'll only put off the day I get to meet her.

936
01:01:58,367 --> 01:01:59,936
"The day I get to meet her?"

937
01:02:03,506 --> 01:02:05,546
Sir.

938
01:02:06,407 --> 01:02:09,876
If I've waited this long, it's about time I meet her now.

939
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:11,287
You can go now.

940
01:02:17,657 --> 01:02:18,686
Ms. Han So Jin.

941
01:02:40,776 --> 01:02:42,876
Did you come back from the US?

942
01:02:43,077 --> 01:02:44,086
Yes.

943
01:02:44,217 --> 01:02:46,517
When? When did you get back?

944
01:02:47,756 --> 01:02:48,956
It hasn't been that long.

945
01:03:10,276 --> 01:03:13,376
Did you quit working as a gynecologist?

946
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:15,717
I'm still working as a doctor.

947
01:03:17,486 --> 01:03:19,886
I thought I was a total city boy,

948
01:03:19,887 --> 01:03:22,256
but living here is fun.

949
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:26,486
The villagers come to me every day and ask me to eat with them.

950
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:27,827
So, I don't eat alone.

951
01:03:41,077 --> 01:03:44,606
There's a problem with your hand, isn't there?

952
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:50,446
Is it because of your hand that you can't be...

953
01:03:50,447 --> 01:03:52,247
a gynecologist or perform surgery anymore?

954
01:03:54,157 --> 01:03:56,557
Come on. It's all better.

955
01:03:57,456 --> 01:04:00,926
Well, it's not fully what it used to be,

956
01:04:00,927 --> 01:04:03,197
but I'm getting used to...

957
01:04:03,626 --> 01:04:04,967
my new senses.

958
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,666
And I had surgery recently too.

959
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:12,367
It was because of me.

960
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:15,907
You should fix that.

961
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:19,146
You think everything is your fault.

962
01:04:20,447 --> 01:04:21,847
Have you already forgotten...

963
01:04:22,046 --> 01:04:24,017
that you were in danger because of me?

964
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:28,456
Besides that,

965
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:31,186
congratulate me.

966
01:04:32,126 --> 01:04:33,456
Congratulate you on what?

967
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:38,267
Now, I really want to become a doctor.

968
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:42,836
Then, do you mean you haven't been a doctor so far?

969
01:04:43,566 --> 01:04:45,936
I always thought about quitting.

970
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:49,276
For the first time in my life, I have passion...

971
01:04:50,336 --> 01:04:51,876
for what I'm doing.

972
01:04:56,117 --> 01:04:58,786
Don't worry too much about Mr. Kim Sang Eun.

973
01:04:58,787 --> 01:05:01,356
I'll do my best to convince him.

974
01:05:07,796 --> 01:05:09,227
When do you go back to Seoul?

975
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,666
Well...

976
01:05:12,327 --> 01:05:14,795
So, Ms. Baek Se Mi said...

977
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:17,666
she had a question about her test result.

978
01:05:17,836 --> 01:05:19,065
I'm going to meet with her son...

979
01:05:19,066 --> 01:05:20,706
and spend the night at their bed and breakfast before I go back.

980
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:23,537
Well, then.

981
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:28,276
If you're to go back up to Seoul early tomorrow,

982
01:05:28,947 --> 01:05:30,347
you should go and get some rest.

983
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,355
Yes, then...

984
01:05:34,356 --> 01:05:35,387
Right.

985
01:05:43,827 --> 01:05:46,066
I went to the airport that day.

986
01:05:50,537 --> 01:05:52,767
I just wanted to tell you.

987
01:05:57,706 --> 01:05:58,847
I'll be going, then.

988
01:06:29,037 --> 01:06:30,977
It's been over a year already.

989
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:34,347
Yeon Woo is...

990
01:06:35,717 --> 01:06:38,287
so quick to sort out his emotions.

991

("Backseat Dating Advice")

996
01:07:03,876 --> 01:07:06,746
Today is the first anniversary of "Backseat Dating Advice."

997
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:09,916
So, we're doing a live broadcast in an open studio.

998
01:07:10,376 --> 01:07:11,387
Goodness.

999
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:14,716
Thankfully, so many people have come to see the show.

("Backseat Dating Advice")

1001
01:07:21,057 --> 01:07:22,097
What is it?

1002
01:07:23,126 --> 01:07:25,066
Is someone here your type, Ms. Jang?

1003
01:07:29,197 --> 01:07:32,306
We've prepared various segments.

1004
01:07:32,307 --> 01:07:34,876
First, let's take some questions.

1005
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:38,005
The man in the back.

1006
01:07:38,006 --> 01:07:40,247
I'll ask you a question, Ms. Jang.

1007
01:07:41,376 --> 01:07:43,416
You're in your 30s now.

1008
01:07:43,677 --> 01:07:45,616
Would you still be polyamorous...

1009
01:07:45,617 --> 01:07:47,586
in your 60s too?

1010
01:07:52,086 --> 01:07:53,585
There's something...

1011
01:07:53,586 --> 01:07:56,227
I want to confess to you all today.

1012
01:07:57,327 --> 01:07:58,767
I am no longer...

1013
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:01,197
polyamorous.

1014
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:06,907
But that doesn't mean I'm monogamous either.

1015
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:09,705
I'm in the process of finding a third option,

1016
01:08:09,706 --> 01:08:11,106
or my own dating style.

1017
01:08:12,776 --> 01:08:13,947
What's important is...

1018
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:18,647
that I've realized it's impossible for someone who can't love...

1019
01:08:19,086 --> 01:08:20,887
even a single person properly...

1020
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:23,916
to love multiple people.

1021
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:25,887
I believe...

1022
01:08:26,326 --> 01:08:29,156
this is also part of my painful growth.

1023
01:08:29,857 --> 01:08:33,495
Yes, please give Ms. Jang's courageous confession...

1024
01:08:33,496 --> 01:08:36,097
another round of applause.

1025
01:08:45,876 --> 01:08:46,946
Hello.

1026
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:49,546
Yes, hello.

1027
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:51,785
Is Dr. Sim Yeon Woo here?

1028
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:53,786
Oh, Dr. Sim?

1029
01:08:53,817 --> 01:08:55,416
He has the day off today.

1030
01:08:55,956 --> 01:08:57,887
Oh, it's his day off?

1031
01:08:58,387 --> 01:09:01,296
He goes somewhere once a month.

1032
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:03,956
He only smiles when I ask him about it.

1033
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:05,666
I see.

1034
01:09:06,427 --> 01:09:09,237
Then, will I be able to meet him if I wait here?

1035
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:12,036
He won't be back today.

1036
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:14,206
He spends a night there.

1037
01:09:14,477 --> 01:09:16,477
Oh, is that so?

1038
01:09:18,307 --> 01:09:20,806
All right. Goodbye.

1039
01:09:20,807 --> 01:09:23,076
Yes, goodbye.

1040
01:09:32,357 --> 01:09:33,656
Excuse me.

1041
01:09:35,326 --> 01:09:37,256
What is this hospital's address?

1042
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:46,866
(Slow Post Box)

1043
01:09:54,717 --> 01:09:57,317
Nothing is intended to happen between us,

1044
01:09:57,446 --> 01:09:58,546
but should we...

1045
01:10:07,956 --> 01:10:09,397
start again?

1046
01:10:26,076 --> 01:10:30,046
The sea looks warmer than usual, So Jin.

1047
01:10:32,586 --> 01:10:34,086
(Slow Post Box)

1048
01:10:35,817 --> 01:10:37,086
For some reason,

1049
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:38,987
I want to send this postcard.

1050
01:10:40,126 --> 01:10:41,427
It will be stamped "Address Unknown," though.

1051
01:11:15,996 --> 01:11:18,195
What... So Jin, how did you come...

1052
01:11:18,196 --> 01:11:19,267
Well,

1053
01:11:20,126 --> 01:11:22,296
I came to send a postcard.

1054
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:24,567
To whom?

1055
01:11:28,177 --> 01:11:30,937
To you, a year from now.

1056
01:11:34,876 --> 01:11:36,217
What will you write?

1057
01:11:39,586 --> 01:11:40,916
I wrote that...

1058
01:11:41,857 --> 01:11:44,156
I let my DNA lover go because of you.

1059
01:11:46,156 --> 01:11:48,456
I don't mean you should take responsibility.

1060
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:50,897
My choice is my responsibility.

1061
01:11:51,196 --> 01:11:52,366
It's just that...

1062
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,536
no matter what happens from now on...

1063
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,006
And we don't know how we might change,

1064
01:12:02,807 --> 01:12:04,406
but I want to...

1065
01:12:06,147 --> 01:12:08,076
start this risky relationship again.

1066
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:12,487
It's not my DNA lover...

1067
01:12:13,847 --> 01:12:16,086
but you whom I love.

1068
01:12:20,687 --> 01:12:22,656
I love you too, So Jin.

1069
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:51,987
Do you want to walk to the lighthouse?

1070
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,387
Shall we?

1071
01:12:53,756 --> 01:12:56,256
I'll just go and mail this postcard.

1072
01:12:56,397 --> 01:12:57,456
All right.

1073
01:13:02,637 --> 01:13:05,967
This man might not be my DNA lover.

1074
01:13:06,836 --> 01:13:09,137
No, he probably isn't.

1075
01:13:09,637 --> 01:13:11,647
My research isn't wrong.

1076
01:13:35,267 --> 01:13:37,536
So, we might find ourselves in pain,

1077
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:41,006
hurt, and uncomfortable.

1078
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:45,107
But we decided to start again.

1079
01:13:46,307 --> 01:13:48,246
Instead of DNA or destiny,

1080
01:13:48,977 --> 01:13:51,147
I'm going to try believing in love.

1081
01:13:54,116 --> 01:13:55,456
So, today,

1082
01:13:56,116 --> 01:13:58,256
I will scrap my theory...

1083
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:00,027
on DNA lovers.

1084
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:05,567
(Thank you for watching DNA Lover.)

1085
01:14:42,897 --> 01:14:45,906
