(Departures)

6
00:00:15,384 --> 00:00:18,654
I let him leave without any promise of return.

7
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:22,093
I didn't even get to say my final goodbye.

8
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:25,385
I just feel infinitely powerless.

9
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,624
For a long time, I believed I made the right choice.

10
00:00:31,894 --> 00:00:34,024
I only realized...

11
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,164
I was wrong after he left.

12
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:42,204
If I think about it, it could've been fate,

13
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:43,774

That's why I'm leaving.

21
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:07,364
Because I started to believe in fate.

Hey.

So Jin.

25
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:30,174
What's wrong, So Jin? Are you okay?

26
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,514
So Jin!

27
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:54,165
Are you awake?

28
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:57,635
What happened?

29
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,075
Thankfully, your fever has gone down a bit.

30
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:04,845
You had a 38-degree fever earlier.

31
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,984
I guess the accident is just now hitting me.

32
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,725
I bought some medicine, so make sure to take it.

33
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,095
Now that you're awake, I'll go.

34
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:20,494
You're going to go?

35
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:30,204
Thanks, Kang Hoon.

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,875
So Jin.

I don't want you to hurt so much.

38
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:48,024
I'll go.

39
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,415
What should I do?

(Sim General Hospital)

41
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:47,114
This punk should let me know whether or not he arrived safely.

42
00:04:47,115 --> 00:04:49,620
He's still the same, even now that he has left.

43
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,855
I hope Doctor Sim arrived safely.

44
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:55,025
Me too.

45
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:59,654
Doesn't the hospital feel empty and gloomy without him?

46
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,424
Why does it feel gloomy? I'm here.

47
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:02,794
Right.

51

What are you talking about?

52
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,944
It is boring without him.

53
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,515
But I'm sure he'll be fine there.

54
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:32,754
- One order of sundae to go, please. - Okay.

55

56
00:05:41,704 --> 00:05:43,035
Right.

57
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:44,934
When did you get here?

58
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,475
Are things going well with So Jin?

59
00:05:56,684 --> 00:05:58,015
Yes.

60
00:06:01,285 --> 00:06:02,785
That's good.

61
00:06:05,595 --> 00:06:07,465
- Here you go. - Thank you.

62
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,864
I gave you lots of liver and lung.

63
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:11,465
Thank you.

64
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:13,965
See you later, then.

65
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:17,405
It's not going well.

66
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:20,705
What?

67
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:23,674
It's not going well.

68
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,915
Do you want a drink?

69
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,610
Eating like this is pretty nice.

70
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:47,105
It's kind of romantic.

71
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,933
Do you come here often?

72
00:06:49,934 --> 00:06:53,574
Yes. I have some special memories here.

73
00:06:56,944 --> 00:06:58,374
When I was young,

74
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,785
I met So Jin here for the first time.

75
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:08,085
Is it okay for me to be here with you?

76
00:07:12,124 --> 00:07:14,064
Yeon Woo is not here anymore.

77
00:07:14,194 --> 00:07:17,095
Everything should be good with So Jin now.

78
00:07:17,665 --> 00:07:20,864
But you don't seem very happy.

79
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,475
Seriously.

80
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:29,605
Feelings are so strange.

81
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,915
I thought Yeon Woo leaving...

82
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:35,785
would solve everything.

83
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:38,384
But when that situation actually came,

84
00:07:40,324 --> 00:07:42,184
I lost my confidence.

85
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:46,395
"Can I really make..."

86
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:50,095
"So Jin happy? Can I fill her heart?"

87
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:54,064
I asked myself those questions for a long time.

88
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,405
Actually,

89
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:01,074
I've known the answer for a long time,

90
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,114
but I tried to deny it.

91
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:13,255
How are you so similar to me?

92
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:15,924
I was the same.

93
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:19,671
I think I demanded their love to feel happy...

94
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,895
even though that person didn't want me.

95
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:26,635
Looking back, I was so selfish and bad.

96
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:29,905
That's why I let him go.

97
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:32,905
I don't know about the other things,

98
00:08:33,534 --> 00:08:35,474
but you're wrong about one thing.

99
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,714
- What? - You're not...

100
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,474
a selfish and bad person.

101
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,184
I know that.

102
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:48,525
I didn't know...

103
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,395
you could say things like that.

104
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,064
They say when people suddenly change, they die.

105
00:08:55,465 --> 00:08:56,924
Are you sick?

106
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,980
- I'm not. - Are you sure?

107
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,604
You seem strange.

108
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:06,411
What?

109
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:09,704
Where did all of my liver and lung pieces go?

110
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:13,944
That's strange.

111
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:19,155
I only had one piece each. Where did they go?

112
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,653
It wasn't me. It really wasn't.

113
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:24,454
Are you acting innocent?

114
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:27,964
What? I only ate one. Hold on.

115
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:30,734
Goodness.

116
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:32,934
- Where did they go? - What is this?

117
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,905
It wasn't me. Did I eat the wrong thing?

118
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:38,711
I guess I ate the innards. Did I mistake it for sundae?

119
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,074
That's strange. Why do you keep denying it?

120
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,744
- Where did they go? - What?

121
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:45,314
- Come on. - There's one left, Mi Eun.

122
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:00,554
Father Andrea.

123
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:04,635
I'm Sister Anna.

124
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:11,005
Where did he go?

125
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,804
There's no mass.

126
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,495
Father Andrea.

127
00:11:16,565 --> 00:11:19,535
Sister Anna. What brings you here?

128
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:32,915
I was worried because you didn't come to mass.

129
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:36,655
Were you here the whole time?

130
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:45,934
Sister Anna.

131
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:49,735
Yes, Father.

132
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,974
I'm a priest who claims to love God...

133
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,875
but can't love people.

134
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:02,985
God tells us to love people.

135
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:07,954
I don't deserve to be a priest.

136
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:13,155
What do you mean by that?

137
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,824
I knew Yi Myung was struggling,

138
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,905
but I never offered a helping hand.

139
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:24,775
Yi Myung...

140
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,704
killed the family who abused him and sent him back to the orphanage.

141
00:12:29,745 --> 00:12:31,645
While he was in prison,

142
00:12:32,774 --> 00:12:35,314
he sent me dozens of letters.

143
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:38,755
But I...

144
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,655
didn't respond to a single one.

145
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,064
I just put...

146
00:12:50,024 --> 00:12:53,995
the responsibility on God to take care of Yi Myung,

147
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:57,604
and I turned away from him.

148
00:12:58,004 --> 00:13:00,535
Yi Myung.

149
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,174
Yi Myung!

150
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:04,074
Yi Myung!

151
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,944
Yi Myung may have stolen...

152
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,385
my robes and Bible...

153
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:11,814
because he missed me.

154
00:13:13,615 --> 00:13:17,454
But I didn't even look in his direction.

155
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:20,824
I was worried that I would drown...

156
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:25,564
in the darkness inside of him if I met him.

157
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:28,865
- I was afraid of that... - No.

158
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,635
You...

159
00:13:33,274 --> 00:13:35,505
love people.

160
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:41,145
Didn't you come into the closet to save me...

161
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,684
because of your love for a person?

162
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,515
Even then,

163
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,755
I was the one being consoled.

164
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:52,694
By you.

165
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:02,604
As long as I remain a priest,

166
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,775
I won't be able to love anyone.

167
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,724
All done. Let's go.

168
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:12,650
Why are you working on that scarf in the middle of the summer?

169
00:15:12,674 --> 00:15:15,444
You don't actually believe what I said...

170
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:17,074
about the thread of fate, do you?

171
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:21,684
I just want to give it to her as a present.

172
00:15:22,485 --> 00:15:23,961
She gets cold easily.

173
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,285
Who?

174
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:27,554
So Jin.

175
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:31,025
- Kang Hoon, do you... - It's not like that.

176
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,025
I want So Jin...

177
00:15:33,624 --> 00:15:35,865
to wear this scarf and meet a good guy.

178
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,094
So Jin should meet...

179
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:44,905
someone she can't forget even after they're gone, like you.

180
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,434
What about you?

182
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,123
Hello.

183
00:16:02,124 --> 00:16:03,954
Ms. Eo. Big news.

184
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:05,554
Do you know what I just saw?

185
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:06,895
Look at this.

186
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,293
Hello.

187
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,234
- Ta-da. - Oh, my.

188
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:14,541
Does Dr. Yeo look great on TV?

189
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:17,211
He's a celebrity. I'm going to get an autograph later.

190
00:16:17,235 --> 00:16:18,350
Don't be dramatic.

191
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,734
He's introducing himself.

192
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:22,174
- Let's see. - I'm Kwang Su...

193
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:23,905
of Solo Land Season 23.

194
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,745
I was born in 1988, and I'm 36 years old.

195
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,885
I live in Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

196
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:35,753
I'm a doctor of endourology at Sim General Hospital...

197
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:37,255
in Cheongdam-dong.

198
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:40,225
I have...

199
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:43,525
a house, a car,

200
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:45,340
and many friends,

201
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:47,535
but I'm missing one thing.

202
00:16:48,165 --> 00:16:49,333
That's...

203
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:52,333
("I Am Solo")

204
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:53,705
Well...

205
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,344
I actually...

206
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:57,073
(A surprise confession)

207
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:58,975
I have aspermia.

208
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,084
But I plan...

209
00:17:01,284 --> 00:17:04,455
to use all of the money and time I would've spent on my kids...

210
00:17:04,854 --> 00:17:07,725
on myself and my wife.

211
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:12,124
I want to meet someone who would like to live...

212
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,424
a DINK lifestyle with me.

213
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:15,725
Thank you.

214
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,104
What is your ideal type?

215
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,250
Well, I like...

216
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:26,174
small, fragile,

217
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:29,045
and feminine women.

218
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:31,775
Oh, my.

219
00:17:32,475 --> 00:17:33,945
I used to.

220
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:36,045
But not too long ago,

221
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:40,654
I changed a lot after being in a relationship...

222
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:42,030
that completely changed my life.

223
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,194
Now, I don't have an ideal type.

224
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:46,955
All of you sitting here...

225
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:50,025
can become my ideal type.

226
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,563
What kind of hobbies do you have?

227
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,035
Do you like to exercise?

228
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,834
I didn't like to exercise, but I like it now.

229
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:02,374
I tend to take care of myself well.

230
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:05,914
When I get a girlfriend, I want to go...

231
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,814
to a foot spa with her.

232
00:18:10,614 --> 00:18:12,253
I'm embarrassed of my feet.

233
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:15,854
Why? They're the prettiest feet in the world.

234
00:18:22,564 --> 00:18:26,033
I want to go to a drive-in theatre once a week.

235
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:27,935
Call me Jung Tam.

236
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:30,304
Don't call me doctor.

237
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,134
Or my lovely cutie-pie.

238
00:18:34,034 --> 00:18:35,705
Even after getting married,

239
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:39,351
I want to spend every day like we're on...

240
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,914
a romantic date.

241
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,785
I'm actually a DINK too.

242
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:47,724
I see.

243
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:51,011
("I Am Solo")

244
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,524
We just broke up!

245
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,493
(Sim General Hospital)

246
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:57,394
Our celebrity.

247
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:59,211
No pictures!

248
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:01,164
Hello.

249
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,351
Doctor Yeo. Why do you look so great on TV?

250
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,273
Are you going to be a cool kid now?

251
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:08,444
Wait. Please give me an autograph.

252
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm not a cool kid.

253
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:11,921
Why do you look so sad?

254
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,613
Because I'm lonely.

255
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,644
- Did you not get a match? - What?

256
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,730
What happened? Give us a spoiler.

257
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:19,215
Did it not work out?

258
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:21,884
I don't know.

259
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,654
Why did you bring up the aspermia thing?

260
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:26,353
Seriously. Why did he do that?

261
00:19:26,354 --> 00:19:28,164
Here is your drink.

262
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:29,564
Thank you.

266
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,645
(Artist Yoo Myung Hee will hold an exhibit on June 15.)

267
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:50,545
Is the project going well?

268
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:54,824
I'm sorry. You must be going through a lot.

269
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,455
It's okay. I should separate my personal life from work.

270
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:01,495
I'm a bit worried about the topic.

271
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:05,333
How about you choose a topic that you're an expert in?

272
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,634
Romance.

273
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:09,904
You should take this chance to do it officially.

274
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:11,904
Right...

275
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,175
I'm not sure.

276
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:18,945
One second.

277
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,650
(So Ri)

278
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:23,384
Hello?

279
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,914
What's going on?

280
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:30,324
What?

281
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:35,695
Okay. I'll be right there.

282
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,374
Ms. Han.

283
00:20:45,675 --> 00:20:47,820
Did something happen? What's wrong?

284
00:20:47,844 --> 00:20:49,505
Oh, I...

285
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:51,314
I...

286
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:54,820
Well, I will... I'll head home early today.

287
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,144
Let's talk about the details tomorrow.

288
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:57,684
I'm sorry. I'll get going.

289
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:58,985
Okay.

290
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,425
Mom.

291
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,634
You're here.

292
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,765
Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:21,745
It's nothing. You don't need to worry.

294
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,675
Nothing?

295
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:28,015
You should've at least told me.

296
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,813
Who else can you talk to other than me?

297
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:32,154
Mi Eun.

298
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:36,785
Death isn't a tragedy but a providence.

299
00:21:37,955 --> 00:21:39,455
I'm so happy...

300
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:43,594
that I'm a painter who gets inspiration from death.

301
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,134
I need you to understand me.

302
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:47,270
Mom.

303
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:49,134
Understand what?

304
00:21:49,435 --> 00:21:52,073
Did I have to hear about you dying through a news article?

305
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:54,704
Mi Eun. You should go for today.

306
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:56,775
Okay, Mom. I'll be back another day.

307
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:04,283
What's with the exhibition?

308
00:22:04,284 --> 00:22:06,985
You don't even have enough time to get surgery and chemotherapy.

309
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:11,131
Why are you holding this dumb exhibit?

310
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,925
Do you want me...

311
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:17,124
to get my lung cut out,

312
00:22:17,764 --> 00:22:20,394
get anti-cancer injections, vomit, pass out,

313
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:22,103
while I wither away in fear...

314
00:22:22,104 --> 00:22:24,134
of the cancer spreading...

315
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:26,881
to my organs, bones, and brain?

316
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,904
Why are you already thinking of dying?

317
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,503
Many people live healthy lives...

318
00:22:30,504 --> 00:22:32,244
after getting surgery and making a full recovery.

319
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:33,644
I'm going to get surgery...

320
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:36,283
after the exhibition is over.

321
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:38,783
What if the cancer spreads in that time?

322
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:41,955
It's my cancer. It doesn't have anything to do with you two.

323
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,824
What?

324
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:47,725
If you feel that bad,

325
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:50,864
hold an exhibit for me after I die.

326
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:54,465
You're so selfish...

327
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:58,005
until the end.

328
00:22:59,574 --> 00:23:01,604
Don't you care about me and So Ri?

329
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:10,545
I haven't done anything for you.

330
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,755
How can I burden you now?

331
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:16,624
I've just lived my life fighting my fate.

332
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,054
Although that fate...

333
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,725
eventually brought me here.

334
00:23:22,395 --> 00:23:25,535
You two don't need to be swallowed up by my fate.

335
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,604
I won't apologize...

336
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:32,074
to you or anyone.

337
00:23:32,735 --> 00:23:34,205
So...

338
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:38,874
don't suddenly ask me to be a mom now.

339
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:42,185
We can just live our own lives.

340
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:45,314
As we've always done.

341
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:05,974
Catch me if you can.

342
00:24:05,975 --> 00:24:07,874
- Catch me if you can. - Dad!

343
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,175
Come and catch me.

344
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,175
- Be careful. - I'm going to catch you.

345
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:18,455
I'm going to catch you.

346
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:20,185
I'm going to catch you.

347
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,255
I caught you!

348
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,844
We ended up as you said.

349
00:24:46,175 --> 00:24:47,775
So Ri and I...

350
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:49,914
aren't weak.

351
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:58,654
Even if you leave this world,

352
00:25:01,364 --> 00:25:03,164
we will never fall.

353
00:25:06,564 --> 00:25:07,965
So...

354
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,275
please live.

355
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:23,785
Whether it be fighting or whatever you did so far,

356
00:25:25,814 --> 00:25:28,054
don't force us to watch you...

357
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:30,584
give into your destiny.

358
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,404
Mom.

359
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:54,275
Are you filming a melodrama?

360
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,215
You're so annoying.

361
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:23,644
When you introduced yourself,

362
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,543
- you said you'd met your true love. - Yes.

363
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,414
Why did you break up?

364
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,415
Oh, well...

365
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,513
(I'm Alone)

366
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,015
I was confident...

367
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:37,554
I could love her for the rest of my life.

368
00:26:38,225 --> 00:26:40,195
But I guess that wasn't...

369
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:42,525
good enough.

370
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,364
Actually...

371
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:52,033
Just looking at this reminds me of her.

372
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:53,604
(I miss my ex so much.)

373
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:57,745
I miss her...

374
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,944
like crazy.

375
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,013
(He burst into tears.)

376
00:27:00,014 --> 00:27:01,314
(Flustered)

377
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,560
Watch him cry. Isn't he hilarious?

378
00:27:04,584 --> 00:27:06,955
How can a crying guy look this pathetic?

379
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,485
My gosh.

380
00:27:10,024 --> 00:27:11,695
Seriously?

381
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:12,823
Oh, no.

382
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:14,394
This is funny?

383
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:17,364
Do you think this is funny?

384
00:27:17,625 --> 00:27:20,164
What's her problem?

385
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:23,834
Why did I even come here?

386
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,874
Why did he cry on national television?

387
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:46,525
Darn it.

388
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:54,094
Goodbye.

389
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,333
- Wait. Let's... - Let go of me.

390
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:57,434
Let's talk.

391
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,634
Do we have anything left to say?

392
00:28:00,774 --> 00:28:03,244
Oh, do you have good news to share...

393
00:28:03,245 --> 00:28:05,614
about the new DINK partner you met?

394
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,344
Did you see me on "I'm Alone?"

395
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:13,353
No. I'm way too busy...

396
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:16,554
to watch stuff like "I'm Alone."

397
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:18,455
Goodbye.

398
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,023
No, wait.

399
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:22,000
I didn't go on because I wanted to.

400
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:24,641
A friend of mine produces the show,

401
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:27,063
and a guy backed out at the last minute.

402
00:28:27,064 --> 00:28:29,634
He begged me to fill in, and I had no choice.

403
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,333
You don't have to explain that to me.

404
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,235
I don't want my feelings to be misconstrued.

405
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:39,445
I thought of you throughout the whole thing.

406
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:42,685
I didn't care for any of the women.

407
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,525
Did you really not miss me at all?

408
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:56,324
I missed you a lot,

409
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:58,324
Sung Mi.

410
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:04,664
I did not miss you.

411
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:13,515
Could you look at me as you say that?

412
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:17,414
I did not...

413
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,614
miss you.

414
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,354
Sung Mi.

415
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:30,594
I love you.

416
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,735
What are you doing?

417
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,045
You know what I'm doing.

418
00:29:45,774 --> 00:29:47,745
Let me go.

419
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:51,084
- Stay still. - Okay.

420
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:04,195
(The Bible)

421
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:41,695
I don't consider this apostasy.

422
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:46,134
I finally broke free of the fence that held me in.

423
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,574
I know, Father.

424
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:55,545
This is just another path to finding God.

425
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,285
Yes.

426
00:31:00,476 --> 00:31:03,754
(Always Sushi)

427
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,211
Kang Hoon.

428
00:31:18,235 --> 00:31:19,634
So Jin.

429
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:21,275
Well...

430
00:31:22,205 --> 00:31:25,844
It's nice in the evening. Shall we go somewhere?

431
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:27,975
You know...

432
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:32,084
whenever I broke up with someone,

433
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:35,654
I came up here to chew out and curse...

434
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:38,354
the guy who hurt me.

435
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,354
But this time...

436
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:47,064
I found myself resenting me.

437
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,874
I thought...

438
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:57,621
Yeon Woo had left me to run away.

439
00:31:57,645 --> 00:31:59,015
But...

440
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:04,114
I was the one who had run away.

441
00:32:07,584 --> 00:32:09,785
Because our DNA didn't match,

442
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:14,225
I ignored the feelings I had for him.

443
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:18,695
Out of fear that I'd get hurt again if it wasn't destiny,

444
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:22,735
I didn't even believe...

445
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:25,574
how he felt about me.

446
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:34,574
So I've decided...

447
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:39,084
to have some courage.

448
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:45,324
I'll forget about DNA and destiny...

449
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:49,164
and follow...

450
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:52,435
my heart.

451
00:32:54,534 --> 00:32:57,935
What if Yeon Woo never returns?

452
00:32:58,135 --> 00:32:59,505
No.

453
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,874
What if he does...

454
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:05,520
and he no longer loves you?

455
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,045
Then...

456
00:33:08,745 --> 00:33:10,245
I'll cry.

457
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:14,215
I'll cry and suffer.

458
00:33:15,254 --> 00:33:17,084
And get over it.

459
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:49,584
Can I...

460
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:52,925
give you a hug?

461
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:26,771
I'm free!

462
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:29,763
Han So Jin finally set me free!

463
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:31,264
Yes!

464
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:34,394
You go ahead.

465
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:37,235
Go on.

466
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,244
- Go. - I'll go ahead.

467
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:25,784
Hey.

468
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:28,255
I guess I came at the right time.

469
00:35:29,685 --> 00:35:31,584
Why are you here?

470
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:35,624
Well...

471
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:38,494
I couldn't sleep.

472
00:35:39,534 --> 00:35:41,903
I was feeling a bit lonely,

473
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:44,005
and this place came to mind.

474
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:49,974
I came by wondering if you'd be here too,

475
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,874
and here you are.

476
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,445
We must have a connection.

477
00:36:02,284 --> 00:36:04,184
I saw the movie "The Notebook."

478
00:36:07,855 --> 00:36:11,664
"I might be someone easy to forget,"

479
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:15,235
"but I gave my soul to loving one woman."

480
00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,434
"It's a successful life."

481
00:36:20,605 --> 00:36:22,675
That's what you're like.

482
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:27,314
So Jin's a real idiot.

483
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:28,945
To reject someone like you.

484
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:38,124
Well, I guess you're right.

485
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:42,865
My heart does hurt bad.

486
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,971
But deep inside, I'm relieved.

487
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,635
See? I was right.

488
00:36:49,404 --> 00:36:52,604
I hope So Jin will be happy.

489
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:54,204
She will be.

490
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:57,775
She's quite resilient.

491
00:36:59,775 --> 00:37:01,215
How about...

492
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:04,221
the two people who got rejected...

493
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:05,755
drink together?

494
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:08,115
We can't drink here.

495
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,825
- Sorry. You're all wet. - I'm sorry.

496
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:13,224
Here.

497
00:37:14,424 --> 00:37:15,795
Thank you.

498
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:26,104
You're much more thoughtful than I expected.

499
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,104
You even have a handkerchief.

500
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:30,905
That's because...

501
00:37:31,145 --> 00:37:34,914
So Jin's clumsy and scatterbrained.

502
00:37:35,444 --> 00:37:37,885
I started carrying around a handkerchief.

503
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,615
I won't need it anymore.

504
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,584
You never know.

505
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:48,724
You might meet someone else whom you'd want to look after.

506
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:00,405
Shall we go?

507
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:08,075
Do you want to watch a late-night movie?

508
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:11,485
It will cheer you up.

509
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:13,584
Right now?

510
00:38:14,815 --> 00:38:17,385
There's no limit to time or location when it comes to cheering up.

511
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:20,195
- But... - Let's go.

512
00:38:22,225 --> 00:38:23,371
A toast?

513
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:25,894
You can't drink in public parks.

(Seo Kang Hoon)

516
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:48,115
I've been looking for and finding answers...

517
00:38:48,185 --> 00:38:50,684
to the difficult problems I'd faced in life.

518
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:55,898
(Seo Kang Hoon)

519
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,463
There's still one assignment...

520
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:02,434
in my heart that I've yet to solve.

521
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:20,407
(1 year later)

522
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,463
Ta-da.

523
00:40:06,464 --> 00:40:07,740
Yeon Woo.

524
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:10,564
I made gopchang tteokbokki that you love.

525
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:11,604
Have a look.

526
00:40:11,605 --> 00:40:12,905
Here.

527
00:40:13,205 --> 00:40:14,481
How does it look?

528
00:40:14,505 --> 00:40:18,173
Mom. Gopchang tteokbokki is best when it's spicy.

529
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:20,144
Is it?

530
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:23,215
Is that why you didn't eat much of mine?

531
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:26,061
You can't eat spicy food.

532
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:28,184
When I visit you in Korea next time,

533
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,360
I'll make you royal tteokbokki...

534
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,595
with beef and soy sauce.

535
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:34,323
You'll visit?

536
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,340
Of course, I should.

537
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,971
I heard you'll open a clinic in the countryside.

538
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:42,164
You'll be tired. I should look after you.

539
00:40:42,165 --> 00:40:43,664
It's not my clinic.

540
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:46,434
I get paid a monthly salary.

541
00:40:46,435 --> 00:40:47,834
What?

542
00:40:48,734 --> 00:40:50,320
You're on a salary?

543
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:53,113
Why? Is it because of your hand?

544
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:54,474
No.

545
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:58,385
It's because I need time to settle in here.

546
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:00,990
See you soon, Mom.

547
00:41:01,014 --> 00:41:02,354
Pass.

548
00:41:02,784 --> 00:41:04,084
Pass!

549
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:09,055
Hey. Are they serving curry today?

550
00:41:09,964 --> 00:41:11,664
The kids must be happy.

551
00:41:13,495 --> 00:41:15,534
- Hi. - Hello.

552
00:41:16,705 --> 00:41:19,204
- Goodness. - Oh, thank you.

553
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:22,443
You look much happier here.

554
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:23,845
Do I?

555
00:41:26,475 --> 00:41:30,284
The children cheer me up and give me strength.

556
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:33,731
I also feel closer to the God...

557
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,954
I searched for all along.

558
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:38,784
I can tell.

559
00:41:39,194 --> 00:41:42,595
This suits you way more than your priest uniform.

560
00:41:42,924 --> 00:41:45,764
I'm a bit envious that you look happier.

561
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:48,334
Yes. I'm happy.

562
00:41:49,364 --> 00:41:51,934
Thanks for coming to volunteer every time.

563
00:41:51,935 --> 00:41:53,434
Don't thank me.

564
00:41:53,705 --> 00:41:56,604
I come once a month for some inner healing.

565
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:00,845
In the end, everyone just wants to be happy.

566
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:04,715
Me, all the kids here,

567
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:06,985
you,

568
00:42:07,685 --> 00:42:09,255
and Yi Myung.

569
00:42:11,324 --> 00:42:13,331
- You can't go. - I really have to.

570
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:14,831
Please. Let go of me.

571
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:17,064
- Why are you doing this to me? - Come back inside.

572
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:19,264
- Let's play. - Play with us.

573
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:20,735
So Jin!

574
00:42:20,835 --> 00:42:23,135
What took you so long?

575
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:25,764
Kids. Aunt So Jin's here.

576
00:42:25,935 --> 00:42:28,135
You should say hi.

577
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,305
Charge!

578
00:42:32,444 --> 00:42:34,751
Long time no see. How have you been?

579
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,644
Wait. I can't drop this.

580
00:42:36,944 --> 00:42:38,343
- Were you having fun? - I'll take that for you.

581
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,414
Thank you.

582
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:41,354
- Take your time. - Okay.

583
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,255
A Ri.

584
00:42:47,194 --> 00:42:49,124
She has changed.

585
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:53,064
Shall we start with Min Jae?

586
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,364
Min Jae.

587
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:57,110
I told you last time to eat lots of vegetables.

588
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:58,434
Did you do so last month?

589
00:42:58,435 --> 00:42:59,681
No.

590
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:01,874
Why not? You promised.

591
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,474
But there are so many tasty things...

592
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:07,251
other than vegetables out there.

593
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:08,874
I love meat.

594
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:12,454
Even so, you made a promise, so let's try to stick to it.

595
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:13,914
Okay? Promise.

596
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:17,155
Ms. Han. I kept my promise.

597
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:19,931
I skipped rope a hundred times every day.

598
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:22,001
My height gene will grow, right?

599
00:43:22,025 --> 00:43:24,240
Nice, Yoon Soo.

600
00:43:24,264 --> 00:43:26,135
You deserve a high-five.

601
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:28,763
Good job. But you must keep it up.

602
00:43:28,764 --> 00:43:30,365
- Okay. - Promise.

603
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:33,305
- Next. - Let's break up.

604
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:35,675
What?

605
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,481
You said we were meant to be.

606
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:39,443
How can love change?

607
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:40,943
Why are you so childish?

608
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:43,115
We both like beans stewed in soy sauce.

609
00:43:43,214 --> 00:43:45,014
We both like teddy bears.

610
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:47,213
We both like the same colour...

611
00:43:47,214 --> 00:43:49,354
and star signs. You said it was fate.

612
00:43:49,355 --> 00:43:51,001
How is that important?

613
00:43:51,025 --> 00:43:53,595
There's no such thing as fate, silly.

614
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:55,740
Then what's important?

615
00:43:55,764 --> 00:43:58,300
Whether you truly like each other.

616
00:43:58,324 --> 00:44:00,195
Don't you know that?

617
00:44:03,134 --> 00:44:04,505
Oh, right.

618
00:44:04,605 --> 00:44:07,005
I don't like beans stewed in soy sauce anymore.

619
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:11,345
It can't be.

620
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:22,925
Shall we get started?

(Iroun Genetic Center)

623
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:57,124
For the last year, I've been working on...

624
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:59,053
the Iroun Project.

625
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:00,255

(Parkinson's disease gene GPR27)

627
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,994
In 2023,

628
00:45:04,025 --> 00:45:06,834
it was reported that GPR27, a gene in Koreans...

629
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:10,534
that causes Parkinson's disease was discovered.

630
00:45:10,634 --> 00:45:12,774
So for the past year, to predict...

631
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:15,133
future cases and provide gene-specific treatments,

632
00:45:15,134 --> 00:45:16,704
our team has been visiting...

633
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:19,650
the elderly living in areas with less medical coverage...

634
00:45:19,674 --> 00:45:22,014
to test their genes.

635
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:25,314
Because this project targets the elderly,

636
00:45:25,315 --> 00:45:27,783
the cases must be managed locally.

637
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:30,454
We plan to cooperate with local elderly care centres...

638
00:45:30,455 --> 00:45:32,823
and organizations that provide home care...

639
00:45:32,824 --> 00:45:34,454
in the future.

640
00:45:34,455 --> 00:45:35,900
Nice.

641
00:45:35,924 --> 00:45:38,823
Han So Jin's project switched genres.

642
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:40,564
From a melodrama to human drama.

643
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:42,564

She's the reason we have to visit rundown areas all over.

When will I ever get my weekends back?

647
00:45:52,645 --> 00:45:55,144

648
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,343
I'll join you this time.

649
00:45:58,344 --> 00:46:00,354
I like that, BK.

650
00:46:00,415 --> 00:46:04,184
Remember it's hard to look after the elderly.

651
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:05,485
Okay.

652
00:46:09,764 --> 00:46:11,064

We'll give you this cup with a funnel.

667
00:46:49,804 --> 00:46:53,104
With the tip of your tongue, rub the inside...

668
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:56,175
of your cheek five times on each side.

669
00:47:02,844 --> 00:47:04,744
Then collect a lot of saliva...

670
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:06,814

- Say "ah." - Sweetie.

00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,414
"Sweetie?"

682
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,784
Well...

683
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:43,655
I see.

684
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:48,255
No one has called me that in a long time.

If you open your mouth wide,

687
00:47:51,964 --> 00:47:55,095
your sweetie will give you something sweet.

It might be a matter of taste,

693
00:48:09,045 --> 00:48:11,883
but his facial bone structure is symmetrical...

694
00:48:11,884 --> 00:48:14,754
and his eyes, nose, and mouth are harmoniously placed.

695
00:48:14,755 --> 00:48:17,655
Wouldn't you say he's handsome enough?

696

No.

is much better looking.

Is there a doctor...

700
00:48:28,594 --> 00:48:31,303
who has more bigger and sharper eyes than mine?

as the ones where you're from.

since Mr. Kim Sang Eun came in for an appointment.

724
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,173
We should have him come today.

He won't come today.

It's his wife's birthday.

727
00:49:49,014 --> 00:49:53,115
Everyone in this village knows about his wife's birthday.

He's been cooking a birthday meal for ten years.

729
00:49:56,855 --> 00:50:00,454
Then, I should try to sneak into...

730
00:50:01,455 --> 00:50:03,865
- that birthday party too. - Pardon?

731
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:15,434
Oh, I'm totally exhausted.

732
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,943
Let's eat something...

733
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:18,550
- when we get to Seoul. - All right.

734
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:21,545

741
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:50,744
- Who is it? - Oh, it's me.

742
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:53,274
I wanted to congratulate your wife's birthday too.

743
00:50:53,275 --> 00:50:56,715
- Here's some pork belly. - Goodness, thank you.

744
00:50:56,745 --> 00:51:00,084
I've been needing someone to eat my seaweed soup.

745
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:02,354
You look great today.

746
00:51:02,355 --> 00:51:04,425
- Do I? I look good, right? - Yes.

747
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:06,284
- Come in. - Thank you.

748
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:12,394
It feels like yesterday when my wife passed away.

749
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:15,294
I can't remember how many birthdays it's been.

750
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:18,440
Sir, have you taken the medicine I prescribed for you?

751
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:20,550
The medicine you prescribed me...

752
00:51:20,574 --> 00:51:22,650
made me sleepy, so I didn't take them.

753
00:51:22,674 --> 00:51:25,244
Come on. You still have to take them.

754
00:51:25,245 --> 00:51:29,291
If things get worse, you might have to go to a big hospital in Seoul.

755
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:32,885
Where would I go? I won't leave this place.

756
00:51:33,554 --> 00:51:35,460
My wife's name was Hyang Mi.

757
00:51:35,484 --> 00:51:37,784
This village is called Hyangmi-ri.

758
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:39,385
That was why she was called Hyang Mi.

759
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:43,564
She was born in Hyangmi-ri and lived her whole life with me.

760
00:51:43,764 --> 00:51:45,325
So, how would I leave this place?

761
00:51:47,134 --> 00:51:49,664
Sir, could I see your phone for a minute?

762
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,135
Sure.

763
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:58,004
From now on, you have to take your medicine...

764
00:51:58,005 --> 00:51:59,874
whenever you hear this alarm.

765
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:00,990
Three times a day.

766
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:04,514
If you don't, you'll keep forgetting about your wife.

767
00:52:05,745 --> 00:52:08,084
That will never happen.

768
00:52:08,214 --> 00:52:10,254
I know the day I will die.

769
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:13,354
The day I forget about Hyang Mi is the day that I'll die.

770
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:23,541
You two must've been a very loving couple.

771
00:52:23,565 --> 00:52:26,610
I'm a sensitive and stubborn man.

772
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:29,374
Hyang Mi was like a teenage girl.

773
00:52:30,505 --> 00:52:32,104
Since the beginning of our marriage,

774
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,115
we fought practically every day.

775
00:52:36,714 --> 00:52:39,644
I thought we wouldn't fight when we got older,

776
00:52:39,685 --> 00:52:42,014
but we fought so often when we were together.

777
00:52:42,415 --> 00:52:46,155
So, I spent several years at my son's house in Suwon too.

778
00:52:48,594 --> 00:52:50,800
All throughout our lives, we said we couldn't live with each other,

779
00:52:50,824 --> 00:52:53,534
bringing up divorce several times when we were angry.

780
00:52:55,264 --> 00:52:57,434
But I wonder what was in here.

781
00:52:58,005 --> 00:52:59,481
Even when we'd split apart,

782
00:52:59,505 --> 00:53:02,405
we'd end up getting back together again.

783
00:53:04,145 --> 00:53:06,451
We said it was such a tenacious relationship.

784
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,661
But I only just found out that was...

785
00:53:09,685 --> 00:53:11,445
all a connection and fate.

786
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:16,300
- Sir. - Yes?

787
00:53:16,324 --> 00:53:17,755
Have you...

788
00:53:19,225 --> 00:53:20,724
ever thought...

789
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,624
that it might've been better...

790
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:28,534
for you to separate...

791
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:30,610
for good?

792
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:32,005
What?

793
00:53:32,404 --> 00:53:34,675
Oh, it's nothing. I...

794
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:37,744
I haven't married yet, so I said the wrong thing.

795
00:53:37,745 --> 00:53:39,104
I'm sorry.

796
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:42,075
What's so important about being happy or not?

797
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:46,244
The fact that there was someone to spend every moment with,

798
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:49,115
and the fact that it was Hyang Mi, is what makes me happy.

799
00:53:54,895 --> 00:53:56,195
Here.

800
00:53:56,324 --> 00:53:58,400
Oh, right.

801
00:53:58,424 --> 00:53:59,764
There.

802
00:54:00,395 --> 00:54:01,395
Thank you.

803
00:54:01,396 --> 00:54:02,565
(Iroun Genetic Center)

804
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:18,920
Sometimes, in that direction,

805
00:54:18,944 --> 00:54:21,115
you can see my favourite star.

806
00:54:22,014 --> 00:54:25,255
I found out later that the star was called Io.

807
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:27,431
Io is a moon of Jupiter.

808
00:54:27,455 --> 00:54:30,124
It became a nightmare star because it was the closest to Jupiter.

809
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:32,024
Lava explodes on one side,

810
00:54:32,025 --> 00:54:35,440
and the other side without lava is minus 148°C.

811
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:38,081
So, it's either a ball of fire or a ball of ice.

812
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:40,681
So, that star became a nightmare...

813
00:54:40,705 --> 00:54:42,434
because they're stuck together?

814
00:54:44,174 --> 00:54:46,550
Still, if I were Io,

815
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,445
I'd never want to get far away from Jupiter.

816
00:54:49,475 --> 00:54:50,983
If they weren't close together,

817
00:54:50,984 --> 00:54:53,584
Io would wander around the endless outer space alone.

818
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:59,025
I like being alone.

819
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:02,755
I liked being alone.

820
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:08,803
(Jung Tam)

821
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:11,534
Hey, Jung Tam.

822
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,943
- Thank you. Oh, you came. - Congratulations.

823
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:20,990
Hey.

824
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:22,314
Oh, my.

825
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,860
It's great to see you.

826
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:25,983
- Goodness. - Congratulations.

827
00:55:25,984 --> 00:55:27,954
- Why do you look so cool? - Gosh, no.

828
00:55:28,214 --> 00:55:30,300
- Congratulations. - Hey, little one.

829
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,925
You're so cute.

830
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:34,425
Oh, you're here.

831
00:55:34,725 --> 00:55:36,894
- Congratulations on your wedding. - Oh, thank you.

832
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,994
Congratulations.

833
00:55:40,864 --> 00:55:42,463
- Oh, my. - Hey.

834
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,064
You're here.

835
00:55:44,065 --> 00:55:45,303
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

836
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:46,704
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

837
00:55:47,205 --> 00:55:48,650
Yes, thank you.

838
00:55:48,674 --> 00:55:50,443
Hey, what is all this?

839
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:51,644
Oh, hey.

840
00:55:51,645 --> 00:55:53,274
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

841
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:55,215
Yes, thank you.

842
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:15,240
My goodness.

843
00:56:15,264 --> 00:56:19,034
The wedding just had to be on the same day as your business trip.

844
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:21,334
The reception seems like it'll go on for a while.

845
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:22,775
Why don't you just leave tomorrow?

846
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,974
When I looked at the elders' test results,

847
00:56:24,975 --> 00:56:27,575
there was someone with a predictor for Parkinson's.

848
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:30,713
I thought explaining it in person would be better than a letter.

849
00:56:30,714 --> 00:56:31,744
I'll make it quick.

850
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:33,084
Yes, you should.

851
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:37,684
By the way,

852
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:41,124
everyone from Sim Hospital must be coming today.

853
00:56:41,125 --> 00:56:42,454
I'm not sure.

854
00:56:43,054 --> 00:56:45,300
I'm guessing they will.

855
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:48,034
Gosh, won't Vice Director Sim come today?

856
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:50,740
Why do you keep liking him? You know it's no use.

857
00:56:50,764 --> 00:56:52,104
Hello.

858
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:56,181
I'm the MC for today's wedding. I'm Seo Kang Hoon.

859
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,604
Before we begin today's ceremony,

860
00:56:58,605 --> 00:57:00,274
Yeo Jung Tam, the groom,

861
00:57:00,275 --> 00:57:03,113
says he has something he must say to the guests.

862
00:57:03,114 --> 00:57:06,014
So, I will deliver his message instead.

863
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,494
"Today,"

864
00:57:17,995 --> 00:57:20,340
"I am going to marry..."

865
00:57:20,364 --> 00:57:22,235
"my DNA lover who I met through destiny."

866
00:57:22,364 --> 00:57:25,865
"Someone told me once..."

867
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:27,874
"that providence is in coincidence..."

868
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,805
"and that there's a gene that acts on providence."

869
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:35,251
Ms. Han, is telepathy really possible?

870
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:36,715
Well...

871
00:57:37,614 --> 00:57:41,630
I think there's providence in some coincidences.

872
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:44,055
And there could be a gene...

873
00:57:44,225 --> 00:57:47,155
that acts on that providence. I'm doing research on that.

874
00:57:47,594 --> 00:57:49,093
Like when you go somewhere without much thought,

875
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:50,201
but you run into someone?

876
00:57:50,225 --> 00:57:52,365
That's simply a coincidence.

877
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:53,971
"I want to meet someone."

878
00:57:53,995 --> 00:57:56,064
"I really want to meet someone."

879
00:57:56,464 --> 00:57:58,204
You send a signal.

880
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,204
"Like Sung Mi and me,"

881
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:03,010
"DNA lovers who have help from upon high..."

882
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:05,974
"are destined to meet someday."

883
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:17,153
"Today, before all of you,"

884
00:58:17,154 --> 00:58:20,555
"I will see that connection bear fruit."

885
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:44,584
Acting like I don't care

886
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:49,385
I've been hiding it well

887
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:51,155
Oh, yes

888
00:58:51,824 --> 00:58:55,931
Because of you, I can't even sleep

889
00:58:55,955 --> 00:59:00,294
Because of you, my heart flutters all night

890
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:04,104
Now, I want to say it

891
00:59:04,105 --> 00:59:06,974
Honestly

892
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:10,244
I'll only let you walk on a flowery path

893
00:59:11,275 --> 00:59:14,275
I'll act just how you want me to

894
00:59:15,674 --> 00:59:18,244
From the moment I first got to know you

895
00:59:18,245 --> 00:59:20,354
Inside my mind

896
00:59:39,705 --> 00:59:41,235
Grandma.

897
00:59:41,505 --> 00:59:43,504
- Grandma. - You're here, Foreman.

898
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:45,175
Yes, hello.

899
00:59:45,245 --> 00:59:46,573
- Hello. - Oh, hello.

900
00:59:46,574 --> 00:59:48,244
- Have you been well? - Yes.

901
00:59:48,245 --> 00:59:49,845
That's enough.

902
00:59:53,484 --> 00:59:55,983
- Ms. Baek Se Mi. - Yes, thank you.

903
00:59:55,984 --> 00:59:58,954
Read it through, and call me if you have any questions.

904
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:00,325
Okay.

905
01:00:01,424 --> 01:00:02,954
Now,

906
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,894
shall we go to Mr. Kim Sang Eun's place?

907
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:06,394
Oh, that old man?

908
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:08,894
He went to the handsome fellow.

909
01:00:11,364 --> 01:00:13,133
"The handsome fellow?"

910
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:17,144
Mr. Kim must have gone to the hospital.

911
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:18,905
I see.

912
01:00:21,344 --> 01:00:24,820
Then, could you tell me the name of the hospital?

913
01:00:24,844 --> 01:00:28,914
I have to deliver this to Mr. Kim today.

914
01:00:45,044 --> 01:00:47,420
- Hello, sir. - Yes.

915
01:00:47,444 --> 01:00:49,315
- You remember me, don't you? - Of course.

916
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,302
You know, last time,

917
01:00:51,532 --> 01:00:53,577
I came to run a DNA test for you.

918
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,571
I have your results.

919
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:58,540
But when I looked at the results,

920
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:00,270
you have a risk of...

921
01:01:00,271 --> 01:01:02,512
I know my own illness.

922
01:01:02,842 --> 01:01:04,782
I'll deal with it myself, so leave.

923
01:01:07,882 --> 01:01:10,220
You know that you can't just leave it untreated.

924
01:01:10,221 --> 01:01:12,228
It can't be fixed.

925
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,251
No, we'll be able to fix it someday soon.

926
01:01:15,252 --> 01:01:17,191
That's why we're working hard to do research and...

927
01:01:17,192 --> 01:01:18,562
And if you fix it?

928
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,992
- What? - What will I do if you fix it?

929
01:01:21,532 --> 01:01:23,291
If you fix my illness, and I live longer,

930
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:25,602
it'll only put off the day I get to meet her.

931
01:01:30,902 --> 01:01:32,771
"The day I get to meet her?"

932
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:38,381
Sir.

933
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:42,628
If I've waited this long, it's about time I meet her now.

934
01:01:42,652 --> 01:01:44,122
You can go now.

935
01:01:50,192 --> 01:01:51,521
Ms. Han So Jin.

936
01:02:13,311 --> 01:02:15,588
Did you come back from the US?

937
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:16,728
Yes.

938
01:02:16,752 --> 01:02:19,352
When? When did you get back?

939
01:02:20,291 --> 01:02:21,791
It hasn't been that long.

940
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:46,211
Did you quit working as a gynaecologist?

941
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:48,552
I'm still working as a doctor.

942
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:52,421
I thought I was a total city boy,

943
01:02:52,422 --> 01:02:55,091
but living here is fun.

944
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:59,321
The villagers come to me every day and ask me to eat with them.

945
01:02:59,362 --> 01:03:00,662
So, I don't eat alone.

946
01:03:13,612 --> 01:03:17,441
There's a problem with your hand, isn't there?

947
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:22,981
Is it because of your hand that you can't be...

948
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,082
a gynaecologist or perform surgery anymore?

949
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:29,392
Come on. It's all better.

950
01:03:29,991 --> 01:03:33,461
Well, it's not fully what it used to be,

951
01:03:33,462 --> 01:03:36,032
but I'm getting used to...

952
01:03:36,161 --> 01:03:37,802
my new senses.

953
01:03:38,002 --> 01:03:39,501
And I had surgery recently too.

954
01:03:43,672 --> 01:03:45,202
It was because of me.

955
01:03:46,502 --> 01:03:48,742
You should fix that.

956
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,981
You think everything is your fault.

957
01:03:52,982 --> 01:03:54,557
Have you already forgotten...

958
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,852
that you were in danger because of me?

959
01:03:59,922 --> 01:04:01,291
Besides that,

960
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,021
congratulate me.

961
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:06,291
Congratulate you on what?

962
01:04:07,362 --> 01:04:11,102
Now, I really want to become a doctor.

963
01:04:12,032 --> 01:04:15,671
Then, do you mean you haven't been a doctor so far?

964
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:18,478
I always thought about quitting.

965
01:04:18,502 --> 01:04:22,111
For the first time in my life, I have passion...

966
01:04:22,871 --> 01:04:24,711
for what I'm doing.

967
01:04:28,652 --> 01:04:31,321
Don't worry too much about Mr. Kim Sang Eun.

968
01:04:31,322 --> 01:04:34,191
I'll do my best to convince him.

969
01:04:40,331 --> 01:04:42,062
When do you go back to Seoul?

970
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:44,501
Well...

971
01:04:44,862 --> 01:04:47,330
So, Ms. Baek Se Mi said...

972
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:50,347
she had a question about her test result.

973
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,600
I'm going to meet with her son...

974
01:04:51,601 --> 01:04:53,541
and spend the night at their bed and breakfast before I go back.

975
01:04:55,072 --> 01:04:56,372
Well, then.

976
01:04:57,982 --> 01:05:01,111
If you're to go back up to Seoul early tomorrow,

977
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:03,182
you should go and get some rest.

978
01:05:04,382 --> 01:05:06,890
Yes, then...

979
01:05:06,891 --> 01:05:08,222
Right.

980
01:05:16,362 --> 01:05:18,901
I went to the airport that day.

981
01:05:23,072 --> 01:05:25,602
I just wanted to tell you.

982
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:31,682
I'll be going, then.

983
01:06:01,572 --> 01:06:03,812
It's been over a year already.

984
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:07,182
Yeon Woo is...

985
01:06:08,252 --> 01:06:11,122
so quick to sort out his emotions.

("Backseat Dating Advice")

991
01:06:36,615 --> 01:06:39,485
Today is the first anniversary of "Backseat Dating Advice."

992
01:06:39,486 --> 01:06:42,955
So, we're doing a live broadcast in an open studio.

993
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:44,332
Goodness.

994
01:06:44,356 --> 01:06:47,630
Thankfully, so many people have come to see the show.

("Backseat Dating Advice")

996
01:06:53,796 --> 01:06:55,136
What is it?

997
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:58,105
Is someone here your type, Ms. Jang?

998
01:07:01,936 --> 01:07:05,045
We've prepared various segments.

999
01:07:05,046 --> 01:07:07,915
First, let's take some questions.

1000
01:07:09,216 --> 01:07:10,744
The man in the back.

1001
01:07:10,745 --> 01:07:13,286
I'll ask you a question, Ms. Jang.

1002
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:16,392
You're in your 30s now.

1003
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:18,355
Would you still be polyamorous...

1004
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,625
in your 60s too?

1005
01:07:24,825 --> 01:07:26,324
There's something...

1006
01:07:26,325 --> 01:07:29,266
I want to confess to you all today.

1007
01:07:30,066 --> 01:07:31,806
I am no longer...

1008
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:34,236
polyamorous.

1009
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:39,921
But that doesn't mean I'm monogamous either.

1010
01:07:39,945 --> 01:07:42,444
I'm in the process of finding a third option,

1011
01:07:42,445 --> 01:07:44,145
or my own dating style.

1012
01:07:45,515 --> 01:07:46,986
What's important is...

1013
01:07:48,586 --> 01:07:51,686
that I've realized it's impossible for someone who can't love...

1014
01:07:51,825 --> 01:07:53,926
even a single person properly...

1015
01:07:54,155 --> 01:07:56,955
to love multiple people.

1016
01:07:57,525 --> 01:07:58,926
I believe...

1017
01:07:59,065 --> 01:08:02,195
this is also part of my painful growth.

1018
01:08:02,596 --> 01:08:06,234
Yes, please give Ms. Jang's courageous confession...

1019
01:08:06,235 --> 01:08:09,136
another round of applause.

1020
01:08:18,615 --> 01:08:19,985
Hello.

1021
01:08:20,785 --> 01:08:22,585
Yes, hello.

1022
01:08:22,615 --> 01:08:24,524
Is Dr. Sim Yeon Woo here?

1023
01:08:24,525 --> 01:08:26,532
Oh, Dr. Sim?

1024
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,455
He has the day off today.

1025
01:08:28,695 --> 01:08:30,926
Oh, it's his day off?

1026
01:08:31,126 --> 01:08:34,335
He goes somewhere once a month.

1027
01:08:34,865 --> 01:08:36,995
He only smiles when I ask him about it.

1028
01:08:37,405 --> 01:08:38,705
I see.

1029
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:42,276
Then, will I be able to meet him if I wait here?

1030
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,982
He won't be back today.

1031
01:08:45,006 --> 01:08:47,192
He spends a night there.

1032
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:49,516
Oh, is that so?

1033
01:08:51,046 --> 01:08:53,545
All right. Goodbye.

1034
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:56,115
Yes, goodbye.

1035
01:09:05,096 --> 01:09:06,695
Excuse me.

1036
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:10,295
What is this hospital's address?

1037
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:19,850
(Slow Post Box)

1038
01:09:27,456 --> 01:09:30,161
Nothing is intended to happen between us,

1039
01:09:30,185 --> 01:09:31,585
but should we...

1040
01:09:40,695 --> 01:09:42,436
start again?

1041
01:09:58,815 --> 01:10:03,085
The sea looks warmer than usual, So Jin.

1042
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:06,951
(Slow Post Box)

1043
01:10:08,617 --> 01:10:10,186
For some reason,

1044
01:10:10,556 --> 01:10:12,057
I want to send this postcard.

1045
01:10:12,896 --> 01:10:14,497
It will be stamped "Address Unknown," though.

1046
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:50,965
What... So Jin, how did you come...

1047
01:10:50,966 --> 01:10:52,337
Well,

1048
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:55,366
I came to send a postcard.

1049
01:10:56,237 --> 01:10:57,637
To whom?

1050
01:11:00,947 --> 01:11:04,007
To you, a year from now.

1051
01:11:07,646 --> 01:11:09,287
What will you write?

1052
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:13,986
I wrote that...

1053
01:11:14,627 --> 01:11:17,226
I let my DNA lover go because of you.

1054
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:21,526
I don't mean you should take responsibility.

1055
01:11:21,726 --> 01:11:23,942
My choice is my responsibility.

1056
01:11:23,966 --> 01:11:25,436
It's just that...

1057
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:29,606
no matter what happens from now on...

1058
01:11:30,936 --> 01:11:34,076
And we don't know how we might change,

1059
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:37,476
but I want to...

1060
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:41,146
start this risky relationship again.

1061
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:45,557
It's not my DNA lover...

1062
01:11:46,617 --> 01:11:49,156
but you whom I love.

1063
01:11:53,457 --> 01:11:55,726
I love you too, So Jin.

1064
01:12:21,886 --> 01:12:25,057
Do you want to walk to the lighthouse?

1065
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:26,457
Shall we?

1066
01:12:26,526 --> 01:12:29,143
I'll just go and mail this postcard.

1067
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,526
All right.

1068
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:39,037
This man might not be my DNA lover.

1069
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:42,207
No, he probably isn't.

1070
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,717
My research isn't wrong.

1071
01:13:08,037 --> 01:13:10,606
So, we might find ourselves in pain,

1072
01:13:10,737 --> 01:13:14,076
hurt, and uncomfortable.

1073
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:18,177
But we decided to start again.

1074
01:13:19,077 --> 01:13:21,316
Instead of DNA or destiny,

1075
01:13:21,747 --> 01:13:24,217
I'm going to try believing in love.

1076
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:28,526
So, today,

1077
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:31,326
I will scrap my theory...

1078
01:13:31,697 --> 01:13:33,097
on DNA lovers.

1079
01:13:33,657 --> 01:13:38,641
