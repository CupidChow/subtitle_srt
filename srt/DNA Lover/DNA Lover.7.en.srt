00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,150
- With me?
- Yes.

183
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,950
I've seen you on Yoo Myeong Hee's social media.

184
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,980
Do you know Ms. Yoo? How?

185
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,630
I'm her daughter.

186
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm not her social daughter, but a biological one.

187
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,440
I've always wanted to meet you.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,000
I didn't know you were her daughter.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,650
What a funny coincidence this is.

190
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,300
I know.

191
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,400
Yeon Woo, they can join us, right?

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,230
Okay, then. Have a seat.

193
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,860
♫  ♫

194
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:25,020
♫  ♫

195
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,140
♫  ♫

196
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,580
Do you like the food, So Jin?

197
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,730
Yes, the chef is so talented, as Yeon Woo said. It's delicious.

198
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,420
I'm glad to hear that.

199
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,890
I used to come here often with Yeon Woo.

200
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,800
He's pickier with food than he seems.

201
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,670
I'm not at all.

202
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,360
Try this, too, So Jin.

203
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,980
Looks like you don't like it so much.

204
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,790
Pardon?

205
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,170
I like it.

206
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,430
Why are they so similar?

207
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,880
What are they, soulmates or something?

208
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,740
Do they like the pork sirloin that much?

209
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,150
It's just salty and fatty.

210
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,490
Are you two dating, by the way?

211
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,630
- Pardon?
- Well...

212
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,180
We're getting to know each other.

213
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,080
We interrupted you while you were getting to know each other.

214
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,320
You ordered this wine.

215
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,530
- Do you remember?
- You mean, Brussels?

216
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,060
So Jin, you should visit Belgium sometime.

217
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,710
I suppose you've been to Belgium together.

218
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,000
No, with the travel club.

219
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,160
You were him.

220
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,820
The club member with the same tastes and aesthetics

221
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,350
as if they're twins.

222
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,170
You agree on everything because you share similar values.

223
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:05,760
You broke up, but you still have romantic feelings for each other.

224
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,070
I read it in your book.

225
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,800
You broke up twice in three years,

226
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,420
but you got back together three times.

227
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,110
- Cha Yoo Ram.
- Let him be. He must like you a lot.

228
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,190
Stop pretending to be courteous.

229
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,630
Noona, I can't continue this abnormal relationship.

230
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,610
I'll leave now.

231
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,130
This isn't why we joined you.

232
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,260
I apologize for this, So Jin.

233
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm sorry, Yeon Woo.

234
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,860
I'll get going now.

235
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,660
Let's eat.

236
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,920
Try this, too, So Jin. It's tasty.

237
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:08,690
He forces his taste on her?

238
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,890
Yeon Woo does that?

239
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,190
He has the promiscuous Octo-gene.

240
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,600
How did he date Jang Mi Eun for three years?

241
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,390
Can't you read the air?

242
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,180
You're talking to yourself again.

243
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,400
Why don't you just go inside?

244
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,970
­

245
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,820
Hello.

246
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,380
Come on.

247
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,610
You don't drink this beer. Why are you copying me?

248
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,860
I got into it because of you.

249
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,480
Hey! Ham with tuna and mayo is my favorite one.

250
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,870
I grew up on ham with tuna and mayo, okay?

251
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,980
You'd better give up.

252
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,190
So Jin, you should visit Belgium sometime.

253
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,940
Seriously, it's bothering me so much.

254
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,260
What is?

255
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,540
You know, Yeon Woo...

256
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,410
has an ex-girlfriend who's really similar to him.

257
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,750
Jang Mi Eun?

258
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,610
Yes. Huh?

259
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,620
What? How do you know Mi Eun?

260
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,510
I got to know her somehow.

261
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:02,260
What kind of relationship do you think they have?

262
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,720
Well, I'm not sure.

263
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm not interested in other people's relationships.

264
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,690
Huh?

265
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,050
Why are you so interested in my relationships, then?

266
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,700
You aren't just anyone, okay?

267
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,390
So, what's wrong?

268
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,230
Why are you bothered by Mi Eun?

269
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,990
I thought she was just an ex-girlfriend.

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,070
We had a meal together today by chance.

271
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,560
With Yeon Woo, Mi Eun, and Mi Eun's boyf-

272
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,230
No.

273
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,940
Should I say her ex-boyfriend?

274
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:41,830
What a strange group. Were you able to eat at all?

275
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,190
Well, you could say they're just friends.

276
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,530
Maybe I don't have to worry.

277
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,690
Gosh, why are you acting so unusually cool?

278
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,240
Once you break up with someone, you burn everything related to him.

279
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,950
It's because I had bad breakups.

280
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,570
Whether it was a good or bad breakup,

281
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,930
men and women shouldn't see each other again once they break up.

282
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,590
It's not hard to get back together with your ex.

283
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,100
There are people like you...

284
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,360
and there are people like Yeon Woo, too, I guess.

285
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,330
I think those two could never break up.

286
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,250
Why are you so sure about it?

287
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,950
Can't you tell how similar they are?

288
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,170
They're the same breed. Yeon Woo and Jang Mi Eun.

289
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,080
They notice and feel the same things.

290
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,330
Encountering my fate and...

291
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:01,060
taking charge of fate are different things.

292
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,550
You mean, Yeon Woo is your man of fate?

293
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,080
After many tests, the result says he's my DNA lover.

294
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,770
- Let's go now.
- You go ahead.

295
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,530
I'll go home with Ah Ri when she's back from the mass.

296
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:45,840
♫ Strengthen for service, Lord ♫

297
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,830
♫ The hands that holy things have taken ♫

298
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:03,370
♫ Let ears that now have heard thy songs ♫

299
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:16,800
♫ To clamour never waken ♫

300
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,170
Should we call it a night, brothers and sisters?

301
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,680
Father, I heard Anna brought us dinner tonight.

302
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,400
It's tasty.

303
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,820
You're such an amazing cook.

304
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,770
It's so tasty. What kind of veggie is this?

305
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,340
It's so tasty. I love the kimbap, too.

306
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,820
Thank you.

307
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,880
So tasty.

308
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,980
Thank you for the meal, Anna.

309
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,040
I love anything with water celery in it.

310
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,400
R-Really? Me, too.

311
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,390
You and I have similar tastes in food.

312
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,070
Sorry?

313
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,360
Well, on your tooth...

314
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,520
[Feel free to take it. I'll label it as trash if no one takes it after a week.]

315
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,710
I waited for you at the park. When did you get home?

316
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,860
You usually come home through the park.

317
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,760
I took a different route tonight.

318
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,570
You could kill someone with this tteokbokki.

319
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,090
I have an appetite even when I want to die.

320
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,230
It gives me a reason to live.

321
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,490
Who puts water celery in tteokbokki?

322
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:13,620
Water celery is good with anything.

323
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,190
Father Andrea likes anything with water celery, just like I do.

324
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,210
They say the appetite makes a person.

325
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:28,820
For the first time, I thought maybe he had something in common with me.

326
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,040
You must be happy because you're similar to him.

327
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,940
Pardon?

328
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,180
["Are We a Match?" by Jang Mi Eun]

329
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,930
[Can I get back together with my ex-boyfriend?]

330
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,990
[The club member with the same tastes and aesthetics as if we're twins]

331
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,590
[Let me tell you how my ex, K and I could sustain our relationship...]

332
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,890
If the K in this book is Yeon Woo...

333
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,410
they spent three years together and...

334
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,240
they broke up twice during that time.

335
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,550
They date, break up, date again, and break up again.

336
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,850
Why did they break up?

337
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,820
I mean, why couldn't they break up? Why?

338
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,280
The hundreds of allogeneic bacteria in their guts

339
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,030
might be pulling each other like magnets.

340
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,410
They might have a similar diet.

341
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,000
You're right, Ah Ri. They like the same food.

342
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,930
It's a so-called matching allogeneic bacteria.

343
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,170
Matching?

344
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,460
It's my current research subject.

345
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,480
If you have similar tastes in food, you both develop allogeneic bacteria.

346
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,310
The allogeneic bacteria change the potency of sex pheromones

347
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:55,750
and the two can become sexually attracted to each other.

348
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,990
I know that theory. In the fruit fly mating test,

349
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:08,340
the male fruit fly was attracted to the female with similar bacteria.

350
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,690
Maybe it's not the humans who fall in love.

351
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:14,560
Maybe it's the allogeneic bacteria in our guts.

352
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,240
If you match, you're attracted to each other.

353
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,620
I suppose. If the microbes that connect the gut and brain are allogeneic,

354
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,470
it'd make you feel positive toward the other.

355
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,550
Three years.

356
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:34,460
They were attracted to each other because they ate similar food.

357
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,770
That's why they got back together after breaking up.

358
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,260
Then, they don't just have the same taste in food.

359
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,040
Did their moods, personalities, tastes, and thoughts become similar, too?

360
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,170
That much?

361
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,190
It's not fair.

362
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,440
They must've eaten the same food at least five meals a week for three years.

363
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,490
They could've been similar since they were babies.

364
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,500
This is no good.

365
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,260
I'll make him eat the same food from now on.

366
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,990
Three meals a day. No, even just one meal a day.

367
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,160
Would that be possible?

368
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,890
Where there is a will, there is a way.

369
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:20,030
Nothing is impossible to me, Han So Jin.

370
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:25,640
I'll make sure we have more allogeneic bacteria!

371
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,470
Ms. Nam!

372
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,040
- Whoa, s-sorry...
- D-Dr. Yeo.

373
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,660
I can't believe we ran into each other again.

374
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,250
- It's true, but-
- I heard running at dawn is good for you.

375
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,820
I thought I should give it a try, too.

376
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,530
It's six in the morning right now.

377
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:05,350
It's a coincidence we met on this path at this hour?

378
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,570
To be honest, Coach told me about your workout schedule.

379
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:16,240
I-I swear I'm not a stalker! Well...

380
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,830
I wanted to do the same thing as you...

381
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,240
every day?

382
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,440
I'll get going now!

383
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,820
Dr. Yeo.

384
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,480
You'll get sick if you overdo it on the first day.

385
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,550
It's not that. I'm late because I had to install the bicycle app.

386
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,020
Wait here for a moment.

387
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,180
I just sprinted for one kilometer here.

388
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,400
I'll be back in a moment.

389
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,950
Let's go back on the way back.

390
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,430
"Let's."

391
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,010
Nam Seong Mi, fighting!

392
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,580
[Nam Seong Mi will win the National Martial Arts Competition!]

393
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,760
You always chug Coke whenever you have a worry.

394
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,740
What are you worried about?

395
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,640
The thing is...

396
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,900
I don't think it was an accident.

397
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,270
You mean, the apartment fire case?

398
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,620
The cause was unknown.

399
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,240
It wasn't a gas explosion or short circuit.

400
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,380
It's weird the leaves didn't burn, too.

401
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,930
You think the police are fools?

402
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:12,490
They called it an accident for a reason.

403
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,960
Right,

404
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,100
there's a man I run into every day these days.

405
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,110
But it's strange.

406
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:27,700
When I saw him today, this part...

407
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,630
I mean, this part felt all itchy.

408
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,730
And all I'm doing is thinking about him, and my mouth is dry.

409
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,450
And my eyes feel warm for some reason.

410
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,950
Who's that man, anyway?

411
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,810
You won't know. He's...

412
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,000
very different from me.

413
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,800
I see.

414
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,760
What are you looking at?

415
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:25,000
­

416
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,980
I heard she had a lot of family to support,

417
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,920
But the chief mourner is her hostess friend.

418
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,870
How did you know about this?

419
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,980
Of course, I should know.

420
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,660
This concerns my husband.

421
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,550
­

422
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,790
Ga Hee and I went to the church only once.

423
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,530
Thank you for coming.

424
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,970
By the way, can she go to heaven?

425
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,920
Death ends the sin and allows resurrection.

426
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,000
Tonight's dinner.

427
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,940
How does a ramen with the shiitake broth with miso sound?

428
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,820
I found a good restaurant for it.

429
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm telling you. Ms. Ha was Director Shim's mistress.

430
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,020
They apparently met at a hostess bar.

431
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,310
Didn't you see her last time?

432
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,360
She was wearing designer clothes from head to toe.

433
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,090
He got her a foreign car and an apartment in Gangnam.

434
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,580
I heard it was crazy.

435
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,760
But still, how could she burn to death?

436
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,800
She was punished by God.

437
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,070
And I heard she was pregnant with the Director's baby, too.

438
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,060
She seduced him to become the director's wife.

439
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,050
- What a bitch.
- Hey.

440
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,410
There are other patients here. Watch your mouth.

441
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,750
Okay.

442
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,870
You came.

443
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,560
Would you like some tea or something?

444
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,900
Let's talk for a moment.

445
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:25,710
Ga Hee and my child died.

446
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,450
Looks like you knew.

447
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,470
Did Mom tell you?

448
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,390
Your mom was at Ga Hee's funeral.

449
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,720
But she looked too happy. It's strange.

450
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,850
So?

451
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,770
I met with her psychiatrist, Dr. Kim.

452
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,310
She apparently went off her meds recently.

453
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,450
Ga Hee wasn't supposed to die like that. It's impossible.

454
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,170
I thought it was an accident.

455
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:18,820
Believing I'd never leave the mother of my child,

456
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,120
your mom has been waiting for me all this time.

457
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,320
If she finds out Ga Hee had my child,

458
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,410
she would've done anything.

459
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,130
Not only you caused her pain her whole life,

460
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,040
you're blaming her for murder now?

461
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,320
Your younger sibling died. Do you not care at all?

462
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,610
Even if it wasn't for that,

463
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,190
your patient and her fetus died!

464
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,000
Do you really deserve to be an obstetrician?

465
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,000
It's so funny...

466
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,550
to be told that...

467
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:07,270
by you, Director.

468
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:11,690
- What?
- Do you really deserve to be the director

469
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,930
and someone's husband?

470
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,480
Think carefully about that...

471
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,940
and tell me if I deserve to be something.

472
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,980
It's really disgusting and uncomfortable to hear.

473
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
Did you find out anything?

474
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,700
The Madam was treated at the Irowoon DNA Center and went home just now.

475
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,860
Keep watching her.

476
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,010
- Yes.
- Ms. Joo Min Ah has a risk of placenta accreta.

477
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,440
Her uterus might have to be removed if it bursts.

478
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,270
I'd like you to be there during the delivery.

479
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,860
Okay, I'll be right there.

480
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,850
So Jin, an emergency surgery was just scheduled.

481

You don't like oysters, So Jin.

491
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,140
I know. Why does it look so good?

492
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,230
I ordered stuff because of this show countless times.

493
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,390
I make impulsive purchases seeing them eating like that.

494
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,750
Yes.

495
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,230
That is what I should do.

496
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,200

Ahjussi, just once, please.

- Please help me just once.
- It's not even sushi.

501
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,530
Why would you do that at my restaurant?

502
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,050
Because the hardwood fixtures and lighting at the bar are so elegant,

503
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,840
my appetite piques whenever I come here.

504

And the "Always with you" sign.

505
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,330
It's so memorable.

No, this is mine.

Just once. Just once.

516
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,210
You can use the new one, then.

517
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,460
You should use the new one.

[Jjajang-ghetti pepper popcorn]

714
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,890
So Jin, do you want to come to my place tomorrow?

715
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:09,440
Let me invite you officially.

716
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,350
Let's have dinner together.

717
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,180
At home?

718
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,730
His place...

719
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:21,420
Let's eat the same meal at the same table instead of the mukbang. Okay?

720
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,790
So Jin.

721
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:37,080
She makes that face whenever she falls for a man.

722
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,810
She smiles with one eye slightly closed.

723
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,430
Just like when she eats a sour tangerine.

724
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,170
Tomatoes, celery, lettuce, bell peppers,

725
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,040
abalone, gochujang, a baguette, milk,

726
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,930
ricotta, feta, whipping cream, and creme fraiche.

727
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:58,870
I'll combine all these random ingredients and create a perfect dish.

728
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:02,880
Sympho... simple... symphony.

729
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,800
Han So Jin has an appetite of a child.

730
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,130
She likes sweets and cheese.

731
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:12,070
She loves cream because she loves the rose sauce.

732
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,730
To feed her the ginseng of the sea, I'll combine it with

733
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:37,890
instant ramen and plenty of butter.

[Jang Mi Eun]

736
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,990
Yeon Woo,

737
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,480
I wanted to celebrate my birthday quietly with you,

738
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,000
not with the club members.

739
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,650
Ta-da. I got us wine, too.

740
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,820
Well, I'm sorry.

741
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,060
I'm having dinner with So Jin at home tonight.

742
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,280
I'll just have tea and leave, then.

743
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,400
I'm sorry. I'm cooking right now.

744
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,890
I want to just focus on that.

745
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:41,510
Let's celebrate your birthday with the club members next time. That's okay, right?

746
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,410
Okay, then.

747
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:48,020
Here, d-drink this.

748
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:49,600
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

749
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,030
Get home safely. I'm sorry.

750
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,850
Where are you, Noona? Would you like cold noodles today?

751
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,010
Jeong Tam, Seon Mi, and I are eating it together.

752
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,650
Hey, hey! Seo Kang Hoon!

753
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,360
No thanks. Eat plenty, including my share.

754
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:09,820
- I'll eat something tastier at Yeon Woo's tonight.
- Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

755
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,870
Kang Hoon.

756
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,100
Yes. Hey...

757
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,430
What did she say? Is Team Leader Han coming?

758
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,100
She said she couldn't come because she already had a plan.

759
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,390
Really? Let's go on our own, then.

760
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:26,150
Isn't she making an excuse because she doesn't want to come?

761
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:27,740
The thing is...

762
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,230
She's eating alone with Yeon Woo at his place.

763
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,400
At Yeon Woo's place?

764
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:39,760
I'm not sure. Will they really be just eating at home?

765
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,550
He does invite women over often.

766
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,880
He has a lot of disposable toiletries in his bathroom, like a hotel.

767
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,980
What a pervert.

768
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:51,940
Y-You can eat without me today. I can't join you.

769
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:57,290
Hey, come with us! I'd feel too awkward.

770
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,640
S-S-Shall we?

771
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,810
Okay.

772
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,390
Do you remember this and the puzzle, too?

773
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,780
It was so hard to put that back together.

774
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,290
Please try to forget that.

775
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:23,380
I can't. I'll remind myself whenever I feel depressed.

776
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,710
Put your coat on that hanger.

777
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,190
Okay.

778

What do you think? Are you happy with the menu?

783
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,420
Yes, I love it!

784
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:56,230
By the way, why did you suddenly suggest eating at home today?

785
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,000
Do I need a reason for it?

786
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,510
I wanted to eat tasty food together,

787
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:05,580
go to nice places, enjoy nice things,

788
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,190
and create a bond with you, So Jin.

789
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,740
A bond?

790
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,780
All of a sudden?

791
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,140
It's not all of a sudden.

792
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,950
It's kind of strange.

793
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,990
Let's eat before the food I worked hard on gets cold.

794
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,520
Okay.

795
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,700
Try the cream pasta.

796
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,360
Yes.

797
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,460
And this cheese tteokbokki, too.

798
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:39,860
I'm so full.

799
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:41,780
How was it?

800
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,260
It was so delicious.

801
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,350
Yeon Woo, I've never been so happy because of food-

802
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:54,780
What's wrong? Is something bothering you?

803
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,260
To be honest, I'm a bit lactose intolerant.

804
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:04,170
So, sometimes, this happens when I eat a lot of dairy.

805
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:07,010
But I'll feel okay in a bit. It's okay.

806
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,340
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Of course.

807
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:11,350
Should I make you a cup of coffee?

808
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,830
Yes.

809
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:20,640
Come on.

810
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,340
What's the deal?

811
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,900
The coffee smells nice.

812
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,680
Yes, I can smell it from here.

813
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,640
It smells nice.

814
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,160
The coffee smells amazing.

815
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,950
- Thank you.
- By the way, do you feel warm in here?

816
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:48,970
I turned up the temperature so you don't feel cold.

817
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:51,340
Did you? Thank you.

818
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:55,160
And I made the coffee stronger in case the food was rich.

819
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,050
That's okay, right?

820
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,500
Strong coffee?

821
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,170
I love strong coffee.

822
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:07,380
If I drink this, I won't be able to stop it.

823
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:09,150
Nice.

824
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,290
Should we go see a movie now, then?

825
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:15,060
Shall we?

826
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:20,830
I can hold it. I can.

827
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,890
Let's hang in there. A little longer.

828
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:25,700
I can do it.

829
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:29,540
Han So Jin. Han So Jin.

830
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:35,530
No, I don't think I can.

831
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:38,120
What if I make a big mistake again?

832
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:41,550
I'll go to the sofa for now.

833
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:42,780
So Jin, are you okay?

834
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:46,700
Yes, did you start it already?

835
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,670
Don't act like you're in a hurry.

836
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:54,120
Be natural as if I'm looking around the house.

837
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:00,520
Stop it with the heel of my foot.

838
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,700
- Are you still warm?
- But...

839
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,720
how much longer can I endure like this?

840
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:17,550
What? Is my heart fluttering at this moment?

841
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,070
I'm okay.

842
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:27,040
T-This is...

843
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,080
A bastard like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

844
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,320
You were wearing the chopsticks in your hair when you barged in.

845
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,910
It was so memorable.

846
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:38,970
That's why I got you this.

847
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,740
Come here.

848
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:57,860
It's pretty.

849
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,000
No!

850
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,890
I don't think I can.

851
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,240
Pardon?

852
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,220
I think I should...

853
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:20,220
go home right now.

854
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,600
- What do you mean-
- Don't follow me! Please!

855
01:06:24,290 --> 01:06:26,010
Let me go...

01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,560

860
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,110
Your jacket...

861
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:02,430
Gosh, I'm dying.

862

Kang Hoon, please come pick me up.

863
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,340
I think I'm dying right now. It hurts so much.

864
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:27,030
Noona? What's wrong? Where are you right now?

865
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:33,700
I'm... I'm in the bathroom in Yeon Woo's building right now.

866
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,020
Noona! Han So Jin!

867

Noona!

869
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,790
Noona, pull yourself together. Where does it hurt?

870
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,310
My stomach hurts so much. Kang Hoon...

871
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,270
My gosh...

872
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:41,230
- Yes, what happened, So Jin-
- Hyung, I can't talk for long.

873
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:44,040
I'm going to the Shim Hospital ER with Noona. Meet us there.

874
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,500
- Hang in there.
- It hurts...
