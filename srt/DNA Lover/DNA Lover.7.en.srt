(in this drama are fictitious

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,189
Goodness, are those bubbles?

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,390
I guess so.

11
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,590
Where are they coming from?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,030
They must be from over there.

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,379
- Try holding it.
- Me?

14
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:13,780
How did you do that?

15
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:15,909
What? That's cool.

16
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,549
My dating history for
the 32 years of my life.

17
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,859
Eleven crushes and
nine confessions of love.

18
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,158
Seven awful breakups.

19
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,159
Hey, look at this.

20
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,629
Goodness.

21
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,030
And today.

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,200
I...

23
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,569
found my DNA lover.

24
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,539
What should we do? The tables
are full, and there's a long line.

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,650
They have delicious paella,
so I wanted to have it with you.

26
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,979
Is that so? That's too bad.
Let's come back some other time.

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,019
Okay.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,119
Then, should I show you
one of my favorite spots?

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,459
That place is really popular.

30
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,958
Gosh, this place really
is popular, as you said.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,469
Look at this line.

32
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:10,099
Bye.

33
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,609
- Yeon Woo.
- Yes?

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,209
- Hurry up and grab a table.
- What?

35
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,879
Hurry. Grab a table!

36
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,909
Sorry.

38
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,990
Ta-da.

39
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,400
It may not be as good as
a fancy restaurant, but try it.

40
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,638
This is good.

41
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,340
Right? It's pretty good, right? I told you.

42
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,109
You must come here often.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,309
I could tell you've done this
more than a couple of times.

44
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,978
Oh, I come here every now and then.

45
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,479
You know, some days are like that.

46
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,349
"Is this life only hard for me?"

47
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,979
I come here whenever I feel that way.

48
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,560
But isn't this too humble
for a day like that?

49
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,789
This place is a popular
place in a different sense.

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,688
It's popular for people watching.

51
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,758
I see.

52
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,698
Last time, some kids were crowded around,

53
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:16,069
trying to feed snacks to a street cat.

54
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,740
That was so cute to watch.

55
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,639
As I watch people, I can smile,

56
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:26,039
and then, my worries and
concerns disappear too.

57
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,849
What do you think? Isn't this
a very cost-effective therapy?

58
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,650
You're right.

59
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,650
What about you?

60
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:40,119
When you feel tired or sad,

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,589
is there a place you go to
for a therapeutic moment?

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,060
- "For a therapeutic moment?"
- Yes.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,830
I think I should give it some thought.

64
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,740
Shouldn't you have some
breathing room, at least?

65
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,009
Let me know if you think of one later on.

66
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:02,009
I showed you a new popular place today,

67
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,948
and I told you a new way to
have a therapeutic moment.

68
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,448
I gave you too much for free.

69
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,889
Next time, you have to treat
me to something delicious.

70
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,560
Saffron. The gem of Persia.

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,369
One must dry 500 pistils...

72
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,670
for a single gram of this spice.

73
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,370
With a few strands, the
scent can fill the entire house.

74
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,979
And it has anti-inflammatory
and antibacterial qualities...

75
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,550
and lowers blood pressure as well.

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,349
This is perfect for soothing my stomach...

77
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,850
from the irritations of instant
foods from a convenience store.

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,050
So Jin seems to like junk food.

79
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,490
I haven't seen her eating
any healthy foods either.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,029
I must let her know...

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,100
how important food is.

82
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,680
The man with pheromones
of the heavenly garden.

83
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,509
The healing gene that will
save me from the dying gene.

84
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,878
Despite all the signal interferences,

85
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,920
he received my telepathy...

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,019
and appeared before me.

87
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,389
My DNA lover.

88
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,258
I will love him forever.

89
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:24,730
I should fall in love slowly.

90
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,299
Very slowly!

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,370
(Sim General Hospital's Sim Yeon Woo)

92
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,698
What were you doing?

93
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,069
Me? Oh, I...

94
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,379
It's a secret.

95
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,310
Should we meet again tomorrow?

96
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,948
We've only been apart for an
hour, and you want to meet again?

97
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:47,689
Slowly. I have to cherish
these meetings with him.

98
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,559
How about we meet on the weekend instead?

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,430
I have to see patients this Saturday.

100
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,799
Let's go and eat something
delicious after work tomorrow.

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,099
There's a very delicious Bulgarian
restaurant run by a local chef.

102
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,170
I'll make the reservation.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,470
Bulgarian? I've never tried that before.

104
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,269
If you send me the
address, I'll meet you there.

105
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,509
Goodnight, Yeon Woo.

106
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,220
I can't believe it!

107
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,620
Are you two dating?

108
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:26,559
Hey, how can we start dating right away?

109
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,958
We're just having a fling first.

110
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,930
What if you end up having a fling only?

111
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,359
Nowadays, people call it a fling...

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,870
even if they break
up after living together.

113
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,399
Really?

114
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,069
Then, should I just go ahead and
say that we're dating tomorrow?

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,069
That can't happen.

116
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,100
(Episode 7: Gut Racing, Not Heart Racing)

117
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,378
- Hello, Auntie.
- Would you like some sundae?

118
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,550
Yes, give me lots of liver and
intestines, not so much sundae.

119
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,620
Thank you.

120
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,818
- Hello.
- Hello.

121
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,859
Can I get some tteokbokki and sundae to go?

122
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,790
And please leave out
the liver and intestines.

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,060
Why won't you eat this when it's so good?

124
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,529
You must eat all your meals here.

125
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,438
Try it.

126
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,469
You won't be able to stop
eating this once you try it.

127
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't like liver.

128
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,750
I don't like people who
try to steal your guts too.

129
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,550
Was that a joke?

130
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,120
How funny.

131
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,089
Since you bought me
food last time, I'll pay today.

132
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,189
Here you go.

133
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,529
Then, if you don't like liver,
do you not like fois gras either?

134
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,458
I love it.

135
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,100
I read an article about
that. Isn't it animal cruelty?

136
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,539
If you eat fatty liver, it'll only
increase your cholesterol levels.

137
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,569
Try to quit eating it.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Thank you.

139
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,209
They raise geese naturally
these days. It's fine to eat them.

140
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,879
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

141
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,319
Hey, Mr. Seo!

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,820
You're missing out on a great
joy in life without fois gras!

143
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,460
Goodness, what a shame.

144
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,230
He's cute.

145
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,179
Excuse me.

146
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,809
I believe we've never met. Who are you?

147
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,579
Just ignore me.

148
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,579
Today is a special day for me.

149
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,219
I mean, I've never seen you
like this over the past five years.

150
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,419
Who is this guy?

151
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,759
My partner.

152
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,730
"Partner?"

153
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,029
I'll be going, then.

154
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,859
Wait, but...

155
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,870
Goodness.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,169
This feels ominous.

157
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,679
Hey.

158
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,820
Are you okay?

159
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,119
Yes, I'm fine.

160
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,789
- My goodness.
- I wasn't hurt.

161
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,519
You called?

162
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,558
Oh, I pressed it by accident.

163
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,729
Oh, I see.

164
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,758
Mikael, have you been well?

165
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,860
Well, it's always the same for me.

166
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,899
By the way, I've never
met this lady before.

167
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,399
Oh, this is the Bulgarian chef.

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,969
His cooking is totally Korean-style.

169
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,109
I see. I'll look forward to it today.

170
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,110
All right.

171
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:12,139
Thank you.

172
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
This place...

173
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,450
Their signature dish is...

174
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,558
It's been a while, Mikael.

175
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,929
The guy you always came
with. Yeon Woo. He's back there.

176
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:29,490
Oh, really?

177
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:36,829
He already took the window seat I like.

178
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,940
Should we go somewhere else?

179
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,370
I know another place
with a great window seat.

180
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,870
No.

181
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,240
Let's go to the table next to it.

182
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Okay.

183
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,820
- This is...
- Yeon Woo.

184
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,779
Hey.

185
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,190
When did you get here?

186
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,360
Just now.

187
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,059
Hello, So Jin.

188
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,028
Oh, this is...

189
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,230
Oh, it's nice to meet you. I'm Cha Yu Ram.

190
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,259
Oh, right.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,668
Nice to meet you. I'm Sim Yeon Woo.

192
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:10,269
This is Ms. Han So Jin.

193
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,969
It seems like you haven't ordered yet.

194
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,840
If it's all right, could
we share the table?

195
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,678
This is an important
dinner date. I'm sorry.

196
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:22,209
I think it would be better for
you two to enjoy your time.

197
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,480
Don't mind us.

198
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,620
- We'll eat over there.
- Yes, okay.

199
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,419
Hey, why don't we...

200
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,058
Yeon Woo, shall we just share the table?

201
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:34,159
I've been wanting to talk to Mi Eun too.

202
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,128
- With me?
- Yes.

203
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:39,959
I saw you on Yoo Myung
Hee's social media before.

204
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,799
You know Ms. Yoo Myung Hee? How?

205
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,970
Oh, I'm her daughter.

206
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,409
Not like a social relationship.
Her actual daughter.

207
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,940
I've always wanted to meet you someday.

208
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,620
So, you were her daughter.

209
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,889
What an interesting relationship we have.

210
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,720
I know.

211
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:05,090
Yeon Woo, we can sit together, right?

212
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,360
Yes, sure. Have a seat.

213
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,778
So Jin, does it taste all right?

214
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,350
Oh, yes.

215
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,749
As Yeon Woo said, the
chef must be very talented.

216
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,750
It's good.

217
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:37,860
I'm glad.

218
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,460
I used to come here often with Yeon Woo.

219
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,989
Yeon Woo has a pickier
appetite than you think.

220
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,500
I'm not a picky eater.

221
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,399
Try this too, So Jin.

222
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,769
It must not suit your taste, So Jin.

223
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,279
Pardon? Oh, no, it's fine.

224
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:04,850
I mean, why are they such a good match?

225
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:08,149
Are they best buddies or
soulmates or something?

226
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,259
Why would you eat pork sirloin like that?

227
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,559
It's only salty and greasy.

228
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,459
By the way, are you two lovers?

229
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,699
- Pardon? Well...
- Well...

230
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,429
We're getting to know each other.

231
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:25,869
Oh, Mi Eun and I
interfered on your time, then.

232
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,470
Hey, you ordered this wine.

233
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,579
- Do you remember?
- Brussels.

234
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,139
So Jin, you should definitely
go to Belgium later on.

235
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,778
Oh, you two must've
been to Belgium together.

236
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,149
Well, the traveling club.

237
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh, you were that guy.

238
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:56,200
The guy in the traveling club with
the same taste and preferences...

239
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,639
as if you were twins.

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,168
You have similar values,
so you agree on most things,

241
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,279
and you broke up, but you
still feel like you're dating.

242
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:07,038
I read it in your book.

243
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,309
You broke up twice over three years.

244
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,580
But you dated again
three times or something.

245
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,778
- Cha Yu Ram.
- Leave him alone.

246
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,148
He must like you a lot.

247
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,289
You should stop acting
like you have manners.

248
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,029
Mi Eun.

249
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,830
I don't think I can carry on
with this abnormal relationship.

250
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,730
I'll be going.

251
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,909
I didn't mean to do this
when we sat down together.

252
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,580
I'm sorry about this, So Jin.

253
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:40,409
Sorry, Yeon Woo.

254
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,279
I'll get going first.

255
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,120
Let's eat.

256
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,100
Try this too, So Jin. It's good.

257
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,809
He's forcing his preferences on someone?

258
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:10,909
Yeon Woo is doing that?

259
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,278
He has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

260
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,620
How did he date Jang
Mi Eun for three years?

261
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,429
And how can you not have
any sense in this situation?

262
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,970
You're talking to yourself again.

263
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,629
Why aren't you going inside?

264
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,009
- Hello.
- Hello.

265
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Look at this.

266
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,548
You didn't use to drink this
beer. Why are you copying me?

267
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,590
I got hooked on it
because of you. Goodness.

268
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,569
No!

269
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:14,409
Hey! Ham and tuna mayo is my favorite!

270
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,808
Ham and tuna mayo used to be my baby food.

271
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:17,910
You should let me have it.

272
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,549
So Jin,

273
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,250
you should definitely
go to Belgium later on.

274
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,858
That's oddly bothering me.

275
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:35,859
What is?

276
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,799
You know, Yeon Woo.

277
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,568
He has an ex-girlfriend
he really gets along with.

278
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:46,639
- Oh, Ms. Jang Mi Eun?
- Yes.

279
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,969
What? What's this? How do you know Mi Eun?

280
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh, I just do.

281
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,549
From what you can see,

282
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,519
what do you think is going
on between those two?

283
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,420
Well, I'm not sure.

284
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:08,258
I don't care about other
people's dating lives.

285
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,259
What?

286
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:12,930
So, why do you care so
much about my dating life?

287
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,900
You're different from them.

288
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,338
So, what? What's bothering
you about Jang Mi Eun?

289
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,809
You said she was his ex anyway.

290
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:26,609
Well, we happened to
have dinner together today.

291
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,079
Yeon Woo, Mi Eun,

292
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,549
and Mi Eun's boyfriend.

293
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,490
No.

294
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,919
Should I say he's her ex-boyfriend?

295
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,759
What kind of combination is
that? Could you even eat properly?

296
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900
Well...

297
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,769
They're just like friends
of the opposite gender.

298
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,839
I don't think I should be bothered by it.

299
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,509
Oh, my. That's so not like you.
Why are you being so nonchalant?

300
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,409
When you break up with a guy,

301
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,180
you get rid of everything
related to that guy by burning it.

302
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,819
That's because I broke
up with them in a bad way.

303
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,649
No matter how you break up,

304
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,318
people who have dated before...

305
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:11,989
have no reason to see
each other after breaking up.

306
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,659
Is it hard to go past a
certain line with someone...

307
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,690
when you've already crossed it once?

308
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,460
There are guys like you.

309
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,769
And there must be guys like Yeon Woo.

310
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,900
I think those two...

311
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,440
will never break up.

312
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,240
How can you be so sure?

313
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,939
Can't you tell they're so similar?

314
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,409
Those two are the same types of people.

315
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,179
Yeon Woo and Ms. Jang Mi Eun.

316
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,019
They see and feel the same things.

317
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,430
Meeting your destiny...

318
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,069
and having them as your
own are two different things.

319
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,380
Yeon Woo is your destiny?

320
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,250
After many experiments,

321
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:12,119
I concluded that he's my DNA lover.

322
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,690
Let's go now.

323
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:23,788
You can go ahead.

324
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,529
I'll go home with A Ri when
she's done with the mass.

325
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,679
- In these hands - In these hands

326
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,319
- That hold the body of Christ
- That hold the body of Christ

327
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,318
- Give me the power - Give me the power

328
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,660
- To be safe - To be safe

329
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,528
- In my ears - In my ears

330
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,568
- That have heard your word
- That have heard your word

331
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:08,268
- Let them block out - Let them block out

332
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:15,609
- The noise of the world
- The noise of the world

333
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,278
Brothers and sisters,
shall we finish up here?

334
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,890
Father, Sister Anna has
packed a boxed meal today.

335
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,490
That sounds delicious.

336
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,189
- I love it.
- How nice.

337
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,059
- I know.
- Right?

338
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,598
It's delicious.

339
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,868
I mean, how can you cook so well?

340
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,528
You really are.

341
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,868
I like this gimbap.

342
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,169
It's so delicious.

343
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,409
- This is good.
- It really is.

344
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,879
- Good work.
- It's delicious.

345
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,979
Sister Anna. Thank you for the food.

346
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,849
I like everything with minari in it.

347
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,518
Really? Me too.

348
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,220
We have similar tastes in food.

349
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,390
Why...

350
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,430
Oh, you have something...

351
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,900
I got it.

352
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,779
You're so funny.

353
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,440
(Whoever needs it can take it.
It'll be hauled away in a week.)

354
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,140
Hey, wait for me.

355
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,369
What?

356
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,308
I was waiting for you in the park.

357
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,539
When did you get back?

358
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,879
You usually walk through
the park on your way home.

359
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,980
I took a different route today.

360
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,129
Oh, my.

361
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,630
You could kill someone
with that tteokbokki.

362
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,098
Even when I want to
die, I still have an appetite.

363
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,440
That gives me a reason to live.

364
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,578
Why are you putting minari in tteokbokki?

365
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:12,549
Minari is good in anything.

366
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,258
Father Andrea also likes
anything with minari in it.

367
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,589
They say food preferences
affect personalities.

368
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,328
For the first time,

369
00:25:22,329 --> 00:25:26,159
I thought Father Andrea and I...

370
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,700
may have something in common.

371
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:34,039
It must be nice that you guys are similar.

372
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,539
What?

373
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,179
("Will We Be a Good
Fit?" Author Jang Mi Eun)

374
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:43,450
(Chapter 8, Can I see
my ex-boyfriend again?)

375
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,979
(A guy from a travel club with
the same preferences as me!)

376
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,719
(A guy I broke up with but
who I still have feelings for!)

377
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,490
(I want to tell you the reason
why my ex-boyfriend K and I...)

378
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,259
If this K in this book really is Yeon Woo,

379
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,930
it means they were
together for three years...

380
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,258
and that they broke up 2
times within those 3 years.

381
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,669
They dated, broke up,

382
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,400
dated again, and broke up again.

383
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,839
Why did they break up?

384
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,740
No. Why couldn't they break up? Why?

385
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,379
It could be that the 100
types of germs in their guts...

386
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,180
are drawing them to
each other like magnets.

387
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,380
They may have similar food preferences.

388
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,589
You're right, A Ri. They have
very similar food preferences.

389
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,160
It's called, "like-attracts-like germ."

390
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,200
"Like-attracts..."

391
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,569
It's something I've
been researching lately.

392
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:42,909
When two people have
similar food preferences,

393
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,608
they have "like-attracts-like
germs" in their guts.

394
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,508
Those germs change the
concentration of their sex pheromones...

395
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,509
and cause those two people...

396
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,348
to be attracted to each other...

397
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,750
as potential mates.

398
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,250
Wait.

399
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,189
I know that theory.

400
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,058
In the fruit fly mating experiment,

401
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,689
the male fruit fly was attracted...

402
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,930
to the female fruit fly
with similar germs to itself.

403
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,930
If so, is love done by
the germs in our guts,

404
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,299
instead of by people?

405
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:17,940
Because like always attracts like.

406
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,278
That makes sense.

407
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,078
If the microorganisms
connecting the gut and the brain...

408
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,808
are similar types of germs,

409
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,579
it's only natural to like each other more.

410
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,049
It was three years.

411
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,058
Yeon Woo and Mi Eun
were drawn to each other...

412
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,390
because they ate similar things.

413
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,089
That's why they got back
together even after breaking up.

414
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,328
If so, do they not only
have the same taste in food,

415
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:43,868
but they also share
moods, personalities, tastes,

416
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,839
and the way they think too?

417
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,299
You're going that far?

418
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,369
It's unfair.

419
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,479
They must've eaten...

420
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,479
the same food at least 5
times a week for 3 years.

421
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
It could've been that way
since they were babies.

422
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,490
This won't do.

423
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:06,059
From now on, I'll make him eat what I eat.

424
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:07,358
Three meals a day?

425
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,990
No. At least one meal a day.

426
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,129
Is that possible?

427
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,569
Where there's a will, there's a way.

428
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,400
"Impossible" is not part of my vocabulary.

429
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,209
I'm going to give him...

430
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,470
my "like-attracts-like germ!"

431
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,720
Ms. Nam!

432
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,490
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Doctor.

433
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,729
We ran into each other again.

434
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,629
Well, that's true...

435
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,970
I heard early morning runs
were good for endurance,

436
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,000
so I thought I'd give it a try.

437
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,079
It's six in the morning.

438
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,910
Is it really a coincidence that
we ran into each other here...

439
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,279
at this time?

440
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,180
To tell you the truth,

441
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,649
I asked your coach about
your workout schedule.

442
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,489
I'm not a stalker or anything.

443
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,490
I...

444
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,490
Well...

445
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:20,000
I wanted to do the same thing as you.

446
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:22,569
Every day...

447
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,599
I'll get going!

448
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
Doctor.

449
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:08,479
You'll get sick if you work
yourself too hard on your first day.

450
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,809
It's not that. I was late
downloading the bicycle app.

451
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:14,519
Wait here for a second.

452
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,220
This is where I do a 1km sprint.

453
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,460
I'll be right back.

454
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,859
Let's go together on my way back.

455
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,259
Well...

456
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,569
Together...

457
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,818
Let's go, Nam Sung Mi!

458
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,190
(A goddess in the ring, Nam Sung Mi, )

459
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,529
(dominates the National Lifetime
Sports Martial Arts Competition!)

460
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,640
Let's go!

461
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:42,670
Tell me.

462
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,480
You always drink tons of Coke
when you're worried about something.

463
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,779
What's on your mind?

464
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,849
Well...

465
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,150
It doesn't seem like an accident.

466
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,490
Oh, that fire at the apartment?

467
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,689
We couldn't identify the cause.

468
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,059
It wasn't a gas explosion
or a short circuit.

469
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,799
It's strange that the flowers didn't burn.

470
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,999
The police aren't dumb, you know.

471
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,329
I'm sure there was a reason
they said it was an accident.

472
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,309
Right.

473
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:17,640
I've been...

474
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:20,539
randomly running into
a guy every day recently.

475
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,410
But it's strange.

476
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,209
When I saw him today,

477
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,279
this part,

478
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:30,890
no, this part...

479
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,720
had this tickly feeling.

480
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,629
And right now as well.
I'm just thinking about him,

481
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,329
so why does it feel like
my mouth is drying up...

482
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,329
and my eyes are getting hot?

483
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,599
Who is that guy?

484
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,440
You don't need to know. A guy...

485
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:55,609
who is very different from me.

486
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,910
I see.

487
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,349
- What are you looking at?
- Look at you.

488
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,380
(Ha Ga Hee)

489
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,569
I heard she had many family
members that she had to support,

490
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,369
but the chief mourner is a
friend from the hostess bar.

491
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,009
How did you know about this?

492
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:06,019
Of course, I should know.

493
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,579
It involves my husband.

494
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,130
(Ha Ga Hee)

495
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,779
Thank you for coming even though Ga Hee...

496
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,550
only came to church with me once.

497
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,190
Will Ga Hee be able to go to a good place?

498
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,760
Death is what ends sins
and allows for resurrection.

499
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,098
Today's dinner menu.

500
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:58,939
What do you think of miso ramen...

501
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,038
made with shiitake broth and miso paste?

502
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,570
I found a good restaurant.

503
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:07,409
I'm telling you. Ms. Ha Ga Hee
was Chief Director Sim's mistress.

504
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,909
They met at a hostess bar.

505
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,379
Didn't you see Ms. Ha the other day?

506
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,419
She was covered in designer goods.

507
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,149
I heard he bought her a foreign
car, an apartment in Gangnam,

508
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,519
and all of that.

509
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,859
I can't believe she
ended up dying in a fire.

510
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,630
She really got punished.

511
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,158
I heard she was also pregnant
with Chief Director Sim's baby too.

512
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,069
So it was her goal to become
the chief director's wife.

513
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,569
Gosh, what a bad girl.

514
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,570
Hey.

515
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,670
Watch your mouths. There
are expecting mothers here.

516
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,039
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,800
You're here. Would you like some tea?

518
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,969
Let's have a quick chat.

519
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,590
Ga Hee and my child died.

520
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:30,690
You seem to know already.

521
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:32,630
Did you hear from your mom?

522
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,570
Your mom...

523
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,570
came by Ga Hee's funeral.

524
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:44,809
But she looked too happy. It was strange.

525
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,219
So what?

526
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,849
I met with Doctor Kim,
your mom's psychiatrist.

527
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,389
I heard your mom stopped
taking her medicine recently.

528
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,360
Ga Hee wouldn't have died like that.

529
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:11,099
Wasn't it an accident?

530
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,170
Your mom waited for me her whole life...

531
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,839
solely based on the belief
that I wouldn't abandon...

532
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,010
the woman who gave birth to my child.

533
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,880
She's the type to do
anything if she found out...

534
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,379
that Ga Hee was pregnant with my child.

535
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,089
Was hurting Mom all of her life not enough?

536
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,190
Are you trying to frame
her as a murderer too?

537
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,460
Your younger sibling
died. Don't you care at all?

538
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:37,860
Even if they weren't your sibling,

539
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,260
they were your patient and her baby!

540
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,070
Do you even deserve to be a gynecologist?

541
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,110
Hearing that...

542
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,519
from you...

543
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,019
makes me laugh.

544
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:08,289
What?

545
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,559
Do you deserve to be a father?

546
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,059
Do you deserve to be a husband?

547
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,539
Think about that first
deep inside of your heart...

548
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,139
before you question...

549
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:26,880
what I deserve to be.

550
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,909
I find what you said so
disgusting and offensive.

551
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,058
Have you found anything?

552
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:47,158
Ms. Yeom finished her
appointment at Iroun Genetic Center...

553
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,659
and just went back home.

554
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,030
Keep an eye on her.

555
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,788
- Hey.
- There's an issue...

556
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,118
with Ms. Joo Min Ha's placenta.

557
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,260
If her uterus ruptures,
we may need to remove it.

558
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,829
It would be helpful if you
were there for the delivery.

559
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:18,090
Okay. I'm on my way.

560
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,939
So Jin. I have to go into
an emergency surgery.

561
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:29,510
I'm sorry. Let's eat miso
ramen together next time.

562
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,050
"Like-attracts-like germ" strategy.

563
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:44,320
It's only the first day, and
it's already not going well.

564
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,519
It's finally time.

565
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,429
We waited a whole year for today.

566
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,058
Let's try 18 courses of these oysters...

567
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:54,329
that are full of flavor
at this time of year.

568
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,730
They are delicious when
the weather gets cold.

569
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,468
And this chef has been cooking
with oysters in Boryeong...

570
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:03,538
for 30 years. How will his dishes taste?

571
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:05,340
So Jin. You don't like oysters.

572
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:06,940
You're right.

573
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,178
Why do they look so good?

574
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:12,308
I've made several delivery
orders while watching this show.

575
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,519
Watching them enjoy the food
makes me impulsively buy things.

576
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:19,789
That's right.

577
00:40:20,889 --> 00:40:22,119
That's what I should do.

578
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,289
What?

579
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,530
What is it?

580
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,400
(We're always together.)

581
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,269
What?

582
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,439
Mr. Seo. Just once. Please?

583
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,808
- Just help me out once.
- It's not even sushi.

584
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:40,539
Why do you want to make
something like that here?

585
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,509
With the hardwood interior
and the lighting on the bar,

586
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,118
this place is so luxurious.

587
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,948
I get so hungry whenever I come here.

588
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,488
Also, that "We're always together."

589
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,459
It's so memorable.

590
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,230
It feels like food that you
want to eat with the person...

591
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,300
you always want to be with.

592
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,899
Okay.

593
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,299
Just for the three days
I'm gone to go fishing.

594
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,968
After you're done, you
have to clean up really well.

595
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,539
Yes, of course!

596
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,308
Mr. Seo.

597
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:13,380
Since you're letting me use the place,

598
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,808
could you let me use that too?

599
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:18,010
That? My chef's hat?

600
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,750
No. This is mine.

601
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:25,018
Just once.

602
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,118
- Hey.
- Just once.

603
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,619
Then you can use a new one.

604
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,690
You should use a new one.

605
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,389
Here.

606
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
What do you think?

607
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
It suits you. You look like a chef.

608
00:41:34,501 --> 00:41:36,500
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, my!

609
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,189
Yeon Woo. Did the surgery go well?

610
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,760
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

611
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,030
Yes. I'm sorry I couldn't
keep our promise today.

612
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,059
Let's have dinner together tomorrow...

613
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,900
Okay. It's time for "Han
So Jin's Five Meals A Day."

614
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,800
When I'm craving...

615
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,510
Italian food after
working late into the night,

616
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:22,379
I eat pasta covered in a
warm blanket of cheese.

617
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,949
The dish I have prepared today...

618
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,280
is Jackson Pasta.

619
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,718
The secret recipe of the number one dish...

620
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,488
on the Convenience Store Yumchelin Guide.

621
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:37,328
You can get all of these
ingredients at a convenience store...

622
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:40,599
just three minutes from your house.

623
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,599
Okay. I'll get started now.

624
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,900
Pour some water on the pasta...

625
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,369
and cover it up.

626
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:53,880
While the noodles cook,
prepare the tteokbokki too.

627
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,909
I'll microwave the
tteokbokki for three minutes.

628
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:04,150
Okay. What will we do while
we wait for three minutes?

629
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:06,260
We'll begin preparing the ingredients.

630
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:10,030
We just need to add all of
these ingredients and mix.

631
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:14,929
Wait.

632
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,799
You should be salivating...

633
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,340
by this point in the video, Yeon Woo.

634
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:24,268
The limitless world of flavor...

635
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:27,839
that you can't experience
without tasting this is coming soon.

636
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,980
I'll add the cheese on top.

637
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:34,550
This color...

638
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,519
and this smell.

639
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,658
- Cheese!
- Did you see that cheese pull?

640
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:43,929
I'll give it a taste.

641
00:43:46,829 --> 00:43:48,329
Dad, I'm back...

642
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:52,699
What's going on?

643
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:54,900
It's so delicious!

644
00:43:58,309 --> 00:43:59,610
Mr. Sim.

645
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:03,610
You always want carb-heavy
foods after surgery.

646
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,948
There's something else...

647
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:11,250
I really want to eat right now.

648
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:12,389
What is it?

649
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,379
Okay. My eating show will continue...

650
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,179
tomorrow evening.

651
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,078
See you tomorrow, Yeon Woo. Bye.

652
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,308
Bye.

653
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:40,320
Look at you.

654
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:45,218
But this isn't Ms. Han's pasta.

655
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:47,289
If I'm going to eat pasta,
it should be really nice.

656
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,900
Isn't it good?

657
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:54,559
Yes.

658
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,659
Why were you doing that?

659
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,428
Oh, nothing.

660
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:59,800
A new strategy I'm trying out.

661
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,440
I wonder if Yeon Woo
followed my recipe well.

662
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,880
Did you eat all of that?

663
00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:20,389
You and I have very
similar food preferences.

664
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,259
We were like that as kids too.
So we always fought over food.

665
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,360
You're right.

666
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,558
We both always loved aged
kimchi and braised pollack.

667
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,670
- And salmon too.
- You're right.

668
00:45:30,469 --> 00:45:31,469
Oh, right.

669
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,940
What now?

670
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,468
You and I must share...

671
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,739
so many "like-attracts-like germs."

672
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,110
"Like-attract-like" what?

673
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,550
When you look at me, instead
of your heart beating fast,

674
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,489
don't your intestines beat fast?

675
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,090
Thump, thump.

676
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:53,759
- Isn't your stomach pounding?
- Stop it.

677
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,019
Don't be ridiculous.

678
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,730
Also, what is this?

679
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,129
Why are you wearing my father's hat?

680
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,500
Hey, no.

681
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,639
Stop it. You punk. Stop it!

682
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:09,739
There.

683
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:13,538
Put it back.

684
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,609
- That's a better look.
- Before I get angry.

685
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,209
- You're really pretty now.
- One.

686
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,279
- You are...
- Two!

687
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,280
Okay.

688
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,268
What are you looking at?

689
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:38,269
What?

690
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:40,599
Well...

691
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,840
Why? Do you think I look like a real chef?

692
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,110
You're pretty.

693
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,379
Hey, you punk.

694
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,919
You should say things
like that out loud. Again.

695
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,949
"You're pretty."

696
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:00,989
Hey.

697
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,859
I thought you downed the food way too fast.

698
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,730
Drink this. Drink it up quick.

699
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,760
You're too old for this.

700
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,369
Why did you eat so fast?

701
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,489
When you look at me, instead
of your heart beating fast,

702
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,489
don't your intestines beat fast?

703
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,940
My gosh.

704
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,570
I'm out of my mind.

705
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,380
Yes.

706
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,619
Let's run. I'll run. I must run.

707
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:06,489
Yeon Woo. What did you eat last night?

708
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,359
I had cheese pasta, of course.

709
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,429
How could I eat anything
else after your eating show?

710
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:16,158
Torturing someone
with food is a tough skill.

711
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,570
Where did you learn that from?

712
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:20,440
Did it really work? What a relief.

713
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:22,000
What's a relief?

714
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,340
I'm relieved that you ate well.

715
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,380
You won't know what I mean.

716
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,139
Today's dinner...

717
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,480
I'm really sorry, So Jin.
I'll call you back soon.

718
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,389
That's right.

719
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,029
My convenient restaurant
cooking and eating show...

720
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:44,829
will make you eat anything.

721
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:49,000
He should have tens of millions
like-attracts-like germs now.

722
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,170
Just wait.

723
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,670
I'll fill your intestines
with germs just like mine.

724
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:04,849
(The Battle of Kindred Germs)

725
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:46,389
How about beef bone soup for dinner?

726
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,759
(Day 2, Project Create Kindred Germs)

727
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,230
Beef bone soup and dumplings.

728
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,629
Whenever I feel under the weather,

729
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,530
a bowl of this beef bone soup...

730
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,639
heats me right up.

731
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:02,868
The broth is hot and spicy.

732
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,139
Shall we try it?

733
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:24,190
You eat so well. So why are you so short?

734
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,499
(Day 3)

735
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,768
Today... Drumroll, please.

736
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:32,868
A really simple
convenience store version...

737
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:34,569
of cheesy fries.

738
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,300
Pour it in like this.

739
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,139
Okay.

740
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,139
My gosh.

741
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,250
Doesn't it look appetizing?

742
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,409
I'm starving.

743
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,679
Let's see.

744
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,959
(Let's meet! 7pm today, Grilled Town)

745
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,729
(What memories. I haven't
been in ages. I'm in!)

746
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,030
(I'm definitely in. Time
works too. I'll be there too!)

747
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:10,909
Dip it right in and...

748
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,839
Hey, camera guy.

749
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,339
I need you to focus. The angle's not right.

750
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,579
Oh, sorry. The food looked so good.

751
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,249
- My gosh.
- Cheers.

752
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,419
You're right.

753
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,460
It's still good. The fries too.

754
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:30,159
Try it.

755
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,198
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

756
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,199
It's so good.

757
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:42,539
Shai.

758
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,709
We ate the same foods for three days.

759
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,139
We should have a billion
like-attracts-like kindred germs.

760
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,049
My plan is going so smoothly.

761
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,149
What will happen next?

762
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,389
(Always Sushi, Chef's recommendation)

763
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,230
(Sim General Hospital's Sim Yeon Woo)

764
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:12,969
It's Yeon Woo.

765
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,609
So Jin, will you do an eating
show this weekend too?

766
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,909
Yes. What are you doing right now?

767
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,280
I left work after my morning shift.

768
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,050
I prepared something amazing.

769
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,619
It'll be worth looking forward to.

770
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,149
I'll be waiting.

771
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,018
Okay. Shall I check the
state of his intestines?

772
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:34,159
Hey, Yeon Woo. Did you notice a change?

773
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:37,329
Like, do you feel unusually constipated,

774
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:40,960
or do your feces have a different color?

775
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,400
The color?

776
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:46,329
Are we close enough
to discuss such details?

777
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:50,110
Oh, well, no, but...

778
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:53,879
I was wondering if you followed the recipe.

779
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,939
If you get the recipe wrong,

780
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,309
it could ruin the dish and
give you a stomachache.

781
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,050
The recipe?

782
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,749
After watching you live yesterday,

783
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,289
I went to a restaurant famous for
their cheesy fries, so don't worry.

784
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,459
(Day 3 experiment failed)

785
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,789
You went to a restaurant...

786
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,059
instead of a convenience store?

787
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,800
On your own?

788
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:19,368
No, with my travel club friends.

789
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:22,440
Oh, the travel club...

790
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:28,380
Was Jang Mi Eun there too?

791
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,980
Yes, she's a member too.

792
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,989
Then what about...

793
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,658
the cheese pasta three days ago?

794
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:44,759
Oh, that, I had at a
restaurant with Jung Tam.

795
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,760
(Day 1 experiment failed)

796
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:47,029
The day after, with Jung Tam,

797
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:49,129
I had beef bone soup at a famous place.

798
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,428
(Day 2 experiment failed)

799
00:53:50,429 --> 00:53:51,429
Is something wrong?

800
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,629
(Project failed)

801
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:54,539
No, well...

802
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,339
Yeon Woo, I need to hang up.

803
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,579
(Project failed)

804
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,650
Did I do something wrong?

805
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:10,519
Yeon Woo and Mi Eun...

806
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:12,689
ate the same food again.

807
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,820
So what?

808
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,658
"So what?"

809
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,459
It means they increased
their number of kindred germs.

810
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,599
Those two!

811
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,500
Put that knife down. Drop it.

812
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,968
What is this germ that
you're making a fuss about it?

813
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:30,268
According to a body of research,

814
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:32,839
when pigs were fed
lactobacillus that humans take,

815
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,408
they became very amicable towards humans.

816
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:39,250
The like-attracts-like kindred
germs created a sense of kinship.

817
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,449
Like you and me.

818
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,449
Okay, but that was about pigs.

819
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,389
What about it anyway?

820
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:50,829
I want to do what Mi Eun did and create...

821
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:53,829
a kind of kinship with Yeon Woo.

822
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,360
A kinship that they have...

823
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,570
and we don't.

824
00:55:02,369 --> 00:55:04,409
But I don't think it worked.

825
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:23,659
(Always Sushi)

826
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,269
So that was it.

827
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,030
A sense of kinship.

828
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,570
I feel bad now.

829
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,369
What should I do?

830
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,150
What should I do to not mind?

831
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,829
(Black pepper jjajang popcorn is out!)

832
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
(New message)

833
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,500
So Jin, do you want to come
over to my place tomorrow?

834
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:10,440
It's an official dinner invitation.

835
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:14,380
At his place? With him?

836
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,010
Forget the eating show.

837
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:19,649
Let's eat the same thing at the same table.

838
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,650
Okay?

839
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,920
So Jin.

840
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:36,130
Han So Jin makes that
face whenever she's in love.

841
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:39,429
She smiles with a slight wink.

842
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:41,570
Like when she eats a sour tangerine.

843
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,779
Tomatoes, celery,

844
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,279
lettuce, bell peppers,

845
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,738
abalone, gochujang,

846
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,149
a baguette, milk,

847
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,948
ricotta cheese, feta cheese,

848
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:54,750
whipped cream, fresh cream.

849
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,750
I'll mix ingredients that could
never work together to make...

850
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:02,059
a symphony.

851
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,630
So Jin has the taste buds of a child.

852
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,129
She likes sweet foods and loves cheese.

853
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,230
She likes rose pasta,
so she loves fresh cream.

854
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,550
To make her eat the ginseng of the sea,

855
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,119
I must coat this...

856
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,989
with instant noodle powder and butter.

857
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,360
(Jang Mi Eun)

858
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:48,340
(Jang Mi Eun)

859
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:10,019
Yeon Woo.

860
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,529
It's my birthday today.

861
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,130
I want to spend it with you
minus the travel club members.

862
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,500
Ta-da. I even brought some wine.

863
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,139
Oh, that's too bad.

864
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:25,070
I invited So Jin over for dinner.

865
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,039
I see.

866
00:58:30,449 --> 00:58:32,249
Then I'll just stay for some tea.

867
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,250
Sorry. I'm cooking right now,

868
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,980
and I'd like to focus just on that.

869
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,589
What?

870
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,618
Let's celebrate your birthday
with the group another time.

871
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:40,619
Is that okay?

872
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:43,559
Yes.

873
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:47,959
Let's do that, then. You can keep this.

874
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,529
I will, thanks a lot.

875
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,570
Get home safely. Sorry.

876
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,050
Where are you? Do you want naengmyeon?

877
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:49,960
I'm with Jung Tam and Sung Mi.

878
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:02,638
Hey, Seo Kang Hoon.

879
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:05,368
No. You can eat enough for me too.

880
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:06,908
- I'm going to Yeon Woo's.
- Over here.

881
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:08,940
- I'll have something nicer.
- Seo Kang Hoon.

882
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,848
Kang Hoon?

883
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:14,049
Hey. So what now?

884
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,379
What did she say? Will she join us?

885
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:20,149
She can't make it. She has other plans.

886
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,519
Does she? We can go without her.

887
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,189
Is she making an excuse
to avoid coming out?

888
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,199
Well...

889
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,198
She went to Yeon Woo's to
have dinner with him. Alone.

890
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,670
At Yeon Woo's place?

891
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,170
I doubt they'll stop at just having dinner.

892
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,280
Yeon Woo does have women over often.

893
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:45,579
His bathroom's full of
amenities you'd see in a hotel.

894
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:47,880
The sneaky punk.

895
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:49,319
I think...

896
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,988
you'll need to go without
me. I can't join you.

897
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,319
Why not? Come with us!

898
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,420
This will feel so awkward...

899
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:06,099
Shall we? Go? Now?

900
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,199
Okay.

901
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:11,940
This room,

902
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,840
and that puzzle. Do you remember it all?

903
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,749
It took me a long time
to put it back together.

904
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,279
Can you delete that memory?

905
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,119
I can't. I'll think of it
whenever I feel down.

906
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,649
Hang your jacket up there.

907
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:26,650
Okay.

908
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:44,738
Do you like the food?

909
01:01:44,739 --> 01:01:46,340
Yes. I love it.

910
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:51,909
Why...

911
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:56,249
did you suddenly decide to invite me over?

912
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,550
Do I need a reason to do so?

913
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,820
Sharing good food,

914
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:04,489
going to nice places,
enjoying things together.

915
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:08,159
I wanted to create a
sense of kinship with you.

916
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,969
A sense of kinship?

917
01:02:12,769 --> 01:02:13,769
Out of the blue?

918
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:14,969
It's not out of the blue.

919
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:17,110
That's weird.

920
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:20,979
Let's eat before the food I
worked hard to prepare gets cold.

921
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:21,980
Okay.

922
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:24,678
Start with the cream pasta.

923
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:25,679
Sure.

924
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,320
Try the cheese tteokbokki too.

925
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,788
I'm so full.

926
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,860
How was it?

927
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:43,059
It was delicious.

928
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,300
Yeon Woo. It's the first time
food made me this happy...

929
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:53,909
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

930
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:55,909
No.

931
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:00,249
I'm slightly lactose intolerant.

932
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:04,149
This happens when I eat
something heavy on dairy.

933
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:06,919
It settles with time. Don't worry.

934
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,319
Are you sure you're okay?

935
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:09,320
I am.

936
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:11,090
Shall I make you some coffee?

937
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,260
Yes.

938
01:03:13,159 --> 01:03:14,230
Okay.

939
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:21,300
Not now. This is bad.

940
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:24,969
The coffee smells great.

941
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,679
It does. I can smell it from here.

942
01:03:31,679 --> 01:03:32,750
What a lovely aroma.

943
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:34,420
It hurts so bad.

944
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,079
The coffee smells amazing today.

945
01:03:38,889 --> 01:03:40,150
My gosh.

946
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,090
Thanks.

947
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:44,888
Do you feel hot?

948
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:47,828
I turned the heater
on in case you felt cold.

949
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:51,399
Oh, is that why? Thank you.

950
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,899
Just in case the food was too greasy,

951
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,900
I made the coffee extra
strong. I hope that's okay.

952
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,538
Extra strong coffee?

953
01:03:58,539 --> 01:04:00,309
I like strong coffee.

954
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,110
If I drink this too,

955
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,249
my anal sphincter might give in.

956
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,250
Shall we...

957
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,349
go and...

958
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:12,050
watch a movie now?

959
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,360
Shall we?

960
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:20,090
I can keep it in. I can do this.

961
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:23,460
Hang in there. Just a bit.

962
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,369
I can do this.

963
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:28,800
Han So Jin.

964
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:34,280
No. I can't do this.

965
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:37,349
What if I make a bigger scene?

966
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,309
Let's try to get to the couch first.

967
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,848
Are you okay, So Jin?

968
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:45,820
Yes. Is the movie on already?

969
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,260
Act like I'm in no hurry.

970
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,059
Look natural, as if I'm looking around.

971
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:59,300
Focus on where I place my feet.

972
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:06,639
You still feel hot?

973
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,839
How long...

974
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,880
- can I last like this?
- You're sweating a lot.

975
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:13,980
No way.

976
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,349
I feel butterflies in this situation?

977
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:21,219
I'm fine.

978
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,329
Hey.

979
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,760
This is...

980
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,230
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

981
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,368
The day you barged in,

982
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:36,639
the sight of you with chopsticks
in your hair left a huge impression.

983
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,039
So I got this.

984
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,010
Come closer.

985
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,190
It's pretty.

986
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:07,869
Sorry.

987
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:10,170
I can't do this.

988
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:12,269
I...

989
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:14,139
What?

990
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,579
I think...

991
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,780
I must go home.

992
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,820
- What do you mean...
- Do not follow me!

993
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:25,219
Just...

994
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,760
let me leave.

995
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:30,360
- Please.
- What's the matter?

996
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,889
So Jin.

997
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,559
Why... Your jacket.

998
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:41,340
Your jacket.

999
01:06:59,789 --> 01:07:02,360
This is so bad.

1000
01:07:16,769 --> 01:07:19,570
Kang Hoon. I need you to come get me.

1001
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:23,308
I think I'm going to die. It hurts so bad.

1002
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:26,280
So Jin. You sound weird. Where are you?

1003
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:30,380
I'm in the public toilet...

1004
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,949
of Yeon Woo's apartment building.

1005
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,510
So Jin.

1006
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:53,309
Han So Jin!

1007
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:58,150
So Jin.

1008
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:00,010
So Jin.

1009
01:08:01,079 --> 01:08:03,750
So Jin, stay with me. Where does it hurt?

1010
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,760
My stomach hurts so bad.

1011
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,219
Help me.

1012
01:08:37,789 --> 01:08:39,549
- So Jin, what happened...
- Yeon Woo.

1013
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:40,960
I can't talk for long.

1014
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,988
I'm taking So Jin to Sim
Hospital's ER. See you there.

1015
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:46,560
- Hang in there.
- It hurts so bad.

1016
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:33,169
(DNA Lover)

1017
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,839
Kang Hoon. To So Jin...

1018
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,908
- Are you okay?
- What are you?

1019
01:09:36,909 --> 01:09:40,109
There are people you want to
share your hurt and struggles with.

1020
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,079
And there are people you want
to share just the good things with.

1021
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,319
- Kang Hoon.
- Be careful.

1022
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:48,318
I like So Jin?

1023
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:49,420
No!

1024
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,689
I know it's not right.

1025
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,859
But I want him.

1026
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,199
So Jin, you're not alone.

1027
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,470
Before the surgery, on the
way to the operating room,

1028
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,739
and inside the operating room,

1029
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,840
I'll be by your side.
