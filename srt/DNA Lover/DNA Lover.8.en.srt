00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,209
(DNA Lover)

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,538
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

8
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:37,880
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:55,929
In my world,

10
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,659
there are two types of men.

11
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,939
Oh, dear. You're too much, So Jin.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
You're a fool.

13
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:12,438
The type of man who I'm madly attracted to genetically...

14
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,579
but keeps hurting me.

15
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,420
Are you okay?

16
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,420
The type of man who I'm not genetically attracted to at all...

17
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,658
but keeps saving me.

18
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,958
- Why are you in pain? - You're a fool.

19
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,488
- That pains my heart. - You're a fool.

20
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:28,929
Kang Hoon is upset.

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,159
You're a fool, So Jin.

22
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,530
What kind of prank is destiny playing on me?

23
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,769
(Episode 8: Shall We Kiss?)

24
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,739
Let's get you up.

25
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,480
Slowly.

26
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,180
Goodness.

27
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:53,319
You have acute enteritis.

28
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,590
What on earth did Yeon Woo feed you?

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,189
Yeon Woo did nothing wrong.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,920
I should've been careful.

31
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,189
How can you say that now?

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,700
Drink some of this. It'll help you get better soon.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,068
When I have enteritis, drinking barley tea...

34
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:10,400
helps me feel better rather than plum tea.

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,810
I'm not the same as you. I'll drink it later.

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,909
Are you okay?

37
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,779
Yeon Woo, how did you come here...

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,719
He called your phone, so I told him.

39
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,889
Yeon Woo, what on earth did you feed her that she got acute enteritis?

40
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,889
I didn't know you were so badly lactose intolerant. I'm so sorry.

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,218
I told you it wasn't Yeon Woo's fault.

42
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,789
So Jin can't eat greasy foods or fresh cream.

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,960
Fresh cream?

44
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,870
But how were you fine with the sauce from the convenience store?

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,469
I must've been nervous about eating at your place for the first time.

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
- Ms. Han So Jin? - Yes.

47
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,788
For your enteritis, you can leave once the IV drip...

48
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,990
with antibiotics is finished and you get your medication.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,360
But we found something off.

50
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,699
There's something protruding...

51
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,060
in your lower left abdominal area.

52
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,770
What?

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,539
Let's have you lie down for now.

54
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,969
- Oh, okay. - Slowly.

55
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,639
One moment.

56
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,750
I'll press down on it.

57
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,020
Are you okay?

58
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,319
It doesn't hurt.

59
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,490
Could you both wait outside for now?

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,900
Yeon Woo, let's go outside.

61
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,929
Could I stay and watch the ultrasound with you?

62
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,370
In similar cases,

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,969
patients had uterine myomas or cervical cancer.

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,568
Cancer?

65
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,270
Oh, I...

66
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,569
I have the BRCA gene.

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,009
That means it's not weird for me to get this kind of disease.

68
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,210
It is earlier than I expected, but...

69
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,520
Why, you...

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,189
How can you say that without even batting an eye?

71
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:14,490
So Jin, can I look at your ultrasound image myself?

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,689
Is that okay?

73
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,129
No. You can't.

74
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,000
Never. Both of you, get out.

75
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,639
I'm sorry. This is an important matter for me too.

76
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,199
I'll check for myself.

77
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:46,189
(Waiting Room)

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,230
Hey, Yeon Woo. How is So Jin?

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,370
Well...

80
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,839
So, we'll only know after some more tests,

81
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:02,939
but I think it's a uterine myoma.

82
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,279
Then, doesn't she need surgery?

83
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,850
Once we know the location and size, she should get surgery right away.

84
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,689
I mean, how could she have not known until now?

85
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:17,160
Then, she must've been in pain every now and then, right?

86
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,459
I'll take good care of her. Don't worry too much.

87
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,329
By the way, Kang Hoon.

88
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:27,870
What are you...

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,600
to So Jin?

90
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,339
Kang Hoon. I need you to come get me.

91
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,079
I think I'm going to die.

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,279
It hurts so bad.

93
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,209
You know,

94
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,779
she asked for you when she was the most desperate and in danger.

95
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,250
There are people you want to share your hurt and struggles with.

96
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,360
And there are people you want to share just the good things with.

97
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,259
It's like that. Don't mind me.

98
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:58,860
Are you okay?

99
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,500
Even if she only asks for you when she's in pain?

100
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,639
I'm fine.

101
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,569
In whatever moment,

102
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,709
I'll run to So Jin if she asks for me.

103
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,209
Thanks, Yeon Woo.

104
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,259
Do not follow me!

105
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,629
Just...

106
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,239
let me leave. Please.

107
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,639
What's the matter?

108
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,138
So Jin.

109
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,779
I'm sorry. I'll check for myself.

110
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,449
Darn it.

111
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,920
I was just trying to share his gut microbiome. What is all this?

112
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,149
Here.

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,589
You know So Jin.

114
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,958
She doesn't eat anything besides my porridge when she's sick.

115
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,529
If she won't eat, you should spoon-feed her yourself.

116
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,198
Is So Jin a baby?

117
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,399
She likes that. Go on.

118
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,639
- I'll be going, then. - Bye.

119
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,209
Goodness.

120
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,319
Good grief.

121
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,550
You'll only get better if you starve until the diarrhea stops.

122
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,720
But this is pure torture.

123
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,129
I don't think my stomach hurts anymore.

124
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,429
Can't I just eat this?

125
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,430
Hey.

126
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,670
Enteritis doesn't go away after one shot of antibiotics.

127
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,209
But it doesn't hurt that much.

128
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,378
When I have enteritis, drinking barley tea...

129
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,810
helps me feel better rather than plum tea.

130
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:59,579
It really doesn't hurt.

131
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,818
Is it because of the barley tea?

132
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,389
Kang Hoon is here.

133
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,860
Dad packed some food for you to eat.

134
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:20,100
Stop picking at your food and eat with more gusto.

135
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,008
Here. Open wide.

136
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,278
That's for someone with your big mouth.

137
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,508
Just eat.

138
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,979
Open wide, okay?

139
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,708
Here it comes.

140
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,778
It's too bland. I should add some soy sauce.

141
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,449
Of course, porridge is bland.

142
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,190
But it's too bland!

143
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,389
Gosh, what are you talking about?

144
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,720
Wait!

145
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,628
Sharing a spoon is practically like an indirect kiss.

146
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,369
It's a moment where you share the germs in your saliva.

147
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,440
An indirect kiss?

148
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,570
Germs?

149
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,570
Gross.

150
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,949
Hey, it's not like we haven't shared a spoon before.

151
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,509
But this isn't right.

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,250
Goodness.

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,419
- There you go. - Come on.

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,519
What are you doing?

155
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,119
Then, So Jin.

156
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,258
Are you giving up on sharing germs with Sewer...

157
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,929
by eating the same food as him?

158
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:15,789
Yes.

159
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:18,599
I think that went down the drain.

160
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,159
Goodness.

161
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,529
I'm leaving.

162
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,070
Return the thermos later.

163
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,538
I owe your dad so much. Let him know I said thank you.

164
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,909
Make sure to go to Yeon Woo for your appointments. Don't be shy.

165
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,610
You have to get surgery from the best doctor.

166
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:38,278
I don't know about anything else, but Yeon Woo is a reliable doctor.

167
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,419
Come on.

168
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,789
I'll get surgery from someone else.

169
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,259
How can I get surgery from Yeon Woo too?

170
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,990
I'll check up on you later.

171
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,259
I'm off.

172
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,830
(Jeongdo Water Parsley)

173
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:58,899
A Ri, could I give two bunches of that water parsley to Mr. Seo?

174
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,239
Go ahead, then. I know the seller's phone number,

175
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
so I can get more easily.

176
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:03,940
Thank you.

177
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,940
Put that down. You'll get enteritis too.

178
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,820
Kang Hoon. Wait up!

179
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,419
Don't run.

180
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,649
You'll fall, okay?

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Be careful.

182
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,809
Hey, are you okay? Is your back all right?

183
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,539
I told you not to run.

184
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,320
If you're okay, how about you get up now?

185
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,779
Oh, right.

186
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,549
These are still fine, though.

187
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,398
Here, take these to Mr. Seo.

188
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,970
A Ri bought these, so I'm sure they're organic.

189
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,370
Okay. Thanks.

190
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,669
I'll be going now.

191
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,409
Okay. Bye.

192
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,039
- Bye. - Okay.

193
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,860
- Dad. - Yes?

194
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,230
So Jin asked me to give these to you.

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,730
Hey, it's water parsley.

196
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,439
Kang Hoon, what's wrong?

197
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
What?

198
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:40,039
Why is your face so red?

199
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,909
- Do you have a fever? - No.

200
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,740
No. No!

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,450
Dad, I'll go and get some air.

202
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,779
What? Hey, Kang Hoon.

203
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,360
Our lips just bumped into each other by accident.

204
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,929
Right.

205
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,700
It's not that big a deal. Goodness.

206
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,120
Darn it. Run.

207
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,279
Just run for now.

208
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,190
Run! Darn.

209
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,740
He doesn't seem to be in his right mind.

210
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,379
Why is he running around in the middle of the night?

211
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,289
You always cry here by yourself, right? I saw you.

212
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,529
Go away.

213
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,200
Go away!

214
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll leave if you tell me why you're crying, little kid.

215
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm not a little kid.

216
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,570
I have a name.

217
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,370
I'm Seo Kang Hoon.

218
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,710
Kang Hoon?

219
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,279
But why do you cry every day?

220
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,950
My mom keeps asking me who I am.

221
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,649
Mom doesn't know my name.

222
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,960
Is your mom sick?

223
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,190
I don't know.

224
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,990
All she does is sleep all day.

225
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,329
Then, from now on,

226
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:50,769
I'll call your name often instead of your mom. Okay?

227
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,970
You're not my mom!

228
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,970
- Kang Hoon. - Stop calling me!

229
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:59,580
Kang Hoon. Seo Kang Hoon.

230
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,509
Seo Kang Hoon.

231
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,730
Right. It's So Jin.

232
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,240
She's just So Jin. Right.

233
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,370
I...

234
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,600
like So Jin?

235
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,809
I sent you a bag as a present.

236
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,779
We can have matching handbags.

237
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
Really?

238
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,649
Goodness, you sure are the best, Mom.

239
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,459
By the way, are you drinking alone on your birthday?

240
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,190
Yes, I don't have anyone to spend my birthday with.

241
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,799
I'll be right there. Wait for me.

242
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,629
No, Mom, it's okay.

243
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,840
Actually, there was one person...

244
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,740
I wanted to spend today with.

245
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,169
One person?

246
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeon Woo.

247
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:44,918
Thinking back, when Yeon Woo and I dated,

248
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,720
half of what we did was pack up and travel together.

249
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,950
But we didn't take photos together.

250
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,220
Is that so?

251
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,129
This photo...

252
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,629
A Belgian friend sent it to me two years ago.

253
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,970
I had just shoved it in somewhere...

254
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,500
until I took it out after having a few drinks now.

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,340
I feel...

256
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,639
a bit weird, Mom.

257
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,950
The fact that this is the only photo I have with Yeon Woo.

258
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,950
Mi Eun.

259
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,350
Do you love that man?

260
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,889
Of course, I love him.

261
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,389
I have lots of people I love.

262
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,700
And Yeon Woo is one of them.

263
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:33,960
I just...

264
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,899
wanted to eat delicious food with Yeon Woo and talk about the past.

265
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,570
Oh, that's too bad.

266
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,138
I invited So Jin over for dinner.

267
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:45,908
Then I'll just stay for some tea.

268
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,710
Sorry. I'm cooking right now,

269
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,309
and I'd like to focus just on that.

270
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,750
Let's do that, then.

271
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,219
You can keep this.

272
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,689
Get home safely. Sorry.

273
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,090
But I was turned away at Yeon Woo's front door.

274
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I mean...

275
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,860
I actually feel so humiliated and lame right now.

276
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,660
But here I am, talking about Yeon Woo again.

277
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
- Mom. - Yes?

278
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,019
I know it's not right.

279
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,019
But...

280
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,259
I want him.

281
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,069
That's what makes you my daughter.

282
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,839
Having something and abandoning something...

283
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,440
You should do it all.

284
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,959
What do you think? Doesn't this place look good?

285
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,690
Yes. Oh, right.

286
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,089
Oh, yes.

287
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,430
Did you ask the coach about how I like blue crab?

288
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:21,069
The blue crab here is as full of meat as snow crabs.

289
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,209
But they're not as big as snow crabs, so you need some skill.

290
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,809
I'll get the meat out for you.

291
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,809
Hang on.

292
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,250
Are you okay? I'll do it.

293
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,450
No.

294
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,089
I'm known for my delicate fingers.

295
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,160
I have hands like bear paws.

296
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,798
You have such beautiful hands.

297
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh, thank you.

298
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,338
Come on. You can't hurt such delicate hands.

299
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,568
No, you can eat. I'll do this.

300
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,309
- Give them to me. - Oh, that hurt!

301
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,039
Oh, what is it?

302
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,950
Did you get pricked?

303
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,890
What?

304
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,519
Dr. Yeo.

305
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:16,630
Dr. Yeo?

306
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,430
- Wake up, Dr. Yeo! - That's...

307
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,029
Blood...

308
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,098
Blood? Let's elevate your legs.

309
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:23,399
- Phobia... - Elevate your legs!

310
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,038
Hemophobia.

311
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,099
What?

312
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,069
- Hemo... - "Hemo?"

313
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:30,940
- Dr. Yeo, are you afraid of blood? - Yes.

314
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,740
You have hemophobia, right?

315
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,679
I'm used to these types of fear-based reactions.

316
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,119
Follow my words. Inhale on one.

317
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,518
And exhale on two.

318
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,549
One.

319
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,690
Two. Breathe out.

320
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,459
Sim General Hospital...

321
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,329
is a general hospital that provides various tailored care...

322
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,828
and encompasses all stages of life for your needs in the OBGYN clinic,

323
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,799
the spine and joint care center,

324
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,369
internal medicine, surgery, and more.

325
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,769
Don't move.

326
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,410
You have a myoma, and you need surgery.

327
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,749
What? Surgery?

328
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,549
Of course you should get surgery. What else? Will you let it grow?

329
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,048
If it gets any bigger, it might put pressure...

330
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,960
on the surrounding organs, leading to complications...

331
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,359
What? Complications?

332
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,029
Explain it to her.

333
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, Doctor.

334
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:27,799
Let's see the next patient.

335
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,470
I'll wipe you down.

336
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,920
After getting surgery, I'll need a guardian.

337
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,660
What should I do?

338
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:11,839
(Mom)

339
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,489
What is it? Make it quick.

340
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,990
Oh, Mom.

341
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,390
It's not a big deal,

342
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,730
but I have to get uterine myoma surgery.

343
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,900
I guess it's pretty big.

344
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,430
So it'll have to be an open-stomach surgery.

345
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,029
A myoma? When is the operation date?

346
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,539
I'm thinking April 3.

347
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,670
The third?

348
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:44,470
That won't work. I have an exhibition in Busan.

349
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,910
What dates don't overlap with your exhibitions?

350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,480
Let's see.

351
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:52,980
This month or next month won't work.

352
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,689
June would work. The second week of June...

353
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,959
No. Make it the third week.

354
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,160
That's when I have time.

355
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
June?

356
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,269
Mom. I have to get surgery.

357
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,568
Are you telling me to wait two months...

358
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:12,140
to get sick to fit your schedule?

359
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,940
Your surgery is your problem.

360
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,180
Do you want to make me the bad guy again?

361
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,680
I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.

362
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,559
Oh, gosh.

363
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,210
(Dad)

364
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:55,309
(March 13, 2024, March 21, 2024, March 26, 2024)

365
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,450
Dad.

366
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,019
I'm going to get...

367
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,460
uterine myoma surgery.

368
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,599
Thinking of being alone in my hospital room...

369
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,039
makes me scared.

370
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,250
Going to the operating room in the wheelchair alone scares me too.

371
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,519
And getting general anesthesia scares me too.

372
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,190
Do you think I'll be okay on my own?

373
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,700
I think...

374
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,470
I could be brave in times like this...

375
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,799
if you just held my hand.

376
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,210
Why were you in such a rush to leave me so early?

377
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,690
I miss you.

378
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:17,430
(I don't want anyone else to leave. I'm going to save everyone.)

379
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,858
She's a special patient, so please take good care of her.

380
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,598
She must be feeling quite nervous.

381
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,099
You've gotten complaints for being rude to patients.

382
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,139
Please take extra care this time.

383
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,240
Complaints?

384
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,669
Are we hotel staff? We're doctors.

385
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,008
Doctors are service workers too.

386
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,380
Being kind should be a given.

387
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,379
Please take the patient's personality...

388
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,720
and psychological state into consideration.

389
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,089
What else should I take into consideration?

390
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,989
Should I take into consideration her food preferences, looks,

391
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,490
and the fact that she has something going on with you?

392
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
Have I done something wrong?

393
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,098
You're just telling me to take extra care because you like her.

394
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,798
- What? - I didn't realize...

395
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,000
you started to like whiny, childish women.

396
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,739
She's an adult.

397
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,480
What is so scary about seeing a doctor in the hospital?

398
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,450
Give me her chart. I'll do it.

399
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,449
- Pardon? - As you said,

400
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,289
is it a problem for me to personally treat someone I like?

401
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,789
Why aren't you leaving?

402
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes?

403
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,848
Vice Director. Ms. Han So Jin is here.

404
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,118
Yes.

405
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,750
(OBGYN Sim Yeon Woo)

406
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,170
Doctor Choi Hyeon Joo was going to do my surgery.

407
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,539
This is the surgery I'm most confident about,

408
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,640
so let me do it, So Jin.

409
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:44,940
Oh, no.

410
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,450
Are you telling me you'll see everything inside of my stomach?

411
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:53,419
You scanned all of the DNA in my body.

412
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,779
That's even worse.

413
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,490
But still...

414
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,559
This is different.

415
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,960
You trust me, right?

416
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
Take a look.

417
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,449
This one is a bit big,

418
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,949
but let's do an MRI scan and get it done right away.

419
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,049
Then I'll have...

420
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,150
a scar from the surgery...

421
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,890
What's wrong with that?

422
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,589
If my girlfriend has a scar from surgery, I would just think,

423
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:39,799
"That must've been so painful and tough."

424
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,829
I'd just feel bad.

425
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:47,539
But...

426
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,039
I'm glad I have you.

427
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,979
You'll make the scar as faint as possible, right?

428
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,190
Of course. Don't worry.

429
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,259
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

430
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,528
It's not my birthday anymore.

431
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,000
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday!

432
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:17,929
- Let's drink. - Let's drink.

433
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,669
You guys are using my birthday as an excuse to drink, aren't you?

434
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,039
You're always so quick to catch on.

435
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:25,440
What did you do for your birthday yesterday?

436
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,910
Yes?

437
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,849
It's a bit loud here.

438
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,618
Hurry. Spill it.

439
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,789
(Han So Jin)

440
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,788
Yes, thank you.

441
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,160
I'll be in touch. Thank you.

442
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:44,359
Yes, Han So Jin. What is it?

443
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:47,529
Han So Jin?

444
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,599
The 3rd. Just 1 day.

445
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,700
Can you make some time for me?

446
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,599
The third? I have a photoshoot that day.

447
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,568
I can't cancel because it's an important shoot.

448
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,009
Why? What is it?

449
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,380
I have to get surgery, and I need a guardian.

450
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,249
It's a uterine myoma.

451
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,690
I have to get general anesthesia, and it needs to be open-stomach.

452
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,650
What?

453
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,759
It's not even cancer. It's just your everyday surgery.

454
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,858
You're saying the same thing as Mom.

455
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,230
I do have Yoo Myung Hee's genes, after all.

456
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,299
Do you know Professor Yoo Myung Hee?

457
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,839
I'm her daughter.

458
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,008
Not just socially. I'm her real daughter.

459
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:31,170
Han So Jin, Han So Ri.

460
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,309
They were sisters?

461
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,460
Did something bad happen?

462
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,230
I didn't mean to eavesdrop earlier.

463
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:52,759
It was my older sister.

464
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,599
Why did she get sick?

465
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,900
Why on the day that I can't go?

466
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,068
You seem quite upset. You two must be very close.

467
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,339
We're not close. She's practically a stranger.

468
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,109
A pitiful stranger.

469
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,880
She's so deprived of affection,

470
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,210
so she's always in other people's business.

471
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:13,149
She cares about other people's personal lives.

472
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,980
Hey!

473
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,118
My older sister...

474
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,019
can't throw anything away.

475
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,490
That fool...

476
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,089
couldn't even throw away a friend who stole money from her...

477
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:28,099
or the boyfriend who cheated on her.

478
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,470
She also can never throw away...

479
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,970
our family, who only says...

480
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,940
such mean things to her.

481
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,079
Isn't she such a fool?

482
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,578
So when will the surgery be?

483
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,450
- The 3rd. - The 3rd?

484
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:51,450
Okay. I'll be there from the day before, so don't worry.

485
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,189
A firefighter should be saving lives.

486
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,460
Why are you planning to sit around at the hospital?

487
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,029
You know your family is busy.

488
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:01,000
From now on, I'm your guardian, okay?

489
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,298
It's okay.

490
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,669
I don't want a guardian who is younger than me.

491
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,269
I'm taller than you, you know.

492
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,269
I'll stop by later. Okay.

493
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
You look like you're worried about a girlfriend.

494
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:15,180
She'll get healthier after surgery, so don't worry.

495
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,279
She's not as strong as you.

496
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,220
She can't even do ten squats.

497
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:23,019
When she got gallstone surgery before,

498
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,960
she needed an IV for a while because she could barely eat.

499
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,829
Anyway, I'm going to head out first.

500
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,430
I have a practice match before the tournament.

501
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,470
I'm a bit worried because my opponent is quite strong,

502
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:37,930
but someone said they'd come to cheer for me,

503
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,039
- so I need to power up. - Who?

504
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,170
Jung Tam?

505
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,079
- Go! - Go!

506
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Start.

507
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,209
- Let's go! - Let's go!

508
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:50,950
- You can do it! - Let's go!

509
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,449
Extend your arm!

510
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,078
There we go! Extend it!

511
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,389
(A goddess in the ring, Nam Sung Mi)

512
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,288
Open your eyes. How will you watch the actual tournament like that?

513
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:00,420
I can watch it. I'm just praying right now.

514
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,289
Sure, let's say so.

515
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,589
Hey! Put up your guard!

516
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,660
- Go! - Let's go!

517
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:08,970
- Go! - Knock her out!

518
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,700
Gosh. I guess a UFC fighter was too tough, even for Sung Mi.

519
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,339
She's getting hit too much.

520
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,509
- Sung Mi is getting hit? - Yes.

521
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,509
Put up your guard!

522
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,750
- Hey! - Oh, no!

523
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,619
Sung Mi!

524
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,920
- Get up, Sung Mi! - Get up!

525
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,890
Let's go, Nam Sung Mi!

526
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,430
Let's...

527
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,529
Let's go, Nam Sung Mi!

528
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,758
Get up, Nam Sung Mi! Get up!

529
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,299
Get up, Sung Mi!

530
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,969
- Get up! - Get up, Sung Mi!

531
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,598
There we go, Sung Mi!

532
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,239
- There we go! - There we go. Get up!

533
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,298
There we go!

534
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,598
You're amazing!

535
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,640
- Let's go, Sung Mi! - Let's go, Sung Mi!

536
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,410
Focus, Sung Mi.

537
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,079
Let's go, Sung Mi!

538
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,649
Let's stop now.

539
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,949
Don't get up, Sung Mi!

540
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:01,479
Let's stop now!

541
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,119
Sung Mi. Don't get up.

542
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,750
Sung Mi!

543
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,559
Doctor.

544
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,180
Doctor.

545
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,390
What happened to your pretty eyes?

546
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Doctor.

547
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,900
Doctor!

548
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,299
(Machundong Gym)

549
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,440
Are you okay?

550
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:56,069
Do you really have to do this?

551
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,509
Aren't you exercising to be healthy?

552
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,910
Why do you need to do something that makes you hurt and bleed?

553
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,949
Don't you care about those who worry about you?

554
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,719
Pardon?

555
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,590
Forget it.

556
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,359
It's not something I should say to someone who doesn't care...

557
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,429
how other people feel.

558
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:25,840
The ring...

559
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,010
is where you fight with your conviction.

560
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,079
I want you to understand my conviction.

561
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:36,348
Who would understand someone they like volunteering...

562
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:37,349
to get hurt? How?

563
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,179
Do you...

564
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:45,989
like me?

565
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,230
Yes, I like you.

566
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,860
Since I first saw you,

567
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,099
I've liked you.

568
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,439
During college, I fainted every time...

569
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,840
I saw blood in the anatomy room.

570
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:06,940
I faint...

571
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,579
every time I see blood,

572
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,619
so I can't even treat you.

573
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,789
But if you bleed so much...

574
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,219
I'm sorry.

575
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,289
You're too cute.

576
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,659
I couldn't help myself.

577
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,929
You're the cute one.

578
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,940
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

579
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,039
- I'm okay. - Really?

580
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,280
Oh, my.

581
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,190
- The kitchen is set. - Okay.

582
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,229
- Here is your sushi. - Hey.

583
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,030
Do you know that?

584
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,638
Couples who kiss a lot...

585
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,510
share approximately 8,000 germs during a single kiss.

586
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,549
And when their tongues...

587
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,409
go back and forth with each other, that number goes over a billion.

588
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,650
And those like-attracts-like germs attract each other even more.

589
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,320
With great force.

590
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,340
Kang Hoon. Why did you turn off the TV? We were watching that.

591
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,349
Your face is red.

592
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,419
No, it's not.

593
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,150
Is just watching the kiss on TV...

594
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,888
making your body pump adrenaline, dopamine,

595
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:01,420
and the happy hormones, serotonin and endorphins?

596
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,590
No.

597
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,760
Kang Hoon, can you... Hey.

598
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,940
It's So Jin.

599
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,380
When we insert contrast agents, your body could get warm.

600
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,750
If you feel nauseous or dizzy, please let us know right away.

601
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:34,659
So Jin.

602
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:38,760
So Jin.

603
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,630
Yeon Woo.

604
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,369
If you listen to music, the scan will be done soon.

605
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,570
And if you feel uncomfortable, just press this, okay?

606
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,639
I'll watch you from the video room with the radiologist,

607
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,079
so don't worry.

608
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,429
So dreamy.

609
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,199
Is this how it feels to be comforted by the healer gene?

610
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,569
Sim General Hospital...

611
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:22,269
is a general hospital that provides various tailored care...

612
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,739
and encompasses all stages of life for your needs in the OBGYN clinic,

613
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,149
the spine and joint care center,

614
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,579
internal medicine, surgery, and more.

615
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:50,130
Cherry blossoms fall at a speed...

616
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,469
of 5cm per second.

617
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,670
Don't they fall so slowly?

618
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:00,039
(Spring and Hope)

619
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,150
When you fall in love,

620
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,889
everything moves slowly.

621
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,889
Like how cherry blossoms fall.

622
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,158
You're here. I'm hungry.

623
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,929
I guess I'm not nervous anymore. Let's go eat.

624
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,030
That's the first thing you say to me?

625
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,769
Did the tests go well?

626
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:25,469
Yes. They were very healing.

627
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,139
How can tests be healing?

628
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:28,739
They can be.

629
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,440
So Jin. Kang Hoon.

630
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,579
Hello.

631
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,380
Mi Eun. Hello.

632
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,479
What a coincidence running into you two here.

633
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,249
Aren't we going? I thought you were hungry.

634
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,380
Right. We should go.

635
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,348
We'll get going first.

636
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,519
Okay. See you again.

637
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,760
Right. So Jin.

638
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,159
You said you were a genetics researcher, right?

639
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:53,659
I want to get tested as well.

640
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,900
I was told before that I had Meniere's syndrome.

641
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,670
I heard that was also genetic.

642
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,300
Oh, Meniere's?

643
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,570
Please come by sometime.

644
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,280
It's better to get tested before it's too late.

645
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,809
(Genetics Laboratory Manager Han So Jin)

646
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,010
I'll give you a call.

647
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:10,380
Let's go.

648
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,820
Wait. Yeon Woo.

649
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,530
You can't eat instant food for now. No more convenience store food.

650
00:40:28,699 --> 00:40:29,768
Okay.

651
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:32,500
Make sure to eat something nutritious for dinner.

652
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,139
Okay.

653
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,469
We'll get going, then

654
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,578
- Should we get some coffee? - Sure.

655
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,579
Okay?

656
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,250
- So Jin. Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

657
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,800
Make sure to eat something nutritious for dinner.

658
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,999
What are you doing? Are you going in or not?

659
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,099
No, I'm okay.

660
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,610
I can't eat instant food for the time being.

661
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,010
He said it was prohibited.

662
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,448
Slippers.

663
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:17,449
(Packing list for surgery)

664
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,718
I should take some extra clothes.

665
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:22,050
(Skincare products, charger, power strip, wet tissues)

666
00:41:22,449 --> 00:41:26,420
(Incoming call, Sim General Hospital's Sim Yeon Woo)

667
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,559
(Call)

668
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,260
Are you working late again today?

669
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,960
No, I'm outside.

670
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,239
Are you with Mi Eun?

671
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,340
As if I'd be with her.

672
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,909
What were you doing?

673
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,980
I'm on my way home.

674
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,179
Are you preparing well for the surgery?

675
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,849
It's going all right.

676
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,679
So Jin. Can you go somewhere with me?

677
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,590
Right now?

678
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,420
Where are you?

679
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:01,690
I think I need to see you today.

680
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:02,889
I have something for you.

681
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,730
- Hey. - Hello.

682
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:14,000
Why did you suddenly want to come here?

683
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,510
You said...

684
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,639
we all need space to breathe sometimes.

685
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:23,110
I plan to come here sometimes for some healing.

686
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,779
It's a pretty cost-effective healing spot, isn't it?

687
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,849
Yes.

688
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,619
But right now,

689
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,960
I think you need it more.

690
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,429
Patients...

691
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:41,260
tend to get quite weak before surgery.

692
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,429
It's unknown to them, so they feel anxious...

693
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,340
and need someone to lean on.

694
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,579
You're not alone, So Jin.

695
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,679
Before the surgery,

696
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,010
on the way to the operating room,

697
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,679
and in the operating room,

698
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,789
I'll be by your side.

699
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,860
- Oh, I got you this. - What's that?

700
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,570
This is cinnamon tea.

701
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,469
I got it from a famous place.

702
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:23,109
Cinnamon boosts blood circulation...

703
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,738
and warms you up,

704
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,808
and it also reduces inflammation.

705
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:31,210
You must drink it all. Don't leave a single drop, okay?

706
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,678
- I will. - And this.

707
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,750
Read it when you feel bored.

708
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,420
And these. To keep your stomach warm post-surgery.

709
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:43,859
- Stick them on your clothes. - Thanks.

710
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,129
A power strip.

711
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:47,629
With an extra long cord. You'll be on your phone all night.

712
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,828
And these. Organic slippers.

713
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:51,569
It's not just any kind of silicone.

714
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,699
This bear's smile. It looks pretty unusual.

715
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,539
Slippers.

716
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,579
We must be telepathic.

717
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,380
How come you brought everything I needed?

718
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,320
You're better than my own family.

719
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:14,559
They don't even care if I'm having an operation.

720
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,059
They may seem so,

721
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:20,158
but I'm sure they're all worried.

722
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,699
I don't think so. Not my family.

723
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,500
They're all so very odd.

724
00:44:28,539 --> 00:44:32,710
Your family might be different.

725
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,079
Now that I think about it,

726
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,449
I never heard you talk about your family.

727
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:44,920
It gets pretty cold at night.

728
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:46,820
Shall we get going?

729
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
Okay.

730
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,900
Don't worry too much about the surgery.

731
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:01,570
Let's get through it well.

732
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,190
Sorry. We're closing for the day.

733
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,059
I won't stay long.

734
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,969
Can I have a sake?

735
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,650
Do you usually close on your own?

736
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,920
Sometimes my father stays until closing.

737
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:50,989
I see.

738
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:55,888
You have a full-time job,

739
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:58,090
and you help your father when you're free.

740
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,360
You live and work pretty hard, Mr. Seo.

741
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:06,139
That's what everyone does.

742
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,539
Can I ask you something?

743
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,179
What is Ms. Han So Jin like?

744
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,849
Why do you ask?

745
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,250
I got curious.

746
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,619
She's a good person.

747
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,159
Is that it?

748
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:33,829
What answer were you hoping for?

749
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:37,000
Everything.

750
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,400
Everything about So Jin.

751
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:46,579
She often acts like a fool.

752
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:49,710
She cares too much for others...

753
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,150
and gets taken advantage of.

754
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,079
But she's sweet and kindhearted.

755
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,789
So I want to protect her even more.

756
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,730
Sorry for disturbing your closing routine.

757
00:47:11,269 --> 00:47:13,869
- How much do I owe you? - It's on me. Goodnight.

758
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,139
Thank you.

759
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,210
Oh, right.

760
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:27,079
"You love not just with your heart but with your limbs too."

761
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,289
"It's not beautiful to just cherish it in your heart."

762
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,618
What does that mean?

763
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,989
It means you won't get anywhere by sitting down and waiting.

764
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,800
The quotes are from the third chapter of my book.

765
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,929
You said you didn't need a copy.

766
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,800
Call me anytime if you think you do need one.

767
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:02,619
So Jin. These are white kimchi and perilla leaves.

768
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,949
Okay.

769
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,389
So Jin.

770
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:08,920
I'll put the shine muscat grapes and strawberries on the fruit shelf.

771
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,960
Eat them after you pass gas.

772
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,389
Okay.

773
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:15,860
Don't you have to go to work?

774
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,329
I'm off today.

775
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:19,000
I'll spend the night here.

776
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,469
Don't you get an enema today before tomorrow's surgery?

777
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,010
An enema?

778
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:27,138
Why would you worry about that?

779
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:28,440
When is it? Where's the medicine?

780
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,979
Can't you go outside for a while?

781
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,050
I'm not going anywhere.

782
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,449
Is this high enough?

783
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,820
Oh, I need you to do something.

784
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:38,788
- What? - Tie my hair for me.

785
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,618
- What? - I'll be lying flat,

786
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,489
so my hair must be tied up here.

787
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,928
Your hands work just fine. Tie your own hair.

788
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:49,059
I would, but because of the drip, it hurts too much if I lift my arm.

789
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,730
Come on. Tie it up.

790
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,869
This is my first time.

791
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,039
- Make me look pretty. - I can't guarantee the outcome.

792
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,439
How do I tie it? Where?

793
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,038
- Grab the top half. - The top half?

794
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,948
- Like this? - Yes. Hold it up at the back.

795
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:06,209
- The top half of my hair. - It's my first time. It might flop.

796
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,849
- Okay, grab some hair. - Like this?

797
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,690
There. That looks awesome.

798
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:13,619
Kang Hoon's your guardian?

799
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,619
- Hey. - Yeon Woo.

800
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,059
Take good care of her for me.

801
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,428
I found a good carer who will come and help.

802
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,499
No, it's fine. I'll look after her.

803
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,669
You have to work.

804
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,139
I told So Ri to cancel her plans and come.

805
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:30,339
We'll take turns staying.

806
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,569
So Ri's coming?

807
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,079
Who is So Ri?

808
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,138
My younger sister.

809
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,209
Your sister, a real legal guardian.

810
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,710
How long will you stick around?

811
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:42,479
You have to stay until I'm wheeled into surgery.

812
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,590
- Promise. - Isn't that a given?

813
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,558
Yeon Woo, she'll take a short walk before the enema.

814
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,419
- Okay. - Hey, you...

815
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,488
If you'll keep saying that word, get lost.

816
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,159
Why do you keep asking your guardian to leave?

817
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,730
I'll go, then.

818
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,400
- Okay. - Bye.

819
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,170
You did a great job tying your hair.

820
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,179
- Why do you keep saying that? - Why not?

821
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,138
There are some words you just can't say.

822
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,380
- What? It's just... - It's so embarrassing.

823
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:15,119
These plants have vibrant stripes.

824
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,320
Would you like to see this side?

825
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,920
This is where we keep the more unique plants.

826
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:26,130
This plant here cleans the air.

827
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,730
This is called a grass tree.

828
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:32,098
It's an odd plant...

829
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,969
that blooms when there's a fire.

830
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,969
I like it.

831
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,409
Okay. Will you take it yourself?

832
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:46,010
I'll give you my address. Have it delivered to me.

833
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:48,119
I will.

834
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,218
If you tell us your address and the delivery date you prefer,

835
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,590
I'll schedule it for you.

836
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:56,729
- Good job, Father. - Thank you all.

837
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:58,229
- Well done. - Great job.

838
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,729
Haven't we gotten better?

839
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,359
You have gotten much better.

840
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,098
- Thanks. - We did great today.

841
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,428
- I was surprised. - Me too.

842
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,729
- You're the best. - I look forward to next week.

843
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,000
We owe it to our handsome Father.

844
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,300
Don't!

845
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:38,730
Stop it!

846
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,539
Don't!

847
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,939
Stop it!

848
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,269
No!

849
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,510
Don't!

850
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,920
Don't come in. Leave me alone.

851
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,389
- Don't come in! - Sister Anna.

852
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,760
Sister Anna.

853
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,230
Sister Anna. Why are you in there?

854
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,539
Father.

855
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,610
Why are you...

856
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,408
I wanted to thank you for the minari gimbap.

857
00:52:56,409 --> 00:52:58,780
I looked for you and ended up here.

858
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
Come on out.

859
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,349
I can't.

860
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,190
I can't go outside.

861
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,130
I shouldn't be outside.

862
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:17,929
Then don't come outside.

863
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,570
I'll come to where you are.

864
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,389
Hey, Sung Mi.

865
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,400
There's a fire. Fourth-floor office by Younghwa Market's entrance.

866
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,698
The buildings are too close, and the fire's about to spread.

867
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:27,899
We need you here.

868
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,699
Okay. I'll be right there.

869
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,829
So Ri.

870
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:52,690
You must come.

871
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,429
Come and see your sister before the surgery, okay?

872
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:01,869
(Han So Jin, 31F, Gynecology, Doctor: Sim Yeon Woo)

873
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:14,679
So Jin, I'm really sorry.

874
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,179
I was called to an emergency.

875
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:19,049
I'll be there when you wake up from anesthesia. Don't worry.

876
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,989
Be who you are. Strong.

877
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,929
- Ms. Han So Jin? - Yes.

878
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,199
Shall we go?

879
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,699
Where's your guardian?

880
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,599
I don't have one.

881
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,190
(Operating Room, Restricted Area)

882
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:06,099
(Operating Room, Restricted Area)

883
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,939
Han So Jin. State your date of birth.

884
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,179
October 5, 1992.

885
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,480
The doctor doing my surgery is Sim Yeon Woo.

886
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,118
He's helping...

887
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,488
a car accident victim give birth.

888
00:56:23,489 --> 00:56:25,518
I'll ask how things are going. Please wait.

889
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,019
Check oxygen saturation.

890
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,499
The patient is bleeding internally and has placenta previa.

891
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,969
It will take a while.

892
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,638
If you wait a bit...

893
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,908
I can't wait. I have another surgery scheduled.

894
00:56:45,909 --> 00:56:48,609
Call Dr. Sim's OR and say I'll begin.

895
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,909
Get the consent form.

896
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,448
When the scheduled doctor can't operate,

897
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,219
another doctor can take over.

898
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:58,989
Ms. Han. Sign the form.

899
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,599
(Han So Jin)

900
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,328
Anesthetize her.

901
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:12,530
Anesthetic going in.

902
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,340
You're not alone, So Jin.

903
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:24,909
Before the surgery,

904
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,019
on the way to the operating room,

905
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,679
and in the operating room,

906
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,849
I'll be by your side.

907
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:38,190
I'm confident. Are you confident too, So Jin?

908
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:43,769
I must be hearing things now.

909
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:51,869
Let's begin.

910
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,710
I'm late. I'm sorry about that.

911
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,780
Yeon Woo.

912
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,780
I'll put you under. Don't worry.

913
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,050
Where do you want to visit the most?

914
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,019
Where I want to visit?

915
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,530
Think of the happiest time in your life.

916
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,869
I don't have such a thing.

917
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,409
Then imagine a time you'd love to cherish.

918
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:27,610
I don't have one.

919
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,429
So Jin.

920
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:29,969
DNA is destiny you can't escape.

921
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,809
Everything was meant to be.

922
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,820
You were wrong, Dad.

923
00:59:47,659 --> 00:59:49,659
You shouldn't have died.

924
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:54,699
Happy times were in our future too.

925
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:03,400
If the surgery went well, why can't she wake up?

926
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:05,409
Ms. Han.

927
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:08,638
You must sit up, cough up some phlegm, and walk.

928
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,079
Your lungs might shut down.

929
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,349
I'll finish my round and come back.

930
01:00:13,449 --> 01:00:15,750
Check on her. Try to wake her up,

931
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,090
and make her sit up if possible.

932
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,820
I'll be going.

933
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,860
Han So Jin. Wake up.

934
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,860
Hey.

935
01:00:33,969 --> 01:00:35,300
Kang Hoon.

936
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,670
I have a shoot scheduled, and I need to go.

937
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:43,138
So Jin seemed to come around in recovery,

938
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,780
but she can't wake up now.

939
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:48,320
- Okay. - I'll get a carer before I go.

940
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,780
No, I'll be right there.

941
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,159
Why won't the fever come down?

942
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,699
It's a bit too high.

943
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,960
The reason Mom...

944
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:33,260
didn't put her hand on my forehead whenever I was ill...

945
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,630
was because of something called "inframince."

946
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,230
Even if she put her hand on me,

947
01:01:40,769 --> 01:01:43,400
because of the thin barrier between the heat and cold,

948
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:45,739
nothing would change, she said.

949
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,099
But...

950
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,699
Are you okay?

951
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,869
The cold from him...

952
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,630
connected to the heat in me.

953
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,408
Sim General Hospital...

954
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:28,280
is a general hospital that provides various tailored care...

955
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,718
and encompasses all stages of life for your needs in the OBGYN clinic,

956
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,889
the spine and joint care center,

957
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,759
internal medicine, surgery, and more.

958
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,889
Okay.

959
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,800
It feels like it'll come out.

960
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,050
You seem to be just fine.

961
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:08,519
I think you can eat now. Shall we start with porridge?

962
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,199
Your fever's gone.

963
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,839
And the gas made an exit. It's good.

964
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,968
What kind of doctor spends so much time with a patient?

965
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,880
That's my job, and you're a special patient.

966
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,039
I'm done for.

967
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:33,480
I'm always embarrassing myself in front of the guy I like.

968
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,050
It's fine. I think it's cute.

969
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:39,948
Plus, it's a good sign that means you're getting better.

970
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,159
- It's a good thing. - Whatever.

971
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:46,159
Is that the kind of man you think I am?

972
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,598
The kind that would be disgusted...

973
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,099
because his crush was like this?

974
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,300
No, I didn't think of you like that, but...

975
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,768
But this is a bit... I don't know.

976
01:03:58,769 --> 01:04:00,039
I bet you don't know...

977
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:03,539
how worried I was...

978
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,510
that I'd miss your surgery.

979
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:11,150
Just how desperate I felt as I ran over.

980
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,689
That's why I'm overjoyed...

981
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,590
just to see you awake.

982
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,130
So don't worry about all that...

983
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,199
Was I possessed by something?

984
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,809
Or was my mind still foggy with the anesthetic?

985
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,739
I didn't know why,

986
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,179
but I just wanted to do it.

987
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,750
As my heart dictated.

988
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:03,159
(DNA Lover)

989
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,868
When you fall for someone,

990
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:06,529
timing becomes cruel.

991
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,538
Your going home present.

992
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:08,939
Was it a present from Yeon Woo?

993
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:11,570
Yeon Woo likes that brand.

994
01:06:11,739 --> 01:06:14,840
How does it feel to care for just one person?

995
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,909
Who said I care for just one person?

996
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,079
- Who was that? - We never met.

997
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,678
It can't be remodeled,

998
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,579
but it can be improved.

999
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:25,549
Did it get in your eyes?

1000
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,260
Yeon Woo's swimming like a little boy.

1001
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,690
I came to give Yeon Woo some abalone.

1002
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:32,489
See you again soon.

1003
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:35,259
- Mi Eun, I have to go. - Yeon Woo.

1004
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:37,529
If I start to like you now,

1005
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:38,929
would that be the worst timing?
