- Why are you sick?
- What a fool.

- You're hurting me.
- What a fool.

12
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,879
Kang Hoon is upset.

Let's try getting up. Slowly.

Gosh, seriously.

18
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,859
You have acute pancreatitis.

19
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,149
What did he feed you?

20
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,259
Yeon Woo did nothing wrong.

21
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,599
I should've been careful.

22
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,819
How could you say that now?

23
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,559
Just drink this so you recover quickly.

24
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:44,159
When I had pancreatitis, barley tea helped more than plum juice.

25
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:48,799
I'm not the same as you. I'll drink it.

26
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:51,989
Are you okay?

27
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,799
Yeon Woo, how did you find me here?

28
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,809
He called your phone. So, I told him.

29
00:01:56,809 --> 00:02:00,919
Hyung, what did you feed her that she got pancreatitis?

30
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:04,079
I didn't know you were so severely lactose intolerant. I'm so sorry.

31
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,109
I said it's not his fault.

32
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,889
She can't digest fatty food or heavy cream well.

33
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,669
Heavy cream?

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,309
But why are you okay with the convenience store sauce?

35
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:23,549
I think I was nervous because I had never eaten at your place before.

36
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:32,479
- Ms. Han So Jin?
- Yes.

37
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:37,559
For pancreatitis, you can take antibiotics, get medicine, and leave.

38
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:41,399
But we found something strange.

39
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:46,819
Something is sticking out on the left bottom abdomen.

40
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,209
Pardon?

41
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:51,899
Lie down for a moment.

42
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:53,219
Okay.

43
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:54,779
Slowly.

44
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,489
Excuse me.

45
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,659
Let me press down.

46
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,709
Does it feel okay?

47
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,059
It doesn't hurt.

48
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:16,729
Could you wait outside for a moment?

49
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,019
Hyung, let's go.

50
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:19,929
May I check the ultrasound with you?

51
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:24,569
There were similar cases of fibroid or cervical cancer.

52
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:26,649
- Cancer?
- Right,

53
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:30,309
I have a BRCA gene.

54
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:34,029
It means it's not unusual for me to develop conditions like this.

55
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,349
It happened sooner than I expected, but-

56
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,279
Are you serious right now?

57
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,999
How could you say that without even flinching?

58
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:47,629
So Jin, you don't mind me checking the ultrasound, right?

59
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,599
That'd be okay, right?

60
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,749
No, you can't. You can never.

61
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,419
Both of you, please leave.

62
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,859
I'm sorry. This is important to me, too.

63
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,099
Let me check it myself.

[Waiting Room]

65
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,999
Hyung, how's Noona?

66
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,669
I'd need to have a thorough checkup,

67
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,489
but I think it's a fibroid.

68
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,429
Doesn't she need surgery, then?

69
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:41,739
She'll need surgery once the location and size are confirmed.

70
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,869
How could she not have known?

71
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:50,169
It means she's been in pain at times, right?

72
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,309
I'll take care of it. Don't worry so much.

73
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,119
By the way, Kang Hoon,

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,409
what are you to So Jin?

75
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,599
<i>Kang Hoon, please come pick me up.</i>

76
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,979
<i>I think I'm dying right now.</i>

77
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,089
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

78
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,389
<i>Think about it.</i>

79
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,139
She wanted you when she was in danger and felt desperate.

80
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:21,549
There's someone you want to share pain and hardship with.

81
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:24,619
And there's someone you only want to share pretty and nice things.

82
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:27,029
That's it. Don't worry about it.

83
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:35,309
Are you okay with that? If she only wants you when she's sick?

84
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:39,079
I'm okay.

85
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:45,279
If she wants me at any moment, I'll run to her like I just did.

86
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,919
Thanks, Hyung.

87
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,889

88
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:08,939

89
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,209

90
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,039

<i>Sorry, I'll check the ultrasound myself.</i>

93
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:26,759
I tried to share the gut bacteria. What is all this now?

94
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,509
Here.

95
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,919
So Jin only eats my porridge when she's sick.

96
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,669
Feed it to her if she refuses to eat it.

97
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:41,199
You think she's a baby?

98
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,089
She'd like it. See you.

99
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,359
- I'll go now.
- Okay.

100
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,389
Geez.

101
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,029
It's better to starve before you stop having diarrhea.

102
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,119
This is like a torture.

103
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,149
I don't think my stomach is hurting anymore.

104
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:10,029
Can't I just eat?

105
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:15,489
Pancreatitis doesn't go away with an antibiotic shot.

106
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:24,069
I'm really not in pain.

<i>When I had pancreatitis, barley tea helped more than plum juice.</i>

108
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:33,219
It really doesn't hurt.

109
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,849
Is it because of the barley tea?

110
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:38,249
It's Kang Hoon.

111
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:42,649
Dad made this for you.

112
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,759
Stop picking at it and eat more.

113
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,939
Here. Say ah.

114
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,119
That's your bite size.

115
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,279
Just eat it. Open your mouth wide.

116
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,589
Here. Say ah.

117
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,709
It's too bland. I need soy sauce.

118
00:08:04,709 --> 00:08:06,379
Porridge is supposed to be bland.

119
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,419
It's way too bland, okay?

120
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:11,049
It's not bland at all.

121
00:08:11,049 --> 00:08:13,379
Hold on!

122
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,709
Sharing a spoon is basically an indirect kiss.

123
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,289
Because you share the matching allogeneic bacteria in the saliva.

124
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:24,709
Indirect kiss?

125
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,359
Bacteria?

126
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,149
Ew...

127
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,899
We've shared a spoon countless times.

128
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,179
This isn't right.

129
00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:38,699
Geez...

130
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:41,039
What are you doing?

131
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,169
Are you giving up on creating

132
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,749
matching bacteria by sharing the same food with the Sewer?

133
00:08:47,749 --> 00:08:49,529
Yes.

134
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,259
I don't think that's happening anymore.

135
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:57,259
I'm leaving. Return the thermal bottle later.

136
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:00,519
Your dad is always doing me a favor. Thank him for me.

137
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,439
Just go to your appointment with Yeon Woo. Don't be shy about it.

138
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:08,109
You need the best surgeon for your operation.

139
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:12,609
- At least Yeon Woo is a trustworthy doctor.
- Geez.

140
00:09:12,609 --> 00:09:14,679
I'll let someone else perform the surgery.

141
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,699
I can't let him do that, too.

142
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:20,389
I'll check later, okay?

143
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:22,029
I'm leaving.

144
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:31,889
Ah Ri, can we give Ahjussi two bunches of water celery?

145
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,939
Go ahead. I can get it easily because I have their contact.

146
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,979
Thank you. Put it down. You'll get pancreatitis.

147
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,359
Kang Hoon, wait just a moment!

148
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,299
Don't run!

149
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,269
You'll fall. Be careful.

150
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,539
Hey, are you okay? Is your back okay?

151
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,719
I told you not to run.

152
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:17,599
Get up if you're okay.

153
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,639
Yes, right.

154
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,479
T-This is still fine, though.

155
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,429
Give this to your dad.

156
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:34,749
It's probably organic because Ah Ri bought it.

157
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,189
Okay, thank you.

158
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,799
I-I'm leaving.

159
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,769
Okay, bye.

160
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,239
Bye? Okay.

161
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,559
- Father,
- Yeah?

162
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,179
So Jin asked me to give you this.

163
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:05,549
It's water celery.

164
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:11,379
- Kang Hoon, what's wrong?
- What?

165
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,479
Why is your face so red?

166
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,549
- Are you having a fever?
- No.

167
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,049
No, no, no!

168
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,399
Father, I'll...

169
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,069
I'll go get some fresh air.

170
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:25,609
Huh? Kang Hoon. Kang Hoon!

171
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,649
Our lips just happened to hit each other.

172
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:42,909
Yes.

173
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:46,849
It's not such a big deal.

174
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,619
Shit. Run.

175
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:00,489
Run for now. Run for now.

176
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,419
Run, run, run!

177
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,459
He's really out of it.

178
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:27,269
Why is he running in the middle of the night?

179
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:40,659
You always cry here alone, huh?

180
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,389
I saw everything.

181
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:43,819
Go away!

182
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,099
Go away!

183
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,849
I'll go if you tell me why, kid.

184
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:51,159
I'm not a kid!

185
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:54,609
I have a name. It's Seo Kang Hoon!

186
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:58,919
Kang Hoon? So, why do you always cry?

187
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:04,599
My mom keeps asking me who I am.

188
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,519
She says she doesn't know my name.

189
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:12,339
Is your mom sick?

190
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:15,489
I don't know.

191
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:17,749
All she does is sleep.

192
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:24,209
From now on, I'll call your name a lot in your mom's place. Happy?

193
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:27,249
You're not my mom!

194
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,459
Kang Hoon.

195
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,169
Don't call me!

196
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:33,719
Kang Hoon. Seo Kang Hoon.

197
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:36,299
Seo Kang Hoon.

198
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:56,449
Yes, she's Noona.

199
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:59,919
She's just Noona.

200
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:27,779
I...

201
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:31,299
like Noona?

202
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:40,309
<i>I sent a purse as a gift.</i>

203
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,629
<i>It matches with mine.</i>

204
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:48,649
Really? Wow, you're the best.

205
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,479
<i>Are you drinking alone on your birthday?</i>

206
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:56,229
Yes. I have no one to spend my birthday with.

207
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,339
<i>I'm coming over now. Wait for me.</i>

208
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,659
It's okay, Mom. I'm fine.

209
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:08,039
To be honest, there was one person I wanted to spend the day with.

210
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,849
<i>One person?</i>

211
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,949
It's Yeon Woo.

212
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,939
Thinking about it, when we were dating,

213
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,839
we spent half of our time together traveling for fun.

214
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,089
But we didn't take photos of just the two of us.

215
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,859
<i>Really?</i>

216
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:33,319
A friend in Belgium sent this photo to me two years ago.

217
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,289
I've been keeping it tucked away,

218
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:39,099
and I'm looking at it now while drinking.

219
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,059
I feel...

220
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,069
kind of sad, Mom.

221
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:49,789
Because this is the only photo of us together.

222
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,489
<i>Mi Eun, do you love him?</i>

223
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:00,189
Yes. Of course, I love him.

224
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,439
There are many people I love...

225
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,919
and one of them is Yeon Woo.

226
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:12,019
I just wanted to eat something tasty with him and talk about the old days.

227
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:13,859
<i>Well, I'm sorry.</i>

228
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,069
<i>I'm having dinner with So Jin at home tonight.</i>

229
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:18,839
<i>I'll just have a tea and leave, then.</i>

230
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,969
<i>I'm sorry. I'm cooking right now.</i>

231
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,849
<i>I want to just focus on that.</i>

232
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,759
<i>Okay, then.</i>

233
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,299
<i>Here, drink this.</i>

234
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,579
<i>Get home safely. I'm sorry.</i>

235
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,939
<i>But I got rejected at his doorway.</i>

236
00:16:34,349 --> 00:16:37,509
To be honest, I feel so embarrassed and small right now,

237
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:41,189
but I'm talking about him again.

238
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:54,139
- Mom.
<i>- Yes.</i>

239
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,669
I know I can't...

240
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,869
but I want...

241
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,929
that man.

242
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,709
<i>That's my girl.</i>

243
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:20,989
<i>You decide when to take or leave.</i>

244
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:40,049
W-What do you think? Doesn't this place look good?

245
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,429
Yes.

246
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,749
Well, yes.

247
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,979
Did you even ask the Coach if I like blue crab?

248
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:54,269
Their blue crabs are as meaty as snow crabs.

249
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,109
But they aren't as big. So you need a bit of skill.

250
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,569
Let me remove the meat for you.

251
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,029
Gosh.

252
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:04,429
Are you okay? Let me do it.

253
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:06,149
No, no.

254
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,119
I'm known for my dexterity.

255
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:20,679
I'm not dexterous at all.

256
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,779
You have very pretty hands.

257
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:25,329
Thank you.

258
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,279
You can't hurt hands like yours.

259
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,619
It's okay. Just eat. I'll do it.

260
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:32,769
- Give it to me.
- Ouch!

261
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,709
What's wrong?

262
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,629
Did it poke you?

263
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:47,749
Dr. Yeo! Dr. Yeo?

264
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,959
Dr. Yeo! Dr. Yeo?

265
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,689
Wake up, Dr. Yeo!

266
00:18:51,689 --> 00:18:53,749
Blood...

267
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:55,759
- Blood? Put your legs up!
- Phobia...

268
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,059
- Put your legs up!
- Hemophobia...

269
00:18:58,059 --> 00:18:59,259
Pardon?

270
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,349
- Hemo...
- Hemo?

271
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,159
Dr. Yeo, are you afraid of blood?

272
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,829
- Yes.
- You have hemophobia, right?

273
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,659
I'm used to handling fear.

274
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:11,289
Follow my lead. Breathe in when I say "one."

275
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,499
And breathe out when I say, "two."

276
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:17,039
One. Two. Breathe.

277
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,769
<i>Shim Hospital provides various custom care in</i>

278
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,949
gynecology, rheumatology, internal medicine, and surgery.

279
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:31,299
<i>We're a general hospital that provides care throughout your life.</i>

280
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:34,689
You can't move.

281
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,649
You have a fibroid. You need surgery.

282
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,739
Pardon? S-Surgery?

283
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:47,749
You need surgery. What will you do? Let it grow?

284
00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:51,559
If it grows more, it could push other organs and cause complications-

285
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,039
Pardon? C-Complications?

286
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:57,409
Explain it to her.

287
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,589
Okay, I will.

288
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,479
I'll see the next patient.

289
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,139
I'll wipe that off for you.

290
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:26,359
I need a guardian after the surgery.

291
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,259
What should I do?

292
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,959
[Mom]

293
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,499
<i>What? Keep it short.</i>

294
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,389
Yes, Mom.

295
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,479
It's not a big deal...

296
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,049
I apparently need fibroid surgery.

297
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:04,999
I suppose it's kind of big.

298
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,609
So, it will be an open surgery.

299
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,769
<i>Fibroid? When is the surgery?</i>

300
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,649
I'm thinking April 3rd.

301
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:15,319
<i>Third?</i>

302
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,709
<i>You can't. I have a show in Busan.</i>

303
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,129
When do you not have a show, then?

304
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:22,779
Let's see.

305
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:26,209
Not this month or the next month.

306
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:29,599
I think June would work. The second week of June...

307
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,959
No, schedule it for the third week.

308
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,989
I'd be free then.

309
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,289
June?

310
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:42,289
Mom, I said I need surgery.

311
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:45,789
You want me to get sick two months later to work with your schedule?

312
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,579
<i>It's your surgery and your business.</i>

313
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:52,809
<i>Would you feel better if you made me the villain again?</i>

314
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:56,599
<i>I'm busy right now. Let's talk later.</i>

315
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,499
[Dad]

316
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:36,969
Dad,

317
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:44,389
I'll be having a fibroid surgery.

318
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,269
Thinking about being alone in the hospital room

319
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:54,639
scares me.

320
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,179
I'm scared to go to the OR alone in a wheelchair

321
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:07,289
and I'm so scared to be put under anesthesia, too.

322
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:11,059
Would I be able to handle it alone?

323
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,249
If you...

324
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,089
held my hand just once, Dad,

325
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:26,769
I don't think I'd feel scared.

326
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:33,029
Why did you have to leave in such a hurry?

327
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:43,439
I miss you.

328
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,859
She's a special patient. Please take extra care.

329
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:26,549
She must be feeling very anxious.

330
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:30,289
You've received complaints for being unfriendly, Dr. Choi.

331
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:32,129
Please take extra care this time.

332
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:33,879
Complaints?

333
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:37,639
What are we, hotel workers? We're doctors.

334
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:41,299
Doctors are in the service industry, too. Being friendly is necessary.

335
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:45,609
Consider the patient's personality and emotional state.

336
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,589
What else should I consider?

337
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,999
Her diet, looks,

338
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,409
and if she's flirting with you or not, too?

339
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,849
Did I do something wrong?

340
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,119
You're telling me to take extra care because you like her.

341
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,889
What?

342
00:25:03,889 --> 00:25:07,619
I didn't know you like a whiny and childish type now.

343
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:12,459
She's an adult. Why is she so afraid to be examined at a hospital?

344
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:17,299
Give me her medical record.

345
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,129
- I'll take over.
- Pardon?

346
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:23,739
As you said, is it a problem to treat someone I like?

347
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:27,519
What are you doing? Leave.

348
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,759
Yes.

349
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,859
Assistant Director, Ms. Han So Jin is here.

350
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,689
Okay.

351
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,989
Dr. Choi was supposed to be my surgeon.

352
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:14,829
This surgery is my specialty.

353
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:17,369
Allow me to do it, So Jin.

354
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:22,479
Are you telling me to show you inside my stomach?

355
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:26,379
You scanned all the DNA in my body.

356
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,489
That's more extreme.

357
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,779
But still,

358
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,499
this isn't the same.

359
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,589
You trust me, right?

360
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,819

Okay. See you later.

00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,930
Right, So Jin. You said you were a DNA researcher, right?

545
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,980
I'd like to be tested sometime.

546
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,760
I've been told I had Meniere's disease.

Yes. But I thought you needed it right now.

588
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,060
Patients often get weak emotionally before surgery.

589
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,290
Things are unpredictable and unstable.

590
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,850

00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,360
This is cinnamon tea. I got it from a very famous place.

597
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,270
Cinnamon promotes blood circulation and warms your body.

598
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,380
And it's an effective anti-inflammatory food.

599
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,650
So, you need to drink every drop of it, okay?

600
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,230
- I will.
- And this.

601

Read it when you're bored in the ward.

602

but they must be worrying about you.

Probably not.

00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:58,910
My family is very unusual.

She's a good person.

639
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,540
Is that all?

Everything about So Jin.

643
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,310
She can often be foolish.

644
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:25,540
Since she's too affectionate, she gets taken advantage of often,

645
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:29,580
but she's a kind and tender person.

646
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:34,090
That's why I want to protect her more.

713
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,440
this one is called a grass tree.

714
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,550
It's a special plant that flowers after a fire.

715
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,660
I like this one.

716
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,750
Okay. Would you like to take it with you?

717

- Thank you.

722

We improved a lot today, right?

723
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,260
You really improved a lot.

I wanted to thank you for the water celery kimbap.

I'll join you by your side.

Yes, Sunbae.

745
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,270
There's a fire in the fourth-floor office of the building near Yeonghwa Market.

746
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:59,440
It's about to become a major fire because the buildings are so close together.

747
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,190
You have to come here now.

748

By the way, my surgeon is Dr. Shim Yeon Woo.

765

Dr. Shim is helping a pregnant car accident victim deliver right now.

766

Please check the blood oxygen saturation.

If you wait a bit...

771

I can't wait because of my next operation.

772
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:21,089
Let's call Dr. Shim's OR and get started immediately.

Bring the consent form.

774

Another doctor can operate when the attending surgeon can't.

You said the surgery went well. Why can't she wake up?

801
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:41,319
Ms. Han, you need to wake up, spit phlegm, and move around.

802
00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:43,369
Your lungs need to expand.

Take good care of her. Keep waking her up.

Why won't her fever go down?

815
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:35,139
Her fever is too high.

01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:41,788
I think you could eat. Should we start with porridge?

831
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:51,658
Your fever went down...

832
01:02:51,658 --> 01:02:54,308
and you released gas, too. It's nice.

Come on, I think it's cute.

838

A man who'd stop liking a woman because of that?

No, it's not like that, but...

843
