1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,962
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:07,986 --> 00:00:08,693
(This drama is fictional.)

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:09,344
(All information related to DNA testing is fictitious.)

4
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:10,160
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

5
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:10,978
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,231
Love...

7
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,030
is a waste.

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,640
No, it was like a waste.

9
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,210
No.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,911
I mean dating, not love.

11
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:28,510
The break-up,

12
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,080
the regrets, and lingering feelings.

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,450
What causes problems always comes after love.

14
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,691
Love is blameless.

15
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:45,160
(Psychopathic gene?)

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,600
(Dying gene)

17
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,671
(Healer gene)

18
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,599
All you did was meet a stranger...

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,120
and you got this feeling of love.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,351
But a lot of work comes with it...

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,361
and there's a cruel price to pay.

22
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:17,631
You must learn their personality and tastes...

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,079
and align your mismatching tastes with theirs.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,180
In the process, you fight and bicker.

25
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:23,920
You end up hurting them and get hurt too.

26
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:25,340
In the end,

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,840
you break up.

28
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:30,819
Where are you going? I'm not done talking!

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,890
Did you say you're the only one trying?

30
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,881
I'm putting in a lot of effort too.

31
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,430
Don't you see I'm trying too?

32
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,510
You think you're the only one trying.

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,500
I just need a single call.

34
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,550
Is that so difficult?

35
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,550
I was the same.

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,539
Just like everyone else,

37
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,091
all of my relationships ended as failures.

38
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,531
You know, there are some typical reasons.

39
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,227
Either someone cheats,

40
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,150
gets too obsessive,

41
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,570
or one side falls out of love too fast.

42
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:04,967
Likewise, the men I loved...

43
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,967
all cheated on me.

44
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:08,711
They were players.

45
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,621
Betrayal and broken heart awaited me after every relationship.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,961
Why does this keep happening to me?

47
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:23,379
Could it be that I lack charms?

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,471
Or was it my fault for loving them more for longer?

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,001
What did I do wrong?

50
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,811
Then I finally came to a realization.

51
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,990
It's not my fault...

52
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:41,010
I keep on failing in love.

53
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,651
It's not my fault nor the fault of those I loved.

54
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,317
The only fault we had...

55
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,591
was not realizing...

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,790
that we were not fated to be together.

57
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,360
The secret behind this fate lies...

58
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,161
in our DNA.

59
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,219
The moment Watson saw the double helix construction...

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,627
of the DNA for the first time,

61
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:10,570
he was sure there would be no mistake to this discovery.

62
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,640
It was too beautiful to be a mistake.

63
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,759
But hiding within this beautiful double helix...

64
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,881
were unimaginable secrets.

65
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,800
These secrets construct our lives...

66
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,046
and determine our fates.

67
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,979
Engraved in your DNA is a blueprint...

68
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,386
that makes someone love you from birth called DNA Lover.

69
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,730
We have predetermined partners.

70
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,896
So if you crack the code in your DNA,

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
you'll be able to find your lover...

72
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,670
destined for you.

73
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,380
My DNA lover...

74
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,050
is someone tall and slim.

75
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,961
He has double eyelids and thick hair.

76
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,079
He's bad with the heat,

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,379
so he'll be cranky in the summer.

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,610
On top of that, his BBS12 gene...

79
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:08,279
makes his skin itchier and more swollen...

80
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,420
compared to others when he gets beaten by mosquitos.

81
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,649
This bit is kind of unfortunate,

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,670
but he has a high alcohol tolerance so he'll love to drink.

83
00:04:16,561 --> 00:04:20,060
He'll likely get lung cancer at the age of 60.5.

84
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,699
It's also highly likely...

85
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,581
he'll suffer from Alzheimer's at the age of 70.3.

86
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:34,560
He'll die...

87
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,430
at the age of 73.

88
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,310
But that man won't feel lonely...

89
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:43,870
or sad until the day he dies.

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,341
Because I'll outlive him.

91
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,641
That means...

92
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,711
the fated person who will love him the most in this world...

93
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:59,221
will be by his side until the end.

94
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm excited to be able to...

95
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,360
introduce my research to you and to the world.

96
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,327
We no longer have to get heartbroken.

97
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,079
There's also no reason...

98
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,566
to waste time or feelings on proving your decision.

99
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,296
Your love is blameless.

100
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,740
You just need...

101
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,837
to meet your destined partner chosen by your DNA...

102
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,750
to love passionately!

103
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,690
So have you met the man with the DNA fated for you?

104
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,271
Yes.

105
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,471
I have.

106
00:06:11,741 --> 00:06:12,921
(Digestive Organs, Blood)

107
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:17,387
What? Was that a dream?

108
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,461
How can it be a dream?

109
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,050
Maybe it's a prophetic dream.

110
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,680
(Meet with Sang Min at 8pm)

111
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:25,471
Gosh, I'm going to be late!

112
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,720
(There's a moment when a relationship begins.)

113
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,949
(Episode 1: Predestined Couple)

114
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,541
(There's a moment when a relationship begins.)

115
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,601
Hey, isn't that guy hot?

116
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,271
Are there three of you?

117
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:32,971
When did you get in?

118
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,641
- No. - I don't know.

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,911
I'm at Kafka.

120
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,707
There's a club in the basement.

121
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:41,281
That's why I came.

122
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,560
What do you say? We'll treat you to something nice.

123
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:46,380
Or how about a barbecue?

124
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,321
Honey.

125
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:51,500
You'll come pick me up, won't you?

126
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,310
Didn't you say it was your friend's birthday?

127
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,017
You should enjoy your time with them.

128
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,279
- I love you. - Sure.

129
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,449
Don't you love me?

130
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,209
I'll wait outside for just 30 minutes.

131
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,480
I'll leave if you don't show up.

132
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,120
Call me when you get here.

133
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,471
Okay.

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm sorry! I'm so late.

135
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,650
It's been so hectic.

136
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:20,980
Hold on.

137
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,940
Ta-da.

138
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:24,940
I'm certain I have a grasp over your hair loss.

139
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,616
Gosh. This?

140
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,840
I made a hair growth solution tailored for your DNA.

141
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,080
It hasn't been clinically tested yet,

142
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,457
but this time, it's really strong.

143
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,610
A rat that had severe hair loss...

144
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,756
grew fluffy fur like a rabbit's in just seven hours.

145
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,723
(So Jin and Sang Min)

146
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,910
Well? How does it feel to have a girlfriend in genetics?

147
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,880
It's really something.

148
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,570
- What is it? - No matter how I think about it,

149
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:53,380
you're definitely not my type.

150
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,200
What is this?

151
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,269
Don't say you were attracted to me without any reason again.

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,990
That's all...

153
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,570
because of your DNA.

154
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,061
No, you're wrong.

155
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,461
I mean I've never been attracted to you.

156
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:08,400
- All of a sudden? - Yes.

157
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:11,789
You know, I might have thought about other women while dating you.

158
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,350
This woman and that woman.

159
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:14,697
Come on.

160
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,220
No way. You've never cheated on me before.

161
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,960
I know you were really heartbroken...

162
00:09:19,961 --> 00:09:21,541
because your ex-boyfriends cheated on you.

163
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,250
Well, maybe I didn't want to become one of them.

164
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,899
Is that so?

165
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,769
Do you know what people call us?

166
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,639
Meant to be.

167
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,990
No.

168
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,786
No!

169
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,160
So Jin.

170
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,030
Let's break up.

171
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,080
I want to end...

172
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,601
our relationship today.

173
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,171
No, you can't.

174
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,971
Our DNAs match so well.

175
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:54,090
DNA! I'm so sick of that DNA talk.

176
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:56,029
It makes me fall out of love with you.

177
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,000
You're so obsessed with finding your fated lover.

178
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,299
You're always taking my hair, ear wax,

179
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,429
and putting tissue up my nose.

180
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,600
You take nasty samples to run tests with them.

181
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,639
Do you know how I feel?

182
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,870
Whenever I go to the bathroom, I can never go comfortably.

183
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,260
My heart would race.

184
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,440
You're not a girlfriend. You're a stalker.

185
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,080
- I do that out of love! - Love?

186
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:13,350
I was just checking...

187
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,179
how compatible we might be in terms of our genetics.

188
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,541
Just go to a fortune teller instead.

189
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,320
I'm a logical guy.

190
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,510
But whenever I see you,

191
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,510
I become emotional.

192
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,250
I think...

193
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,776
it'd be better for each other to end it here.

194
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,077
I advise you to find someone just like you to date.

195
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,890
Then you'll understand how I feel.

196
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,087
Take care.

197
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:44,111
I'm leaving.

198
00:10:44,112 --> 00:10:45,860
Wait.

199
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,000
- I spent days and nights... - Gosh.

200
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,171
You know,

201
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:55,460
compared to someone who helps me produce more hair,

202
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:59,081
I prefer someone who finds me hot...

203
00:10:59,231 --> 00:11:00,581
even without hair.

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,150
Bye.

205
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,941
From a certain point,

206
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,910
I'd hear sirens...

207
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,780
whenever I was in my worst moments.

208
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,419
Hey, Sang Min!

209
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,071
What? What is it?

210
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,207
How can you end it like this?

211
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,441
Can you really just end it all like this?

212
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:10,477
What is this? Is it a drama?

213
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,980
A sad movie? Action? Romantic comedy?

214
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:16,750
I'm far from athletic, but I learned roller skates for you.

215
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,551
Should I throw out my skates now?

216
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,986
I started to eat cilantro with my pho because of you.

217
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,110
Now I can't eat pho anymore...

218
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,679
because cilantro will remind me of you.

219
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,250
Gosh, it's a drama.

220
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,450
It's okay. I stopped eating cilantro.

221
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:30,850
Don't let it stop you from eating it.

222
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,090
It's the 1990s vibe.

223
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:33,590
What about our joint bank account?

224
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:35,389
We were going to get your mother implants.

225
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,896
I never asked for it.

226
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,960
You got excited about it on your own.

227
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:40,961
No...

228
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:43,830
Fine. It's your money anyway.

229
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,520
Feel free to take all the money out.

230
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,917
No... Protect your pride.

231
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:53,169
Did you forget what happened while we dated?

232
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,070
What?

233
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:57,760
You should've protected your pride.

234
00:12:58,851 --> 00:13:00,309
I was the first to clean up your niece's poop...

235
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,549
after she was born.

236
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,770
How can we suddenly become strangers?

237
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,649
Your father and I...

238
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,701
have matching climbing shoes. We have so many pictures together.

239
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,419
Even if I run into him while climbing,

240
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,711
I can't say hello anymore.

241
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:17,311
You might be breaking up with a single person,

242
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:21,620
but I'm breaking up with five from your family.

243
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,660
You're mean. You're a terrible person.

244
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,461
Gosh.

245
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,331
See?

246
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,120
Even at the moment of our breakup, you're dating my family,

247
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:38,519
not me.

248
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,019
Just be good to your own family,

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,270
instead of overstepping with mine.

250
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,150
It's over.

251
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:05,431
She should've ended it sooner.

252
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:13,341
What?

253
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:22,351
It must be her specialty to tune out of it.

254
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,631
(Sim General Hospital)

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,167
- Hey, Li Na. - Honey.

256
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,337
Don't you think you're neglecting me?

257
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,100
I'm 22.

258
00:14:56,101 --> 00:14:58,700
Your girlfriend who is twelve years younger than you went to a club.

259
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,929
Why didn't you come get me?

260
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,039
If your strength is your age, meet someone who cares about age.

261
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,717
I told you I'd only wait just for 30 minutes.

262
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,970
I was drunk. Weren't you worried?

263
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,169
I don't like it when you're drunk, so I left. Didn't you know?

264
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,561
I'll avenge you tonight.

265
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,980
What time should we meet?

266
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:14,061
I have plans already with a friend.

267
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,419
You can cancel it.

268
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,419
- I can't. - Why not?

269
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,496
I don't want to lie to my friend.

270
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,870
Fine.

271
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:22,159
You've changed.

272
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,190
Li Na,

273
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:24,889
we weren't planning to meet today.

274
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,081
Do you only want to meet your girlfriend on specific days?

275
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,047
Why do you have so many friends?

276
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:33,947
It's all useless.

277
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:36,276
What am I to you?

278
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,847
Am I really your girlfriend? Do you even love me?

279
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,291
Wait.

280
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,009
Don't you want to know if I went to a club,

281
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,879
if I hung out with a man, or what time I went home?

282
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,320
What if I was hanging out with a guy?

283
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,601
How would you feel?

284
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,067
Honey, please answer me.

285
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:56,019
Who am I to you?

286
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,671
A stranger in 30 seconds.

287
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:01,129
- What? - I'm going to break up with you,

288
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,380
and I plan to hang up in 30 seconds.

289
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:04,601
Are you joking?

290
00:16:04,602 --> 00:16:05,870
You know, this is the third time...

291
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:08,020
we're bickering over the same thing.

292
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,340
Whatever you want from me, I can't give it to you.

293
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:12,470
I also don't have any plans to become your ideal man.

294
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,669
Moreover, I don't intend to change you.

295
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,769
You get my drift, right?

296
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,587
- Honey. - 28,

297
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,986
29, 30.

298
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,000
- Take care. - Honey!

299
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,159
Mr. Sim, did you break up with your girlfriend?

300
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,990
You have that face you always make whenever you break up.

301
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,477
Why, how does my face look? Do I still look sexy and cool?

302
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:36,599
You have the face of someone who races...

303
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,137
when there are no speed limits.

304
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,746
I like that. You know what?

305
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,339
It's less likely for an accident to happen at a place like that...

306
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,940
as long as one follows the rules.

307
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:44,941
But...

308
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:46,217
What?

309
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:50,231
Is it that hard to stay within the lanes?

310
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,750
I don't know. I always let other people pass me.

311
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:53,927
"You've changed."

312
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:55,880
- "Do you even love me?" - What is this?

313
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,579
Why do they always say the same thing at the end?

314
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,420
Are they AIs? Even AIs don't do that.

315
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:01,920
They were definitely different at first.

316
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:05,359
They each had their own color at first.

317
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,890
Even that famous ice cream brand with 31 flavors...

318
00:17:07,891 --> 00:17:10,650
introduce a new flavor each year. So why?

319
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:14,281
Why do they always say the same thing?

320
00:17:15,941 --> 00:17:17,390
I'm sorry.

321
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:21,160
How did she barge into your lane?

322
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,009
Hello, Dr. Sim.

323
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,109
Hello.

324
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,309
Here, Dr. Sim. A new cafe opened in front of the hospital.

325
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,950
I got you Mandheling coffee.

326
00:17:29,951 --> 00:17:32,096
Is it the Mandheling coffee?

327
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,096
How did you know I was into it these days?

328
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,019
That's considerate of you. Thank you.

329
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Where's mine?

330
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,430
Gosh. Do you drink drip coffee?

331
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:42,981
Do I look like I would only drink instant coffee?

332
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,710
Don't mind him. Thank you.

Your face is so swollen.

345
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,539
- Well... - Gosh.

346
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,690
So Jin was dumped by that garbage Sang Min yesterday.

347
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:33,887
Oh Sang Min?

348
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:37,670

when the three of us were eating?

350
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,390
But calling him garbage is harsh.

351
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:45,140
They were in love at one point.

352
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,730
She's right. He's not garbage.

353
00:18:48,731 --> 00:18:51,610
At least he wasn't cheating on me.

354
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,776
So Jin. They say, love can help you heal.

355
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,991
Should I set you up?

356
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:03,930
He had the most potential...

357
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:07,200

Sang Min will return to me.

00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:32,869
DRD4...

366
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,839
This gene affects the dopamine hormone levels,

367
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,210
which act as a way to send excitement to the brain cells.

368
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:40,079
People with this gene are more likely...

369
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,009
to seek for stimulation, thrill, and pleasure.

370
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,950
What is it? What does his result say?

371
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:48,150
He was also a holder of the cheater gene.

372
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,071
No way.

373
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,819
He doesn't look like the type.

374
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,289
This is wrong... He never did such a thing.

375
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,630
By now,

376
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:58,559
you can assume you only love cheaters.

377
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,730
Why does he have this gene?

378
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,207
All your exes had it. How many is it now?

379
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,991
No... This is not possible.

380
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:07,660
He didn't cheat while we dated.

381
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,231
This time, it wasn't because of another woman.

382
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,026
This is driving me crazy!

383
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,370
(Seoul Fire Services)

384
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,400
Headquarters, do you copy?

385
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,200
One rescuer will be using a rope from the roof.

386
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:41,140
He'll check on the patient upon entering the building...

387
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:44,039
and secure the entryway for other rescuers. Over.

388
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,601
The rope has been secured. I'm going in.

389
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,291
Anyone here?

390
00:21:15,911 --> 00:21:18,960
If you can hear me, please answer me.

391
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,970
Wake up!

392
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,771
Let's get out.

393
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,210
What happened?

394
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,346
We received a fire report, but there wasn't a fire.

395
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,576
While searching your place,

396
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,380
I found you unconscious in the bathroom.

397
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,720
Wait.

398
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,890
You're that firefighter who came last time...

399
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,930
I wasn't trying to kill myself this time.

400
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,470
I'm glad.

401
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:03,259
She was unconscious in the bathroom when I arrived.

402
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,637
Okay.

403
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,390
You, come with me to search for any other casualties.

404
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,160
You should start moving up...

405
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,700
- while knocking on each unit. - Okay.

406
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:12,880
Is anything bothering you?

407
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,851
I'm currently pregnant.

408
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:18,190
Maybe it's anemia.

409
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,591
Maybe it's dehydration from my enteritis.

410
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,779
Things went black before my eyes.

411
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,809
(Hey, Blue! How is it in there?)

412
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,809
I probably fainted because of it.

413
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,579
(Blue, it was so good to see you today. Let's meet soon.)

414
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,771
Let me check your blood pressure.

415
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,771
Do you have the number I gave to you last time?

416
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,581
I'll write it down for you again.

417
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:46,799
If you ever need help...

418
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,680
or if you get those bad thoughts again,

419
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:50,390
please just call.

420
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,991
Please call...

421
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,816
instead of writing a will. Okay?

422
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,531
(Seo Kang Hoon)

423
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,460
I will. Thank you.

424
00:23:03,951 --> 00:23:05,400
What do we do?

425
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,400
Your paycheck will have to cover the damage compensation.

426
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,041
I know why you act like this,

427
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:15,311
but it's about time you get past it.

428
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,180
Sung Mi.

429
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,581
I still wish I could go back...

430
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,420
to five minutes before it happened.

431
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,157
Good job today.

432
00:23:29,181 --> 00:23:30,531
You too.

433
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,259
What are you doing tonight? Should we get a drink?

434
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,410
(Please?)

435
00:23:48,931 --> 00:23:50,960
- Not again. - What do you mean?

436
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:53,306
Do you know when you ask me to go for a drink?

437
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,816
Only after you've been beaten around by the pieces of trash.

438
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,991
You always let those guys push you around.

439
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:03,190
Hey, it's not like I date them knowing they're trash.

440
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,279
- Han So Jin. - Don't.

441
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
You scare me when you call me like that.

442
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:11,480
How about finding an interest in surviving instead of dating?

443
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,349
You cry over men, but other people cry...

444
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,519
because it's hard to make a living or they got fired,

445
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,296
or because of an illness.

446
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,430
Hey. Do you think people die of hunger?

447
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:24,210
They die because there's no one to say that they're hungry.

448
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,351
Tell me if you get hungry.

449
00:24:27,701 --> 00:24:29,620
I'll eat with you for the rest of your life.

450
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,291
You're so simple-minded.

451
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:34,940
I'm coming to your place for drinks tonight.

452
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,491
Not again!

453
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,491
It's a restaurant, not a bar.

454
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:41,360
Come on.

455
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,400
I won't be there tonight.

456
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,727
I have plans. Come tomorrow.

457
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,627
Don't come!

458
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:49,619
It's more fun to drink alone.

459
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,789
Don't you dare come.

460
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,541
(Always Sushi)

461
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,380
Hey!

462
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,751
Oh Sang Min, you jerk.

463
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,947
Darn it.

464
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:11,390
Hey! I need one more bottle of sake.

465
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,127
You should drink when you want to.

466
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:16,056
A drink can be better than a friend.

467
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,119
That pig. Bug. Insect.

468
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,559
I'm really going to get back at him.

469
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Jerk.

470
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,890
You little...

471
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:28,990
I could just chew you up.

472
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:30,329
I'll just...

473
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,281
You piece of...

474
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Why do you guys swear so much?

475
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:42,091
Why don't you sit together and battle in curse words?

476
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,117
Hey.

477
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:46,627
Why didn't you listen to me?

478
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:48,150
- What? - That fish.

479
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:50,880
I told you to wash it first before killing it.

480
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:54,301
So Ri, this was washed clean with salt and water.

481
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,736
Did you want me to wash it with dish soap?

482
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,110
Yes.

483
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:01,440
So Jin.

484
00:26:04,161 --> 00:26:06,981
My buck teeth are ugly, right?

485
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,751
No.

486
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,091
Not at all.

487
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,120
By the way, who are you?

488
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,486
So Ri.

489
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,680
Do you know each other?

490
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,657
- She's a junior model. - I see.

491
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:21,700
Jerk...

492
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:24,380
He told me he liked my buck teeth...

493
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:26,619
and told me to keep on smiling.

494
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,019
He was making fun of you.

495
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,370
He might have really liked it.

496
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,559
But he probably got sick of it because his love died out.

497
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,460
We became strangers in a minute.

498
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,680
How can you become strangers in just a minute?

499
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,900
- Strangers? - Yes.

500
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:43,091
Did he call you a stranger? That jerk...

501
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,700
How?

502
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:46,360
That's so harsh.

503
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:49,420
Even the dirt under his toenail is my type.

504
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,427
I had never met anyone like him who treated me so well.

505
00:26:53,451 --> 00:26:56,430
He was good to me and he was funny.

506
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:58,980
Not only was he funny,

507
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,670
he was cool.

508
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:05,467
He was cool even while breaking up. It's so annoying!

509
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,410
Seriously... Do you need my help with getting over him?

510
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:10,311
Hey, what's his name?

511
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:12,460
I'll get all the personal details of him.

512
00:27:12,461 --> 00:27:15,150
Sim Yeon Woo...

513
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,720
What? Sim who?

514
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:22,440
Stop crying and tell me!

515
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:25,910
Sim Yeon Woo!

516
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,710
Sim Yeon Woo!

517
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:30,127
She says his name is Sim Yeon Woo. Can't you hear her?

518
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,319
What does he do?

519
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,349
Do you know the Sim General Hospital in Cheongdam-dong?

520
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,596
He's the son of the chief director.

521
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,670
Girls!

522
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,160
An overly handsome doctor lives there.

523
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,511
Excuse me!

524
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,481
A guy with upsetting DNA lives in Sinchon.

525
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,970
Girls, I caught this...

526
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:51,039
An awful guy with the DNA...

527
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,690
of a cheater like an octopus with eight legs lives there!

528
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,770
Oh, never mind.

529
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:56,660
He makes me so upset.

530
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,720
How ominous.

531
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,860
Should we punish the jerk who dumped you?

532
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,880
How?

533
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,630
How?

534
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,849
Well... How?

535
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,001
Let's see.

536
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,566
Right!

537
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,140
Universal gravitation is...

538
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,960
the force that pulls each other together.

539
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:49,440
Everyone,

540
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,821
there is no such thing as coincidence.

541
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,269
In billions of lightyears,

542
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,440
that man and woman...

543
00:28:59,441 --> 00:29:03,586
were drawn together to this point because they were both so lonesome.

544
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,056
- But... - Let's go!

545
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,630
To get revenge.

546
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,630
Yes, Dad.

547
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,390
Is So Jin at the restaurant? You didn't give her alcohol, right?

548
00:29:14,391 --> 00:29:16,796
The three girls are totally drunk now.

549
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,089
Gosh, Dad!

550
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,581
I told you not to give her alcohol!

551
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,251
(Always Sushi)

552
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:38,480
You know she's dangerous when she gets drunk.

553
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:39,809
You mean when she said she'd do an experiment...

554
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,750
and poured lemon powder and cola in her mouth and it exploded?

555
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,420
That was when she was young.

556
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:46,549
Last year, she got drunk and she almost started a fire...

557
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,619
while experimenting on alchemy.

558
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,771
She becomes two-faced when she's drunk! It's like she's possessed!

559
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:59,251
Which unit is it? You can find him, right?

560
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,877
Of course!

561
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:03,647
No, today, I'm the leader.

562
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,016
All right, then. Forward!

563
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,609
One, two...

564
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,190
Darn it!

565
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,309
Hey, just say stuff that you couldn't say to him.

566
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,700
Let's go!

567
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,101
- Let's go! - Let's go!

568
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:39,998
- Yeon Woo! - Gosh.

569
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,728
Why won't you answer my calls?

570
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:44,238
Is it all over because we broke up? Is it? I'm going crazy!

571
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:46,508
I have nothing more to say, Li Na.

572
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,908
- Gosh! Shall we talk inside? - What?

573
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:49,909
Don't let your neighbors report you...

574
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,289
- for loud noise and disturbance. - What...

575
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:53,559
Gosh, what? Darn it.

576
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:04,109
Everyone, this is...

577
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,117
an illegal act of breaking and entering.

578
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:08,928
Oh, I don't intend to stay here for a long time either.

579
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:11,208
Hey, say everything you want to say to him.

580
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,975
Can you make this quick if possible?

581
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,218
I'll be good, Yeon Woo.

582
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:20,638
I'll cater to you from now on. Let's start over.

583
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:24,928
The reason why we broke up was exactly this, Li Na.

584
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:28,928
Even now, only your emotions are important to you.

585
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:30,648
How would you and I have any chance?

586
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,017
Gosh, this house is insane!

587
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:35,418
Do you think you'll meet another woman who loves you as much as I do?

588
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:38,587
I didn't like you who liked me. I just liked you.

589
00:31:38,588 --> 00:31:40,357
The you that I liked...

590
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:43,809
wasn't a woman who whined and acted childish like you are now.

591
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:46,767
Will you please leave now? I have dinner plans.

592
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:47,768
I don't want to.

593
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:49,998
Who is it? Is it a woman? It's not, is it?

594
00:31:49,999 --> 00:31:51,968
I will die without you.

595
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:54,918
You won't die. People don't die because of love.

596
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:57,438
- What? - "This too shall pass."

597
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:59,925
"Love, as if you are falling in love for the first time."

598
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:02,448
You're going to post something like that on social media, aren't you?

599
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:04,617
Gosh, no!

600
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:07,799
You are my destiny. Destiny!

601
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:10,309
"Destiny"?

602
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:14,309
I think I told you I don't believe in stuff like that.

603
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:16,735
I'll tell you one last time.

604
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:17,998
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

605
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:21,218
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

606
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,178
That's all people who lack charm...

607
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,289
and anything to show for themselves rely on.

608
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,725
Destiny is like...

609
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:39,928
the tabloids on the streets.

610
00:32:42,348 --> 00:32:43,968
Like you right now.

611
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:48,478
Why are you being so mean?

612
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,375
Are you the same guy I know?

613
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,779
When someone says that it's destiny,

614
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,589
they're saying that with their lives on the line.

615
00:33:02,368 --> 00:33:03,728
You...

616
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:06,589
have no sincerity, even at first glance.

617
00:33:06,749 --> 00:33:09,599
Since you had no sincerity, it was all easy for you.

618
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:13,898
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

619
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,108
(So Jin loves Sang Min, Super Teol)

620
00:33:27,999 --> 00:33:29,718
Become uglier.

621
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:32,549
Become uglier.

622
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:34,489
Become uglier.

623
00:33:34,768 --> 00:33:37,128
Become hairy!

624
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:45,228
Become hairy!

625
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:49,369
Oops.

626
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,909
Become hairy!

627
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:11,215
Gosh, you're causing trouble!

628
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,277
- Hey. - No!

629
00:34:13,278 --> 00:34:16,147
- My experiment is just starting. - Hey, let's go.

630
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,448
- Welcome! - Hey!

631
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:22,317
Welcome to becoming Han So Jin's experiment!

632
00:34:22,318 --> 00:34:24,135
My puzzles...

633
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,569
Hey, are we going home?

634
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:32,235
Hey! Answer me, will you? Darn it.

635
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,868
Answer me!

636
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,578
Welcome!

637
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:42,968
- No, wait! - Again?

638
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:44,038
- No, I... - You can't!

639
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,448
No, I seriously... Are we leaving her?

640
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,277
- You're a nuisance. - Are we just leaving her?

641
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:52,555
Seriously, though. I won't forgive him.

642
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:54,718
So Ri, this is not right.

643
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,917
- We should do the right thing. - Okay. I know.

644
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,038
- Gosh. - Please.

645
00:35:18,338 --> 00:35:22,098
Hello? Is this Mars?

646
00:35:24,949 --> 00:35:28,799
What? My DNA match is living there?

647
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,018
Oh, I knew it.

648
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:33,658
I thought he might not be on Earth.

649
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:37,204
But perhaps, does he look weird?

650
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:39,328
Gosh, that's okay.

651
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:41,297
I don't care about looks.

652
00:35:41,298 --> 00:35:44,489
But do Martians...

653
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:48,259
only love one person at a time?

654
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,759
I am like that too.

655
00:35:54,809 --> 00:35:56,848
I may be an Earthling,

656
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:01,538
but unlike other Earthlings, I only love one person at a time.

657
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,339
Let's meet now.

658
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,535
I'll send you a signal.

659
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:11,978
You must find me.

660
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,049
Okay?

661
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:21,458
Beep, beep.

662
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,638
Beep, beep.

663
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,828
(Estimated Time of Arrival, 2 minutes)

664
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:33,768
How in the world does that girl have no middle ground?

665
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:45,527
Beep, beep.

666
00:36:45,528 --> 00:36:47,428
- Hey. - Beep, beep.

667
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:49,797
Sweetie, have you arrived? Beep, beep.

668
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,748
Hey, do you want to get caught by Kang Hoon and get yelled at?

669
00:37:02,548 --> 00:37:04,668
Gosh, it feels so gross. What was that?

670
00:37:05,978 --> 00:37:08,898
What was that, seriously?

671
00:37:10,588 --> 00:37:12,438
Gosh, it feels so gross!

672
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,479
(So Jin loves Sang Min, Super Teol)

673
00:37:16,858 --> 00:37:19,148
It doesn't smell like chemicals.

674
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:22,179
"Super Te-ol?"

675
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:23,567
"Super Tee-ol?"

676
00:37:23,568 --> 00:37:26,188
"Super Teel?"

677
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:28,589
What is this stuff?

678
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,259
Why won't he answer?

679
00:37:49,128 --> 00:37:50,808
Yeon Woo, I'm here.

680
00:37:59,139 --> 00:38:01,788
- Hey, you're here. - What on earth happened?

681
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:03,067
What's up with your living room...

682
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,288
and why is this shoe stuck in your front door?

683
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:08,828
Kang Hoon, I'm sorry,

684
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,199
but get this girl in a taxi and send her off.

685
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:18,357
Beep, beep, beep!

686
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:22,288
- I shouldn't be in a taxi now! - Stop, So Jin!

687
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:24,598
- Seriously! - Gosh, just sit still!

688
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,704
Sir, could you please drive a little slower?

689
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:29,698
- Beep, beep. - Gosh.

690
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:31,819
Can you hear me?

691
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:35,908
- I'm waiting for your signal. - Gosh.

692
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:39,454
- Please answer me. Beep, beep. - Kang Hoon is looking for us.

693
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:41,377
- Beep, beep. - Don't answer him, okay?

694
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:44,018
- No, but I want to! - Don't answer his call!

695
00:38:44,019 --> 00:38:46,668
- But why not? - I'm sorry, sir.

696
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:50,808
- I feel like I'm going throw up. - Yes, so am I.

697
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,938
Sending my signal. I'll wait for your signal. Beep...

698
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,119
What do I do?

699
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:12,728
How am I supposed to live now?

700
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:17,929
Think of it as rather a good thing.

701
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:21,369
Now, you have a chance to meet a man who will only love you.

702
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,168
You should get ready to find a job, right?

703
00:39:27,728 --> 00:39:30,758
You should focus on your studies for now and develop yourself.

704
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:33,158
And how much is there to do when you're young?

705
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,848
You can walk across the country and travel the world.

706
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:39,768
If you were a man, I'd tell you to buy a bowl of seolleongtang...

707
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:42,445
with money you earned from shedding blood and sweat by doing hard labor.

708
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:43,469
How old are you?

709
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,929
I'm 29.

710
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,909
Hey, do you want to try dating me?

711
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:02,378
I'll decline.

712
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:16,368
She doesn't mean she will die.

713
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:17,958
It means she wants to be loved.

714
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:20,799
The first commandment of dating.

715
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:24,199
Do not love another besides me.

716
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:27,118
Only think of me 24-7, only look at me,

717
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,498
and live for me. That's the truth.

718
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:33,888
What is this? You're giving off a vibe that you're upset.

719
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:37,334
Last year, didn't you date a lawyer at Byeon and Jang Law Firm?

720
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:39,328
- Yes, I did. Byeon and Jang. - And the beginning of this year,

721
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,397
it was the ballet and yoga academy instructor,

722
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,468
and after that, you dated an animation voice actor.

723
00:40:43,469 --> 00:40:44,469
Did I tell you about that too?

724
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,198
Why are there so many women in your life?

725
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,238
Is that a bad thing?

726
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,707
If you were born a man, you should give your pure love to one woman.

727
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,538
- "Pure love?" - Yes, pure love.

728
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:55,078
I wish I could fall for someone too, sir. How can I do that?

729
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,247
What are you saying?

730
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:59,817
Gosh, you. Mr. Fireman, you should've been a woman.

731
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:01,398
Why?

732
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:04,765
Yeon Woo.

733
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:07,018
Do you know what kind of jerks I hate the most?

734
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:08,988
Right, who is it? I'm curious.

735
00:41:08,989 --> 00:41:11,098
Those who only care about themselves.

736
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,227
- Only themselves. - What?

737
00:41:13,228 --> 00:41:16,049
The woman you dumped today. Does she look normal?

738
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:20,389
Look at how you've hurt her and where inside her heart.

739
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,144
- I'm off. - What...

740
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:23,518
Hey...

741
00:41:24,739 --> 00:41:26,589
What's wrong with him?

742
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,058
I was hurt too. They barged in so suddenly today.

743
00:41:30,648 --> 00:41:32,128
What did I do?

744
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,029
Gosh.

745
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:03,928
(The Best Fireman Seo Kang Hoon)

746
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,939
Hello?

747
00:42:08,048 --> 00:42:10,669
Look at your voice. Do you remember last night?

748
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:12,939
What? Last night?

749
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,479
Yes, I drank at your restaurant until the end.

750
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,357
How did I get home? Gosh, my head.

751
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:21,567
Do you really not remember?

752
00:42:21,568 --> 00:42:24,138
Dad said you left with So Ri yesterday.

753
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,189
So Ri?

754
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,988
Yes, I think she brought me home.

755
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:31,158
Didn't you cause trouble somewhere?

756
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,638
You always do when you get drunk.

757
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,559
That's practically like a disease you have.

758
00:42:39,318 --> 00:42:41,499
Me? Trouble?

759
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:43,118
No, not at all.

760
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,468
Think carefully.

761
00:42:44,918 --> 00:42:46,417
Nothing happened.

762
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,508
(Go to work, February 27, 2024, 7:30am)

763
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:50,749
Hey, hang up. I have to get ready for work.

764
00:42:56,628 --> 00:42:57,797
- Hey! - Wait!

765
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:58,848
So Ri!

766
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,319
What was that?

767
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:05,629
Did I go somewhere with So Ri?

768
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:26,249
I just shaved. What's this?

769
00:43:28,068 --> 00:43:29,278
Why is it just this side?

770
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,319
Become hairy!

771
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:38,859
You...

772
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,229
Super Teol?

773
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,147
You drank last night, didn't you?

774
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:51,439
Yes.

775
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:54,908
When I asked Hyung Cheol,

776
00:43:55,028 --> 00:43:59,508
we had a good time drinking, and So Ri took me outside.

777
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:04,319
But when I woke up in the morning, I'm missing a shoe.

778
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:05,649
Good grief.

779
00:44:07,068 --> 00:44:08,919
I should drink less.

780
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:16,399
What's this?

781
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:21,339
What?

782
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,857
- It's not here. - What did you lose now?

783
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:33,348
The hair growth spray.

784
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:35,278
Super Teol is gone.

785
00:44:36,398 --> 00:44:37,519
Super Teol?

786
00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:41,184
No way. You didn't spray it on someone all night, did you?

787
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,289
Spray it?

788
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,428
Become uglier.

789
00:44:45,938 --> 00:44:47,758
Become hairy!

790
00:44:48,778 --> 00:44:51,417
No, I'm sure that was a dream.

791
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:52,468
It might not...

792
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:54,298
be a dream.

793
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:56,618
Last year, when you got drunk,

794
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,008
you couldn't remember what happened the night before at all.

795
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:01,127
- Me? - I've felt this for a while now,

796
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:03,187
but I think you have a REM sleep disorder.

797
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:07,008
A REM sleep disorder means you act out your dream subconsciously.

798
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:14,638
What time do you get off work today?

799
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,559
I'll come and pick you up outside work. Let's grab dinner together.

800
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:19,828
This punk...

801
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:22,598
Food is not the issue right now.

802
00:45:27,548 --> 00:45:28,868
Is it Han So Jin again?

803
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:31,865
Yes, I'm going to have dinner with her later.

804
00:45:31,889 --> 00:45:34,178
Hey, we have a team dinner tonight.

805
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:37,575
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't think I'll be able to join you.

806
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,048
My gosh.

807
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:43,749
By the way, the two of you seem to be dating, but you keep denying it.

808
00:45:44,469 --> 00:45:49,468
Come on. I treat you like this too, but it's not like we're dating.

809
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:50,519
Gosh.

810
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:55,428
It's not like you see me as a woman.

811
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:57,569
Well...

812
00:45:59,248 --> 00:46:00,598
I'm joking.

813
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:06,238
I'm going to do the same even if So Jin gets married.

814
00:46:08,829 --> 00:46:10,039
Go ahead.

815
00:46:14,469 --> 00:46:15,469
This one?

816
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:19,348
This size is the most popular for rosemary.

817
00:46:28,248 --> 00:46:29,298
What?

818
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:31,229
That's Hee Yeon.

819
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,235
Hey, why were you waiting in the cold?

820
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,698
If you like gentle scents, I also recommend eucalyptus.

821
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,078
Oh, really?

822
00:46:46,898 --> 00:46:49,218
- Let's go. - Shall we go? Let's go.

823
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:58,089
So Jin.

824
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:01,729
Hee Yeon's boyfriend was...

825
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:03,959
you?

826
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:07,078
Hey, we only broke up...

827
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,539
So Jin, shall I set you up on a blind date?

828
00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:13,939
Were you cheating on me, perhaps?

829
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:17,388
Gosh, seriously. How annoying.

830
00:47:17,389 --> 00:47:20,258
Why? Is it annoying that you got caught?

831
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:21,379
So Jin.

832
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:24,649
When you look back, you must've done something wrong too.

833
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:27,738
How can you break up just because one person was wrong?

834
00:47:27,739 --> 00:47:30,908
We didn't break up. He was cheating. And he tricked me.

835
00:47:30,909 --> 00:47:33,328
Ask anyone passing by on the streets.

836
00:47:33,378 --> 00:47:36,747
If a woman goes on about destiny and says she'll die without me,

837
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:38,524
would any man not get tired of that?

838
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:40,578
You're the one who made me like this.

839
00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:42,817
Your ex-boyfriend and the ex before that.

840
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,008
You made all of them cheat. Do you know that?

841
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,979
Don't make Hee Yeon's life hard.

842
00:47:58,168 --> 00:47:59,448
Hey, Oh Sang Min!

843
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:02,618
One second.

844
00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,229
- Why? - You.

845
00:48:06,938 --> 00:48:09,499
- You. - You, what? Just say it!

846
00:48:09,778 --> 00:48:11,999
You don't have stress-related balding.

847
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:14,518
You have a balding gene.

848
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:16,647
You'll lose all your hair in three years and it'll never grow back.

849
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:18,769
Even your children's children will have baldness.

850
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:22,227
Do you know that you have a gene that leads to prostate cancer?

851
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:24,948
You're likely to get it at 42.3 years of age.

852
00:48:25,228 --> 00:48:28,274
Oh, you also have a diabetic gene.

853
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:31,519
You'll get that at 45.3 years of age.

854
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:34,038
You know that DNA is an unavoidable destiny, right?

855
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,059
Don't worry. Science is stronger than DNA.

856
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:38,629
I hope you treat it well.

857
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,928
Sentence me to death, why don't you?

858
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:45,047
Hey, do you think this will damage me in any way?

859
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:47,399
Is that so? But I'm sorry.

860
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:51,609
Predictions don't matter at all in your everyday life.

861
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:53,638
But then,

862
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:56,957
the more you start to age,

863
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:59,448
it'll slowly eat away at you.

864
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,027
"Oh, the test results she read to me back then..."

865
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:04,819
"was my future." Like that!

866
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:07,519
Are you really crazy?

867
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:11,909
Darn it.

868
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:13,459
Don't deal with a jerk like that.

869
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:16,047
What? A jerk? You...

870
00:49:16,048 --> 00:49:17,408
Hey, you punk! Come here.

871
00:49:17,409 --> 00:49:19,298
Come here, you punk! You little...

872
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:24,908
Oh, no! Sang Min.

873
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,138
Let's go, So Jin.

874
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,458
You...

875
00:49:29,459 --> 00:49:32,127
Hey, where are you going?

876
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:34,627
Hey, I didn't like you the moment I first saw you!

877
00:49:34,628 --> 00:49:37,468
Are you Leon or what? You punk!

878
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:39,497
Gosh, seriously...

879
00:49:39,498 --> 00:49:42,908
- Stop that. - Does she think I will...

880
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:46,028
See you next time! Be ready to get beaten up!

881
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:51,317
Here is the sushi you ordered.

882
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:52,629
Looks good.

883
00:49:54,748 --> 00:49:56,238
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

884
00:50:19,478 --> 00:50:20,658
She's drunk.

885
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:26,428
Hey.

886
00:50:28,889 --> 00:50:29,999
Goodness.

887
00:50:30,248 --> 00:50:32,439
You got drunk yesterday too. You're drinking again?

888
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,138
What does a jerk like that matter? Forget him soon.

889
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,948
"Always with you."

890
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,078
What?

891
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,979
Has it already been ten years since Mother passed away?

892
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:47,448
He took care of her while she was sick for over ten years.

893
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,129
Still, Mr. Seo only loves your mother.

894
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:55,928
It's not even a family photo. A wedding photo.

895
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:00,269
Inside my dad's heart, Mom is still alive.

896
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:04,709
Would my dad be alive in my mom's heart too?

897
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:09,109
They shouldn't have met in the first place.

898
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,008
If Dad and Mom had met someone different in the first place,

899
00:51:14,798 --> 00:51:17,019
they wouldn't have been so unhappy.

900
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,689
Then,

901
00:51:20,398 --> 00:51:23,319
my dad wouldn't have left like that.

902
00:51:24,938 --> 00:51:26,658
Come on.

903
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:30,359
Eat, then think.

904
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,647
From now on, date someone who'll only like you.

905
00:51:33,648 --> 00:51:34,738
Got it?

906
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:39,587
Bring every single guy you have an interest in.

907
00:51:39,588 --> 00:51:43,035
Jerks, pieces of trash, cheaters. I'll tell you which ones they are.

908
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:47,149
Instead, if I say no, you can never date them. Got it?

909
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,067
What are you saying suddenly?

910
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,738
If you cry one more time because of a guy,

911
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:53,837
you'll be in big trouble!

912
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:55,158
It's my dating life.

913
00:51:55,438 --> 00:51:56,689
Eat up.

914
00:52:04,409 --> 00:52:05,468
Is it good?

915
00:52:08,148 --> 00:52:11,039
We were unhappy until the moment Dad died...

916
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:14,678
because Mom had met the wrong partner.

917
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:17,979
I knew then.

918
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:21,249
You must meet the perfect match...

919
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,419
to be able to save and make the other one live.

920
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:27,519
That you can save each other.

921
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:31,359
The test samples I got from Oh Sang Min's body.

922
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,028
I wanted to prove that he was my DNA lover.

923
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:38,569
But what I made with this...

924
00:52:39,579 --> 00:52:42,569
was only the hair loss treatment for that guy.

925
00:52:49,588 --> 00:52:50,738
The perfect partner...

926
00:52:52,298 --> 00:52:55,448
I will spend my life with is engraved in my DNA.

927
00:52:57,528 --> 00:52:59,419
I call that perfect partner...

928
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:02,089
a DNA lover.

929
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:06,859
My DNA lover...

930
00:53:07,438 --> 00:53:10,198
whom I don't even know the name or face of.

931
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:13,328
(Oh Sang Min)

932
00:53:20,858 --> 00:53:22,708
Before I die,

933
00:53:23,228 --> 00:53:26,509
will I get to find my DNA lover?

934
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,878
Where could he be?

935
00:53:32,338 --> 00:53:34,148
How old is he?

936
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:38,119
What if...

937
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:42,058
he's already...

938
00:53:43,778 --> 00:53:45,199
dead?

939
00:54:12,865 --> 00:54:15,385
Gosh, what dream was that?

940
00:54:25,816 --> 00:54:27,166
What's this?

941
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,615
- Hello. - Good morning.

942
00:54:50,675 --> 00:54:51,704
Doctor.

943
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,752
- Gosh! - What's wrong?

944
00:54:53,776 --> 00:54:56,415
Oh, I've been... I...

945
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:58,315
My face has been getting larger, so I've been getting massages...

946
00:54:58,316 --> 00:54:59,666
just on this one side.

947
00:54:59,885 --> 00:55:03,154
How about you? Why don't you get massages? You totally should.

948
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:05,905
You of all people. Of course, you should.

949
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:24,352
I'm sure it's because of this.

950
00:55:24,376 --> 00:55:25,726
So Jin...

951
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:28,226
How do I find this person?

952
00:55:30,345 --> 00:55:32,344
(Ms. Yoo Young A, prenatal test results)

953
00:55:32,345 --> 00:55:33,636
I should work, though.

954
00:55:35,385 --> 00:55:37,485
(Sim Yeon Woo)

955
00:55:37,486 --> 00:55:40,554
- Yes, Dr. Sim. - Ms. Yoo Young A's prenatal tests.

956
00:55:40,555 --> 00:55:42,246
I'll check them at the genetics center.

957
00:55:58,106 --> 00:56:01,025
Become uglier!

958
00:56:01,515 --> 00:56:03,095
Become uglier!

959
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:06,465
Become hairy!

960
00:56:07,285 --> 00:56:08,735
Gosh.

961
00:56:10,256 --> 00:56:11,706
Who are you?

962
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:17,546
Hey, BK.

963
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:19,471
I just arrived.

964
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:21,746
I'll be right there. Okay.

965
00:56:35,175 --> 00:56:37,315
We'll have a meeting with the doctor...

966
00:56:37,316 --> 00:56:39,284
from Sim General Hospital that's going to be working with us.

967
00:56:39,285 --> 00:56:40,695
Come to the auditorium.

968
00:56:40,785 --> 00:56:42,405
"Sim General Hospital"?

969
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,336
"Sim General Hospital"?

970
00:56:47,955 --> 00:56:49,071
Sim General Hospital!

971
00:56:49,095 --> 00:56:52,025
You know, Sim General Hospital in Cheongdam-dong?

972
00:56:52,026 --> 00:56:54,345
Sim Yeon Woo!

973
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:55,845
What was that?

974
00:57:07,816 --> 00:57:09,091
I'm busy.

975
00:57:09,115 --> 00:57:12,122
So Ri, the day I got drunk, tell me everything that happened.

976
00:57:12,146 --> 00:57:14,232
It would be better not to hear it.

977
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,206
You could totally get sued over this.

978
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:18,025
I doubt that.

979
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:21,275
I'm not someone who acts out after getting drunk.

980
00:57:23,296 --> 00:57:24,646
Do you really want to know?

981
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:29,385
Hey.

982
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:32,965
You are my destiny.

983
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,786
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

984
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:37,582
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

985
00:57:37,606 --> 00:57:40,425
Become uglier.

986
00:57:40,606 --> 00:57:43,025
Become hairy!

987
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:51,485
I must be really crazy!

988
00:57:51,486 --> 00:57:53,284
I must seriously be crazy.

989
00:57:53,285 --> 00:57:56,295
I knew I would end up doing this! I really went crazy!

990
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:58,571
I must be crazy!

991
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:02,186
But why don't I remember his face?

992
00:58:14,816 --> 00:58:16,514
I must be crazy!

993
00:58:16,515 --> 00:58:19,244
What do I do?

994
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,784
- This is driving me crazy. - Hey.

995
00:58:20,785 --> 00:58:21,785
- You're here. - Hi.

996
00:58:21,786 --> 00:58:22,985
- Have a good day. - Yes, sir.

997
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:25,102
(Hair loss, it's now time to treat it with DNA.)

998
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,905
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

999
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:32,675
What is it this time?

1000
00:58:32,796 --> 00:58:35,295
A Ri, it wasn't a dream. I remember everything!

1001
00:58:35,296 --> 00:58:37,134
I think I sprayed Super Teol on that guy.

1002
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:38,516
What?

1003
00:58:38,936 --> 00:58:40,516
Who is that man?

1004
00:58:40,936 --> 00:58:42,275
Sim Yeon Woo.

1005
00:58:42,276 --> 00:58:44,204
But I don't remember his face.

1006
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:45,945
How could you not remember?

1007
00:58:45,946 --> 00:58:47,726
That's what's driving me crazy.

1008
00:58:48,646 --> 00:58:49,852
Hey, wait.

1009
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:52,384
Dr. Sim says he has arrived. He'll be here soon.

1010
00:58:52,385 --> 00:58:55,036
What? Dr. Sim?

1011
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:02,631
Oh, there he is now.

1012
00:59:02,655 --> 00:59:05,115
Here, Dr. Sim Yeon Woo. Over here.

1013
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:09,272
"Sim Yeon Woo"?

1014
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:11,246
Dr. Sim Yeon Woo. Over here.

1015
00:59:18,046 --> 00:59:20,126
When someone says that it's destiny,

1016
00:59:20,606 --> 00:59:22,925
they're saying that with their lives on the line.

1017
00:59:23,345 --> 00:59:25,836
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

1018
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:06,876
Darn it.

1019
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:53,185
(DNA Lover)

1020
01:00:53,336 --> 01:00:54,835
Women can tell a man's immunity gene...

1021
01:00:54,836 --> 01:00:57,875
for the sake of her children.

1022
01:00:57,876 --> 01:00:59,204
Se Hee! This is a perfume I made with the scents...

1023
01:00:59,205 --> 01:01:00,545
of my favorite things.

1024
01:01:00,546 --> 01:01:03,551
If there's a man who smells like this, you have to bark.

1025
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:05,236
Where are you going? Se Hee!

1026
01:01:05,345 --> 01:01:07,662
You must've just broken up with your boyfriend.

1027
01:01:07,686 --> 01:01:10,114
It's fine. I've just found a new boyfriend.

1028
01:01:10,115 --> 01:01:11,724
- Just now? - I caught you.

1029
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:12,835
You're interested in me.

1030
01:01:13,555 --> 01:01:14,824
Dr. Sim?

1031
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:15,825
We've met, right?

1032
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:19,246
Your Super Teol is causing my DNA to mutate.

1033
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:21,346
I think I like her,

1034
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:23,746
but I don't like her.

1035
01:01:24,035 --> 01:01:25,065
Ms. Han So Jin.

1036
01:01:25,066 --> 01:01:27,556
Find me the antidote to Super Teol.
