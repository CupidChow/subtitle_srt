1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,209
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,050
(Choi Si Won)

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,689
(Jung In Sun)

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,289
(Lee Tae Hwan)

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,899
(Jung Eugene)

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,968
(DNA Lover)

7
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:35,969
(This drama is fictional.)

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,309
(All information related
to DNA testing is fictitious.)

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,578
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,840
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,880
Love...

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,679
is a waste.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,289
No, it was like a waste.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,859
No.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,560
I mean dating, not love.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,159
The break-up,

17
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:59,729
the regrets, and lingering feelings.

18
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:05,099
What causes problems
always comes after love.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,340
Love is blameless.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,109
(Psychopathic gene?)

21
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:15,549
(Dying gene)

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,620
(Healer gene)

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,598
All you did was meet a stranger...

24
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,769
and you got this feeling of love.

25
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,000
But a lot of work comes with it...

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,010
and there's a cruel price to pay.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,280
You must learn their
personality and tastes...

28
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,078
and align your mismatching
tastes with theirs.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,179
In the process, you fight and bicker.

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,919
You end up hurting them and get hurt too.

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,989
In the end,

32
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,489
you break up.

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,818
Where are you going? I'm not done talking!

34
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,889
Did you say you're the only one trying?

35
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm putting in a lot of effort too.

36
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,429
Don't you see I'm trying too?

37
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,159
You think you're the only one trying.

38
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,499
I just need a single call.

39
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,199
Is that so difficult?

40
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,199
I was the same.

41
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,538
Just like everyone else,

42
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,740
all of my relationships ended as failures.

43
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,180
You know, there are some typical reasons.

44
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,120
Either someone cheats,

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,149
gets too obsessive,

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,219
or one side falls out of love too fast.

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,789
Likewise, the men I loved...

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,689
all cheated on me.

49
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,360
They were players.

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,270
Betrayal and broken heart
awaited me after every relationship.

51
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,610
Why does this keep happening to me?

52
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,378
Could it be that I lack charms?

53
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,120
Or was it my fault for
loving them more for longer?

54
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,650
What did I do wrong?

55
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,460
Then I finally came to a realization.

56
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,989
It's not my fault...

57
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,659
I keep on failing in love.

58
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:14,300
It's not my fault nor
the fault of those I loved.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,139
The only fault we had...

60
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,240
was not realizing...

61
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:23,439
that we were not fated to be together.

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,009
The secret behind this fate lies...

63
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,810
in our DNA.

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,218
The moment Watson saw
the double helix construction...

65
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,389
of the DNA for the first time,

66
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,219
he was sure there would be
no mistake to this discovery.

67
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:43,289
It was too beautiful to be a mistake.

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,758
But hiding within this
beautiful double helix...

69
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,530
were unimaginable secrets.

70
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:52,799
These secrets construct our lives...

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,740
and determine our fates.

72
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,978
Engraved in your DNA is a blueprint...

73
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:02,110
that makes someone love
you from birth called DNA Lover.

74
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,379
We have predetermined partners.

75
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,550
So if you crack the code in your DNA,

76
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,559
you'll be able to find your lover...

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,319
destined for you.

78
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,029
My DNA lover...

79
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,699
is someone tall and slim.

80
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:28,610
He has double eyelids and thick hair.

81
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,078
He's bad with the heat,

82
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,378
so he'll be cranky in the summer.

83
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,609
On top of that, his BBS12 gene...

84
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,278
makes his skin itchier and more swollen...

85
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,419
compared to others when
he gets beaten by mosquitos.

86
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,648
This bit is kind of unfortunate,

87
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:44,319
but he has a high alcohol
tolerance so he'll love to drink.

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,059
He'll likely get lung
cancer at the age of 60.5.

89
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,698
It's also highly likely...

90
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,230
he'll suffer from Alzheimer's
at the age of 70.3.

91
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,209
He'll die...

92
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,079
at the age of 73.

93
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,309
But that man won't feel lonely...

94
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,519
or sad until the day he dies.

95
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,990
Because I'll outlive him.

96
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,290
That means...

97
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,360
the fated person who will
love him the most in this world...

98
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,870
will be by his side until the end.

99
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,239
I'm excited to be able to...

100
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,009
introduce my research
to you and to the world.

101
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,110
We no longer have to get heartbroken.

102
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,078
There's also no reason...

103
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,389
to waste time or feelings
on proving your decision.

104
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,160
Your love is blameless.

105
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,389
You just need...

106
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,689
to meet your destined
partner chosen by your DNA...

107
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,399
to love passionately!

108
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,339
So have you met the man
with the DNA fated for you?

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Yes.

110
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,120
I have.

111
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,870
(Digestive Organs, Blood)

112
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,110
What? Was that a dream?

113
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,110
How can it be a dream?

114
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,049
Maybe it's a prophetic dream.

115
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,679
(Meet with Sang Min at 8pm)

116
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
Gosh, I'm going to be late!

117
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,719
(There's a moment when
a relationship begins.)

118
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,948
(Episode 1: Predestined Couple)

119
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,490
(There's a moment when
a relationship begins.)

120
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,250
Hey, isn't that guy hot?

121
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,920
Are there three of you?

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,620
When did you get in?

123
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,290
- No.
- I don't know.

124
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm at Kafka.

125
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:08,490
There's a club in the basement.

126
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,930
That's why I came.

127
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,559
What do you say? We'll
treat you to something nice.

128
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,029
Or how about a barbecue?

129
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,970
Honey.

130
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,499
You'll come pick me up, won't you?

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,309
Didn't you say it was
your friend's birthday?

132
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,740
You should enjoy your time with them.

133
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,278
- I love you.
- Sure.

134
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,448
Don't you love me?

135
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,208
I'll wait outside for just 30 minutes.

136
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,479
I'll leave if you don't show up.

137
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,119
Call me when you get here.

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Okay.

139
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,199
I'm sorry! I'm so late.

140
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,299
It's been so hectic.

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,629
Hold on.

142
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,939
Ta-da.

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,939
I'm certain I have a
grasp over your hair loss.

144
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,309
Gosh. This?

145
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,839
I made a hair growth
solution tailored for your DNA.

146
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,079
It hasn't been clinically tested yet,

147
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,379
but this time, it's really strong.

148
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,609
A rat that had severe hair loss...

149
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,750
grew fluffy fur like a
rabbit's in just seven hours.

150
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,549
(So Jin and Sang Min)

151
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,559
Well? How does it feel to
have a girlfriend in genetics?

152
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,529
It's really something.

153
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,569
- What is it?
- No matter how I think about it,

154
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,029
you're definitely not my type.

155
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,199
What is this?

156
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,268
Don't say you were attracted
to me without any reason again.

157
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,639
That's all...

158
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:29,569
because of your DNA.

159
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,710
No, you're wrong.

160
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,110
I mean I've never been attracted to you.

161
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,049
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

162
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,788
You know, I might have thought
about other women while dating you.

163
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,349
This woman and that woman.

164
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,389
Come on.

165
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,219
No way. You've never cheated on me before.

166
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,959
I know you were really heartbroken...

167
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,190
because your ex-boyfriends cheated on you.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,899
Well, maybe I didn't want
to become one of them.

169
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:55,898
Is that so?

170
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,768
Do you know what people call us?

171
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,638
Meant to be.

172
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
No.

173
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,570
No!

174
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:04,809
So Jin.

175
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,679
Let's break up.

176
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,079
I want to end...

177
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,250
our relationship today.

178
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,820
No, you can't.

179
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,620
Our DNAs match so well.

180
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,089
DNA! I'm so sick of that DNA talk.

181
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,028
It makes me fall out of love with you.

182
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,999
You're so obsessed with
finding your fated lover.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,298
You're always taking my hair, ear wax,

184
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,428
and putting tissue up my nose.

185
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,599
You take nasty samples
to run tests with them.

186
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,638
Do you know how I feel?

187
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,869
Whenever I go to the bathroom,
I can never go comfortably.

188
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,909
My heart would race.

189
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,439
You're not a girlfriend. You're a stalker.

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,079
- I do that out of love!
- Love?

191
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,349
I was just checking...

192
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,178
how compatible we might
be in terms of our genetics.

193
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,190
Just go to a fortune teller instead.

194
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,319
I'm a logical guy.

195
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,159
But whenever I see you,

196
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,159
I become emotional.

197
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,899
I think...

198
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,500
it'd be better for each
other to end it here.

199
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,769
I advise you to find
someone just like you to date.

200
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,539
Then you'll understand how I feel.

201
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,940
Take care.

202
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,110
I'm leaving.

203
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,509
Wait.

204
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,649
- I spent days and nights...
- Gosh.

205
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,820
You know,

206
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,459
compared to someone who
helps me produce more hair,

207
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,730
I prefer someone who finds me hot...

208
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,230
even without hair.

209
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,799
Bye.

210
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:02,590
From a certain point,

211
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,559
I'd hear sirens...

212
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,429
whenever I was in my worst moments.

213
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,418
Hey, Sang Min!

214
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,720
What? What is it?

215
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,919
How can you end it like this?

216
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,090
Can you really just end it all like this?

217
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,129
What is this? Is it a drama?

218
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,629
A sad movie? Action? Romantic comedy?

219
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,399
I'm far from athletic, but I
learned roller skates for you.

220
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,200
Should I throw out my skates now?

221
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,940
I started to eat cilantro
with my pho because of you.

222
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,109
Now I can't eat pho anymore...

223
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,678
because cilantro will remind me of you.

224
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,249
Gosh, it's a drama.

225
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,449
It's okay. I stopped eating cilantro.

226
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,849
Don't let it stop you from eating it.

227
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,089
It's the 1990s vibe.

228
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,589
What about our joint bank account?

229
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,388
We were going to get your mother implants.

230
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,620
I never asked for it.

231
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,959
You got excited about it on your own.

232
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
No...

233
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,829
Fine. It's your money anyway.

234
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,169
Feel free to take all the money out.

235
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,840
No... Protect your pride.

236
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,168
Did you forget what
happened while we dated?

237
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,069
What?

238
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,409
You should've protected your pride.

239
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,308
I was the first to clean
up your niece's poop...

240
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,548
after she was born.

241
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:32,419
How can we suddenly become strangers?

242
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,648
Your father and I...

243
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:37,350
have matching climbing shoes.
We have so many pictures together.

244
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,418
Even if I run into him while climbing,

245
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,360
I can't say hello anymore.

246
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,960
You might be breaking
up with a single person,

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,269
but I'm breaking up
with five from your family.

248
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,309
You're mean. You're a terrible person.

249
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:59,110
Gosh.

250
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,980
See?

251
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,119
Even at the moment of our
breakup, you're dating my family,

252
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,518
not me.

253
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,018
Just be good to your own family,

254
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,919
instead of overstepping with mine.

255
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,799
It's over.

256
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,080
She should've ended it sooner.

257
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,990
What?

258
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,000
It must be her specialty to tune out of it.

259

(Sim General Hospital)

260
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,059
- Hey, Li Na.
- Honey.

261
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,990
Don't you think you're neglecting me?

262
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,099
I'm 22.

263
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,699
Your girlfriend who is twelve years
younger than you went to a club.

264
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,928
Why didn't you come get me?

265
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,038
If your strength is your age, meet
someone who cares about age.

266
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,440
I told you I'd only wait
just for 30 minutes.

267
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,969
I was drunk. Weren't you worried?

268
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,168
I don't like it when you're
drunk, so I left. Didn't you know?

269
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,210
I'll avenge you tonight.

270
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:40,979
What time should we meet?

271
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,710
I have plans already with a friend.

272
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,418
You can cancel it.

273
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,418
- I can't.
- Why not?

274
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,350
I don't want to lie to my friend.

275
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,519
Fine.

276
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,158
You've changed.

277
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,189
Li Na,

278
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,888
we weren't planning to meet today.

279
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,730
Do you only want to meet
your girlfriend on specific days?

280
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,929
Why do you have so many friends?

281
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,629
It's all useless.

282
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,200
What am I to you?

283
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,639
Am I really your girlfriend?
Do you even love me?

284
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,940
Wait.

285
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,008
Don't you want to know if I went to a club,

286
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,878
if I hung out with a man,
or what time I went home?

287
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,319
What if I was hanging out with a guy?

288
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,250
How would you feel?

289
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,850
Honey, please answer me.

290
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,018
Who am I to you?

291
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,320
A stranger in 30 seconds.

292
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,128
- What?
- I'm going to break up with you,

293
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,029
and I plan to hang up in 30 seconds.

294
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Are you joking?

295
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:34,869
You know, this is the third time...

296
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,669
we're bickering over the same thing.

297
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,339
Whatever you want from
me, I can't give it to you.

298
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,469
I also don't have any plans
to become your ideal man.

299
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,668
Moreover, I don't intend to change you.

300
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,768
You get my drift, right?

301
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,509
- Honey.
- 28,

302
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,909
29, 30.

303
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,649
- Take care.
- Honey!

304
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,158
Mr. Sim, did you break
up with your girlfriend?

305
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,989
You have that face you always
make whenever you break up.

306
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,230
Why, how does my face look?
Do I still look sexy and cool?

307
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,598
You have the face of someone who races...

308
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,829
when there are no speed limits.

309
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,500
I like that. You know what?

310
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:11,338
It's less likely for an accident
to happen at a place like that...

311
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,939
as long as one follows the rules.

312
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
But...

313
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,940
What?

314
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,880
Is it that hard to stay within the lanes?

315
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,749
I don't know. I always
let other people pass me.

316
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,779
"You've changed."

317
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,879
- "Do you even love me?"
- What is this?

318
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,578
Why do they always say
the same thing at the end?

319
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,419
Are they AIs? Even AIs don't do that.

320
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,919
They were definitely different at first.

321
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,358
They each had their own color at first.

322
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,889
Even that famous ice
cream brand with 31 flavors...

323
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,299
introduce a new flavor each year. So why?

324
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,930
Why do they always say the same thing?

325
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,039
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,809
How did she barge into your lane?

327
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,008
Hello, Dr. Sim.

328
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,108
Hello.

329
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,308
Here, Dr. Sim. A new cafe
opened in front of the hospital.

330
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,949
I got you Mandheling coffee.

331
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,079
Is it the Mandheling coffee?

332
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,990
How did you know I was into it these days?

333
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,018
That's considerate of you. Thank you.

334
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,019
Where's mine?

335
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,429
Gosh. Do you drink drip coffee?

336
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,630
Do I look like I would
only drink instant coffee?

337
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,359
Don't mind him. Thank you.

It's a salad with tomatoes and beets.

It promotes dopamine secretion,

Did you cry yesterday?

Your face is so swollen.

350
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,538
- Well...
- Gosh.

351
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,339

garbage Sang Min yesterday.

352

Oh Sang Min?

353
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,319
Right. Was that the guy
who came to see you...

354
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,589
when the three of us were eating?

355
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,389
But calling him garbage is harsh.

356
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,789
They were in love at one point.

357
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,729
She's right. He's not garbage.

358
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,259
At least he wasn't cheating on me.

359
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,500
So Jin. They say, love can help you heal.

360
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,640

He had the most potential...

362
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,849
as my DNA lover so far.

363
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,480
You'll see.

364
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,649
Sang Min will return to me.

365
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,490
If he tries to see someone else,
his body will instinctively reject.

366
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,390
So Jin.

367
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,700
Is this Oh Sang Min's report?

368
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,268
(Gender: Male)

369
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:00,669
(Personal Characteristics)

370
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:01,868
DRD4...

371
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,838
This gene affects the
dopamine hormone levels,

372
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,209
which act as a way to send
excitement to the brain cells.

373
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,078
People with this gene are more likely...

374
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,008
to seek for stimulation,
thrill, and pleasure.

375
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,949
What is it? What does his result say?

376
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,149
He was also a holder of the cheater gene.

377
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,720
No way.

378
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,818
He doesn't look like the type.

379
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,288
This is wrong... He never did such a thing.

380
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,629
By now,

381
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,558
you can assume you only love cheaters.

382
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,729
Why does he have this gene?

383
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,200
All your exes had it. How many is it now?

384
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,640
No... This is not possible.

385
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,309
He didn't cheat while we dated.

386
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:39,880
This time, it wasn't
because of another woman.

387
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,880
This is driving me crazy!

388
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:46,319
(Seoul Fire Services)

389
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,399
Headquarters, do you copy?

390
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,199
One rescuer will be
using a rope from the roof.

391
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,139
He'll check on the patient
upon entering the building...

392
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,038
and secure the entryway
for other rescuers. Over.

393
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,250
The rope has been secured. I'm going in.

394
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:42,940
Anyone here?

395
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,609
If you can hear me, please answer me.

396
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,619
Wake up!

397
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,420
Let's get out.

398
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,859
What happened?

399
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,029
We received a fire report,
but there wasn't a fire.

400
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,529
While searching your place,

401
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,029
I found you unconscious in the bathroom.

402
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:13,369
Wait.

403
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,539
You're that firefighter
who came last time...

404
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,579
I wasn't trying to kill myself this time.

405
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
I'm glad.

406
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,258
She was unconscious in
the bathroom when I arrived.

407
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,319
Okay.

408
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,389
You, come with me to
search for any other casualties.

409
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,159
You should start moving up...

410
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,699
- while knocking on each unit.
- Okay.

411
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,529
Is anything bothering you?

412
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
I'm currently pregnant.

413
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,839
Maybe it's anemia.

414
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,240
Maybe it's dehydration from my enteritis.

415
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,778
Things went black before my eyes.

416
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:52,808
(Hey, Blue! How is it in there?)

417
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,808
I probably fainted because of it.

418
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,578
(Blue, it was so good to see
you today. Let's meet soon.)

419
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,420
Let me check your blood pressure.

420
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,420
Do you have the number
I gave to you last time?

421
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,230
I'll write it down for you again.

422
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,798
If you ever need help...

423
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,329
or if you get those bad thoughts again,

424
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,039
please just call.

425
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,640
Please call...

426
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,539
instead of writing a will. Okay?

427
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,480
(Seo Kang Hoon)

428
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,109
I will. Thank you.

429
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,049
What do we do?

430
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,049
Your paycheck will have to
cover the damage compensation.

431
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,690
I know why you act like this,

432
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,960
but it's about time you get past it.

433
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:46,829
Sung Mi.

434
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,230
I still wish I could go back...

435
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,069
to five minutes before it happened.

436
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,039
Good job today.

437
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
You too.

438
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:12,258
What are you doing tonight?
Should we get a drink?

439
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,359
(Please?)

440
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,959
- Not again.
- What do you mean?

441
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,069
Do you know when you
ask me to go for a drink?

442
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,569
Only after you've been beaten
around by the pieces of trash.

443
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,640
You always let those guys push you around.

444
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,839
Hey, it's not like I date
them knowing they're trash.

445
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:35,278
- Han So Jin.
- Don't.

446
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,679
You scare me when you call me like that.

447
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,479
How about finding an interest
in surviving instead of dating?

448
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,348
You cry over men, but other people cry...

449
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,518
because it's hard to make
a living or they got fired,

450
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,059
or because of an illness.

451
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,429
Hey. Do you think people die of hunger?

452
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,859
They die because there's no
one to say that they're hungry.

453
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:56,000
Tell me if you get hungry.

454
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,269
I'll eat with you for
the rest of your life.

455
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,940
You're so simple-minded.

456
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,939
I'm coming to your
place for drinks tonight.

457
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,140
Not again!

458
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,140
It's a restaurant, not a bar.

459
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,009
Come on.

460
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:13,049
I won't be there tonight.

461
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:14,720
I have plans. Come tomorrow.

462
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,549
Don't come!

463
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,618
It's more fun to drink alone.

464
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:19,788
Don't you dare come.

465
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:22,430
(Always Sushi)

466
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,029
Hey!

467
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:29,400
Oh Sang Min, you jerk.

468
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:36,740
Darn it.

469
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,039
Hey! I need one more bottle of sake.

470
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,849
You should drink when you want to.

471
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,779
A drink can be better than a friend.

472
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,118
That pig. Bug. Insect.

473
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,558
I'm really going to get back at him.

474
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,559
Jerk.

475
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,889
You little...

476
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,989
I could just chew you up.

477
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,328
I'll just...

478
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,930
You piece of...

479
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,999
Why do you guys swear so much?

480
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,740
Why don't you sit together
and battle in curse words?

481
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,940
Hey.

482
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,309
Why didn't you listen to me?

483
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,149
- What?
- That fish.

484
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,879
I told you to wash it
first before killing it.

485
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,950
So Ri, this was washed
clean with salt and water.

486
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,660
Did you want me to wash it with dish soap?

487
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,759
Yes.

488
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,089
So Jin.

489
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,630
My buck teeth are ugly, right?

490
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,400
No.

491
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,740
Not at all.

492
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,769
By the way, who are you?

493
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:45,309
So Ri.

494
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,679
Do you know each other?

495
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,480
- She's a junior model.
- I see.

496
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,349
Jerk...

497
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,379
He told me he liked my buck teeth...

498
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,618
and told me to keep on smiling.

499
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:57,018
He was making fun of you.

500
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,019
He might have really liked it.

501
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:02,558
But he probably got sick of
it because his love died out.

502
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,459
We became strangers in a minute.

503
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,329
How can you become
strangers in just a minute?

504
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,899
- Strangers?
- Yes.

505
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,740
Did he call you a stranger? That jerk...

506
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:13,699
How?

507
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,009
That's so harsh.

508
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,069
Even the dirt under his toenail is my type.

509
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,180
I had never met anyone like
him who treated me so well.

510
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,079
He was good to me and he was funny.

511
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,979
Not only was he funny,

512
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,319
he was cool.

513
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,220
He was cool even while
breaking up. It's so annoying!

514
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,059
Seriously... Do you need
my help with getting over him?

515
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,960
Hey, what's his name?

516
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,459
I'll get all the personal details of him.

517
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,799
Sim Yeon Woo...

518
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,369
What? Sim who?

519
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,439
Stop crying and tell me!

520
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,909
Sim Yeon Woo!

521
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,709
Sim Yeon Woo!

522
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,920
She says his name is Sim
Yeon Woo. Can't you hear her?

523
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,318
What does he do?

524
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,348
Do you know the Sim General
Hospital in Cheongdam-dong?

525
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,549
He's the son of the chief director.

526
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,319
Girls!

527
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,159
An overly handsome doctor lives there.

528
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Excuse me!

529
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,130
A guy with upsetting DNA lives in Sinchon.

530
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,969
Girls, I caught this...

531
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,038
An awful guy with the DNA...

532
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,339
of a cheater like an octopus
with eight legs lives there!

533
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:23,769
Oh, never mind.

534
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,309
He makes me so upset.

535
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,369
How ominous.

536
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,509
Should we punish the jerk who dumped you?

537
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,879
How?

538
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,279
How?

539
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,848
Well... How?

540
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,650
Let's see.

541
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,490
Right!

542
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:13,789
Universal gravitation is...

543
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,959
the force that pulls each other together.

544
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,089
Everyone,

545
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:22,470
there is no such thing as coincidence.

546
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,268
In billions of lightyears,

547
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:28,439
that man and woman...

548
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,480
were drawn together to this point
because they were both so lonesome.

549
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:33,880
- But...
- Let's go!

550
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,279
To get revenge.

551
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,279
Yes, Dad.

552
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,389
Is So Jin at the restaurant?
You didn't give her alcohol, right?

553
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,660
The three girls are totally drunk now.

554
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,088
Gosh, Dad!

555
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,230
I told you not to give her alcohol!

556
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,200
(Always Sushi)

557
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,479
You know she's dangerous
when she gets drunk.

558
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,808
You mean when she said
she'd do an experiment...

559
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,749
and poured lemon powder and
cola in her mouth and it exploded?

560
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,419
That was when she was young.

561
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,548
Last year, she got drunk
and she almost started a fire...

562
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:16,618
while experimenting on alchemy.

563
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:19,420
She becomes two-faced when
she's drunk! It's like she's possessed!

564
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,900
Which unit is it? You can find him, right?

565
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,670
Of course!

566
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,500
No, today, I'm the leader.

567
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,700
All right, then. Forward!

568
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,608
One, two...

569
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:37,839
Darn it!

570
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:41,308
Hey, just say stuff that
you couldn't say to him.

571
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:42,349
Let's go!

572
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,750
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

573
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,739
- Yeon Woo!
- Gosh.

574
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,469
Why won't you answer my calls?

575
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,979
Is it all over because we
broke up? Is it? I'm going crazy!

576
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,249
I have nothing more to say, Li Na.

577
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,649
- Gosh! Shall we talk inside?
- What?

578
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,650
Don't let your neighbors report you...

579
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:19,680
- for loud noise and disturbance.
- What...

580
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,950
Gosh, what? Darn it.

581
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,500
Everyone, this is...

582
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,858
an illegal act of breaking and entering.

583
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,669
Oh, I don't intend to stay
here for a long time either.

584
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,599
Hey, say everything you want to say to him.

585
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,609
Can you make this quick if possible?

586
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,609
I'll be good, Yeon Woo.

587
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,379
I'll cater to you from
now on. Let's start over.

588
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,319
The reason why we broke
up was exactly this, Li Na.

589
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:57,319
Even now, only your
emotions are important to you.

590
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,389
How would you and I have any chance?

591
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,758
Gosh, this house is insane!

592
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,159
Do you think you'll meet another
woman who loves you as much as I do?

593
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,328
I didn't like you who
liked me. I just liked you.

594
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,098
The you that I liked...

595
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,200
wasn't a woman who whined
and acted childish like you are now.

596
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,508
Will you please leave
now? I have dinner plans.

597
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,509
I don't want to.

598
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,739
Who is it? Is it a woman? It's not, is it?

599
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,709
I will die without you.

600
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,309
You won't die. People
don't die because of love.

601
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,179
- What?
- "This too shall pass."

602
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,380
"Love, as if you are falling
in love for the first time."

603
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,189
You're going to post something
like that on social media, aren't you?

604
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,358
Gosh, no!

605
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,190
You are my destiny. Destiny!

606
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,700
"Destiny"?

607
00:32:40,299 --> 00:32:42,700
I think I told you I don't
believe in stuff like that.

608
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:45,130
I'll tell you one last time.

609
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,739
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

610
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,609
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

611
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,919
That's all people who lack charm...

612
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,680
and anything to show
for themselves rely on.

613
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,119
Destiny is like...

614
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,319
the tabloids on the streets.

615
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,359
Like you right now.

616
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,869
Why are you being so mean?

617
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,940
Are you the same guy I know?

618
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,170
When someone says that it's destiny,

619
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,980
they're saying that with
their lives on the line.

620
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,119
You...

621
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,980
have no sincerity, even at first glance.

622
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,990
Since you had no sincerity,
it was all easy for you.

623
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,289
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

624
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:46,799
(So Jin loves Sang Min, Super Teol)

625
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,109
Become uglier.

626
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,940
Become uglier.

627
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:02,880
Become uglier.

628
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,519
Become hairy!

629
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,619
Become hairy!

630
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Oops.

631
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,300
Become hairy!

632
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,780
Gosh, you're causing trouble!

633
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,018
- Hey.
- No!

634
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,888
- My experiment is just starting.
- Hey, let's go.

635
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,189
- Welcome!
- Hey!

636
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,058
Welcome to becoming
Han So Jin's experiment!

637
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,559
My puzzles...

638
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,960
Hey, are we going home?

639
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,840
Hey! Answer me, will you? Darn it.

640
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,609
Answer me!

641
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,969
Welcome!

642
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,709
- No, wait!
- Again?

643
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,779
- No, I...
- You can't!

644
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,189
No, I seriously... Are we leaving her?

645
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,018
- You're a nuisance.
- Are we just leaving her?

646
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,289
Seriously, though. I won't forgive him.

647
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,459
So Ri, this is not right.

648
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,658
- We should do the right thing.
- Okay. I know.

649
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,429
- Gosh.
- Please.

650
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,489
Hello? Is this Mars?

651
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,190
What? My DNA match is living there?

652
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,759
Oh, I knew it.

653
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,399
I thought he might not be on Earth.

654
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,639
But perhaps, does he look weird?

655
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:08,069
Gosh, that's okay.

656
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,038
I don't care about looks.

657
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,880
But do Martians...

658
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,650
only love one person at a time?

659
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,150
I am like that too.

660
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,589
I may be an Earthling,

661
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,929
but unlike other Earthlings, I
only love one person at a time.

662
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,730
Let's meet now.

663
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,099
I'll send you a signal.

664
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,369
You must find me.

665
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,440
Okay?

666
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,849
Beep, beep.

667
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,379
Beep, beep.

668
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,519
(Estimated Time of Arrival, 2 minutes)

669
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,159
How in the world does that
girl have no middle ground?

670
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,268
Beep, beep.

671
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:16,169
- Hey.
- Beep, beep.

672
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,538
Sweetie, have you arrived? Beep, beep.

673
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:21,139
Hey, do you want to get caught
by Kang Hoon and get yelled at?

674
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,059
Gosh, it feels so gross. What was that?

675
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,289
What was that, seriously?

676
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,829
Gosh, it feels so gross!

677
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,170
(So Jin loves Sang Min, Super Teol)

678
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,539
It doesn't smell like chemicals.

679
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,570
"Super Te-ol?"

680
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,308
"Super Tee-ol?"

681
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,579
"Super Teel?"

682
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,980
What is this stuff?

683
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,650
Why won't he answer?

684
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,199
Yeon Woo, I'm here.

685
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,179
- Hey, you're here.
- What on earth happened?

686
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,808
What's up with your living room...

687
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,679
and why is this shoe
stuck in your front door?

688
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,219
Kang Hoon, I'm sorry,

689
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,590
but get this girl in a
taxi and send her off.

690
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,098
Beep, beep, beep!

691
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,029
- I shouldn't be in a taxi now!
- Stop, So Jin!

692
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,339
- Seriously!
- Gosh, just sit still!

693
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,170
Sir, could you please
drive a little slower?

694
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:58,439
- Beep, beep.
- Gosh.

695
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,210
Can you hear me?

696
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,649
- I'm waiting for your signal.
- Gosh.

697
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,050
- Please answer me. Beep, beep.
- Kang Hoon is looking for us.

698
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:10,118
- Beep, beep.
- Don't answer him, okay?

699
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,759
- No, but I want to!
- Don't answer his call!

700
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,059
- But why not?
- I'm sorry, sir.

701
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,199
- I feel like I'm going throw up.
- Yes, so am I.

702
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,329
Sending my signal. I'll
wait for your signal. Beep...

703
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,510
What do I do?

704
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,119
How am I supposed to live now?

705
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,320
Think of it as rather a good thing.

706
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,760
Now, you have a chance to
meet a man who will only love you.

707
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,559
You should get ready to find a job, right?

708
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:59,499
You should focus on your studies
for now and develop yourself.

709
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,899
And how much is there
to do when you're young?

710
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,239
You can walk across the
country and travel the world.

711
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:08,509
If you were a man, I'd tell you
to buy a bowl of seolleongtang...

712
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:11,010
with money you earned from shedding
blood and sweat by doing hard labor.

713
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,210
How old are you?

714
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:13,320
I'm 29.

715
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:27,300
Hey, do you want to try dating me?

716
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,769
I'll decline.

717
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,109
She doesn't mean she will die.

718
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,349
It means she wants to be loved.

719
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,190
The first commandment of dating.

720
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,590
Do not love another besides me.

721
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,859
Only think of me 24-7, only look at me,

722
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,889
and live for me. That's the truth.

723
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,629
What is this? You're giving
off a vibe that you're upset.

724
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,039
Last year, didn't you date a
lawyer at Byeon and Jang Law Firm?

725
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:08,069
- Yes, I did. Byeon and Jang.
- And the beginning of this year,

726
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,138
it was the ballet and
yoga academy instructor,

727
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,209
and after that, you dated
an animation voice actor.

728
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,210
Did I tell you about that too?

729
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:14,939
Why are there so many women in your life?

730
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,979
Is that a bad thing?

731
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,448
If you were born a man, you should
give your pure love to one woman.

732
00:41:19,449 --> 00:41:21,279
- "Pure love?"
- Yes, pure love.

733
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,819
I wish I could fall for someone
too, sir. How can I do that?

734
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,988
What are you saying?

735
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:28,558
Gosh, you. Mr. Fireman,
you should've been a woman.

736
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,789
Why?

737
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Yeon Woo.

738
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,759
Do you know what kind
of jerks I hate the most?

739
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,729
Right, who is it? I'm curious.

740
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:39,839
Those who only care about themselves.

741
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,968
- Only themselves.
- What?

742
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,440
The woman you dumped
today. Does she look normal?

743
00:41:44,909 --> 00:41:48,780
Look at how you've hurt her
and where inside her heart.

744
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,550
- I'm off.
- What...

745
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:51,909
Hey...

746
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,980
What's wrong with him?

747
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,449
I was hurt too. They
barged in so suddenly today.

748
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,519
What did I do?

749
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,420
Gosh.

750
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:32,619
(The Best Fireman Seo Kang Hoon)

751
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,630
Hello?

752
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,360
Look at your voice. Do
you remember last night?

753
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,630
What? Last night?

754
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,170
Yes, I drank at your
restaurant until the end.

755
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,098
How did I get home? Gosh, my head.

756
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,308
Do you really not remember?

757
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:52,879
Dad said you left with So Ri yesterday.

758
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,880
So Ri?

759
00:42:54,409 --> 00:42:57,679
Yes, I think she brought me home.

760
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,849
Didn't you cause trouble somewhere?

761
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,379
You always do when you get drunk.

762
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,250
That's practically like a disease you have.

763
00:43:08,059 --> 00:43:10,190
Me? Trouble?

764
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:11,859
No, not at all.

765
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,159
Think carefully.

766
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:15,158
Nothing happened.

767
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,199
(Go to work, February 27, 2024, 7:30am)

768
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:19,440
Hey, hang up. I have to get ready for work.

769
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,538
- Hey!
- Wait!

770
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,539
So Ri!

771
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,010
What was that?

772
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:34,320
Did I go somewhere with So Ri?

773
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,940
I just shaved. What's this?

774
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:57,969
Why is it just this side?

775
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,010
Become hairy!

776
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,550
You...

777
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,920
Super Teol?

778
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:18,888
You drank last night, didn't you?

779
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,130
Yes.

780
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,599
When I asked Hyung Cheol,

781
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:28,199
we had a good time drinking,
and So Ri took me outside.

782
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:33,010
But when I woke up in the
morning, I'm missing a shoe.

783
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,340
Good grief.

784
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,610
I should drink less.

785
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,090
What's this?

786
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,030
What?

787
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,598
- It's not here.
- What did you lose now?

788
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,039
The hair growth spray.

789
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,969
Super Teol is gone.

790
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,210
Super Teol?

791
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,880
No way. You didn't spray it
on someone all night, did you?

792
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:10,980
Spray it?

793
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,119
Become uglier.

794
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,449
Become hairy!

795
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,158
No, I'm sure that was a dream.

796
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,159
It might not...

797
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,989
be a dream.

798
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,359
Last year, when you got drunk,

799
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,699
you couldn't remember what
happened the night before at all.

800
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:29,868
- Me?
- I've felt this for a while now,

801
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:31,928
but I think you have a REM sleep disorder.

802
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:35,699
A REM sleep disorder means you
act out your dream subconsciously.

803
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,379
What time do you get off work today?

804
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,250
I'll come and pick you up outside
work. Let's grab dinner together.

805
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,519
This punk...

806
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,289
Food is not the issue right now.

807
00:45:56,289 --> 00:45:57,559
Is it Han So Jin again?

808
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,559
Yes, I'm going to have
dinner with her later.

809
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:02,869
Hey, we have a team dinner tonight.

810
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:06,269
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't
think I'll be able to join you.

811
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,739
My gosh.

812
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,440
By the way, the two of you seem
to be dating, but you keep denying it.

813
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,209
Come on. I treat you like this
too, but it's not like we're dating.

814
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,210
Gosh.

815
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:24,119
It's not like you see me as a woman.

816
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,260
Well...

817
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:29,289
I'm joking.

818
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:34,929
I'm going to do the same
even if So Jin gets married.

819
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,730
Go ahead.

820
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,210
This one?

821
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:48,039
This size is the most popular for rosemary.

822
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:57,989
What?

823
00:46:58,389 --> 00:46:59,920
That's Hee Yeon.

824
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:09,969
Hey, why were you waiting in the cold?

825
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,439
If you like gentle scents, I
also recommend eucalyptus.

826
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,769
Oh, really?

827
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:17,909
- Let's go.
- Shall we go? Let's go.

828
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:26,780
So Jin.

829
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:30,420
Hee Yeon's boyfriend was...

830
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,650
you?

831
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,819
Hey, we only broke up...

832
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,230
So Jin, shall I set you up on a blind date?

833
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,630
Were you cheating on me, perhaps?

834
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:46,129
Gosh, seriously. How annoying.

835
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,999
Why? Is it annoying that you got caught?

836
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,070
So Jin.

837
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:53,340
When you look back, you
must've done something wrong too.

838
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:56,479
How can you break up just
because one person was wrong?

839
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,649
We didn't break up. He was
cheating. And he tricked me.

840
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,019
Ask anyone passing by on the streets.

841
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,488
If a woman goes on about destiny
and says she'll die without me,

842
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:07,219
would any man not get tired of that?

843
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:09,319
You're the one who made me like this.

844
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,558
Your ex-boyfriend and the ex before that.

845
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,699
You made all of them
cheat. Do you know that?

846
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:19,670
Don't make Hee Yeon's life hard.

847
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:28,139
Hey, Oh Sang Min!

848
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:31,309
One second.

849
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,920
- Why?
- You.

850
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:38,190
- You.
- You, what? Just say it!

851
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:40,690
You don't have stress-related balding.

852
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:43,259
You have a balding gene.

853
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,388
You'll lose all your hair in three
years and it'll never grow back.

854
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,460
Even your children's
children will have baldness.

855
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,968
Do you know that you have a
gene that leads to prostate cancer?

856
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,639
You're likely to get it
at 42.3 years of age.

857
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:57,010
Oh, you also have a diabetic gene.

858
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,210
You'll get that at 45.3 years of age.

859
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:02,779
You know that DNA is an
unavoidable destiny, right?

860
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,750
Don't worry. Science is stronger than DNA.

861
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,320
I hope you treat it well.

862
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,619
Sentence me to death, why don't you?

863
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:13,788
Hey, do you think this will
damage me in any way?

864
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:16,090
Is that so? But I'm sorry.

865
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:20,300
Predictions don't matter
at all in your everyday life.

866
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:22,329
But then,

867
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,698
the more you start to age,

868
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:28,139
it'll slowly eat away at you.

869
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,768
"Oh, the test results she
read to me back then..."

870
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:33,510
"was my future." Like that!

871
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,210
Are you really crazy?

872
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,650
Darn it.

873
00:49:40,651 --> 00:49:42,150
Don't deal with a jerk like that.

874
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,788
What? A jerk? You...

875
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,149
Hey, you punk! Come here.

876
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,989
Come here, you punk! You little...

877
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,599
Oh, no! Sang Min.

878
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,829
Let's go, So Jin.

879
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,199
You...

880
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,868
Hey, where are you going?

881
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,368
Hey, I didn't like you the
moment I first saw you!

882
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,209
Are you Leon or what? You punk!

883
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,238
Gosh, seriously...

884
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,649
- Stop that.
- Does she think I will...

885
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,719
See you next time! Be
ready to get beaten up!

886
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,058
Here is the sushi you ordered.

887
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,320
Looks good.

888
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,929
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

889
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:49,349
She's drunk.

890
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,119
Hey.

891
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,690
Goodness.

892
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,130
You got drunk yesterday
too. You're drinking again?

893
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,829
What does a jerk like that
matter? Forget him soon.

894
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,639
"Always with you."

895
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:08,769
What?

896
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,670
Has it already been ten years
since Mother passed away?

897
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:16,139
He took care of her while
she was sick for over ten years.

898
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,820
Still, Mr. Seo only loves your mother.

899
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,619
It's not even a family
photo. A wedding photo.

900
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,960
Inside my dad's heart, Mom is still alive.

901
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,400
Would my dad be alive
in my mom's heart too?

902
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,800
They shouldn't have met in the first place.

903
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,699
If Dad and Mom had met
someone different in the first place,

904
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:45,710
they wouldn't have been so unhappy.

905
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,380
Then,

906
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,010
my dad wouldn't have left like that.

907
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,349
Come on.

908
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,050
Eat, then think.

909
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,388
From now on, date
someone who'll only like you.

910
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:03,429
Got it?

911
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,328
Bring every single guy
you have an interest in.

912
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:11,769
Jerks, pieces of trash, cheaters.
I'll tell you which ones they are.

913
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,840
Instead, if I say no, you
can never date them. Got it?

914
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:18,808
What are you saying suddenly?

915
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:21,479
If you cry one more time because of a guy,

916
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,578
you'll be in big trouble!

917
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:23,849
It's my dating life.

918
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,380
Eat up.

919
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,159
Is it good?

920
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,730
We were unhappy until
the moment Dad died...

921
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,369
because Mom had met the wrong partner.

922
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:46,670
I knew then.

923
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,940
You must meet the perfect match...

924
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,110
to be able to save and
make the other one live.

925
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,210
That you can save each other.

926
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,050
The test samples I got
from Oh Sang Min's body.

927
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,719
I wanted to prove that he was my DNA lover.

928
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,260
But what I made with this...

929
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,260
was only the hair loss
treatment for that guy.

930
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,429
The perfect partner...

931
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,139
I will spend my life with
is engraved in my DNA.

932
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,110
I call that perfect partner...

933
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,780
a DNA lover.

934
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:35,550
My DNA lover...

935
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:38,889
whom I don't even know the name or face of.

936
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,019
(Oh Sang Min)

937
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,099
Before I die,

938
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:54,900
will I get to find my DNA lover?

939
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,269
Where could he be?

940
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:02,539
How old is he?

941
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:06,510
What if...

942
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,449
he's already...

943
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:13,590
dead?

944
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,349
Gosh, what dream was that?

945
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:56,130
What's this?

946
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,579
- Hello.
- Good morning.

947
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:21,018
Doctor.

948
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:22,960
- Gosh!
- What's wrong?

949
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:25,729
Oh, I've been... I...

950
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,629
My face has been getting larger,
so I've been getting massages...

951
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,630
just on this one side.

952
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:32,468
How about you? Why don't you
get massages? You totally should.

953
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:34,869
You of all people. Of course, you should.

954
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,349
I'm sure it's because of this.

955
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:54,690
So Jin...

956
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,190
How do I find this person?

957
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:01,658
(Ms. Yoo Young A, prenatal test results)

958
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:02,900
I should work, though.

959
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,799
(Sim Yeon Woo)

960
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,868
- Yes, Dr. Sim.
- Ms. Yoo Young A's prenatal tests.

961
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,210
I'll check them at the genetics center.

962
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,989
Become uglier!

963
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:32,059
Become uglier!

964
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,429
Become hairy!

965
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:37,699
Gosh.

966
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,670
Who are you?

967
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:46,510
Hey, BK.

968
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:48,639
I just arrived.

969
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:50,710
I'll be right there. Okay.

970
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,629
We'll have a meeting with the doctor...

971
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:08,598
from Sim General Hospital
that's going to be working with us.

972
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,659
Come to the auditorium.

973
00:57:10,099 --> 00:57:11,369
"Sim General Hospital"?

974
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:14,300
"Sim General Hospital"?

975
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:18,269
Sim General Hospital!

976
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:21,339
You know, Sim General
Hospital in Cheongdam-dong?

977
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,309
Sim Yeon Woo!

978
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:24,809
What was that?

979
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,159
I'm busy.

980
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:41,260
So Ri, the day I got drunk, tell
me everything that happened.

981
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,199
It would be better not to hear it.

982
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,170
You could totally get sued over this.

983
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,339
I doubt that.

984
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,239
I'm not someone who
acts out after getting drunk.

985
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,610
Do you really want to know?

986
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:58,349
Hey.

987
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,279
You are my destiny.

988
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,750
Things like that don't exist, Li Na.

989
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:06,550
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

990
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,389
Become uglier.

991
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,989
Become hairy!

992
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,799
I must be really crazy!

993
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,598
I must seriously be crazy.

994
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,609
I knew I would end up
doing this! I really went crazy!

995
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,639
I must be crazy!

996
00:58:27,909 --> 00:58:31,150
But why don't I remember his face?

997
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,828
I must be crazy!

998
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:48,558
What do I do?

999
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,098
- This is driving me crazy.
- Hey.

1000
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,099
- You're here.
- Hi.

1001
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,299
- Have a good day.
- Yes, sir.

1002
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,369
(Hair loss, it's now
time to treat it with DNA.)

1003
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,869
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

1004
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,639
What is it this time?

1005
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,609
A Ri, it wasn't a dream.
I remember everything!

1006
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,448
I think I sprayed Super Teol on that guy.

1007
00:59:06,449 --> 00:59:07,480
What?

1008
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,480
Who is that man?

1009
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,589
Sim Yeon Woo.

1010
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,518
But I don't remember his face.

1011
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:15,259
How could you not remember?

1012
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,690
That's what's driving me crazy.

1013
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,989
Hey, wait.

1014
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,698
Dr. Sim says he has
arrived. He'll be here soon.

1015
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:24,000
What? Dr. Sim?

1016
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,639
Oh, there he is now.

1017
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:34,079
Here, Dr. Sim Yeon Woo. Over here.

1018
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,250
"Sim Yeon Woo"?

1019
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,210
Dr. Sim Yeon Woo. Over here.

1020
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,090
When someone says that it's destiny,

1021
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,889
they're saying that with
their lives on the line.

1022
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,800
A guy like you doesn't deserve to be loved!

1023
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,840
Darn it.

1024
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:22,449
(DNA Lover)

1025
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,149
Women can tell a man's immunity gene...

1026
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,189
for the sake of her children.

1027
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:28,518
Se Hee! This is a perfume
I made with the scents...

1028
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,859
of my favorite things.

1029
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:32,829
If there's a man who smells
like this, you have to bark.

1030
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,500
Where are you going? Se Hee!

1031
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,960
You must've just broken
up with your boyfriend.

1032
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,428
It's fine. I've just found a new boyfriend.

1033
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,038
- Just now?
- I caught you.

1034
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:42,099
You're interested in me.

1035
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,138
Dr. Sim?

1036
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,139
We've met, right?

1037
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,510
Your Super Teol is
causing my DNA to mutate.

1038
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,610
I think I like her,

1039
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,010
but I don't like her.

1040
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:54,379
Ms. Han So Jin.

1041
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,820
Find me the antidote to Super Teol.
