(DNA Lover)

(Choi Si Won)

(DNA Lover)

7
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,508
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

8
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:37,939
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,309
You may not see him now,

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,109
but the Lord, who has risen again, is always with us...

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,979
through the Holy Spirit.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,519
He protects us when we are exhausted from life...

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,990
and consoles us. We live as we are reminded of this.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,489
The Lord said his country...

15
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,590
is not a part of this world.

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,298
Therefore, the people who live in the celestial country...

17
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,928
where the Lord is king...

18
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,769
live in this world...

19
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,170
but are not a part of this world.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,139
The people of the land where the Lord is king...

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,810
listen to his words,

22
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,980
keep his words in their hearts,

23
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:15,649
and live as they stay true to his words.

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,848
How did you come here?

25
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:18,879
I have something to ask the Almighty.

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,389
What might that be?

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,749
To our Lord who comforts us...

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,419
He has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

29
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,559
- Within his embrace... - From the man of my pheromones.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,229
- What pressures and oppresses us... - Oh, dear Lord.

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,329
Let us escape from those and find peace. Let us pray.

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,370
- Amen. - Amen.

33
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,238
Who on earth is the one...

34
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,310
who will heal and comfort me, dear Lord?

35
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:49,078
I look forward to your homily next weekend as well.

36
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,780
Sure, have a safe trip home.

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,549
Let's go.

38
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,459
- Father. - We are...

39
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,059
Thank you. Have a safe trip home.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
Thank you.

41
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Sister.

42
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,340
You come often, but you only ever sit in the very back.

43
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,909
Oh, I...

44
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,810
Goodbye.

45
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,120
There's no way.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,560
No, something is wrong.

47
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,530
His immune system was a perfect match for me.

48
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,770
So Jin, aren't you getting ready to go to work?

49
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,580
(Phosphoric acid)

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,218
Oh Sang Min was nothing but a preview.

51
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,319
This man...

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,789
What's the answer?

53
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,259
What should I do?

54
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,429
What do you mean, what should you do?

55
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,830
It's highly likely that your DNA lover has the cheaters' gene.

56
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,999
Just admit it.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,870
If you admit it, you'll find comfort.

58
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,669
A cheater is my DNA lover?

59
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:23,438
Then, I'll get involved with a cheater again.

60
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,979
I'll get hurt again and break up again.

61
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:30,009
No! That can't happen.

62
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,388
That can't happen!

63
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,750
(Healer gene)

64
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,520
This can't be true.

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,560
Not this time.

66
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,959
Why did it have to be him?

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,330
(Episode 4: The Healer Gene)

68
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,399
The OBGYN Department of Sim General Hospital...

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,039
consider the parents and child our utmost priority.

70
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,669
From pregnancy to childbirth, we are there for the pain and worry...

71
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,679
of the expectant mothers. And in the process of childbirth,

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,680
we are always trying hard so that you can trust us.

73
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,650
Medical staff with vast experience are on call 24-7.

74
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,819
We, at Sim Hospital's OBGYN Department,

75
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,289
take care of all your needs after giving birth.

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,259
Haeng Un's mom hasn't called yet, right?

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,230
Gosh, that lady is so...

78
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,328
I mean, where has she gone when she's not even recovered yet?

79
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,300
Did you contact the priest who came in as her guardian?

80
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,810
Yes, he was the one who paid for all her care too.

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,310
He must be searching for Haeng Un's mom everywhere.

82
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,378
Oh, Nurse Park called.

83
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:39,649
Haeng Un was sick all night, so they moved him to Intensive Care.

84
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,420
Let's go there together.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,160
Together...

86
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,959
Dear Lord, please protect our beloved child with your grace.

87
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,529
In Jesus' name we pray.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Amen.

89
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,339
You might actually become Haeng Un's father at this rate.

90
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,680
How is Haeng Un doing?

91
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,578
He did have a rough night,

92
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,120
but I'm sure he'll pull through, knowing you're so worried.

93
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,589
This is the priest I just mentioned.

94
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,759
I've heard a lot about you.

95
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,128
I'm Haeng Un's doctor, Sim Yeon Woo.

96
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,529
I'm Father Andrea.

97
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,198
Thank you for all your efforts,

98
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,430
but if we can't get in touch with the mother by next week,

99
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,599
Haeng Un will be going to a child welfare facility.

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,670
He'll be put up for adoption right away.

101
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,869
Adoption?

102
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,980
Yes, he will meet good parents who won't abandon him this time.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,209
And he'll have so much luck, just like what his name means.

104
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,850
Anyway,

105
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,350
please pray for him, Father.

106
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:50,620
- Of course. - Bye, then.

107
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,879
Those are marsh marigolds.

108
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,480
Can you tell at first glance?

109
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,489
You sure know everything, Dr. Sim.

110
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,749
Who sent them?

111
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,160
It didn't say who they were from,

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,219
but Ms. Oh handed out juices...

113
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,889
because she gave birth today.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,730
Maybe she sent you a flower pot instead.

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,300
That eye shape must be the logo of the flower shop.

116
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,268
Oh, there will be a pre-meeting...

117
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:39,698
with the genetics center about the lecture.

118
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,839
- Okay, Dr. Sim. - All right.

119
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,949
Why is she so quiet today?

120
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,079
The test results must be out already.

121
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:56,719
Right, so this is the most important item...

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,459
for today.

123
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,258
We'll be doing a project with Sim General Hospital...

124
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,458
where we give an information session about freezing eggs and pregnancy.

125
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,500
So, we'll be sending someone...

126
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:09,698
to consult and give a lecture...

127
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,299
on DNA testing to Sim Hospital.

128
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,039
Ms. Yoon. How does that sound?

129
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,008
I have a conference with the women's cancer specialist center.

130
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,309
A conference?

131
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,879
Then...

132
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,379
Ms. Han, you can go.

133
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,019
Ms. Han?

134
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,589
Yes? Right.

135
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,559
I'm in charge of the prenatal tests for Sim Hospital.

136
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,328
- I'm busy. - Right.

137
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,659
You've worked with Sim Hospital the whole time,

138
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,599
so you could work with them again for this event.

139
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,769
That'd be perfect, right?

140
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,500
Right...

141
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,620
Then, I'll go with A Ri.

142
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,790
A Ri?

143
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,519
Will you be able to go?

144
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,529
Don't worry, Bi Kei.

145
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,829
I'll take good care of A Ri and wrap up the event.

146
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,430
I'd be so glad if A Ri could go with you.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
Then, I'll take it that no one has any objections.

148
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,240
Let's finish today's meeting.

149
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,939
Hey!

150
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,480
I mean...

151
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,949
Why must I suffer amongst throngs of strangers for days?

152
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,749
He has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

153
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,550
so I just can't face him yet.

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,549
Then, just date him.

155
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,919
Anyway, I'm not going.

156
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:42,490
I'm not sure I can date the guy with that gene!

157
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,329
What am I supposed to do?

158
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,529
It must've been hard.

159
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,299
Next time, don't wear sneakers. Wear slip-ons instead, okay?

160
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,999
And don't ever wear socks by yourself.

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,169
And don't clip your toenails.

162
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,869
What good is your husband?

163
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,480
He's there so you can make him do these things.

164
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,779
Well, let me know if there's anything you need.

165
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,330
What's with that cheesy gaze?

166
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,559
Well...

167
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,299
A doctor should be nice to his patient.

168
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,369
As we can now test for the fetus' illnesses and growth...

169
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,539
before the birth, which we had no way of knowing before,

170
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,809
it has become possible to treat these illnesses early...

171
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:34,409
and for the mothers to choose.

172
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,849
Especially, by working with Iroun Genetic Center,

173
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,949
we've increased pregnancy rates,

174
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,149
and we are now able to share the choices and joys of mothers.

175
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,220
Here to consult with us on DNA testing...

176
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,459
and to help us with the lecture, we have Team Leader Han So Jin...

177
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,928
and Researcher Son A Ri from Iroun Genetics Center.

178
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,429
Please give them a round of applause.

179
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,470
They're only interested in the bonus.

180
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,879
Are they just here for him to keep them on the hook?

181
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,039
"Keep them on the hook?"

182
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,949
Even among unmarried women,

183
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,350
there have been increased interests in freezing their eggs.

184
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,819
Harvesting one's eggs when one is in the best condition...

185
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,648
and keeping them frozen...

186
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,090
until one can get pregnant at the time one wants to...

187
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,830
could be an obvious right as a woman.

188
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,258
Selecting healthy embryos through the PGT test,

189
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,829
and increasing the success rate for pregnancy...

190
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,739
may lead to a higher chance of having a healthy baby.

191
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,340
Especially, the PGT-A test.

192
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,138
Expecting mothers who are older in age and those with histories...

193
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:37,008
of failure in IVF...

194
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,480
are recommended to take this test.

195
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:41,679
So, Sim Hospital and the genetics center...

196
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,419
have decided to hold an information session for our members.

197
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,519
Ms. Han So Jin?

198
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,419
Ms. Han So Jin?

199
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,959
- Yes. - You said you would give...

200
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,689
the lecture on genetic diagnostic tests...

201
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,599
in the preimplantation stage, correct?

202
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes, PGT, the preimplantation genetic test,

203
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,469
is the test we do in IVF procedures...

204
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,969
in cases where the parents...

205
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,469
have been confirmed to have genetic illnesses...

206
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,638
in the preimplantation phase.

207
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,908
She must have the test results.

208
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,908
But she hasn't even called.

209
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,220
And she came all this way, but didn't even mention it.

210
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,479
What's this?

211
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,619
The PGT-SR, and PGT-M...

212
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,019
will be available in order.

213
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,329
We're so looking forward to it, Ms. Han So Jin.

214
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,659
Give her another round of applause.

215
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,440
(Cooperation Conference Hall)

216
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,979
Why are you putting me in a tight spot by bringing me here?

217
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,279
Then should I have come alone?

218
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,950
Oh, my.

219
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,190
- Are you okay? - Yes.

220
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,190
So annoying.

221
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,528
He must've flirted with so many people...

222
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:05,700
that all these women see him as a man, not a colleague.

223
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,700
- Seriously. - Gosh.

224
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,939
- He's coming! The cheater! - Let's get going.

225
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
Okay.

226
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,909
- Hurry! - Hurry.

227
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,379
What's wrong with her?

228
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,309
(Yeo Jung Tam)

229
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,250
Yes?

230
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,190
- Hello. - Hello.

231
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,690
Hey, aren't you the guy I met at the gym before?

232
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,330
You...

233
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,929
remember me.

234
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,429
- Right. - Yes.

235
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,740
I wasn't sure it was you when I saw your name on the chart.

236
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,408
I'll officially introduce myself.

237
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,739
I'm Endocrinologist Yeo Jung Tam.

238
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,840
- Hello. - Hello.

239
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,148
- Have a seat here. - Oh, that's okay!

240
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,350
Yes, have a seat.

241
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,950
- Thank you. - Of course.

242
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,360
Right.

243
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,919
Oh, but...

244
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,460
you want to have female hormone shots?

245
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,230
Oh, yes.

246
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,329
Maybe it's because of the martial arts competition I'm preparing for,

247
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,269
but I haven't had my period for two and a half months.

248
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,799
I see.

249
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,008
I'm sure it's because of a hypothalamic-pituitary imbalance.

250
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,139
It's quite common, so you don't have to worry.

251
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,778
Instead of a hormone shot, you should get a shot...

252
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,339
to induce your period first...

253
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,350
No. I want to get that shot, no matter what.

254
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:33,149
I want to have the female hormone shot.

255
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,990
But why? Is there a particular reason for it?

256
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,460
Well...

257
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,789
Feel free to tell me.

258
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,529
Actually,

259
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,600
ever since I was little, I was told I was very boyish.

260
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,970
I see.

261
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:55,139
I don't think I've liked boys like other girls.

262
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,779
So, sometimes, I wonder if I really am a woman.

263
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,079
Who? You?

264
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Yes.

265
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,320
I'm not sure what you mean...

266
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,128
You're the coolest woman I've ever seen.

267
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,559
If you don't know that...

268
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,929
I mean, how could you not know that?

269
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,038
I'll help treat you on the part you're concerned about.

270
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,139
Don't worry.

271
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,639
- Thank you. - Sure.

272
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,518
Didn't you hear the alarm?

273
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,120
Is the emergency speaker just for decoration?

274
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,960
You can't just remove it.

275
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,009
(March 7, livestreaming day)

276
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,480
- Hey, Mi Eun. - Yeon Woo.

277
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,350
There was a fire in my building.

278
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,749
What? A fire?

279
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,320
Yes, but...

280
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,019
I also met a brave fireman.

281
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,419
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

282
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,230
You should check that in person.

283
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,129
To celebrate me having a near-death experience,

284
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,898
buy me something delicious.

285
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,399
Gosh, what a relief.

286
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,830
What do you want to eat?

287
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,799
Well...

288
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,239
Sushi?

289
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,970
I'll have dinner before I go home.

290
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,840
The truck is coming today.

291
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,379
No.

292
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,850
The hillside tornado potato skewer is not your ordinary potato.

293
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,179
The food truck owner...

294
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,749
farmed the potatoes himself on high altitude in Gangwon Province...

295
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,619
with much love and care. And he prepped them himself too.

296
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,919
They are sumi potatoes.

297
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,329
Sadly, he tours around the country...

298
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,459
so he only comes...

299
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,169
only on the 1st and 3rd Fridays in front of our church.

300
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,340
Those soft high-altitude potatoes...

301
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,940
that are sweet but fresh as well.

302
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:09,710
They're cut in perfect thickness and spacing as designed by the owner.

303
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,340
The perfect temperature of the oil and seasoning.

304
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:13,809
Getting to...

305
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,750
see all of this in person...

306
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,350
is a grace from the Almighty.

307
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,490
I will see you later.

308
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,359
- Yes, here you go. Enjoy. - Thank you.

309
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,559
Get home safely.

310
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,099
- Yes, there you go. - I hope business goes well.

311
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,229
- Bye. - Bye.

312
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,529
Yes, hello. What would you like?

313
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,000
The honey butter flavor.

314
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,898
- Honey butter? - Yes.

315
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,340
You ordered one honey butter flavor.

316
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,480
- Here you go. Bye. - Thank you.

317
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,679
Hello, which flavor would you like?

318
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,149
One original, please.

319
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,049
A great choice.

320
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,820
It's very hot. Be careful.

321
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:57,918
Yes, thank you.

322
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,320
Get home safely.

323
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,489
- Yes, hello. - Hello.

324
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,589
I'll one honey butter flavor.

325
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,229
I'm sorry, but we're all out of ingredients now.

326
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,230
You can come back in two weeks.

327
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,328
- Gosh, are you okay? - Sorry.

328
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,369
- Sorry, are you okay? - Are you okay? I'm sorry.

329
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,369
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

330
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,069
- Sorry! - Sorry.

331
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,740
My high-altitude...

332
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,079
Are you okay?

333
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,779
Sister Anna. You can have this.

334
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,650
(Gangwon Province High-altitude Hillside Tornado Potato Skewers)

335
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,019
It's fine. You can have it.

336
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:08,960
Thank you.

337
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,759
Thank you.

338
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,209
Dad.

339
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,509
- You're here. - Yes.

340
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,509
Dad, I'm here. Hey, Yeon Woo.

341
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,649
You're here.

342
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,818
You save people during the day...

343
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:35,649
and help your dad at night. When do you have time to date?

344
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,518
I know, Yeon Woo. You should set Kang Hoon up with a girl.

345
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,959
This crazy punk won't date.

346
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
Why don't you date?

347
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,229
I said I didn't want to start something...

348
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,700
I can't be responsible for.

349
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,659
Hey, punk. Are we in the Joseon Dynasty?

350
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,268
Why does the time period matter when it's all about people's lives?

351
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:52,338
But you age faster than most people. You have to hurry and get married.

352
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,740
We'll all grow old anyway. Why does the speed matter?

353
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,209
Also, I take after you.

354
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,179
If you take after me, you shouldn't look so old.

355
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,379
I look old because I look like you.

356
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,879
He does look old, right?

357
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,579
He does look a bit older than me.

358
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:03,880
Seriously.

359
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,219
- Did you come alone? - Someone will join me.

360
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,250
Who?

361
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,990
Look. There she is.

362
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,420
Hey, Yeon Woo.

363
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,529
Wait.

364
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,859
- Wait. - Oh, my.

365
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,759
What a coincidence meeting my savior here.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,429
Your savior? Do you two know each other?

367
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,298
I told you there was a brave firefighter who saved me.

368
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:27,069
- I see. - She's the life I saved yesterday.

369
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,410
I see.

370
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,440
Let me introduce you. This is...

371
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,338
my closest friend, Seo Kang Hoon.

372
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,250
- This is... - Oh, Seo Kang Hoon?

373
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,119
Hello. I'm Jang Mi Eun.

374
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:40,719
Did you fix the emergency announcement speaker?

375
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,890
Not yet.

376
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,450
That's the perfect spot to hang a painting, you see.

377
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,990
You're hanging a painting where the speaker should be?

378
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,930
I'm joking. I fixed it.

379
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,899
Yesterday, I saw you were burning incense with the windows closed.

380
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,900
Please remember that incense...

381
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,470
makes more carbon monoxide than regular candles.

382
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,940
You can't burn incense for more than 15 minutes.

383
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,139
Yeon Woo. Is he always full of worries like this?

384
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,210
He's gotten a lot better. Let's sit down.

385
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:06,910
I see.

386
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,250
Gosh.

387
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,018
But why is he working at a sushi restaurant?

388
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,719
He's helping out his father's store.

389
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,150
Oh, that's his father.

390
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,589
This is such a nice place.

391
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,920
I'll come often from now on.

392
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,470
How old are you?

393
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,970
It must be a secret.

394
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,140
He's 28, no, 29.

395
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,149
He's a baby.

396
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,480
I'm not a baby, and I don't like semi-casual speech.

397
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:47,118
- What do you want to eat? - One salmon and tuna set.

398
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,390
And a warm sake.

399
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,250
Okay.

400
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,759
He's not the one.

401
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,099
He'll never fall for you.

402
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,599
I'll tie it for you.

403
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,439
I take after you.

404
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
This boy.

405
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,868
Guys like him become very bold...

406
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,779
once they cross the line.

407
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,019
People have the right to be forgotten.

408
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,920
You don't even remember properly, and you've already forgotten?

409
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,900
What are you thinking about?

410
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,359
It's nothing.

411
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,069
Oh, I know.

412
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,269
That otaku researcher?

413
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,000
No.

414
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,008
If someone has to receive prenatal education,

415
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,650
I believe the husband has to be the one to get prenatal education...

416
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,518
during pregnancy.

417
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,920
The mother will feel the happiest when she feels...

418
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,450
safely protected and loved by her husband,

419
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,920
and the fetus in her stomach will feel all of that.

420
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,389
Rather than during the dating phase,

421
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,899
I believe pregnancy is when a woman can know and see...

422
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,829
her husband's noble and pure love.

423
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,470
Why does a guy like this...

424
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,569
have the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene?

425
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Why?

426
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,640
Why?

427
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,009
Official statements and personal lives are different.

428
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,579
Men who say overly beautiful things...

429
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,779
are not to be trusted easily.

430
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,059
Could it be that his Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

431
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:36,259
went into a dormant state after experiencing...

432
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,329
countless miracles of birth as a gynecologist?

433
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,869
What a beautiful story.

434
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:26,680
Have you been well?

435
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:33,450
Will you come to this lecture?

436
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,650
You do well on your own. I don't need to be there.

437
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,288
I'm thinking of hosting...

438
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,829
a prenatal genetics counseling symposium early next year.

439
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,829
I see. I think...

440
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,170
you could put Dr. Choi in charge of that.

441
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,099
Next year, I'm going to take a break from working at the hospital.

442
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,368
- Take a break? - I need to have some fun...

443
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,970
before starting my own hospital.

444
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,709
Start your own hospital? This hospital is yours.

445
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,079
No way.

446
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,349
I can't be a gynecologist forever.

447
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,249
What's your schedule like this evening? Should we have dinner?

448
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,450
I have plans.

449
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:13,519
Oh, is that so?

450
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,430
If so, let's have dinner together soon.

451
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,500
Let's do that.

452
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,839
Right, Chief Director. I guess you're going to date this woman...

453
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:34,380
for a while.

454
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:42,289
I never planned to have a short relationship.

455
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,289
If you're my son,

456
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:48,289
you won't be able to live with a woman who you don't love.

457
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,500
Not all women are the same.

458
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,069
There is a woman somewhere that will make you go crazy.

459
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,569
See you later.

460
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,730
Oh, this addiction.

461
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,269
I will never eat rose carbonara again. Gosh.

462
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,190
Are you okay?

463
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,559
I'm okay.

464
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,740
Ms. Yeom Jang Mi.

465
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,568
I see that you signed up...

466
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,269
for the anti-aging food therapy program.

467
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:13,579
You are quite underweight.

468
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:15,209
I think food therapy is too much...

469
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,680
I don't like having excess fat.

470
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:18,950
Excess fat?

471
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,619
Your body fat percentage is way lower than the average range.

472
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,118
Just do it for me.

473
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:27,660
Also, you can't take appetite suppressants like this.

474
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,629
The hormonal imbalance could cause depression...

475
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,000
I get it, so just...

476
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,130
So just do it for me.

477
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,670
My husband doesn't like women with excess fat.

478
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,240
He likes women who look like models.

479
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:44,269
Not wrinkly, sagging skin like mine.

480
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,779
There's a girl younger than my son by my husband.

481
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,920
How do you think he'll feel...

482
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,549
looking at me?

483
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:05,328
Your husband...

484
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:06,400
At first,

485
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:10,599
he seemed he would only care about me.

486
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,569
He didn't know much about women,

487
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,940
and he couldn't drink.

488
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,509
But...

489
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,049
when I got pregnant, he cheated for the first time.

490
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,348
It was barely an affair.

491
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:31,758
He got caught very soon and begged for forgiveness.

492
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,160
But that was just the beginning.

493
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,058
Those men are the problem.

494
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,399
Men who look for other women...

495
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,528
because their wives gained weight after having kids.

496
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:42,399
They get old too, but they hate it when women get old.

497
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,930
Those jerks!

498
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,508
Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene holders are the axis of evil.

499
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,109
I will crush these axis-of-evil men.

500
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,450
Do you think Mr. Sewer is part of the axis of evil?

501
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,400
Who are you?

502
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,700
Who keeps talking about me?

503
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,670
Gosh.

504
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,769
(Sim General Hospital)

505
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,879
Da Mi. Listen to me.

506
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,179
So who is that girl?

507
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,618
I thought you broke up. Why is she messaging you?

508
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,318
She's always been a super obsessive person.

509
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,518
Do you know what her nickname is?

510
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,149
It's French Bulldog.

511
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,189
Ruff, ruff.

512
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,858
Once she bites, she never lets go.

513
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:43,529
If so, call her right now.

514
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:46,598
So I can hear her say whether you're dating or not.

515
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,159
You're the only one for me.

516
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,999
What should I do? Should I write a blood note?

517
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,268
Call her now, you punk!

518
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:53,539
I'll call her.

519
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,009
Ms. Kim Hee Yeon.

520
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,440
What are you doing?

521
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:02,980
Is that you, Hee Yeon?

522
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,250
Yes, So Jin.

523
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,420
Oh Sang Min is in front of me right now.

524
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,190
I was curious if you two were happily dating.

525
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,490
Why is Sang Min with you?

526
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,618
Oh, we just ran into each other.

527
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,529
I see. Of course, we're happy together.

528
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,259
We're going to Iceland next month to see the aurora borealis.

529
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,369
Oh Sang Min. Were you cheating on me?

530
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,868
You asked me to go to Iceland too!

531
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,509
Sang Min. Who are you with right now?

532
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,369
Who is that woman?

533
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,279
Hello?

534
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:37,108
Hey, Oh Sang Min. When you broke up with me,

535
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,018
you told me you found true love.

536
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:40,249
You said that was Hee Yeon.

537
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,919
And now you're cheating on Hee Yeon with another woman?

538
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,389
- Shut it. - That's what you were always doing.

539
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,019
How many girls did you cheat on me with?

540
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,559
Forget it. I don't even want to know.

541
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,599
I don't even want to recall the times I spent...

542
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,429
dating pieces of trash like you.

543
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,500
I told you to shut it.

544
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,339
I won't let you get away with this, Han So Jin. Just wait.

545
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,569
Da Mi!

546
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,308
Da Mi. Wait.

547
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:06,839
I didn't mean that.

548
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,048
- Stop that. - Wait. You can't just go like this.

549
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,049
Please.

550
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,859
Yes. I should give up here.

551
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,460
If I fall for a cheater, that'll be the end of me.

552
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,730
(Sim General Hospital)

553
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,499
The results of your DNA test.

554
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,038
Mr. Sim Yeon Woo possesses DRD4-7R,

555
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:38,210
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

556
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:42,450
With seven Indecent Octopus Tentacle Genes,

557
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,650
you are in the second percentile in the whole world.

558
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,348
What I'd like to suggest to you...

559
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,920
is meditation and temple stays to reflect on yourself.

560
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,759
Foods that I don't suggest...

561
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,589
are eels, chives, oysters, and more.

562
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,798
What is she talking about?

563
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,700
Gosh. This isn't right.

564
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,869
(Samil-dong Intersection)

565
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:12,939
Ms. Han. I need an explanation. Where are you?

566
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,910
Let's meet at the park we met at before.

567
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,380
- Ms. Han So Jin. - Yes?

568
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,709
I need an explanation...

569
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,109
on the test results you sent earlier.

570
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,778
- An explanation... - Isn't that...

571
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:55,920
what you should do as a researcher?

572
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Yes.

573
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,730
Even if...

574
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:09,399
my partner gets sick...

575
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
with a rare or terminal illness,

576
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:16,170
I'm going to do everything with my partner.

577
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:17,410
But...

578
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,210
I can't date a guy with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

579
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,880
I just agreed to the test,

580
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,150
but while you were running the DNA test,

581
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,680
you already dated me.

582
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,630
I don't know what those indecent octopus tentacles did to you,

583
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,960
but you need to put trash in the trashcan.

584
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,129
If you always hold onto your wounds,

585
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,200
you won't be able to meet a good person.

586
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,200
For someone who was too sincere about that love,

587
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,739
some wounds can last forever.

588
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,278
You can only get wounds if you allow it to happen.

589
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,279
I...

590
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,319
run these tests because I don't want to get hurt.

591
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,419
I no longer want to hurt...

592
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,750
from wounds I didn't agree to getting.

593
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,220
Going forward,

594
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,559
I'm going to continue to test all men that I date.

595
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,930
Over people's feelings... No.

596
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,529
Over my feelings,

597
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,269
I trust DNA.

598
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,670
DNA is the only thing that doesn't change.

599
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,980
I feel a bit flabbergasted and wronged.

600
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:35,519
You don't know anything about me,

601
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,289
but you labeled me a cheater before even starting anything.

602
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,329
You might not cheat right now,

603
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,359
but you'll definitely...

604
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,630
cheat...

605
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,930
one day.

606
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,239
You might have affairs until you die...

607
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,410
if your gene manifests you.

608
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,609
It's not about having an affair or not.

609
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,579
It's a matter of time.

610
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,950
That's why...

611
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,050
I can't start anything...

612
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,889
with someone with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

613
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,859
I'm sure I told you that that's not how men and women...

614
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,730
are supposed to get to know each other.

615
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,730
Other than my Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

616
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
what do you know about me?

617
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,599
I trust DNA.

618
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,670
If you're my son,

619
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,679
you won't be able to live with a woman who you don't love.

620
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:37,879
If you're the kind of person who judges people easily...

621
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,079
and makes decisions based on those judgments,

622
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,550
I'm also no longer interested.

623
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,139
What?

624
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,739
Hold on.

625
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,179
Yeon Woo.

626
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,250
We keep running into each other.

627
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,150
Aren't you here with someone?

628
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,719
Go to the guy who's waiting for you.

629
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,289
I want to be alone today.

630
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,828
Give me a glass of the one...

631
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:35,260
- I was keeping. - Okay.

632
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:37,230
Did something happen?

633
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,670
Nothing happened.

634
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,969
I just feel angry for some reason.

635
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:45,579
Mi Eun.

636
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:47,210
Yes?

637
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,849
Do you also think I'm a Casanova?

638
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,519
Well, I think you're good at noticing...

639
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,489
when women look their prettiest.

640
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,230
Whether that woman is old or young.

641
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,230
I'm sure the women you dated can't forget you.

642
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,500
So why do things always end so badly?

643
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,229
All relationships end badly.

644
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,869
Relationships are dirty. That's how love is.

645
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,510
But...

646
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,209
who is making you so worried?

647
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,309
Seriously.

648
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,380
She's strangely bothering me.

649
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,820
Cheers.

650
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:33,519
What about him?

651
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
He's a guy who knows we'll break up...

652
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,329
as soon as he comes here to get me.

653
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,800
I'll listen to some music before I go home today.

654
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
So Jin.

655
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,019
- Hey. - Why are you up there again?

656
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,679
What are you doing there?

657
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,400
Kang Hoon.

658
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:18,699
Yes. Tell me what's going on.

659
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,969
Do you also think so?

660
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:27,139
That you need to break up when you feel sorry...

661
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,210
and sad?

662
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,050
That's when you're supposed to break up.

663
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,579
When you feel sorry and sad.

664
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:37,219
Not when you feel sick of someone and so angry at them.

665
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,920
What do you mean by that?

666
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,860
I just remembered...

667
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,130
someone saying that.

668
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,630
Who said that?

669
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,500
I guess I'm bad at deciding when to break up with someone.

670
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:57,510
I can never...

671
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,840
break up with a guy until we're fighting like crazy.

672
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:02,679
So this time,

673
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,679
I found the right chance to end things before that.

674
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
But...

675
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,690
I still don't feel great.

676
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,868
Oh, you fool.

677
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:25,429
You have so much going on in your head.

678
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,739
You did something dumb again, didn't you?

679
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,239
When are you going to stop doing things you regret?

680
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,569
It's not like that.

681
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,110
I've been very busy lately with my experiments.

682
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,049
Experiments to find my DNA lover.

683
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,619
I told you not to test people.

684
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,690
"Experiments are the only way..."

685
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:49,090
"to truly learn."

686
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:51,989
Leonardo da Vinci.

687
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
Han So Jin.

688
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,230
What?

689
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,369
You can't find fate...

690
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,969
through experiments.

691
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,139
When you get to know the person, you can see your fate.

692
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,920
Let's go.

693
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,150
Here.

694
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,199
Did you change your fabric softener?

695
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,739
You smell like flowers.

696
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:37,469
- Hey. - Gosh.

697
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,078
Don't say things like that to other guys, okay?

698
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,519
They're going to think you're a pervert.

699
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,550
I've already been told that.

700
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,859
Aren't you being too lazy about exercising these days?

701
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,789
You fell over while trying to hold me.

702
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:58,488
Maybe you grew this way and that way.

703
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,459
Look here. I stopped growing when I was 16,

704
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,899
and my weight has also stayed the same.

705
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,230
Oh, has it?

706
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:05,899
Is that why your eye for men...

707
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,300
also stayed the same since you were in elementary school?

708
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:08,769
- Hey. - Gosh.

709
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,369
Come on.

710
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,979
There is a gene that pulls down...

711
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,380
the holder to suffering.

712
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,809
If you know someone...

713
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,480
with such a gene,

714
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,449
it's best to cut ties with them.

715
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,360
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

716
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,259
Say hello, Ms. Han. This is Dr. Sim Yeon Woo.

717
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,900
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

718
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,979
This is my original hair. This is the super hair.

719
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,110
Will touching it help...

720
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,090
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

721
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,590
Open up.

722
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:04,659

727

OPTG7...

728
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,179
What? This is the optimistic gene.

729
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,820
Does Mr. Sim have the optimistic gene?

730
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:05,289
Really?

731
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,989
Each person is born with a weakness-like gene...

732
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,730
that could make you unhappy.

733
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,199
Good.

734
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,710
And for each of us,

735
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,239
there exists someone...

736
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,110
with a gene that could heal us.

737
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,750
I call that gene...

738
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:38,519
the healer.

739
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,389
I call it the healer gene.

740
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,400
There are countless men as many as the stars,

741
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:50,599
and I've found the man with a healer gene for me.

742
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,099
OPTG7...

743
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,569
is the healer gene...

744
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,969
that could heal my dying gene.

745
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,849
That man with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

746
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,219
was my healer.

747
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,788
If you're the kind of person who judges people easily...

748
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:15,989
and makes decisions based on those judgments,

749
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,030
I'm also no longer interested.

750
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:28,170
But it's over between us now.

751
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,909
Sinhon has such a loud heartbeat.

752
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,320
Don't you think so?

753
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:43,849
It sure does.

754
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:47,289
Ms. Heo, your prenatal test result will come out tomorrow.

755
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,829
You can come directly to the genetic center.

756
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:52,090
The nurse will tell you the location and the time.

757
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,400
- Yes, Doctor. - See you tomorrow.

758
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,510
That flower pot is really beautiful.

759
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:21,719
(Happiness will surely come.)

760
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,280
- So Jin. - No!

761
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,550
Why are you so surprised?

762
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,179
I thought someone was following me.

763
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,420
Don't take this path for a while.

764
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,888
I told you about the college student, right?

765
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:52,319
The abduction was reported on this path.

766
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,360
Should I just stay home?

767
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,189
To you,

768
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,829
every inch of Seoul was a place where some kind of case happened.

769
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,130
Do you have a tracker on me or something?

770
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,630
You're just too predictable.

771
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,739
Do you have your safety alarm with you?

772
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,440
Of course.

773
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,139
Here it is.

774
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,409
Let's go to our restaurant. I'll make you some udon.

775
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:20,619
Gosh.

776
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,698

(Sim Yeon Woo)

778
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,710
Yeon Woo. What brought you here without notice?

779
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,610
It's not like I ever called before.

780
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,809
Take a seat.

781
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,320
Aren't you closed?

782
00:47:26,679 --> 00:47:28,320
You're always welcome here.

783
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,788
- Do you want something? - I'll have an udon.

784
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:31,949
Udon? Just a minute.

785
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Right.

786
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,359
You should come sit with So Jin. You two know each other, right?

787
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,429
- No. - I...

788
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,030
Why are you keeping a distance?

789
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,670
Wait.

790
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:47,570
It's hot. Be careful.

791
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,369
- Thank you. - Here. Enjoy.

792
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,110
Why are you picking at your food?

793
00:47:56,909 --> 00:48:00,550
What? No, I'm not picking at it. I'm eating.

794
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,579
Not again. Here.

795
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,218
You should pull up your sleeve when you eat.

796
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,920
You're going to get soup on it, you clumsy.

797
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,559
Wait.

798
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,789
Hey, isn't this mine?

799
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:13,360
Is it the one I gave you during a high school retreat?

800
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,158
- Did you? - It's so stretched out.

801
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:17,800
You should throw it out now.

802
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:21,300
It's the most comfortable thing on earth. Why would I?

803
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,340
It helps me fall asleep.

804
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,340
I'll buy you a new one.

805
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,710
I know your size, but the color...

806
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,380
You like pink, don't you?

807
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,510
Yes.

808
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:35,448
I remember how you cried when your mom bought So Ri...

809
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,090
a pink bag but you got a blue one.

810
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,859
How do you remember all that?

811
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,219
I was always there when you cried.

812
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:45,689
Although you always cried over nothing.

813
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,599
You cried in front of me too, you know.

814
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:49,029
- Me? - Yes.

815
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,070
No way.

816
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,469
Well...

817
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,469
Anyway, I swear you did.

818
00:49:00,409 --> 00:49:02,010
I should apologize first.

819
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,880
Kang Hoon, I'm going to get going.

820
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:07,419
I enjoyed it. Take care.

821
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,250
- What? Already? - Yes.

822
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,630
She's talking more than usual today.

823
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,340
Good job!

824
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,409
Gosh, that stinks.

825
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:41,250
We have to get a car wash thanks to you.

826
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,050
Do we have to rescue dogs from sewers now?

827
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,919
The whole neighborhood knows that dog is homeless.

828
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,359
It got through a rough patch,

829
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,630
so I'm certain only good things will happen to him now.

830
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,260
Sure. Hurry up and take a shower.

831
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,929
That stench will be on you for a month at least.

832
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,670
Really?

833
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,768
- Here. - Hey!

834
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,369
You're really something.

835
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:05,969
- Good job today. - You too.

836
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,590
Mom.

837
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,889
I didn't expect you.

838
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:35,170
This time, she's even younger than you.

839
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,659
Didn't I introduce you to a lawyer?

840
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,090
Why won't you get a divorce?

841
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,829
That lawyer is talented.

842
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,399
They'll leave Father penniless.

843
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,730
Your father had affairs with countless women,

844
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,570
but he always came home whenever relationships ended.

845
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,670
I'm going to make that happen.

846
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,908
You know my grandfather...

847
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:17,309
and uncles also had affairs.

848
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:22,518
Do you still expect Father to live a different kind of life?

849
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,690
They all returned in the end.

850
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,590
It's in the family gene.

851
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,260
They never abandon the woman who gave birth to their child.

852
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,289
That darn gene talk again.

853
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:47,739
How much longer will you let this ruin you before you stop?

854
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,579
Please, you should start living your own life.

855
00:51:54,949 --> 00:51:56,050
Loving,

856
00:51:57,989 --> 00:52:00,420
blaming, and waiting for your father...

857
00:52:05,389 --> 00:52:06,730
is my life.

858
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,170
There's still no room for me in your life.

859
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,320
I have to see a patient off-site. Please see yourself out.

Well...

868
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:49,459
According to the DNA test, your baby...

869
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,500
It's Sinhon.

870
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:53,000
My baby's nickname is Sinhon.

871
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,039
Okay.

872
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,210
There's a bit of a problem with Sinhon.

873
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,880
Just as you were concerned,

874
00:54:01,579 --> 00:54:03,510
the gene from your father-in-law...

875
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,349
is also in Sinhon.

876
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,019
Are you saying Sinhon will go blind?

877
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,089
No way. That's impossible.

878
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,089
Sinhon's dad has perfect eyes.

879
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,489
We can't conclude that the baby will lose sight.

In terms of RP,

881
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,130
it's diverse in genetic and clinical features.

882
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,869
It could show in the early stages,

883
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,039
but it might not show at all.

884
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:31,340

885
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,440
It's a good thing you found out during your prenatal test.

886
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,749
It's currently in the clinical stage,

887
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,710
but there's a new RP treatment...

888
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,349
using the stem cell currently under development.

889
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,150
This is impossible.

890
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,489
I don't believe it.

891
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:47,489

892
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,730
You have the same genes. How are you fine?

Your face tells me...

894
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,039
you already know...

895
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,909
whose child Sinhon is.

896
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,250
Do you mean...

897
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,119
just like how you came to see me knowing who I am?

898
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,360
This time, she's even younger than you.

899
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,300
Would it be okay for me to ask what your baby nickname was?

900
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,630
I want a son like you.

901
00:55:33,269 --> 00:55:34,699
It was Sinhon.

902
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:38,408
They gave me that nickname because my mother wanted...

903
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:39,940
her and my father to live like newlyweds forever.

904
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,139
Sinhon.

00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,949
That's pretty. I'll use that baby nickname too.

906
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,280
Of course you should know...

907
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,420
since you're family.

908
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,889
"Family?"

909
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,019
I don't know about that.

910
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:56,420
What you're doing now is committing adultery.

911
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,130
No. The chief director and I will soon get married.

912
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,899
He proposed to me.

913
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,159
Does he know you came to see me?

914
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:06,269
Do you think your father wouldn't know?

915
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,710
I grew up without parents while supporting my siblings.

916
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:17,210
He was the only man I met...

917
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:20,178
to have proposed to someone like me.

918
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,579
Let me give you some advice.

919
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,288
His feelings for women change frequently.

920
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:26,389
He also cares...

921
00:56:26,489 --> 00:56:29,289
about his public image.

922
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,730
So I urge you to behave.

923
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,599
Also, I know you don't have any siblings.

924
00:56:43,469 --> 00:56:44,570
How ridiculous.

925
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:47,380
Did you hire someone to investigate me?

926
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,750
I saw many likes of you around him before.

927
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,849
But when you need him the most like right now,

928
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,650
he won't be around.

929
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,789
Are you clueless, or are you acting like you are?

930
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,860
Do you really not see why...

931
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,559
your father gave me his specimen?

932
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,099
What is it? Are you scared?

933
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:12,800
Your house and your hospital will belong to me and Sinhon!

934
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,010
I'm sorry.

935
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:26,179
Please keep today's consultation confidential.

936
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:29,719
- Wait. - It's my parents' personal life.

937
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,349
It has nothing to do with me.

938
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,500
You might not cheat right now,

939
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,170
but you'll definitely cheat one day.

940
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:51,768
You might have affairs until you die...

941
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,780
if your gene manifests you.

942
00:57:54,409 --> 00:57:56,110
It's not about having an affair or not.

943
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,010
It's a matter...

944
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,050
of time.

945
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:08,719
It must have sounded like he'd become his father.

946
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,389
What have I done?

947
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:18,900
Mr. Sim!

948
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:21,739
Mr. Sim!

949
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:25,510
Mr. Sim...

950
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:28,539
Here.

951
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:36,280
If you're not busy today,

952
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:39,420
should we get a drink together?

953
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:40,788
I'll buy.

954
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:42,820
I don't think we're in the position to have drinks.

955
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,090
Then please give me a minute.

956
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,098
I want to apologize. I was...

957
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:50,329
I don't know what it's about, but consider it accepted.

958
00:58:50,469 --> 00:58:52,699
I said that you would cheat one day,

959
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,199
and that you might cheat until you die.

960
00:58:55,969 --> 00:58:57,070
I want to apologize for saying that.

961
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:00,070
It must have sounded like you'd follow your father's steps.

962
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:04,909
But if you find your DNA lover,

963
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:07,249
you'll be able to live differently even with your current DNA.

964
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,679
I told you it's my parents' personal life,

965
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,590
and that it has nothing to do with me.

966
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:16,159
Also, that cheaters' gene and your DNA talk...

967
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,190
don't bother me...

968
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,329
nor do I believe in it.

969
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:27,639
I'll give you a piece of advice, Ms. Han.

970
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,010
All you talk about are DNAs,

971
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:36,340
and that's why you always fail in your relationships.

972
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,349
You should take that into account.

973
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,650
Was I too harsh on her?

974
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,469
Don't take this path for a while.

975
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,198
I told you about the college student, right?

976
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,539
The abduction was reported on this path.

977
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:47,980
It's a safety alarm.

978
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,150
It's no problem from your place and around here to my restaurant.

979
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:53,650
I specially prepared table number zero for you.

980
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:14,809
(Always Sushi)

981
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:26,590
(So Jin)

982
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,429
(So Jin)

983
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,300
(Missed call: So Jin)

984
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,539
So Jin?

985
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:24,848
Kang Hoon, someone's following me!

986
01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:26,150
- Where are you? - I'm...

987
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,150
in front of the traffic lights!

988
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,289
Han So Jin!

989
01:02:34,119 --> 01:02:36,489
Hey! Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

990
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,429
Please... Please help me...

991
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,069
Help me! Help!

992
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,538
Help me...

993
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:53,539
Please...

994
01:02:53,909 --> 01:02:55,309
Please, help me...

995
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,480
Please, help me...

996
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:04,989
Please... Please! Help me!

997
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:09,789
- Please... Please help me! - Ms. Han So Jin!

998
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:13,229
Please help me...

999
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:14,960
- Ms. Han, are you all right? - Help!

1000
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,599
Ms. Han.

1001
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,130
It's me, Sim Yeon Woo.

1002
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:21,900
Ms. Han, are you okay?

1003
01:03:25,869 --> 01:03:26,908
Are you okay?

1004
01:03:26,909 --> 01:03:27,909
So Jin!

1005
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,510
- Did he leave? - Kang Hoon.

1006
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,210
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1007
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,079
- Where did that jerk go? - That way.

1008
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:35,719
- Please look after her. - Okay.

1009
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,670
- Who are you? - Let go of me.

1010
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,440
That hurts!

1011
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,709
I can't believe how low you're stooping!

1012
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,308
What did I do? Well, what did I do?

1013
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:05,710
My information leaked all thanks to Han So Jin.

1014
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,650
My girlfriends dumped me.

1015
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,718
I only came to tell her that.

1016
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,448
I only came to talk!

1017
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:13,519
So Jin almost got hurt because of you!

1018
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:16,420
Hey, it wasn't me who did that.

1019
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,988
She fell on her own!

1020
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:19,058
You jerk!

1021
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,759
- Are you okay? Can you get up? - Yes.

1022
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,760
Okay.

1023
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,400
Have you calmed down?

1024
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:36,309
- Thank you... - What?

1025
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:40,110
Thank you for rescuing me.

1026
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:45,690
I'll take you home.

1027
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:46,789
Wait.

1028
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,090
I know this is random in this situation,

1029
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,800
but there is something I must tell you.

1030
01:04:56,699 --> 01:04:58,969
That Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene you have...

1031
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,800
I told you.

1032
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,599
This isn't the way to get to know someone.

1033
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,638
Aside from my Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

1034
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:08,079
what do you know about me?

1035
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,079
I found out something else.

1036
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,250
Aside from the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

1037
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,349
you have the healer gene.

1038
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,289
That wasn't what I meant.

1039
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,300
Do you still want to talk to me about genes?

1040
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,130
The gene you have...

1041
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:33,729
can save someone who wants to die...

1042
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,599
and make someone who cries all the time to smile.

1043
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:40,440
For someone who has a fatally unlucky gene,

1044
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:41,980
it's...

1045
01:05:42,809 --> 01:05:44,250
It's a gene they really need.

1046
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,119
So...

1047
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,219
I must learn more...

1048
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:53,789
about you.

1049
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,760
Do you want to learn more about me?

1050
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,260
Please let me continue...

1051
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,469
the tests.

1052
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,539
This woman...

1053
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:19,809
keeps calling attraction a test.

1054
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:22,579
This is how...

1055
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,750
you perform a test.

1056
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:14,399
(DNA Lover)

1057
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,699
- Let's go. - Hey.

1058
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,340
Do you like Ms. Han?

1059
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,939
She's like family to me.

1060
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,610
Then mind your own business.

1061
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,250
Family shouldn't come between a man and a woman.

1062
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:29,078
You're suddenly acting like someone else.

1063
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,519
It gives me butterflies.

1064
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:32,650
Did I give you butterflies?

1065
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,218
One, two...

1066
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:36,320
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

1067
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,059
Telepathy.

1068
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,288
- I want to check. - Check what?

1069
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:43,630
If genetic partners could communicate telepathically.

1070
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,130
Ms. Han So Jin.
