00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,957
(DNA Lover)

2
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:09,550
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:10,981
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:13,387
You may not see him now,

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:16,264
but the Lord, who has risen again, is always with us...

6
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,434
through the Holy Spirit.

7
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,597
He protects us when we are exhausted from life...

8
00:00:20,598 --> 00:00:24,444
and consoles us. We live as we are reminded of this.

9
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:26,567
The Lord said his country...

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:30,068
is not a part of this world.

11
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:32,376
Therefore, the people who live in the celestial country...

12
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,006
where the Lord is king...

13
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,847
live in this world...

14
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:38,648
but are not a part of this world.

15
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:42,217
The people of the land where the Lord is king...

16
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,133
listen to his words,

17
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,263
keep his words in their hearts,

18
00:00:46,287 --> 00:00:48,727
and live as they stay true to his words.

19
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:49,926
How did you come here?

20
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:52,304
I have something to ask the Almighty.

21
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,467
What might that be?

22
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:55,827
To our Lord who comforts us...

23
00:00:55,828 --> 00:00:57,497
He has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

24
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:59,637
- Within his embrace... - From the man of my pheromones.

25
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:02,307
- What pressures and oppresses us... - Oh, dear Lord.

26
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,807
Let us escape from those and find peace. Let us pray.

27
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:09,848
- Amen. - Amen.

28
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:15,316
Who on earth is the one...

29
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:18,788
who will heal and comfort me, dear Lord?

30
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:22,156
I look forward to your homily next weekend as well.

31
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,258
Sure, have a safe trip home.

32
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,027
Let's go.

33
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:32,937
- Father. - We are...

34
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:37,137
Thank you. Have a safe trip home.

35
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,538
Thank you.

36
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:42,978
Sister.

37
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,818
You come often, but you only ever sit in the very back.

38
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,387
Oh, I...

39
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:53,288
Goodbye.

40
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,598
There's no way.

41
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:07,038
No, something is wrong.

42
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:10,008
His immune system was a perfect match for me.

43
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:17,248
So Jin, aren't you getting ready to go to work?

44
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:27,708
(Phosphoric acid)

45
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:30,296
Oh Sang Min was nothing but a preview.

46
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,747
This man...

47
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,217
What's the answer?

48
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,687
What should I do?

49
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:40,507
What do you mean, what should you do?

50
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:44,984
It's highly likely that your DNA lover has the cheaters' gene.

51
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,077
Just admit it.

52
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,298
If you admit it, you'll find comfort.

53
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,097
A cheater is my DNA lover?

54
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,516
Then, I'll get involved with a cheater again.

55
00:02:56,517 --> 00:02:59,407
I'll get hurt again and break up again.

56
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:03,437
No! That can't happen.

57
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,466
That can't happen!

58
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:09,878
(Healer gene)

59
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:12,674
This can't be true.

60
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,988
Not this time.

61
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:18,037
Why did it have to be him?

62
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:21,466
(Episode 4: The Healer Gene)

63
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,446
The OBGYN Department of Sim General Hospital...

64
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:26,363
consider the parents and child our utmost priority.

65
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:29,863
From pregnancy to childbirth, we are there for the pain and worry...

66
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:32,726
of the expectant mothers. And in the process of childbirth,

67
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:36,077
we are always trying hard so that you can trust us.

68
00:03:36,157 --> 00:03:40,047
Medical staff with vast experience are on call 24-7.

69
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,942
We, at Sim Hospital's OBGYN Department,

70
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,686
take care of all your needs after giving birth.

71
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:49,583
Haeng Un's mom hasn't called yet, right?

72
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,627
Gosh, that lady is so...

73
00:03:51,746 --> 00:03:54,375
I mean, where has she gone when she's not even recovered yet?

74
00:03:54,376 --> 00:03:58,393
Did you contact the priest who came in as her guardian?

75
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:02,207
Yes, he was the one who paid for all her care too.

76
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:05,707
He must be searching for Haeng Un's mom everywhere.

77
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,425
Oh, Nurse Park called.

78
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:13,046
Haeng Un was sick all night, so they moved him to Intensive Care.

79
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:15,817
Let's go there together.

80
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,557
Together...

81
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:25,356
Dear Lord, please protect our beloved child with your grace.

82
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:28,926
In Jesus' name we pray.

83
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,397
Amen.

84
00:04:37,227 --> 00:04:39,563
You might actually become Haeng Un's father at this rate.

85
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,077
How is Haeng Un doing?

86
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:44,625
He did have a rough night,

87
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:48,443
but I'm sure he'll pull through, knowing you're so worried.

88
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,986
This is the priest I just mentioned.

89
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:52,883
I've heard a lot about you.

90
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,175
I'm Haeng Un's doctor, Sim Yeon Woo.

91
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,612
I'm Father Andrea.

92
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:59,245
Thank you for all your efforts,

93
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,827
but if we can't get in touch with the mother by next week,

94
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:05,646
Haeng Un will be going to a child welfare facility.

95
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:08,067
He'll be put up for adoption right away.

96
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,916
Adoption?

97
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:13,377
Yes, he will meet good parents who won't abandon him this time.

98
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:16,606
And he'll have so much luck, just like what his name means.

99
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,247
Anyway,

100
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:21,747
please pray for him, Father.

101
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:24,017
- Of course. - Bye, then.

102
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,032
Those are marsh marigolds.

103
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,842
Can you tell at first glance?

104
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:53,536
You sure know everything, Dr. Sim.

105
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:54,796
Who sent them?

106
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:57,557
It didn't say who they were from,

107
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,266
but Ms. Oh handed out juices...

108
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:01,286
because she gave birth today.

109
00:06:01,407 --> 00:06:04,127
Maybe she sent you a flower pot instead.

110
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,697
That eye shape must be the logo of the flower shop.

111
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:11,315
Oh, there will be a pre-meeting...

112
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:12,745
with the genetics centre about the lecture.

113
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:15,236
- Okay, Dr. Sim. - All right.

114
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:24,172
Why is she so quiet today?

115
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:26,476
The test results must be out already.

116
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,766
Right, so this is the most important item...

117
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,643
for today.

118
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:34,305
We'll be doing a project with Sim General Hospital...

119
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:37,505
where we give an information session about freezing eggs and pregnancy.

120
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:39,552
So, we'll be sending someone...

121
00:06:39,576 --> 00:06:42,745
to consult and give a lecture...

122
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:44,346
on DNA testing to Sim Hospital.

123
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:46,086
Ms. Yoon. How does that sound?

124
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:49,055
I have a conference with the women's cancer specialist centre.

125
00:06:49,056 --> 00:06:50,356
A conference?

126
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:52,276
Then...

127
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:55,776
Ms. Han, you can go.

128
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,416
Ms. Han?

129
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:01,743
Yes? Right.

130
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:05,606
I'm in charge of the prenatal tests for Sim Hospital.

131
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,375
- I'm busy. - Right.

132
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:09,706
You've worked with Sim Hospital the whole time,

133
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,646
so you could work with them again for this event.

134
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:14,166
That'd be perfect, right?

135
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:15,897
Right...

136
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:33,773
Then, I'll go with A Ri.

137
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,187
A Ri?

138
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,916
Will you be able to go?

139
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,926
Don't worry, Bi Kei.

140
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:44,083
I'll take good care of A Ri and wrap up the event.

141
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:47,827
I'd be so glad if A Ri could go with you.

142
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:50,693
Then, I'll take it that no one has any objections.

143
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,637
Let's finish today's meeting.

144
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,336
Hey!

145
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,833
I mean...

146
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:01,102
Why must I suffer amongst throngs of strangers for days?

147
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,796
He has the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

148
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:04,947
so I just can't face him yet.

149
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,946
Then, just date him.

150
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:10,316
Anyway, I'm not going.

151
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:15,887
I'm not sure I can date the guy with that gene!

152
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,376
What am I supposed to do?

153
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:19,926
It must've been hard.

154
00:08:20,206 --> 00:08:23,552
Next time, don't wear sneakers. Wear slip-ons instead, okay?

155
00:08:23,576 --> 00:08:26,046
And don't ever wear socks by yourself.

156
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,566
And don't clip your toenails.

157
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,916
What good is your husband?

158
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,877
He's there so you can make him do these things.

159
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:36,176
Well, let me know if there's anything you need.

160
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,727
What's with that cheesy gaze?

161
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:52,922
Well...

162
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:55,696
A doctor should be nice to his patient.

163
00:08:57,017 --> 00:09:00,416
As we can now test for the fetus' illnesses and growth...

164
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,633
before the birth, which we had no way of knowing before,

165
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:06,206
it has become possible to treat these illnesses early...

166
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:07,633
and for the mothers to choose.

167
00:09:07,657 --> 00:09:09,896
Especially, by working with Iroun Genetic Center,

168
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:10,996
we've increased pregnancy rates,

169
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:14,546
and we are now able to share the choices and joys of mothers.

170
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:17,617
Here to consult with us on DNA testing...

171
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:20,506
and to help us with the lecture, we have Team Leader Han So Jin...

172
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,975
and Researcher Son A Ri from Iroun Genetics Center.

173
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,826
Please give them a round of applause.

174
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:35,867
They're only interested in the bonus.

175
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:38,276
Are they just here for him to keep them on the hook?

176
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,436
"Keep them on the hook?"

177
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,996
Even among unmarried women,

178
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:45,747
there have been increased interests in freezing their eggs.

179
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:47,866
Harvesting one's eggs when one is in the best condition...

180
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,695
and keeping them frozen...

181
00:09:49,696 --> 00:09:52,243
until one can get pregnant at the time one wants to...

182
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:56,227
could be an obvious right as a woman.

183
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:59,305
Selecting healthy embryos through the PGT test,

184
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:00,876
and increasing the success rate for pregnancy...

185
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,786
may lead to a higher chance of having a healthy baby.

186
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:06,737
Especially, the PGT-A test.

187
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,185
Expecting mothers who are older in age and those with histories...

188
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,055
of failure in IVF...

189
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,877
are recommended to take this test.

190
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:14,873
So, Sim Hospital and the genetics centre...

191
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:18,816
have decided to hold an information session for our members.

192
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,916
Ms. Han So Jin?

193
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,816
Ms. Han So Jin?

194
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:28,006
- Yes. - You said you would give...

195
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,736
the lecture on genetic diagnostic tests...

196
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,646
in the preimplantation stage, correct?

197
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:36,397
Yes, PGT, the preimplantation genetic test,

198
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,516
is the test we do in IVF procedures...

199
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,016
in cases where the parents...

200
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:42,516
have been confirmed to have genetic illnesses...

201
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,685
in the preimplantation phase.

202
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,955
She must have the test results.

203
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,955
But she hasn't even called.

204
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:51,473
And she came all this way, but didn't even mention it.

205
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:52,526
What's this?

206
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,666
The PGT-SR, and PGT-M...

207
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:56,416
will be available in order.

208
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,376
We're so looking forward to it, Ms. Han So Jin.

209
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:03,056
Give her another round of applause.

210
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,537
(Cooperation Conference Hall)

211
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:24,026
Why are you putting me in a tight spot by bringing me here?

212
00:11:24,027 --> 00:11:25,676
Then should I have come alone?

213
00:11:25,897 --> 00:11:27,347
Oh, my.

214
00:11:27,836 --> 00:11:29,587
- Are you okay? - Yes.

215
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:31,587
So annoying.

216
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:35,575
He must've flirted with so many people...

217
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:39,097
that all these women see him as a man, not a colleague.

218
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:43,097
- Seriously. - Gosh.

219
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,986
- He's coming! The cheater! - Let's get going.

220
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,337
Okay.

221
00:11:48,387 --> 00:11:50,306
- Hurry! - Hurry.

222
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:52,776
What's wrong with her?

223
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:54,406
(Yeo Jung Tam)

224
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:57,647
Yes?

225
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,587
- Hello. - Hello.

226
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:08,087
Hey, aren't you the guy I met at the gym before?

227
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:10,727
You...

228
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:13,182
remember me.

229
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,792
- Right. - Yes.

230
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:18,137
I wasn't sure it was you when I saw your name on the chart.

231
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,455
I'll officially introduce myself.

232
00:12:21,456 --> 00:12:23,786
I'm Endocrinologist Yeo Jung Tam.

233
00:12:23,787 --> 00:12:25,237
- Hello. - Hello.

234
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,195
- Have a seat here. - Oh, that's okay!

235
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,503
Yes, have a seat.

236
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:31,347
- Thank you. - Of course.

237
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:37,757
Right.

238
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,316
Oh, but...

239
00:12:40,466 --> 00:12:42,812
you want to have female hormone shots?

240
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:44,627
Oh, yes.

241
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:47,376
Maybe it's because of the martial arts competition I'm preparing for,

242
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:49,666
but I haven't had my period for two and a half months.

243
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:51,196
I see.

244
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:55,055
I'm sure it's because of a hypothalamic-pituitary imbalance.

245
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,302
It's quite common, so you don't have to worry.

246
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,825
Instead of a hormone shot, you should get a shot...

247
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:00,386
to induce your period first...

248
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:03,702
No. I want to get that shot, no matter what.

249
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:06,546
I want to have the female hormone shot.

250
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:10,387
But why? Is there a particular reason for it?

251
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,857
Well...

252
00:13:14,537 --> 00:13:16,186
Feel free to tell me.

253
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:19,652
Actually,

254
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:22,993
ever since I was little, I was told I was very boyish.

255
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:24,017
I see.

256
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:28,536
I don't think I've liked boys like other girls.

257
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:34,176
So, sometimes, I wonder if I really am a woman.

258
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,126
Who? You?

259
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:39,477
Yes.

260
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,717
I'm not sure what you mean...

261
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:48,175
You're the coolest woman I've ever seen.

262
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:49,956
If you don't know that...

263
00:13:50,507 --> 00:13:53,326
I mean, how could you not know that?

264
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:58,085
I'll help treat you on the part you're concerned about.

265
00:13:58,086 --> 00:13:59,536
Don't worry.

266
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,036
- Thank you. - Sure.

267
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,565
Didn't you hear the alarm?

268
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,282
Is the emergency speaker just for decoration?

269
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,357
You can't just remove it.

270
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:36,106
(March 7, livestreaming day)

271
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:40,877
- Hey, Mi Eun. - Yeon Woo.

272
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,702
There was a fire in my building.

273
00:14:43,726 --> 00:14:45,796
What? A fire?

274
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,717
Yes, but...

275
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,143
I also met a brave fireman.

276
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,816
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

277
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,627
You should check that in person.

278
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:57,526
To celebrate me having a near-death experience,

279
00:14:57,806 --> 00:14:58,945
buy me something delicious.

280
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,753
Gosh, what a relief.

281
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,223
What do you want to eat?

282
00:15:02,247 --> 00:15:04,196
Well...

283
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,286
Sushi?

284
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,192
I'll have dinner before I go home.

285
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,237
The truck is coming today.

286
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:14,776
No.

287
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:18,247
The hillside tornado potato skewer is not your ordinary potato.

288
00:15:18,696 --> 00:15:20,442
The food truck owner...

289
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,796
farmed the potatoes himself on high altitude in Gangwon Province...

290
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,666
with much love and care. And he prepped them himself too.

291
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,316
They are sumi potatoes.

292
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:30,376
Sadly, he tours around the country...

293
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:31,506
so he only comes...

294
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:34,566
only on the 1st and 3rd Fridays in front of our church.

295
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:37,562
Those soft high-altitude potatoes...

296
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:40,162
that are sweet but fresh as well.

297
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:43,093
They're cut in perfect thickness and spacing as designed by the owner.

298
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:45,737
The perfect temperature of the oil and seasoning.

299
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,206
Getting to...

300
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,147
see all of this in person...

301
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,747
is a grace from the Almighty.

302
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,887
I will see you later.

303
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,406
- Yes, here you go. Enjoy. - Thank you.

304
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:03,956
Get home safely.

305
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:07,146
- Yes, there you go. - I hope business goes well.

306
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:08,276
- Bye. - Bye.

307
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,922
Yes, hello. What would you like?

308
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,397
The honey butter flavour.

309
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,945
- Honey butter? - Yes.

310
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,737
You ordered one honey butter flavour.

311
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:17,763
- Here you go. Bye. - Thank you.

312
00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:20,076
Hello, which flavour would you like?

313
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,546
One original, please.

314
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:26,446
A great choice.

315
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:29,042
It's very hot. Be careful.

316
00:16:29,066 --> 00:16:30,965
Yes, thank you.

317
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,717
Get home safely.

318
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:34,536
- Yes, hello. - Hello.

319
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:35,636
I'll one honey butter flavour.

320
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:38,276
I'm sorry, but we're all out of ingredients now.

321
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:40,627
You can come back in two weeks.

322
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,375
- Gosh, are you okay? - Sorry.

323
00:16:43,376 --> 00:16:45,463
- Sorry, are you okay? - Are you okay? I'm sorry.

324
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:47,766
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

325
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,362
- Sorry! - Sorry.

326
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:52,137
My high-altitude...

327
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,476
Are you okay?

328
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:31,003
Sister Anna. You can have this.

329
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:34,747
(Gangwon Province High-altitude Hillside Tornado Potato Skewers)

330
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,416
It's fine. You can have it.

331
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,357
Thank you.

332
00:17:42,707 --> 00:17:44,156
Thank you.

333
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,256
Dad.

334
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:00,906
- You're here. - Yes.

335
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,632
Dad, I'm here. Hey, Yeon Woo.

336
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:04,696
You're here.

337
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:06,865
You save people during the day...

338
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:08,696
and help your dad at night. When do you have time to date?

339
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:12,565
I know, Yeon Woo. You should set Kang Hoon up with a girl.

340
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,006
This crazy punk won't date.

341
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,557
Why don't you date?

342
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,276
I said I didn't want to start something...

343
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:18,852
I can't be responsible for.

344
00:18:18,876 --> 00:18:20,706
Hey, punk. Are we in the Joseon Dynasty?

345
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:22,315
Why does the time period matter when it's all about people's lives?

346
00:18:22,316 --> 00:18:25,385
But you age faster than most people. You have to hurry and get married.

347
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,933
We'll all grow old anyway. Why does the speed matter?

348
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:29,256
Also, I take after you.

349
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,226
If you take after me, you shouldn't look so old.

350
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,426
I look old because I look like you.

351
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,926
He does look old, right?

352
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:35,872
He does look a bit older than me.

353
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,277
Seriously.

354
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:40,266
- Did you come alone? - Someone will join me.

355
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:41,342
Who?

356
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:43,372
Look. There she is.

357
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:44,817
Hey, Yeon Woo.

358
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,926
Wait.

359
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:50,256
- Wait. - Oh, my.

360
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,023
What a coincidence meeting my saviour here.

361
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,476
Your saviour? Do you two know each other?

362
00:18:54,477 --> 00:18:57,345
I told you there was a brave firefighter who saved me.

363
00:18:57,346 --> 00:19:00,223
- I see. - She's the life I saved yesterday.

364
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:01,807
I see.

365
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:03,693
Let me introduce you. This is...

366
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:05,385
my closest friend, Seo Kang Hoon.

367
00:19:05,386 --> 00:19:08,647
- This is... - Oh, Seo Kang Hoon?

368
00:19:08,896 --> 00:19:11,516
Hello. I'm Jang Mi Eun.

369
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,766
Did you fix the emergency announcement speaker?

370
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:15,072
Not yet.

371
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:17,542
That's the perfect spot to hang a painting, you see.

372
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,387
You're hanging a painting where the speaker should be?

373
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:23,327
I'm joking. I fixed it.

374
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,946
Yesterday, I saw you were burning incense with the windows closed.

375
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:27,947
Please remember that incense...

376
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:30,592
makes more carbon monoxide than regular candles.

377
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,337
You can't burn incense for more than 15 minutes.

378
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:36,186
Yeon Woo. Is he always full of worries like this?

379
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:38,607
He's gotten a lot better. Let's sit down.

380
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,307
I see.

381
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,403
Gosh.

382
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:45,065
But why is he working at a sushi restaurant?

383
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:46,766
He's helping out his father's store.

384
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,547
Oh, that's his father.

385
00:19:50,866 --> 00:19:52,842
This is such a nice place.

386
00:19:52,866 --> 00:19:54,317
I'll come often from now on.

387
00:20:04,316 --> 00:20:05,867
How old are you?

388
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,367
It must be a secret.

389
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:13,537
He's 28, no, 29.

390
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:15,196
He's a baby.

391
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,872
I'm not a baby, and I don't like semi-casual speech.

392
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,165
- What do you want to eat? - One salmon and tuna set.

393
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,787
And a warm sake.

394
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,647
Okay.

395
00:20:30,406 --> 00:20:32,156
He's not the one.

396
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,223
He'll never fall for you.

397
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:35,996
I'll tie it for you.

398
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,486
I take after you.

399
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,037
This boy.

400
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:42,915
Guys like him become very bold...

401
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,176
once they cross the line.

402
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,416
People have the right to be forgotten.

403
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:56,317
You don't even remember properly, and you've already forgotten?

404
00:21:04,747 --> 00:21:06,297
What are you thinking about?

405
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,453
It's nothing.

406
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,466
Oh, I know.

407
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:11,666
That otaku researcher?

408
00:21:12,987 --> 00:21:14,397
No.

409
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,055
If someone has to receive prenatal education,

410
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:23,047
I believe the husband has to be the one to get prenatal education...

411
00:21:23,126 --> 00:21:24,565
during pregnancy.

412
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:27,072
The mother will feel the happiest when she feels...

413
00:21:27,096 --> 00:21:29,847
safely protected and loved by her husband,

414
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:33,282
and the fetus in her stomach will feel all of that.

415
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,436
Rather than during the dating phase,

416
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,946
I believe pregnancy is when a woman can know and see...

417
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,226
her husband's noble and pure love.

418
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,867
Why does a guy like this...

419
00:21:43,747 --> 00:21:45,966
have the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene?

420
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:47,837
Why?

421
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:51,037
Why?

422
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:54,163
Official statements and personal lives are different.

423
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,976
Men who say overly beautiful things...

424
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:00,176
are not to be trusted easily.

425
00:22:02,767 --> 00:22:06,282
Could it be that his Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

426
00:22:06,306 --> 00:22:09,382
went into a dormant state after experiencing...

427
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:12,726
countless miracles of birth as a gynaecologist?

428
00:22:13,646 --> 00:22:16,266
What a beautiful story.

429
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,077
Have you been well?

430
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:06,703
Will you come to this lecture?

431
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:09,047
You do well on your own. I don't need to be there.

432
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:13,335
I'm thinking of hosting...

433
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:16,226
a prenatal genetics counselling symposium early next year.

434
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:19,226
I see. I think...

435
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:21,567
you could put Dr. Choi in charge of that.

436
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,496
Next year, I'm going to take a break from working at the hospital.

437
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:27,415
- Take a break? - I need to have some fun...

438
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,362
before starting my own hospital.

439
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:31,756
Start your own hospital? This hospital is yours.

440
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,203
No way.

441
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:35,746
I can't be a gynaecologist forever.

442
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:43,296
What's your schedule like this evening? Should we have dinner?

443
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,812
I have plans.

444
00:23:44,836 --> 00:23:46,916
Oh, is that so?

445
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:50,827
If so, let's have dinner together soon.

446
00:23:51,447 --> 00:23:52,897
Let's do that.

447
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:05,236
Right, Chief Director. I guess you're going to date this woman...

448
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:07,777
for a while.

449
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:15,686
I never planned to have a short relationship.

450
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:18,686
If you're my son,

451
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,686
you won't be able to live with a woman who you don't love.

452
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,897
Not all women are the same.

453
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:32,466
There is a woman somewhere that will make you go crazy.

454
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:35,966
See you later.

455
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:59,122
Oh, this addiction.

456
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:01,666
I will never eat rose carbonara again. Gosh.

457
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,587
Are you okay?

458
00:25:32,576 --> 00:25:33,956
I'm okay.

459
00:25:37,646 --> 00:25:39,137
Ms. Yeom Jang Mi.

460
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:41,615
I see that you signed up...

461
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,666
for the anti-ageing food therapy program.

462
00:25:43,886 --> 00:25:46,632
You are quite underweight.

463
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:48,256
I think food therapy is too much...

464
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:50,077
I don't like having excess fat.

465
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,347
Excess fat?

466
00:25:52,967 --> 00:25:55,743
Your body fat percentage is way lower than the average range.

467
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:57,165
Just do it for me.

468
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:01,057
Also, you can't take appetite suppressants like this.

469
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,676
The hormonal imbalance could cause depression...

470
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:06,397
I get it, so just...

471
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,523
So just do it for me.

472
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,993
My husband doesn't like women with excess fat.

473
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:13,562
He likes women who look like models.

474
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:17,666
Not wrinkly, sagging skin like mine.

475
00:26:18,487 --> 00:26:22,176
There's a girl younger than my son by my husband.

476
00:26:24,297 --> 00:26:26,317
How do you think he'll feel...

477
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:28,946
looking at me?

478
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:38,375
Your husband...

479
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:39,797
At first,

480
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:43,996
he seemed he would only care about me.

481
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,966
He didn't know much about women,

482
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,337
and he couldn't drink.

483
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:52,906
But...

484
00:26:57,197 --> 00:27:00,446
when I got pregnant, he cheated for the first time.

485
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:02,395
It was barely an affair.

486
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:04,805
He got caught very soon and begged for forgiveness.

487
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:07,557
But that was just the beginning.

488
00:27:08,237 --> 00:27:10,105
Those men are the problem.

489
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:11,446
Men who look for other women...

490
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:12,575
because their wives gained weight after having kids.

491
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:15,446
They get old too, but they hate it when women get old.

492
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:17,327
Those jerks!

493
00:27:18,687 --> 00:27:21,555
Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene holders are the axis of evil.

494
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:25,506
I will crush these axis-of-evil men.

495
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,847
Do you think Mr. Sewer is part of the axis of evil?

496
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:46,797
Who are you?

497
00:27:46,876 --> 00:27:50,097
Who keeps talking about me?

498
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:51,717
Gosh.

499
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:53,807
(Sim General Hospital)

500
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:02,926
Da Mi. Listen to me.

501
00:28:02,927 --> 00:28:05,226
So who is that girl?

502
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,665
I thought you broke up. Why is she messaging you?

503
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,365
She's always been a super obsessive person.

504
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:09,565
Do you know what her nickname is?

505
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:11,196
It's French Bulldog.

506
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:12,236
Ruff, ruff.

507
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:13,905
Once she bites, she never lets go.

508
00:28:13,906 --> 00:28:16,612
If so, call her right now.

509
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:19,645
So I can hear her say whether you're dating or not.

510
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:21,206
You're the only one for me.

511
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:24,046
What should I do? Should I write a blood note?

512
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:25,315
Call her now, you punk!

513
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,936
I'll call her.

514
00:28:28,886 --> 00:28:30,406
Ms. Kim Hee Yeon.

515
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:34,802
What are you doing?

516
00:28:34,826 --> 00:28:36,102
Is that you, Hee Yeon?

517
00:28:36,126 --> 00:28:37,403
Yes, So Jin.

518
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,817
Oh Sang Min is in front of me right now.

519
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,473
I was curious if you two were happily dating.

520
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:45,582
Why is Sang Min with you?

521
00:28:45,606 --> 00:28:47,665
Oh, we just ran into each other.

522
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,683
I see. Of course, we're happy together.

523
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:54,352
We're going to Iceland next month to see the aurora borealis.

524
00:28:54,376 --> 00:28:56,766
Oh Sang Min. Were you cheating on me?

525
00:28:56,846 --> 00:28:58,915
You asked me to go to Iceland too!

526
00:28:58,916 --> 00:29:01,792
Sang Min. Who are you with right now?

527
00:29:01,816 --> 00:29:03,766
Who is that woman?

528
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:05,676
Hello?

529
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:10,155
Hey, Oh Sang Min. When you broke up with me,

530
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,065
you told me you found true love.

531
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,296
You said that was Hee Yeon.

532
00:29:13,297 --> 00:29:15,966
And now you're cheating on Hee Yeon with another woman?

533
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,436
- Shut it. - That's what you were always doing.

534
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:21,416
How many girls did you cheat on me with?

535
00:29:21,937 --> 00:29:23,683
Forget it. I don't even want to know.

536
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:25,996
I don't even want to recall the times I spent...

537
00:29:26,076 --> 00:29:27,476
dating pieces of trash like you.

538
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:28,897
I told you to shut it.

539
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,736
I won't let you get away with this, Han So Jin. Just wait.

540
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:35,963
Da Mi!

541
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:38,355
Da Mi. Wait.

542
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,236
I didn't mean that.

543
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:44,095
- Stop that. - Wait. You can't just go like this.

544
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:45,446
Please.

545
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:53,256
Yes. I should give up here.

546
00:29:54,336 --> 00:29:56,857
If I fall for a cheater, that'll be the end of me.

547
00:30:00,977 --> 00:30:04,827
(Sim General Hospital)

548
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:06,546
The results of your DNA test.

549
00:30:06,547 --> 00:30:09,085
Mr. Sim Yeon Woo possesses DRD4-7R,

550
00:30:09,086 --> 00:30:11,307
the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

551
00:30:11,856 --> 00:30:15,547
With seven Indecent Octopus Tentacle Genes,

552
00:30:15,626 --> 00:30:19,747
you are in the second percentile in the whole world.

553
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:22,395
What I'd like to suggest to you...

554
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:26,017
is meditation and temple stays to reflect on yourself.

555
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,856
Foods that I don't suggest...

556
00:30:27,937 --> 00:30:30,686
are eels, chives, oysters, and more.

557
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:33,845
What is she talking about?

558
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:36,797
Gosh. This isn't right.

559
00:30:36,846 --> 00:30:39,966
(Samil-dong Intersection)

560
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:45,986
Ms. Han. I need an explanation. Where are you?

561
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,307
Let's meet at the park we met at before.

562
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,503
- Ms. Han So Jin. - Yes?

563
00:31:19,527 --> 00:31:20,756
I need an explanation...

564
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:22,506
on the test results you sent earlier.

565
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:25,825
- An explanation... - Isn't that...

566
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:29,317
what you should do as a researcher?

567
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,117
Yes.

568
00:31:35,677 --> 00:31:37,127
Even if...

569
00:31:39,576 --> 00:31:42,446
my partner gets sick...

570
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,797
with a rare or terminal illness,

571
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:49,362
I'm going to do everything with my partner.

572
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,807
But...

573
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:53,607
I can't date a guy with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

574
00:31:53,987 --> 00:31:56,277
I just agreed to the test,

575
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,547
but while you were running the DNA test,

576
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:01,077
you already dated me.

577
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:10,027
I don't know what those indecent octopus tentacles did to you,

578
00:32:10,677 --> 00:32:14,357
but you need to put trash in the trash can.

579
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,176
If you always hold onto your wounds,

580
00:32:16,177 --> 00:32:17,493
you won't be able to meet a good person.

581
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:20,597
For someone who was too sincere about that love,

582
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:23,786
some wounds can last forever.

583
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:27,325
You can only get wounds if you allow it to happen.

584
00:32:27,326 --> 00:32:28,676
I...

585
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:32,716
run these tests because I don't want to get hurt.

586
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:34,466
I no longer want to hurt...

587
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:36,147
from wounds I didn't agree to getting.

588
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,617
Going forward,

589
00:32:41,237 --> 00:32:43,956
I'm going to continue to test all men that I date.

590
00:32:44,477 --> 00:32:47,327
Over people's feelings... No.

591
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:48,926
Over my feelings,

592
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:51,666
I trust DNA.

593
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:57,067
DNA is the only thing that doesn't change.

594
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:06,377
I feel a bit flabbergasted and wronged.

595
00:33:07,366 --> 00:33:08,916
You don't know anything about me,

596
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:12,686
but you labelled me a cheater before even starting anything.

597
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:16,726
You might not cheat right now,

598
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:19,756
but you'll definitely...

599
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:22,027
cheat...

600
00:33:22,977 --> 00:33:24,327
one day.

601
00:33:24,876 --> 00:33:26,286
You might have affairs until you die...

602
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:28,807
if your gene manifests you.

603
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:31,006
It's not about having an affair or not.

604
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:34,976
It's a matter of time.

605
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:39,347
That's why...

606
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,372
I can't start anything...

607
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,113
with someone with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene.

608
00:33:45,137 --> 00:33:46,906
I'm sure I told you that that's not how men and women...

609
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:49,127
are supposed to get to know each other.

610
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:52,127
Other than my Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

611
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:54,757
what do you know about me?

612
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:59,996
I trust DNA.

613
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:03,067
If you're my son,

614
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:06,076
you won't be able to live with a woman who you don't love.

615
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,926
If you're the kind of person who judges people easily...

616
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:12,476
and makes decisions based on those judgments,

617
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:16,947
I'm also no longer interested.

618
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:43,217
What?

619
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:45,817
Hold on.

620
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:50,257
Yeon Woo.

621
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,328
We keep running into each other.

622
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:56,228
Aren't you here with someone?

623
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:00,797
Go to the guy who's waiting for you.

624
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,367
I want to be alone today.

625
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,556
Give me a glass of the one...

626
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:08,338
- I was keeping. - Okay.

627
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:10,308
Did something happen?

628
00:36:12,228 --> 00:36:13,748
Nothing happened.

629
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:17,047
I just feel angry for some reason.

630
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:18,657
Mi Eun.

631
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:20,288
Yes?

632
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,927
Do you also think I'm a Casanova?

633
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:29,597
Well, I think you're good at noticing...

634
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:33,567
when women look their prettiest.

635
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:36,308
Whether that woman is old or young.

636
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:39,308
I'm sure the women you dated can't forget you.

637
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:43,334
So why do things always end so badly?

638
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:44,957
All relationships end badly.

639
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,947
Relationships are dirty. That's how love is.

640
00:36:49,238 --> 00:36:50,588
But...

641
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:53,937
who is making you so worried?

642
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:55,387
Seriously.

643
00:36:56,608 --> 00:36:58,458
She's strangely bothering me.

644
00:37:01,508 --> 00:37:02,898
Cheers.

645
00:37:05,217 --> 00:37:06,597
What about him?

646
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,133
He's a guy who knows we'll break up...

647
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:11,407
as soon as he comes here to get me.

648
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:16,878
I'll listen to some music before I go home today.

649
00:37:28,108 --> 00:37:29,458
So Jin.

650
00:37:30,137 --> 00:37:32,097
- Hey. - Why are you up there again?

651
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:33,757
What are you doing there?

652
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:48,478
Kang Hoon.

653
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,777
Yes. Tell me what's going on.

654
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:56,047
Do you also think so?

655
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:00,217
That you need to break up when you feel sorry...

656
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:02,214
and sad?

657
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,984
That's when you're supposed to break up.

658
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:05,657
When you feel sorry and sad.

659
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:10,297
Not when you feel sick of someone and so angry at them.

660
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:12,998
What do you mean by that?

661
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:16,938
I just remembered...

662
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,208
someone saying that.

663
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:21,708
Who said that?

664
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:27,578
I guess I'm bad at deciding when to break up with someone.

665
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,588
I can never...

666
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:33,918
break up with a guy until we're fighting like crazy.

667
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:35,757
So this time,

668
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,757
I found the right chance to end things before that.

669
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:41,958
But...

670
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:46,768
I still don't feel great.

671
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,596
Oh, you fool.

672
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,507
You have so much going on in your head.

673
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:00,774
You did something dumb again, didn't you?

674
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:03,113
When are you going to stop doing things you regret?

675
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:04,297
It's not like that.

676
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:07,044
I've been very busy lately with my experiments.

677
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:10,777
Experiments to find my DNA lover.

678
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:12,697
I told you not to test people.

679
00:39:15,878 --> 00:39:19,593
"Experiments are the only way..."

680
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:22,168
"to truly learn."

681
00:39:22,557 --> 00:39:25,067
Leonardo da Vinci.

682
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:27,677
Han So Jin.

683
00:39:28,927 --> 00:39:30,308
What?

684
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:33,447
You can't find fate...

685
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,044
through experiments.

686
00:39:36,068 --> 00:39:39,217
When you get to know the person, you can see your fate.

687
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:45,998
Let's go.

688
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,228
Here.

689
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,277
Did you change your fabric softener?

690
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,817
You smell like flowers.

691
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,547
- Hey. - Gosh.

692
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:17,806
Don't say things like that to other guys, okay?

693
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,484
They're going to think you're a pervert.

694
00:40:19,508 --> 00:40:21,628
I've already been told that.

695
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,587
Aren't you being too lazy about exercising these days?

696
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:27,867
You fell over while trying to hold me.

697
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:31,216
Maybe you grew this way and that way.

698
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:34,187
Look here. I stopped growing when I was 16,

699
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:35,627
and my weight has also stayed the same.

700
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,133
Oh, has it?

701
00:40:37,157 --> 00:40:38,627
Is that why your eye for men...

702
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:40,378
also stayed the same since you were in elementary school?

703
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:41,847
- Hey. - Gosh.

704
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,447
Come on.

705
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:45,707
There is a gene that pulls down...

706
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:48,458
the holder to suffering.

707
00:40:49,108 --> 00:40:50,887
If you know someone...

708
00:40:51,537 --> 00:40:53,558
with such a gene,

709
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:56,527
it's best to cut ties with them.

710
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:01,910
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

711
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:05,987
Say hello, Ms. Han. This is Dr. Sim Yeon Woo.

712
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:08,497
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

713
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:21,707
This is my original hair. This is the super hair.

714
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:24,188
Will touching it help...

715
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,770
(Sim Yeon Woo?)

716
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,368
Open up.

717
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:37,437

(Possibility of developing cancer according to the lifestyle)

721
00:42:21,697 --> 00:42:23,636
(OPTG7)

722
00:42:23,637 --> 00:42:26,558
OPTG7...

723
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:31,257
What? This is the optimistic gene.

724
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:35,898
Does Mr. Sim have the optimistic gene?

725
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:38,367
Really?

726
00:42:41,447 --> 00:42:44,067
Each person is born with a weakness-like gene...

727
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:47,808
that could make you unhappy.

728
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,277
Good.

729
00:42:57,097 --> 00:42:58,788
And for each of us,

730
00:42:59,307 --> 00:43:01,317
there exists someone...

731
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:04,188
with a gene that could heal us.

732
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:09,828
I call that gene...

733
00:43:10,177 --> 00:43:11,597
the healer.

734
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:14,467
I call it the healer gene.

735
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:20,478
There are countless men as many as the stars,

736
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:23,677
and I've found the man with a healer gene for me.

737
00:43:24,628 --> 00:43:26,177
OPTG7...

738
00:43:26,697 --> 00:43:29,297
is the healer gene...

739
00:43:29,298 --> 00:43:31,047
that could heal my dying gene.

740
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:40,927
That man with the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene...

741
00:43:41,548 --> 00:43:43,297
was my healer.

742
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:47,516
If you're the kind of person who judges people easily...

743
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:48,964
and makes decisions based on those judgments,

744
00:43:48,988 --> 00:43:51,108
I'm also no longer interested.

745
00:43:57,997 --> 00:44:01,248
But it's over between us now.

746
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:11,854
Sinhon has such a loud heartbeat.

747
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:13,398
Don't you think so?

748
00:44:15,577 --> 00:44:16,927
It sure does.

749
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:20,367
Ms. Heo, your prenatal test result will come out tomorrow.

750
00:44:20,488 --> 00:44:22,633
You can come directly to the genetic centre.

751
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:25,168
The nurse will tell you the location and the time.

752
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,478
- Yes, Doctor. - See you tomorrow.

753
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,588
That flower pot is really beautiful.

754
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:54,413
(Happiness will surely come.)

755
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:13,358
- So Jin. - No!

756
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:16,314
Why are you so surprised?

757
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:20,257
I thought someone was following me.

758
00:45:20,648 --> 00:45:22,323
Don't take this path for a while.

759
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:23,616
I told you about the college student, right?

760
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:25,047
The abduction was reported on this path.

761
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:27,438
Should I just stay home?

762
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:28,917
To you,

763
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:31,907
every inch of Seoul was a place where some kind of case happened.

764
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:36,208
Do you have a tracker on me or something?

765
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,708
You're just too predictable.

766
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,817
Do you have your safety alarm with you?

767
00:45:40,898 --> 00:45:42,518
Of course.

768
00:45:44,738 --> 00:45:46,217
Here it is.

769
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:49,487
Let's go to our restaurant. I'll make you some udon.

770
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:53,697
Gosh.

771
00:46:04,419 --> 00:46:06,461

(Sim Yeon Woo)

773
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:52,788
Yeon Woo. What brought you here without notice?

774
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:55,688
It's not like I ever called before.

775
00:46:56,537 --> 00:46:57,887
Take a seat.

776
00:46:57,978 --> 00:46:59,383
Aren't you closed?

777
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,398
You're always welcome here.

778
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:03,516
- Do you want something? - I'll have an udon.

779
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:05,027
Udon? Just a minute.

780
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,263
Right.

781
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:10,087
You should come sit with So Jin. You two know each other, right?

782
00:47:10,088 --> 00:47:11,507
- No. - I...

783
00:47:12,657 --> 00:47:14,108
Why are you keeping a distance?

784
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:16,748
Wait.

785
00:47:19,197 --> 00:47:20,648
It's hot. Be careful.

786
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:23,447
- Thank you. - Here. Enjoy.

787
00:47:27,508 --> 00:47:29,188
Why are you picking at your food?

788
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:33,584
What? No, I'm not picking at it. I'm eating.

789
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:35,624
Not again. Here.

790
00:47:35,648 --> 00:47:37,946
You should pull up your sleeve when you eat.

791
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,964
You're going to get soup on it, you clumsy.

792
00:47:39,988 --> 00:47:41,394
Wait.

793
00:47:41,418 --> 00:47:42,867
Hey, isn't this mine?

794
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:46,438
Is it the one I gave you during a high school retreat?

795
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:48,886
- Did you? - It's so stretched out.

796
00:47:48,887 --> 00:47:50,878
You should throw it out now.

797
00:47:51,197 --> 00:47:54,144
It's the most comfortable thing on earth. Why would I?

798
00:47:54,168 --> 00:47:56,418
It helps me fall asleep.

799
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,374
I'll buy you a new one.

800
00:47:58,398 --> 00:48:00,788
I know your size, but the colour...

801
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:02,458
You like pink, don't you?

802
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:04,354
Yes.

803
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:08,176
I remember how you cried when your mom bought So Ri...

804
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,168
a pink bag but you got a blue one.

805
00:48:11,177 --> 00:48:12,587
How do you remember all that?

806
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:15,297
I was always there when you cried.

807
00:48:15,717 --> 00:48:18,417
Although you always cried over nothing.

808
00:48:18,418 --> 00:48:20,403
You cried in front of me too, you know.

809
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:21,757
- Me? - Yes.

810
00:48:21,758 --> 00:48:23,104
No way.

811
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:24,547
Well...

812
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:26,547
Anyway, I swear you did.

813
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:35,088
I should apologize first.

814
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:37,958
Kang Hoon, I'm going to get going.

815
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:40,147
I enjoyed it. Take care.

816
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:42,328
- What? Already? - Yes.

817
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:53,708
She's talking more than usual today.

818
00:49:05,807 --> 00:49:07,418
Good job!

819
00:49:09,338 --> 00:49:11,487
Gosh, that stinks.

820
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:14,328
We have to get a car wash thanks to you.

821
00:49:14,907 --> 00:49:18,128
Do we have to rescue dogs from sewers now?

822
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,647
The whole neighbourhood knows that dog is homeless.

823
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:23,087
It got through a rough patch,

824
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:25,464
so I'm certain only good things will happen to him now.

825
00:49:25,488 --> 00:49:28,104
Sure. Hurry up and take a shower.

826
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:30,007
That stench will be on you for a month at least.

827
00:49:30,398 --> 00:49:31,748
Really?

828
00:49:34,228 --> 00:49:35,496
- Here. - Hey!

829
00:49:35,497 --> 00:49:37,113
You're really something.

830
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:39,047
- Good job today. - You too.

831
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:55,668
Mom.

832
00:49:57,188 --> 00:49:58,967
I didn't expect you.

833
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:08,248
This time, she's even younger than you.

834
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:28,693
Didn't I introduce you to a lawyer?

835
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:30,168
Why won't you get a divorce?

836
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:33,907
That lawyer is talented.

837
00:50:34,387 --> 00:50:36,127
They'll leave Father penniless.

838
00:50:36,128 --> 00:50:38,808
Your father had affairs with countless women,

839
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,648
but he always came home whenever relationships ended.

840
00:50:43,798 --> 00:50:45,748
I'm going to make that happen.

841
00:50:46,608 --> 00:50:48,636
You know my grandfather...

842
00:50:48,637 --> 00:50:50,387
and uncles also had affairs.

843
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:55,246
Do you still expect Father to live a different kind of life?

844
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:57,593
They all returned in the end.

845
00:50:57,617 --> 00:50:59,564
It's in the family gene.

846
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:02,338
They never abandon the woman who gave birth to their child.

847
00:51:02,418 --> 00:51:04,367
That darn gene talk again.

848
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:20,817
How much longer will you let this ruin you before you stop?

849
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:27,653
Please, you should start living your own life.

850
00:51:27,677 --> 00:51:29,128
Loving,

851
00:51:30,717 --> 00:51:33,498
blaming, and waiting for your father...

852
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:39,808
is my life.

853
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:51,248
There's still no room for me in your life.

854
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:01,398
I have to see a patient off-site. Please see yourself out.

Well...

863
00:53:19,148 --> 00:53:22,278
According to the DNA test, your baby...

864
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,669
It's Sinhon.

865
00:53:24,148 --> 00:53:25,825
My baby's nickname is Sinhon.

866
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:27,208
Okay.

867
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:31,379
There's a bit of a problem with Sinhon.

868
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,049
Just as you were concerned,

869
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:36,679
the gene from your father-in-law...

870
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:39,518
is also in Sinhon.

871
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:44,084
Are you saying Sinhon will go blind?

872
00:53:44,108 --> 00:53:45,908
No way. That's impossible.

873
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:47,908
Sinhon's dad has perfect eyes.

We can't conclude that the baby will lose sight.

In terms of RP,

876
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:55,299
it's diverse in genetic and clinical features.

877
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,764
It could show in the early stages,

878
00:53:57,788 --> 00:54:00,208
but it might not show at all.

880

It's a good thing you found out during your prenatal test.

881
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:09,568
It's currently in the clinical stage,

882
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:11,879
but there's a new RP treatment...

883
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:13,518
using the stem cell currently under development.

884
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:16,319
This is impossible.

885
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:18,658
I don't believe it.

886
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:20,655

887
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:23,899
You have the same genes. How are you fine?

888

Your face tells me...

889
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:37,208
you already know...

890
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,078
whose child Sinhon is.

891
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:48,419
Do you mean...

892
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:51,288
just like how you came to see me knowing who I am?

893
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:53,529
This time, she's even younger than you.

894
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:03,394
Would it be okay for me to ask what your baby nickname was?

895
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,799
I want a son like you.

896
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:07,664
It was Sinhon.

897
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:11,227
They gave me that nickname because my mother wanted...

898
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,109
her and my father to live like newlyweds forever.

899
00:55:13,659 --> 00:55:15,104
Sinhon.

900
00:55:15,128 --> 00:55:18,118
That's pretty. I'll use that baby nickname too.

901
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,449
Of course you should know...

902
00:55:20,938 --> 00:55:22,575
since you're family.

903
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:24,058
"Family?"

904
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,188
I don't know about that.

00:55:27,038 --> 00:55:29,314
What you're doing now is committing adultery.

906
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:32,055
No. The chief director and I will soon get married.

907
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,718
He proposed to me.

908
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:36,328
Does he know you came to see me?

909
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:39,438
Do you think your father wouldn't know?

910
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:47,879
I grew up without parents while supporting my siblings.

911
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,345
He was the only man I met...

912
00:55:50,369 --> 00:55:52,997
to have proposed to someone like me.

913
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:54,748
Let me give you some advice.

914
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:58,107
His feelings for women change frequently.

915
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,284
He also cares...

916
00:55:59,308 --> 00:56:02,314
about his public image.

917
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:06,894
So I urge you to behave.

918
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:09,768
Also, I know you don't have any siblings.

919
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:17,739
How ridiculous.

920
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:20,305
Did you hire someone to investigate me?

921
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:23,919
I saw many likes of you around him before.

922
00:56:24,768 --> 00:56:27,018
But when you need him the most like right now,

923
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:29,819
he won't be around.

924
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:34,958
Are you clueless, or are you acting like you are?

925
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,029
Do you really not see why...

926
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:40,728
your father gave me his specimen?

927
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:42,994
What is it? Are you scared?

928
00:56:43,018 --> 00:56:45,969
Your house and your hospital will belong to me and Sinhon!

929
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,179
I'm sorry.

930
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:59,348
Please keep today's consultation confidential.

931
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:02,775
- Wait. - It's my parents' personal life.

932
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,518
It has nothing to do with me.

933
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:18,669
You might not cheat right now,

934
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:22,339
but you'll definitely cheat one day.

935
00:57:23,188 --> 00:57:24,587
You might have affairs until you die...

936
00:57:24,588 --> 00:57:26,949
if your gene manifests you.

937
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:29,279
It's not about having an affair or not.

938
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:31,179
It's a matter...

939
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:33,219
of time.

940
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:41,888
It must have sounded like he'd become his father.

941
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:45,558
What have I done?

942
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,069
Mr. Sim!

943
00:57:53,418 --> 00:57:54,908
Mr. Sim!

944
00:57:57,228 --> 00:57:58,679
Mr. Sim...

945
00:58:00,358 --> 00:58:01,708
Here.

946
00:58:05,268 --> 00:58:09,449
If you're not busy today,

947
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,514
should we get a drink together?

948
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:13,607
I'll buy.

949
00:58:13,608 --> 00:58:15,715
I don't think we're in the position to have drinks.

950
00:58:15,739 --> 00:58:18,259
Then please give me a minute.

951
00:58:18,549 --> 00:58:20,917
I want to apologize. I was...

952
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,264
I don't know what it's about, but consider it accepted.

953
00:58:23,288 --> 00:58:25,868
I said that you would cheat one day,

954
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:28,368
and that you might cheat until you die.

955
00:58:28,788 --> 00:58:30,239
I want to apologize for saying that.

956
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:33,239
It must have sounded like you'd follow your father's steps.

957
00:58:33,998 --> 00:58:37,805
But if you find your DNA lover,

958
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:40,068
you'll be able to live differently even with your current DNA.

959
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:41,715
I told you it's my parents' personal life,

960
00:58:41,739 --> 00:58:44,759
and that it has nothing to do with me.

961
00:58:45,768 --> 00:58:49,328
Also, that cheaters' gene and your DNA talk...

962
00:58:49,608 --> 00:58:51,359
don't bother me...

963
00:58:52,009 --> 00:58:53,498
nor do I believe in it.

964
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,808
I'll give you a piece of advice, Ms. Han.

965
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:06,179
All you talk about are DNAs,

966
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:09,509
and that's why you always fail in your relationships.

967
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:12,518
You should take that into account.

968
00:59:42,058 --> 00:59:43,819
Was I too harsh on her?

969
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:04,595
Don't take this path for a while.

970
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,017
I told you about the college student, right?

971
01:00:06,018 --> 01:00:07,708
The abduction was reported on this path.

972
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,075
It's a safety alarm.

973
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:24,284
It's no problem from your place and around here to my restaurant.

974
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:26,819
I specially prepared table number zero for you.

975
01:00:43,958 --> 01:00:47,282
(Always Sushi)

976
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:59,147
(So Jin)

977
01:01:04,876 --> 01:01:06,785
(So Jin)

978
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:42,520
(Missed call: So Jin)

979
01:01:52,046 --> 01:01:53,396
So Jin?

980
01:01:54,916 --> 01:01:57,355
Kang Hoon, someone's following me!

981
01:01:57,356 --> 01:01:58,693
- Where are you? - I'm...

982
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,007
in front of the traffic lights!

983
01:02:03,796 --> 01:02:05,146
Han So Jin!

984
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:09,346
Hey! Hey, Seo Kang Hoon!

985
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:17,286
Please... Please help me...

986
01:02:21,276 --> 01:02:23,576
Help me! Help!

987
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,045
Help me...

988
01:02:25,046 --> 01:02:26,392
Please...

989
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:28,166
Please, help me...

990
01:02:32,117 --> 01:02:34,337
Please, help me...

991
01:02:34,657 --> 01:02:37,846
Please... Please! Help me!

992
01:02:37,996 --> 01:02:42,646
- Please... Please help me! - Ms. Han So Jin!

993
01:02:43,737 --> 01:02:45,736
Please help me...

994
01:02:45,737 --> 01:02:47,817
- Ms. Han, are you all right? - Help!

995
01:02:48,037 --> 01:02:49,456
Ms. Han.

996
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:50,987
It's me, Sim Yeon Woo.

997
01:02:52,237 --> 01:02:54,757
Ms. Han, are you okay?

998
01:02:58,376 --> 01:02:59,415
Are you okay?

999
01:02:59,416 --> 01:03:00,693
So Jin!

1000
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:03,093
- Did he leave? - Kang Hoon.

1001
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:05,067
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1002
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,936
- Where did that jerk go? - That way.

1003
01:03:07,057 --> 01:03:08,576
- Please look after her. - Okay.

1004
01:03:25,077 --> 01:03:27,283
- Who are you? - Let go of me.

1005
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:29,297
That hurts!

1006
01:03:31,476 --> 01:03:33,216
I can't believe how low you're stooping!

1007
01:03:33,217 --> 01:03:35,815
What did I do? Well, what did I do?

1008
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:38,463
My information leaked all thanks to Han So Jin.

1009
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:40,363
My girlfriends dumped me.

1010
01:03:40,387 --> 01:03:42,225
I only came to tell her that.

1011
01:03:42,226 --> 01:03:43,955
I only came to talk!

1012
01:03:43,956 --> 01:03:46,376
So Jin almost got hurt because of you!

1013
01:03:46,996 --> 01:03:49,002
Hey, it wasn't me who did that.

1014
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:50,495
She fell on her own!

1015
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:51,565
You jerk!

1016
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,266
- Are you okay? Can you get up? - Yes.

1017
01:03:53,267 --> 01:03:54,617
Okay.

1018
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,257
Have you calmed down?

1019
01:04:07,046 --> 01:04:09,166
- Thank you... - What?

1020
01:04:09,546 --> 01:04:12,967
Thank you for rescuing me.

1021
01:04:16,796 --> 01:04:18,272
I'll take you home.

1022
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:19,646
Wait.

1023
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:23,947
I know this is random in this situation,

1024
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:27,657
but there is something I must tell you.

1025
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:31,826
That Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene you have...

1026
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:33,657
I told you.

1027
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:36,456
This isn't the way to get to know someone.

1028
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,145
Aside from my Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

1029
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:40,936
what do you know about me?

1030
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:42,936
I found out something else.

1031
01:04:43,887 --> 01:04:46,107
Aside from the Indecent Octopus Tentacle Gene,

1032
01:04:46,827 --> 01:04:49,206
you have the healer gene.

1033
01:04:52,626 --> 01:04:54,146
That wasn't what I meant.

1034
01:04:56,197 --> 01:05:00,157
Do you still want to talk to me about genes?

1035
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,987
The gene you have...

1036
01:05:04,137 --> 01:05:06,236
can save someone who wants to die...

1037
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:09,456
and make someone who cries all the time to smile.

1038
01:05:09,976 --> 01:05:13,297
For someone who has a fatally unlucky gene,

1039
01:05:13,416 --> 01:05:14,837
it's...

1040
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,107
It's a gene they really need.

1041
01:05:19,557 --> 01:05:20,976
So...

1042
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:23,076
I must learn more...

1043
01:05:24,996 --> 01:05:26,646
about you.

1044
01:05:29,066 --> 01:05:30,617
Do you want to learn more about me?

1045
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,117
Please let me continue...

1046
01:05:35,237 --> 01:05:38,326
the tests.

1047
01:05:47,987 --> 01:05:49,396
This woman...

1048
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:52,666
keeps calling attraction a test.

1049
01:05:54,086 --> 01:05:55,436
This is how...

1050
01:05:56,057 --> 01:05:57,607
you perform a test.

1051
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:46,906
(DNA Lover)

1052
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,458
- Let's go. - Hey.

1053
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:50,133
Do you like Ms. Han?

1054
01:06:51,212 --> 01:06:53,382
She's like family to me.

1055
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:55,299
Then mind your own business.

1056
01:06:55,323 --> 01:06:58,043
Family shouldn't come between a man and a woman.

1057
01:06:59,022 --> 01:07:01,521
You're suddenly acting like someone else.

1058
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:03,312
It gives me butterflies.

1059
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:05,443
Did I give you butterflies?

1060
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,661
One, two...

1061
01:07:07,662 --> 01:07:09,113
- Mandu soup. - Mandu soup.

1062
01:07:09,403 --> 01:07:10,852
Telepathy.

1063
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:12,731
- I want to check. - Check what?

1064
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:16,423
If genetic partners could communicate telepathically.

1065
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:17,923
Ms. Han So Jin.
