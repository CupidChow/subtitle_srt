Thank you for tonight.

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,078
- I had fun. - Thank you.

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,419

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:47,889

- See you again. Bye. - Bye.

18
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:23,620
I have...

19
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,760
an oddly bad feeling about this.

20
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,849
Come on.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,989
Anyone can tell she's Han So Jin.

(Episode 6: Crosstalk)

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,349
But what brings you here?

26
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,050
I was supposed to meet someone,

27
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,849
but I think we crossed paths.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,090
So Jin will be disappointed again.

29
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,288
Han So Jin?

30
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:31,389
But why...

31
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,529
Why are you here at the Han River?

32
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,830
Why? Can I not come here?

33
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,500
It's weird.

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,800
Are you the kind of guy who comes to the Han River...

35
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,699
around dinnertime by yourself?

36
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,300
Well, that is true,

37
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,539
but I didn't have an appetite today, so I came to work out.

38
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,339
Yes, but why are you at the Han River now,

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,710
at this hour, of all times?

40
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,779
I mean, I just wanted to go for a run today!

41
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,680
Gosh, are you satisfied?

42
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,119
- Yes, I'm on my way. - Gosh.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,218
I'm at Jamsu Bridge at the Han River.

44
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,818
- Why that... - Gosh, look at that.

45
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:05,289
He's not even wearing a helmet. That's so dangerous.

46
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,089
- What? - Oh...

47
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,388
That fanatic from last time?

48
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,399
But what brings you here?

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,229
I was giving a lecture around here.

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,000
How did I run into you here, though?

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,969
I guess my telepathy went to the wrong person.

52
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,300
Telepathy?

53
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,340
Didn't you send that telepathy to me?

54
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,879
It looks like you've been stood up.

55
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,978
Shall we go for a drink?

56
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,449
Maybe not today. I have other plans too.

57
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,689
Okay, then.

58
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,150
Oh, you'll come to this week's meeting, right?

59
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,789
I'll have to see.

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,120
Bye.

61
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,669
Han So Jin.

62
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,039
Everyone is there?

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,439
I'll be right there. Just wait a little.

64
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,710
Okay. Why are you always making such a fuss?

65
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,449
All right.

66
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,419
- Ma'am, are you okay? Are you hurt? - Goodness.

67
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,360
No, I'm fine.

68
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,129
- Goodness. - Look here, kid.

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,688
Don't you know that it's dangerous to talk on your phone...

70
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,699
while riding a scooter?

71
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,629
And why aren't you wearing a helmet?

72
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,269
You sped up without even looking ahead?

73
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,268
You're not the only one who could get hurt.

74
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,370
That lady almost got hurt because of you.

75
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,170
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,069
- Ma'am, I'm sorry. - Goodness.

77
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,110
My gosh.

78
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,040
He came to the Han River to save the old lady.

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,309
Goodbye, ma'am.

80
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,079
- Gosh, thank you. - Sure.

81
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,449
It's around here somewhere.

82
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,389
Gosh.

83
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,629
She should be back from the Han River by now.

84
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,060
There's no need to keep her phone off.

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,159
I'm at the Han River too. Where are you?

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,129
This isn't easy.

94
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,139
I can treat that myself later.

95
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,310
You don't treat your wounds on time and always end up with scars.

96
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,879
There you go.

97
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,448
All right. Show me your leg now.

98
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:42,910
What? Hey.

99
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,149
I'm only going to show my bare legs to my future wife.

100
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,750
You can do that when you get married.

101
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,219
- Here. - Hey.

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,560
Look here.

103
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,060
Why, you little... Sit still.

104
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:58,829
Let's see.

105
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,850
If your mother were alive,

106
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,920
she would've told you to quit working as a fireman.

107
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,389
Having a job as a man...

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,259
is the same as being married to one woman.

109
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,360
That's what she would've said had she been alive.

110
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,949
Did you change your shampoo? You smell nice.

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,480
It's been the same for the past three years.

112
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,350
You said you only smelled a burnt scent before.

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
That's right.

114
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,500
Oh, it's all done now.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Thanks.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,198
Let's go home now.

117
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,729
Hey, but.. Your face is still...

118
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,029
I'll put ointment on it at home.

119
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,040
What are you doing? Hurry up.

120
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,279
Okay. I'm coming.

121
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,389
Isn't he handsome?

122
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,329
How would anyone have known?

123
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,159
I've been divorced three times,

124
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,360
but I met my fated match at this age.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,898
Jang Mi, you should also...

126
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,269
kick your husband to the curb and find your destiny.

127
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,569
My husband...

128
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,370
has had countless women,

129
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,839
but he came back to me every time he broke up with them.

130
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,279
I still feel as if he would come in with a smile.

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,290
He'll come crawling back to you when he's old and feeble?

132
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,189
You'll grow old in that time too.

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,099
Gosh, you were so pretty and talented.

134
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
But because you met one wrong man,

135
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,930
you're living in this huge house all by yourself.

136
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,769
You're like a stuffed animal.

137
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,169
Hey, Yeon Woo.

138
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,470
Hey, Auntie. Welcome back.

139
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,610
- Oh, my. Yes. - Have you been well?

140
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,949
Darn it.

141
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,209
I focused so hard to send that message.

142
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,750
He really didn't get it?

143
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,489
Even telepathy...

144
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,159
can only work with a cause-and-effect relationship.

145
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,960
You have no incidents or memories that you share.

146
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:43,830
What telepathy do you expect?

147
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,730
Twins that never met each other since being separated as kids...

148
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,340
really had a telepathic connection.

149
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,669
So Jin, only souls can transcend...

150
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,110
time and space.

151
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,779
- Souls? - Yes, souls.

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,049
That's what Father Andrea said.

153
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,860
Whether it's the soul or telepathy,

154
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,259
it didn't work.

155
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,839

163
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,070
"I want to meet you."

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,509
"I want to meet you so badly."

165
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,610
You send a signal.

166
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,049
Just come.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,049
Come even if you have to work overtime.

168
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,350
Come no matter what, even if you don't want to.

169

It suddenly started pouring rain.

171
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:30,229
It seems like a sun shower, but it's pretty heavy rain.

172
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,369
Take this. It might rain again later.

173
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,309
The rain has already stopped anyway.

174
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,070
Give me that umbrella.

175

- I think I have the aches. - Do you want to work out?

178
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,319
When you have the aches, you should just sweat it out...

179
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,960
and go to the sauna to cure it.

180
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,230
- It worked. - What?

181
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,690
Oh, nothing.

186

Here it comes.

187
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,720
I sent a telepathic message to Yeon Woo.

188
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,648
But at 8:30pm...

189
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,690

190
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,219

191
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,490
(What's that? I've never seen anything like that.)

192

(So Jin, Yeon Woo)

194
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,639
Was it refracted...

195
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,638
and sent to Kang Hoon?

Failed.

201
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,789
Why did she send so many messages?

202
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,730
Calling doesn't seem like that great of an idea.

208
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,548

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,960
Oh, this is Han River Snack Bar.

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,788
There's a new snack bar that opened near your place.

212
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,428

213
00:12:38,429 --> 00:12:39,899

in front of Han River Snack Bar last night.

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,889
So, Yeon Woo was in front of Han River Snack Bar?

A Ri.

223
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,159
My telepathic message must've been delivered.

224
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,840
Yeon Woo did receive my telepathic message.

225
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,309
But maybe he received the message...

226
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,240
as "Han River..."

227

228
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,950
and not as an image.

229
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,449
Seeing you try to force things,

230
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,320
you won't have to continue this experiment.

231

There are so many nagging mothers-in-law in the comments.

234

A crosstalk.

239

The communication from one device...

240
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,139
is interfered by another communication device.

241
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,539
Due to a coincidental connection with someone,

242
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,649
there was an interference in the signal.

243
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:07,519
So, that might be why he didn't receive my telepathic message.

244
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,950
Then, did someone else send...

245
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,690
another weird telepathic message to Sewer?

00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,889
Could you maybe appear in it?

332
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:17,660

Hey, come on.

337
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:31,108

I think, if you make this into a movie,

340
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,078
it could be of more help.

341
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,920

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,470
By the way, Mi Eun,

349
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,109
since when did you start dating...

350
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,509
several men at once?

351
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,950
Gosh, sorry.

352
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,789
Goodness.

353
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,819
Was that question too strong?

354
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:21,019
Since I was 28 years old.

355
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,129
Dating was a good thing,

356
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,258
but I first had the thought that...

357
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,329
I didn't like hurting one another in order to possess one's partner.

358
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,099
Then, perhaps, about being polyamorous...

359
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,268
Do you tell the guy about it before you start dating?

360
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,170
Or do you hide it?

361
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,739
If you tell the other person that you're polyamorous...

362
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,109
after you start dating exclusively, it's fraud.

363
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,219
And that's not something you can persuade someone about.

364
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,180
If you do, it's gaslighting.

365
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,319
When you were young, were you perhaps sexually abused...

366
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,230
or the victim of sexual harassment?

367
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,730
I mean, seeing how you have relationships with many men at once,

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,400
it seems like it could be a lack of affection.

369
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,538
Abnormal people...

370
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:09,109
all have a traumatic experience or two.

371
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,180
Who decides whether someone is normal or abnormal?

372
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,480
Am I abnormal because I'm different from you?

373
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,579
Then I'll ask you a question.

374
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,349
Are you normal?

375
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:26,119
Why do you think that's my perspective?

376
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,029
I'm saying most normal men are like that.

377
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,359
I mean, most people are like that.

378
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,569
What is the real reason you're making this movie?

379
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:41,869
I see.

380
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,140
You must think the story of a woman who went through that...

381
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,839
becoming polyamorous will be very popular.

382
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:51,479
Hey, you're weird today.

383
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,650
You're not usually like this. Why are you getting upset?

384
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,920
Do you really have some sort of trauma?

385
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,759
I'm sorry for not having trauma.

386
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,859
Come on.

387
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,059
Let go of me.

388
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,000
What are you doing?

389
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,069
- Let go of me. - Come on.

390
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,538
Have one more drink.

391
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,369
- Oh, no. - Oh, my!

392
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,768
I'm sorry. I spilled that.

393
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,039
- Hey, Sim Yeon Woo! - I'm sorry.

394
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,039
- Seriously... - I'm so sorry.

395
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,480
I tripped. Sorry.

396
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,750
You used to ignore things like that pretty well.

397
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:30,890
You're right.

398
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,660
Why did I act that way?

399
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,759
Didn't you choose this path,

400
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,930
knowing it was a difficult one?

401
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,729
Don't pay them any mind.

402
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,630
I like how confident you are, Mi Eun.

403
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,170
Don't lose your nerve.

404
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,339
How did you feel?

405
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,980
What?

406
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,609
When I first told you that I was polyamorous.

407
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,019
How did you feel?

408
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,019
At first,

409
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,630
it was hard to go along with it.

410
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,730
I liked it.

411
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,630
Really? You liked it?

412
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,140
I liked that amount of comfortable distance.

413
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:21,839
A relationship that is not too far and not too close.

414
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,670
I liked it.

415
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,650
Dating a polyamorous person...

416
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,849
was also my choice.

417
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:35,890
Whether you were polyamorous or not,

418
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,589
I most looked forward...

419
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,059
to spending time with you.

420
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,130
But why did we break up?

421
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:49,730
Back then,

422
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:53,170
we felt...

423
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,410
like a movie with just the ending left.

424
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,409
Also,

425
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,309
you were the one who ghosted me. I didn't do that.

426
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,680
And you ghosted me for six months.

427
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,849
Six months.

428
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,829
A Ri. Don't you get tired of that?

429
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,730
How do you eat that whenever the vendor comes?

430
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,539
Are you from Gangwon Province or something?

431
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,769
Not all people who like potatoes are from Gangwon Province.

432
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,539
What a strange way to stereotype people by region.

433
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,278
Where are you from?

434
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,339
Gangwon Province.

435
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,250
A Ri.

436
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,349
You have something on your mind, don't you?

437
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,630
Have you ever experienced this?

438
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,329
- Experienced what? - Strangely feeling the desire...

439
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,369
to approach someone you just met.

440
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,439
Did you finally meet someone like that?

441
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,769
Father Andrea.

442
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,539
- A Father? - Yes.

443
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,279
But I'm worried about something.

444
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,950
What is it?

445
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,619
It's nothing. I'm heading to bed.

446
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,390
(My beloved Ga Hee)

447
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,569
- You're here. - Hi.

448
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,000
I went to the psychiatrist yesterday,

449
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,210
and they told me I've gotten much better, so I'm happy.

450
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,079
I'm going to put some effort toward anti-aging treatments now.

451
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,279
I have many plans. So many.

452
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,779
That's good to hear.

453
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,519
You look happy too.

454
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:26,990
I have some nice plans as well.

455
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,798
(119 Emergency Response)

456
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,529
(Patrol)

457
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,839
She must be focused on losing weight for the competition.

458
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,210
- What are you doing? Oh, my! - Oh, goodness.

459
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:51,880
You scared me!

460
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,849
I was passing by,

461
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,559
and I thought we could have lunch together if you were around.

462
00:26:58,819 --> 00:26:59,960
- Me? - Yes.

463
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,059
What about Yeon Woo?

464
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,759
That punk is busy.

465
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,029
He seems to be planning a lot to win Ms. Han's heart.

466
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,529
He's a player, and now he's even making plans. How can he do that?

467
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:11,470
Kang Hoon!

468
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,508
- Oh, hello. - Hi, Sung Mi.

469
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,039
Hi. What brings you here?

470
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,539
This is lactose-free protein.

471
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,209
Having enough protein is very important.

472
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,480
You should have it when you're eating salad.

473
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,518
Oh, thank you.

474
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,980
You didn't have to.

475
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,789
Aren't you late? I thought you said you had lunch plans.

476
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,190
What?

477
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:38,328
Right. See you later, Sung Mi.

478
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:41,400
Hey, we were supposed to eat together...

479
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,599
Oh, no. It would've been nice to eat together.

480
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,299
Yes. Somehow, things ended up this way...

481
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,639
- I'll contact you next week. - Okay.

482
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,539
- Thank you. - Thank you.

483
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,460
Hello?

484
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,429
- Did you have a good meeting? - Yes.

485
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,660
So Jin, do you want to go see a celestial show...

486
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,660
tomorrow evening?

487
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,329
You like observing the stars.

488
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,869
If we miss the chance...

489
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:21,068
to see the five planets together,

490
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:24,309
you'll have to wait about another 18 years.

491
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,079
We can see the five planets,

492
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,879
Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter,

493
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,179
all at once?

494
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,749
With our bare eyes and not with telescopes?

495
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,818
Really?

496
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,749
It would be right before the sun comes up at dawn,

497
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,920
so it's not the best time,

498
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,359
but you're the only person I can think of who will get up...

499
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:42,430
that early to come with me.

500
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,989
It's not too early.

501
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,929
I'll get hand warmers and blankets ready right away.

502
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,699
Oh, and we'd also need a tripod.

503
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,469
- And what else would we need? - This...

504
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,699
is in Gapyeong, so it's a bit far.

505
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,970
How about we take off tomorrow evening at 10pm?

506
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,769
Okay. That sounds good.

507
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,409
That sounds good. If so, let's meet tomorrow with happy faces. Okay?

508
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,739
I'll go to pick you up.

509
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,950
Okay. See you tomorrow.

510
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
Amazing.

511
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,119
A tripod.

512
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,618
(RSVP to the celestial show, Not attending)

513
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,619
(Your response has been submitted.)

514
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,619
(Number of participants: 7)

515
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,930
(Io, Europa, Ganymede)

516
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,839
One serving of sundae, please.

517
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,210
We're seeing each other often.

518
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:38,750
Is today the day you come to your writing room?

519
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,278
I checked the sprinklers...

520
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,549
and added three safety keys, so don't worry.

521
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:46,359
Good job.

522
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,589
I want...

523
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,859
to live a safer life now.

524
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,669
(Can Yeon Woo not come? Is he busy?)

525
00:29:58,670 --> 00:29:59,970
(It must be because of a woman. Tell us who it is.)

526
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,368
One more fishcake, please.

527
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,409
(I wish Yeon Woo could come with us.)

528
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,240
(We'll go ahead this time. Don't be jealous after seeing the pictures!)

529
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,339
Here, ma'am. I'm paying for the person next to me too.

530
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,579
- Wait... - I'll buy today.

531
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,019
Here's your to-go order.

532
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,460
I liked that amount of comfortable distance.

533
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,059
A relationship that is not too far and not too close.

534
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,299
Ms. Jang.

535
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,630
I'll win you over with my sensibility, Han So Jin.

536
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,508
The splendid celestial show of the five planets...

537
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:11,639
that'll take place early morning tomorrow...

538
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,239
is predicted to be visible...

539
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,038
- from the eastern sky at dawn. - Organize these parts away...

540
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,279
- so they're out of sight. - Okay.

541
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,479
Aren't you going home?

542
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,548
- I will soon. - If you miss this chance,

543
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:20,048
you will have to wait until September of 2040...

544
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,288
when the five planets line up once again.

545
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,450
Gosh.

546
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,058
Popular stargazing spots will be so crowded today.

547
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:29,160
Everything will be fine, right?

548
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,828
Do you like stargazing too?

549
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,699
Hey. What's the fun in sitting still and looking at stars?

550
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,130
But I do want to use stargazing as an excuse to try glamping.

551
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,969
The nice places...

552
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,700
have large TVs, sofas, and beds at a minimum,

553
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:44,039
and they even have wine fridges and bars.

554
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,609
They're not tents. They're hotels.

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
(So Jin)

556
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,519
Sung Mi. One second.

557
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,289
Hey, Kang Hoon.

558
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:02,289
I'm going to a celestial show, so I won't be back home today.

559
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,429
- What? - So I was thinking,

560
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,230
could you walk Shai today?

561
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,630
A Ri fell asleep early because she's a bit sick.

562
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:11,970
A celestial show?

563
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,368
With who? Alone?

564
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,969
No. With Yeon Woo.

565
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,838
- What? - We're going to go camping too.

566
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,440
That punk is busy.

567
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,809
He seems to be planning a lot to win Ms. Han's heart.

568
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,950
He's a player, and now he's even making plans. How can he do that?

569
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,588
So you're going to...

570
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:33,289
spend the night together?

571
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,258
No. We're not spending the night together. We'll only be outside.

572
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,859
We're just going to see the stars.

573
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:41,730
Anyway, thank you.

574
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,900
Sung Mi.

575
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,900
I'll head out first.

576
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,509
Okay. Bye.

577
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,670
Why is she doing this?

578
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,579
Why?

579
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,549
You can...

580
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,349
You can just see the stars from home!

581
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,179
Emergency.

582
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,319
Oh, my.

583
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,150
- So Jin. - Yes?

584
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,920
- It's a bit heavy. - Okay.

585
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,029
- Here we go. - It's so pretty!

586
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,869
That should face down.

587
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:22,210
Okay. Here.

588
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,779
And we put it on top?

589
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,318
- Here. - It looks pretty nice.

590
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,179
- You can take a break. - Is there anything I can do...

591
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,250
Look at the stars.

592
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:44,559
Amazing.

593
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,528
Yeon Woo! There are so many stars in the sky!

594
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:49,599
Right?

595
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,538
It's so pretty.

596
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:54,940
Gosh, So Jin.

597
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,470
He's such a player. How could she fall for his tricks?

598
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:01,578
What is she thinking?

599
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,879
When she falls for someone, there's no cure.

600
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,980
It's happened so many times.

601
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,230
You have arrived at your destination.

602
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,948
- Cheers. - Cheers.

603
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,880
- I drank too much. - Cheers.

604
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,150
Gosh. This is so good.

605
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,488
When should we have our next meeting?

606
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,489
The next meeting?

607
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,599
Is that so?

608
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,500
Where is she hiding?

609
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:00,698
Kang Hoon?

610
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,538
(Campsite A, Cooking Area, Campsite B, Family Campsite)

611
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:03,670
Gosh.

612
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,110
Okay. Campsite A.

613
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,079
(Campsite A, Cooking Area, Campsite B)

614
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,449
(Campsite A, Cooking Area, Campsite B, Family Campsite)

615
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,460
(Campsite A)

616
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,529
- So Jin. - Yes?

617
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,558
Eat up. Okay?

618
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,000
- Why? - When we get to the top,

619
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,130
you're not allowed to eat anything because of pollution.

620
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:31,400
- Here. Open wide. - I can...

621
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,570
So Jin!

622
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,940
- Kang Hoon. What are you doing... - Gosh.

623
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,210
What a coincidence...

624
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,050
meeting you here.

625
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,848
This really isn't right.

626
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,289
It isn't.

627
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:51,689
I just came to check it out because So Jin...

628
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,960
kept going on about it.

629
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,119
To see the stars.

630
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,690
You came because you were worried...

631
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,059
about the crowds being a safety hazard, didn't you?

632
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,929
- That's part of the reason. Yes. - Gosh.

633
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,969
Let's see.

634
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,598
There are three hours,

635
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,110
45 minutes, and 32 seconds until the planets come up.

636
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,379
Kang Hoon. The stars are so visible from here. Let's watch together.

637
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,678
- Really? - That's okay, right?

638
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,408
No. That's not right.

639
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:17,880
- He's just joking. - Shall we?

640
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Thank you.

641
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,289
It is pretty cold.

642
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,789
Right? When it's cold,

643
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,800
you need a blanket.

644
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,170
Gosh. It is pretty chilly...

645
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,940
here in the mountains.

646
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,198
You're right. It's really cold.

647
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,210
Are you cold?

648
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,710
One second.

649
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,050
I'm cold too.

650
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,920
Gosh. How cozy.

651
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,119
Are you warm?

652
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,650
Okay. Should we eat some gopchang jeongol?

653
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,119
Pardon?

654
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,090
Was this gopchang jeongol?

655
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,598
So Jin can't eat gopchang. Didn't you know?

656
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,828
I'm sure my gopchang jeongol is a bit different.

657
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,670
I'm sure it's tasty and fantastic.

658
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,940
I'll try it, Kang Hoon.

659
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,539
Good choice.

660
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:18,009
I've gotten sick after eating gopchang before,

661
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,510
but I should get over that trauma.

662
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,849
Here. Open wide.

663
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:33,960
Come on. Do you want to go to the bathroom and vomit all night?

664
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,590
I told you that accidents happen when you assume things are safe.

665
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,058
They say when you eat something...

666
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:43,928
with a happy heart, it all becomes your blood and flesh.

667
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:44,929
Right.

668
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,969
Open wide.

669
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,210
Oh, no. It's hot.

670
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:58,880
This is the taste of blood and flesh, I see.

671
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:04,849
Look here.

672
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,260
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

673
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,929
Was that bromance or what?

674
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,429
You handled that heat pretty well.

675
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:23,070
Hey. I went through a lot to get that champagne.

676
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,039
You should've brought something with no alcohol.

677
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,339
You're not even going to drink because you have to drive.

678
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,809
It is non-alcoholic.

679
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:33,118
Yeon Woo. Why did you come prepared to sleep...

680
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,049
when you're here to watch the stars? What's with that tent?

681
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,319
We have to sleep if we get tired while watching the stars, Kang Hoon.

682
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,559
Gosh. I don't like you.

683
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,289
Wait.

684
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,260
Where am I?

685
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:48,659
Gosh. Please give me service.

686
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,039
- Okay. Time-out. - What?

687
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,169
Why are you doing all this?

688
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,239
What do you mean?

689
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:00,940
Why are you being so nosy?

690
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,780
So Jin will meet a good guy.

691
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:10,988
A guy who will love her so much...

692
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,559
and stay by her side forever.

693
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,789
Until that guy shows up, I'm on guard duty.

694
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,929
Don't you think you're going a bit too far...

695
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,598
to call yourself family?

696
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,570
Yeon Woo. Even if I had real sisters,

697
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,840
I would've never let them date you. I couldn't.

698
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,239
Gosh. It's so cold.

699
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,639
I'm so cold.

700
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,808
- Yes, Sung Mi? - Seo Kang Hoon.

701
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,049
We have received an emergency standby order.

702
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,149
- Pardon? - You should hurry over here.

703
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,449
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there right away.

704
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,448
What happened?

705
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,288
I received an emergency call. I need to get going.

706
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:47,590
Oh, no.

707
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,828
It's okay. You should get going.

708
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,428
You can't get hurt, okay?

709
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,059
If you get hurt, I won't see you again.

710
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:56,500
Okay. Bye.

711
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
Bye.

712
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,199
He's a bit... How can I put it?

713
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:03,769
He's...

714
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:08,679
Take care of So Jin.

715
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:25,360
You two are closer than I thought.

716
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,369
It must be because we grew up together.

717
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,199
When he gets hurt, I also feel the pain.

718
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,599
So I can't have him get hurt.

719
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,369
The first time we met, I saw her tears.

720
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,980
She's someone who should never get hurt.

721
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,650
Shall we go to see the stars?

722
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,309
Shall we?

723
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,280
Where is this?

724
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:56,059
What?

725
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,230
Finally...

726
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:07,300
Should I turn the lights off to get a better view?

727
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,039
Sounds good.

728
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,019
My goodness.

729
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,949
I can see them so well!

730
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,159
The brightest one is Venus.

731
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,190
They're in a straight line.

732
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,829
So Jin, come here.

733
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,030
- What? - Come.

734
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:41,969
Come and look.

735
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,210
- Can you see it? - Yes.

736
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:51,980
It's Io!

737
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,550
Amazing.

738
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,389
It looks so beautiful,

739
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,789
but hundreds of volcanic explosions are happening inside it.

740
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,059
Do you want to take a look too?

741
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,859
You might assume Io is hot...

742
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,300
because of the volcanic eruptions,

743
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,170
but it's actually cold because it doesn't get sunlight.

744
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,539
Then is Io's DNA lover the sun...

745
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,409
instead of Jupiter?

746
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,590
What?

747
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,029
Did you bring that with you on purpose?

748
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,260
It seemed important to you.

749
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,030
I got it repaired.

750
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,070
Do you want to listen to it together?

751
00:43:23,469 --> 00:43:24,570
Isn't it strange?

752
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,639
After I broke up with a cheater,

753
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,579
this song would always make me cry.

754
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,349
But today,

755
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:36,690
it sounds so nice.

756
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,760
Hey.

757
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,960
Is telepathy that important to you?

758
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,730
Well...

759
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:52,469
If I'm able to telepathically communicate with my partner,

760
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,440
I'd be able to feel his pains...

761
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,210
at his worst moments too.

762
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,880
For example,

763
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:04,480
on days that are so difficult...

764
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,519
that he wants to die.

765
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,329
Since we listened to this song together,

766
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,599
that makes me your destiny.

767
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,639
What are you saying?

768
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:32,909
Yeon Woo?

769
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,840
What?

770
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,880
What?

771
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,780
How could I possibly run into you here?

772
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,750
It happened at Mount Nam too.

773
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,349
"Mount Nam?"

774
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,920
I came with the travel club,

775
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:49,960
but I lost my way and ended up here.

776
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,428
Why don't we all go down together?

777
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:57,570
Shall we go?

778
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,639
Here. Okay.

779
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,480
He called her a fanatic, and she's kind of cute.

780
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,780
She probably made many fanatics cry with those big round eyes.

781
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,480
That's Jang Mi Eun, right?

782
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,988
She's a famous dating columnist.

783
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:20,259
She has porcelain skin and espresso-like eyes.

784
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,189
She's not just an ordinary kind of beauty.

785
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,589
So Jin, please say hello. She's...

786
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,300
Hello, I'm Jang Mi Eun.

787
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,099
I'm Yeon Woo's ex-girlfriend.

788
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,530
Sorry?

789
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:32,599
I see.

790
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,500
I heard a lot about you, Ms. Han.

791
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,340
Nice to meet you.

792
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,639
Nice to meet you too.

793
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,349
- All right. - Do you want some fruits?

794
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,750
- Sure. - I'll go wash some.

795
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,019
Sounds great.

796
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,130
No way.

797
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,170
Did they meet at Mount Nam...

798
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,539
while I was sending him a telepathy?

799
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,539
That means...

800
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:17,010
Did her signals get between...

801
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,480
our signals to cause a crosstalk between 8pm and 9pm?

802
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,289
Was she the one that caused the interference?

803
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,090
I see.

804
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,300
You skipped our club meeting, so I wondered what happened.

805
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,369
So you were with her all along.

806
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,038
Anyway, how did we run into each other again?

807
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:43,839
It's not uncommon for us.

808
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,769
Right. I guess you remember.

809
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,849
Isn't it rare for such a situation to happen?

810
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,210
What is this?

811
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:02,960
The fire at S Officetel in Cheongdam-dong has been put out.

812
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,190
We're currently searching for additional casualties.

813
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,929
Checking for lingering fire with a thermal imaging camera.

814
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,960
No additional casualties on this side.

815
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:34,320
- Good work. - Thank you.

816
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,760
Why are you taking a picture? Forensics will do it anyway.

817
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,030
A lot of goods were damaged because of the water.

818
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,400
It's a habit of mine to take pictures just in case.

819
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,199
No one entered the place before or after the fire.

820
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,610
It was double locked.

821
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,769
It's strange a fire started.

822
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,309
If the victim is a target,

823
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,150
I think the clue might be in here.

824
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,449
According to the witnesses,

825
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,018
she was with the child of a married man,

826
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:03,519
so bad rumors were going around.

827
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,619
Do you think that might have something to do with it?

828
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,130
Gosh.

829
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:20,340
Goodness.

830
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:28,980
(Happiness will surely come.)

831
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:37,349
If I'm able to telepathically communicate with my partner,

832
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,389
I'd be able to feel his pains...

833
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:43,159
at his worst moments too.

834
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:45,829
For example,

835
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,130
on days that are so difficult...

836
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,329
that he wants to die.

837
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,039
That fanatic.

838
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:03,710
("Will We Be a Good Fit?")

839
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,559
("Will We Be a Good Fit?" Author Jang Mi Eun)

A Man Who Cracks Crabs for You.

841
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:22,329
He's asking about dating a fanatic.

842
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,639
When having a fling with a woman who seems to be a total fanatic,

843
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:31,269
you must learn her favorite line.

844
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:34,009
Then, you can say it for her.

845
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:36,949
This is because if one shares what they love,

846
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,679
it'll hit the spot.

847
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,650
Secondly,

848
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:45,519
nerds have a higher expectation...

849
00:49:45,889 --> 00:49:49,489
when it comes to love. Please keep that in mind.

850
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:53,630
If you don't meet their standard, they'll be really disappointed.

851
00:49:55,329 --> 00:49:58,429
Share what she loves?

852
00:49:58,530 --> 00:49:59,769
Meet her expectations?

853
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:01,538
But that's telepathy for her.

854
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:03,210
What do you want me to do?

855
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,010
Wait, no.

856
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,320
It doesn't necessarily have to be by chance.

857
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,949
If it doesn't happen by coincidence, I'll make it into a coincidence.

858
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,250
Yes.

Why do they look like they'd be a good fit?

865
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,420
Why did they break up?

866
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,719
She's so beautiful.

867
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,000

869
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,579

What? Yeon Woo.

872
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,070
Can I also do an experiment?

873
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,308
An experiment?

874
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:20,638
I'll choose the rules this time.

875
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:22,979
However, if this test is successful,

876
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,449
let's go out on an official date.

877
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,449
You don't think my experiments are a joke, do you?

878
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:34,989
No, they seem sincere. I'm not joking either.

879
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,929
Let's test our telepathy for the last time.

Why do you have so many disposable stuff? Is this a hotel?

883
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,550
Was that what you wanted to discuss?

884
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:03,789
You'll help me, won't you?

885
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:04,989
What is this?

886
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:07,960
It sounds like money to me.

887
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:10,559
It'll be in exchange for a night at the Grand Hotel. River view.

888
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,029
I know you love staycations.

889
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,159
You can go for night swims there with a city view.

890

Grand Hotel, river view,

891
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,400

893
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,639

(Oksu Station)

896
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,880
She'll likely take the subway since it's rush hour.

897
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,380
Follow her closely, okay?

898
00:53:36,789 --> 00:53:37,789
Okay.

899
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,058
She's at the station as you predicted.

900
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:42,189
Make sure she doesn't find out, okay?

901
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,929
Don't you worry.

902
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,429

903

Look at him. What's wrong with him?

904

Gosh.

905
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,109

908
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,289
(Line Two, Line Five)

909
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,030
(Line Two)

910
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,539
Okay. It's Line Two.

911
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,939
If she's going to Culture Complex Station,

912
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,038
she'll likely transfer to Line Three at Gyodae Station.

913
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:32,839
Call me right away when she gets off at Gyodae Station.

914
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,879
No, call me even if she doesn't get off...

915
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,178
because that means she'll go to the aquarium.

916
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:37,409
Okay.

917
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:40,880
Sorry.

918
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:42,650
Gosh.

919
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,218
What is this? My wallet...

920
00:54:48,219 --> 00:54:50,690
Hey! Stop right there!

921
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,169
Catch him! Stop him!

922
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,170
Thief!

923
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,739
Gosh...

924
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,209
That jerk stole my wallet!

925
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,179
Why are you just watching?

926
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,579
How mean.

927
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:15,579
Gosh.

928
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:17,619
Get him!

929
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,989
That wallet's mine.

930
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:22,119
Thank you, mister.

931
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:24,059
- You punk. - Darn it.

932
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:26,559
Thank...

933
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,699
I thought it sounded like you.

934
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,199
It's me, Nam Sung Mi.

935
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:37,639
Ms. Nam...

936
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,110
Of course I know who you are.

937
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,510
I know...

938
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,449
I know you only too well.

939
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,578
(Yeongdongpo-gu Office Station)

940
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:47,750
Where is it?

941
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,210
(Transfer to Line Five)

942
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,039
What? You lost her?

943
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,980
Why? Where? How?

944
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:19,480
Who's beside you?

945
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,590
Hello? Jung Tam?

946
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,090
Is it the aquarium or the cultural complex?

947
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:35,829
Both are possible.

948
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:39,400
Telepathy...

949
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,868
Mommy shark

950
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:46,980
Mommy shark

951
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:49,409
- Hello. - Hello.

952
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:52,979
Daddy shark

953
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,380
Grandma shark

954
00:56:55,719 --> 00:56:58,250
- Grandpa shark - It smells like fish.

955
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,320
The smell of fish.

956
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:02,590
Even if they're in a different place from you,

957
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:05,459
someone can feel the same thing as you...

958
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,799
at the same time.

959
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,059
I call the person who you can do that communication with...

960
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:11,369
your genetic partner.

961
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:16,139
How is that even possible?

962
00:57:40,829 --> 00:57:42,059
Should I bet on it?

963
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,469
Hello?

964
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:20,268
Yeon Woo, where are you right now?

965
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,339
I'm...

966
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:23,710
I'll now explain the next piece.

967
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:27,579
In this piece, only half of the face was painted.

968
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:30,479
The blank half allows the viewer to imagine...

969
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,109
I'm sorry, I left the office late because I had too many patients.

970
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:35,849
The cars in front of me are stalling.

971
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:38,920
I don't know where you are, but I'll be there soon. I'm sorry.

972
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,099
Let's end it here.

973
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,500
I'm sure you'll change too.

974
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,369
- Excuse me. - Yes?

975
00:59:25,469 --> 00:59:28,599
I'm so sorry, but we close at 8pm.

976
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,039
Oh, okay.

977
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:35,110
I'm sorry.

978
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,190
Should we meet here by chance in ten years?

979
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,299
We made memories here,

980
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,369
so I'm sure we'll meet again by chance.

981
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:00,369
I told you to stop talking about ten years from now.

982
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:04,309
That makes me sad.

983
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,550
I guess we can't communicate telepathically.

984
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,479
What could've interfered with the signals?

985
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,549
What?

986
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,989
Is it because he has more memories...

987
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:22,759
with Ms. Jang than with me?

988
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,260
But I lost my way and ended up here.

989
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:31,269
Maybe there wasn't any crosstalk.

990
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,869
That means Yeon Woo and I...

991
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,510
So Jin!

992
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,309
So Jin!

993
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,920
We finally communicated...

994
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:53,718
telepathically.

995
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:54,789
I guess so.

996
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,230
Talk about making our own destiny.

997
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,429
Did you know?

998
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,329
It's the first time you said the word "destiny."

999
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:11,639
Should we grab a bite? I'm hungry.

1000
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,239
Sure.

1001
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:16,579
That was how my first date started...

1002
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,280
with the fanatic I liked.

1003
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:23,218
Daddy shark

1004
01:01:23,219 --> 01:01:25,789
Daddy shark

1005
01:01:25,989 --> 01:01:28,859
- Grandma shark - It smells like fish.

1006
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,989
- Grandpa shark - The smell of fish.

1007
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:38,230
(Fish)

1008
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,500
(DNA Lover)

1009
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:14,499
What if you end up having a fling only?

1010
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,169
This won't do. From now on,

1011
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:18,440
I'll make him eat what I eat.

1012
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,909
It's called, "like-attracts-like germ."

1013
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:23,038
Doesn't it look scrumptious?

1014
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,279
I'm so hungry.

1015
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,550
Yeon Woo is a picky eater.

1016
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,178
Please let me leave.

1017
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:29,650
- So Jin! - Please.

1018
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,618
They not only have the same taste in food,

1019
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:33,218
but they also share moods, personalities, tastes,

1020
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:35,118
and the way they think too!

1021
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,658
The kinship between them...

1022
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:38,289
doesn't exist between me and him.

1023
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,599
Meeting your destiny...

1024
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,530
and having them as your own are two different things.
