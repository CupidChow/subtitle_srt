1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,800
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,100
Take me away!

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,920
Let's go! Let's go!

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:16,800
I want it.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,730
It's... It's...

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,860
1405.

7
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,830
Hello. Hello.

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,990
It's not you! It's you! It's me! It's you! It's me!

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,890
You have deviated from your destination.

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,930
You have deviated from your destination.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,530
You're off the destination.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,660
Young man.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,660
Why did you leave without picking him up?

14
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,660
I didn't mean it.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,560
How about

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,660
Get in the car.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,160
Passengers in 1405 have arrived.

18
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,090
Please send to the Reincarnation Gate immediately.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,560
Please send the passengers to the Reincarnation Gate before midnight.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,260
After midnight,

21
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,600
The reincarnation door is closed.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,860
You'll pay for it.

23
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,660
Hey, man. Let's go.

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,330
Can you do me a favor

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,060
can you do me a favor?

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,800
Granny.

27
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,830
My mission is to send you to the Reincarnation Gate.

28
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,729
I can't help you

29
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,860
I can't help you.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,960
It's near the Gate of Reincarnation.

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,800
Granny.

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,290
We're almost there.

33
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,330
Get ready.

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,829
Get ready to get off.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,530
Where did he go?

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,430
Don't do it. Don't do it.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,530
If you don't want to be reincarnated,

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:24,800
I want to live.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,860
The Reincarnation Gate is open.

40
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,320
The living must stay away.

41
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,829
Grandma!

42
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,760
Grandma, come out!

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,060
At the end of life.

44
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,430
The beginning of death.

45
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,690
The door is open! The door is open!

46
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,030
The boundary is gone

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,760
[Yin and Yang are intertwined.]

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
Life and death respond.

49
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,030
Ghosts are the guide.

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,430
Reincarnation.

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,060
Who are you?

52
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,430
Tell me your name.

53
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Young man.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,829
Let's go.

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,760
We don't have much time left.

56
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,960
Honey.

57
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,230
These are all your favorite.

58
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,660
Dumplings. Okay.

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,160
Here you go. Here you go.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,260
Osmanthus cake.

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,930
Hello. Hello.

62
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,630
It's almost time.

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,700
Almost.

64
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,060
Soon.

65
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,560
We promised to come here

66
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,600
every year on this day.

67
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,560
The stars are not here.

68
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,360
You're not here either.

69
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,730
Honey.

70
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,030
Are you back?

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,630
Where are you?

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,760
Old man.

73
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,900
I'm here.

74
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,160
Granny.

75
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,190
We still have some time.

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,460
Thank you.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Young man.

78
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,060
60 years ago,

79
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,160
you made a promise to me

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,460
in the starry sky.

81
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,430
Now,

82
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,200
I used the fireflies

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,500
to say goodbye.

84
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,130
I'll eat well.

85
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,330
and sleep well.

86
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,660
Honey.

87
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,300
Wait for me there.
