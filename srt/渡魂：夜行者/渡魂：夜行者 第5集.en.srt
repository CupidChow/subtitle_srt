1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,230
My name is Mo, a night taxi driver.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,860
[We've arrived at the reservation location.]

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,000
Please check the end number 3408. Passengers from 3409, get in.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,860
Hello?

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,060
Hello? Hello?

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,100
Is this your car?

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,800
It's here.

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,730
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,500
Get him!

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,360
I have a mission to pick up.

11
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,520
I am the person you want to pick up.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,000
Please check the number of passengers.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Passengers with the last number 3408, get in.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,530
Hurry up!

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,129
Follow the front team.

16
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,060
Okay, leave it to me.

17
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,160
I'll get the bride back for you.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,060
The brake doesn't work.

19
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,860
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

20
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,660
Honey, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,430
It was all my fault.

22
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,100
30 minutes until the life door closes. Please send the passenger to the life door immediately.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,330
Please give me one more chance. I want to be your husband in my next life.

24
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,430
Make up your mind. The life door is closing.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,259
In my next life,

26
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,760
in my next life.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,330
If the life door is closed,

28
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,190
you won't be able to reincarnate.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,730
You have half an hour left. You decide by yourselves.

30
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,590
The marriage certificate is still burning.

31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,930
it means we're still destined to be together.

32
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,930
We're destined to be husband and wife in our next life.

33
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,630
Sir, stop the car.

34
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,360
Zhou Jie.

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,630
Do you know why I have to divorce you?

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,829
What time is it?

37
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:52,860
Do you know what day it is today?

38
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,560
Do you still love me?

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,060
I said I'm working overtime. I can't go.

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm sick.

41
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,830
You said you were busy? Yes.

42
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,960
My parents were hospitalized.

43
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
You said you couldn't leave.

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,060
When I need you,

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
when I need you.

46
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,130
Honey.

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,700
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,900
I want to create a better life for us.

49
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,430
But what I want is you.

50
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,460
not those promises that you can never fulfill.

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,630
I didn't expect that all my efforts

52
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,730
in exchange for your misunderstanding.

53
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,130
In the next life,

54
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,900
we will never meet again.

55
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,400
In the next life

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,600
I don't want to see you again.

57
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,160
10 minutes until the life door closes. Please go to the Life Gate immediately.

58
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,700
I want to see blue tears by the beach of Iceland.

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,930
I heard that two people who see blue tears

60
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,400
will never be apart.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,260
I promise you.

62
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,959
Get the bonus.

63
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,029
we can take her to the Iceland to see blue tears.

64
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,600
This is the ticket to Iceland.

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,330
You always remember my wish.

66
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,730
I hope you can forgive me.

67
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,400
Blue tears.

68
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,500
How about we try it again in our next life?

69
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,860
We've reached the destination. Life is long. Don't look back.

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,760
Sir, please burn the marriage certificate to us.

71
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,860
We can continue our relationship in our next life.

72
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,760
Don't worry.

73
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,000
Love can overcome life and death.

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,300
Your next mission is to go to the slaughterhouse.

75
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,160
Five-star review, 5 days of life balance.
