1
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,200
It's your turn

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
I'll use Yin De to extend your life.

3
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,730
Sir.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,560
Get him! Get him!

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,330
you can take the dead

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,730
[It's a good choice.] [It's a good choice.]

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,600
You decide

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,600
You'll have to

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:39,660
Okay.

10
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,720
Let's go! Let's go!

11
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,560
I'll answer it.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,060
What the hell is this place?

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,730
[Passenger's reservation has arrived.]

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,260
[Please check the remaining number of 2079.]

15
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,630
Who is it?

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,900
Are you looking for me?

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,030
Look at me. I'm pretty.

18
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,930
Beautiful. Beautiful.

19
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,229
Please take a good look.

20
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,430
[Passenger number 2079 has arrived.] Please go to the Life Gate immediately.

21
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,160
Don't be afraid. Shenny is the fox spirit who protects this ancestral hall.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,260
Young man, can you do me a favor?

23
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,930
What is it?

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,430
I have a daughter who works in the city alone.

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,200
I wonder how she's doing recently.

26
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,030
Every time I think of her,

27
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,230
my heart

28
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,900
feel so painful.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,530
I can't let it go.

30
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,930
I really can't.

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,300
Hey.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,530
You want to quit?

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,860
Did I tell you to leave?

34
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,329
I'm sorry, sir.

35
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:31,400
It's too late.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,130
I need to go through a dark alley.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,160
I don't care where you are now.

38
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,290
come back to keep the client company.

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,329
Mom, I miss you so much.

40
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,860
Mom.

41
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,130
I wish you were with me.

42
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,760
It's almost midnight. What is your wish?
