1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,300
It's here

2
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,260
Fang Hui, this is...

3
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,500
It's...

4
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,730
Am I dead?

5
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,930
You've been in a coma for three months.

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,900
You should leave now.

7
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,830
I've already delivered your soul.

8
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,500
Why did you die?

9
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,930
Young man, you should ask yourself first.

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,630
Do you really want to live?

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,930
Let's go. Our company doesn't keep trash.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,730
The debtor is here again.

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,500
I think we should move out.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,830
I'll find a way.

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,960
You want to win money in a race with your stupid car?

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,330
You'd better go on a field trip.

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,860
I'll kill you if you don't pay me back next time.

18
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,530
I don't think death will be worse than this.

19
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,100
Hang in there.

20
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,300
Wake up! Wake up!

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,960
I committed suicide.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,530
People who commit suicide

23
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,229
their souls can only float between heaven and earth.

24
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,060
That's why

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:05,260
I asked you to be a ferryman who escorts souls.

26
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,930
They all have unfulfilled wishes.

27
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,530
Young man,

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can you do me a favor

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,300
can you do me a favor?

30
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,200
What is it?

31
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,930
Just tell me.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,730
I heard that two people who see blue tears

33
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,230
will never be apart.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,730
Please forgive me.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,730
Mom.

36
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,230
I promise you.

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,260
I will live a bright life like fireworks.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,860
I will help you.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,160
Can became a firefighter.

40
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
I have no regrets.

41
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,000
Can.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm proud of you.

43
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,200
You promised me

44
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,660
in the starry sky.

45
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,030
I used the fireflies

46
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,030
to say goodbye.

47
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,600
Thank you, young man.

48
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,130
for letting me go.

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
for helping me fulfill my dream.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,230
Dreams are important.

52
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,130
But what's more precious

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,430
is someone who loves you.

54
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:45,960
Be good. Be good.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,900
Stop it.

56
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,329
Let's stay with Dad a little longer.

57
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,660
I've made up my mind.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,600
I want to live.

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,860
[I'm going to live.]

60
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,530
Okay.

61
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,560
Do me one last favor.

62
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,630
After my wife passed away,

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,460
I chose to commit suicide.

64
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,830
But I ended up lying in a hospital bed like you.

65
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,830
I became a burden to my children.

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,000
Now that I found you to take over my job,

67
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,630
I should leave in peace.

68
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,660
Thank you.

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,160
for sending me off.

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,159
Sir, the bridge ahead is broken.

71
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,190
Why is it gone again?

72
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,030
You again?

73
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,630
Come on. Come on.

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,200
Live well.

75
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,230
See you.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
Take care.

77
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,060
In the end, the old man fulfilled his mission

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,900
[and went to the other side of the fog.]

79
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,500
[The ferryman returned to his life.]

80
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,300
You're finally awake.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,760
I thought you were dead.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,930
Don't be afraid. It's just a dream.

83
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,530
The balance is three days left.
