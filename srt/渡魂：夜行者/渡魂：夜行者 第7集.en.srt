1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,760
It's here.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
So many people have passed away.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,660
have arrived at the reservation. Please pick up the number 5807.

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,330
Gosh.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,930
Wake up! Wake up!

6
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,160
Wake up! Wake up!

7
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,900
He's here. He's here.

8
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,930
God of Car.

10
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:34,160
Get in the car. I'm the one you need to pick up.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,630
Surpass him, God of Car!

12
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,200
We won!

13
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,460
When I was 17,

14
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,930
I saw the car god running on the arena with my own eyes.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,860
The moment he stood on the winning stage,

16
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,360
he also lit the unbreakable dream of racing.

17
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,760
It's worth it to receive an idol.

18
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,260
Before the championship,

19
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,329
the doctor found out that I was terminally ill.

20
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,500
But I told myself I shouldn't have died in the hospital.

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,930
The destination of a racer is the track.

22
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,790
Idol, what do you think?

23
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,660
I learned how to drift from you.

24
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,630
I didn't run on the track. I'm not a real racer.

25
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
God of racing.

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,829
Can you do me a favor?

27
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,660
Don't be nervous. I'll show you the way.

28
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,960
Thank you.

29
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,060
The rain is too heavy. I can't see clearly.

30
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,360
Turn left at 50 meters, level 9.

31
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,530
Drive left.

32
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh.

33
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,060
Full throttle passed. Delay the brake at the next corner.

34
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,230
Okay.

35
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,460
Don't think too much.

36
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,990
The biggest opponent of a person is yourself.

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,400
The highest level of a racer is the combination of human cars.

38
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm at the end

39
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,160
This is awesome.

40
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:38,990
30 minutes until the life door closes. Please send the passenger to the life door immediately.

41
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,300
Thank you for helping me fulfill my dream.

42
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,330
A dream is important, but it's more precious than a dream.

43
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,030
is the person who loves you.

44
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,600
[We've reached the destination.]

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
Take care.

46
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,660
[It's a stone.] [It's a stone.] [It's a stone.] [It's a stone.]

47
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,130
The stone bridge

48
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,660
It may collapse at any time.

49
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,830
Sit tight.

50
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,230
Whether you can leave or not depends on your fate.

51
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,060
Did you have a nightmare again?

52
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,659
I received a passenger order. Please go to #705 Sunshine Community to pick up the passengers.

53
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,960
Isn't this my house?
