1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,460
I have a daughter

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,800
She works alone in the city.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,730
I wonder how she's doing recently.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,430
Every time I think of her,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,330
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,730
Put it down.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,330
I really can't.

8
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,860
It's almost midnight. What is your wish?

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,460
My last wish is to watch fireworks with my daughter.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
to fulfill her childhood wish.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,460
Mom, can you take me to the city to see the fireworks?

12
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,800
Of course.

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,630
I'll keep my promise.

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Mom, where are you? I want you to be with me.

15
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,030
Young man, please do me a favor.

16
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,300
What is it? Tell me.

17
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,600
Mom.

18
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,800
What is a big city like?

19
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,630
When Wei Wei grows up, she will leave here.

20
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,500
and live in a big city.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,199
Where was my mom then?

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,360
I'll always stand behind you.

23
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,560
[and cheer for you.]

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,420
Look at the fireworks.

25
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,130
[Xiao Wei, where are you?] I'm here.

26
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,400
No matter where I am,

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,300
[you must live like a fireworks.]

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,700
Mom.

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,200
I promise you.

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I will live a bright life like fireworks.

31
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,560
Thank you, young man. and end my last concern.

32
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,000
[We've reached the destination. Life is long. Don't look back.]

33
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,160
The Reincarnation Gate is open. The living must stay away.

34
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,100
Idiot! Turn around!

35
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,900
Pour it into the life door.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,730
Alas.

37
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,630
The heart of a parent

38
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,160
In fact, death is not scary.

39
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,460
I'm afraid that I can't let go of my children after I die.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,030
Your next mission

41
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,160
is a funeral house in the countryside.

42
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,430
I had a dream again.

43
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,930
Three days. Okay.
