1
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,730
Request backup!

2
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,630
The fire is too strong. Request backup.

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,500
Don't move. Get down.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,430
Get down!

5
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,830
Help!

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,230
There's someone inside!

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,630
Get them out!

8
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,300
Is the end number 4681 here?

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,500
It's me.

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,830
There you are.

11
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,100
Come with me.

12
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,960
Who are you?

13
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,430
Where are those trapped people?

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,030
They're all dead.

15
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,229
No way! I could have saved them!

16
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,259
Actually...

17
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,120
You're dead too. You're dead too.

18
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,400
I'm dead!

19
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,400
Captain, watch out!

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,400
It’s almost midnight. Come with me.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,030
There you are.

22
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,560
Can.

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,360
[Passenger number 4681] Please go to the Life Gate now.

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,960
Your daughter?

25
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,160
Chan Chan is eight years old. Today is her birthday.

26
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,730
We agreed to celebrate her birthday at home tonight.

27
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,800
But now...

28
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,360
Dad.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,329
Come home early today.

30
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:27,760
Don't forget your birthday present.

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay, I promise.

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,460
I'll go home to celebrate your birthday after work.

33
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,560
I didn't expect

34
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,460
The flame swallows everything faster than we expected.

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,660
I tried my best to save them.

36
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,060
But in the end,

37
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,160
My daughter must be waiting for me at home.

38
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,430
I'll cry if I can't wait.

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,900
Where do you live?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,330
I'll help you with this.

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,830
You have deviated from the designated route.

42
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,460
There's a fire. Stop the car.

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
Hey, wait.

44
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,160
You're dead. You're dead.

45
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,630
Please!

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,930
My daughter is still inside. Please save her.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,600
Don't worry. We'll save her.

48
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,890
Hey, don't get any closer to the fire.

49
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
Or your soul will disappear.

50
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,100
My daughter is still inside.

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Please!

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,230
Please save her.

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,700
Someone's coming out!

54
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,200
It's me. It's me.

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,030
When I was young,

56
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,030
my dad always asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up.

57
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,230
Today,

58
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,860
I want to be like him.

59
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,560
like him.

60
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,300
No matter when or where,

61
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,260
as long as there is a fire,

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,330
I'll be the first to rush in and protect everyone.

63
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,560
Dad, come home early today.

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,860
Don't forget your birthday present.

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,330
Okay, I promise.

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,430
I'll go home and celebrate your birthday after work.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,500
Dad.

68
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,960
Can.

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,400
I'm proud of you.

70
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,400
Chan became a firefighter. I have no regrets.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,260
You're a good father.

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,300
How dare you! Close the life door!

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,360
Leave now!

74
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,500
Three days left.
