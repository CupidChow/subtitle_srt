1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:13,972
Bunty,

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:15,849
touch me.

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,351
Touch me.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,020
Again?

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,357
Guess what I’m thinking!

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,278
We’re out of toilet paper.

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,449
I can buy some,
but couldn’t you just say that?

8
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,367
My back! Touch my back!

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,620
Yo, can you hear me

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,873
Hear my vibe? Friend’s teaching

11
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,792
Heart’s awakening
Did you catch the vibe?

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,252
What vibe are you going for?

13
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,297
What about here?

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,256
Just your fingertip.

15
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,215
It’s the same.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,509
-Just a little.
-Even a little, I can hear it.

17
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,932
Then, if we kiss, can you hear me?

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,607
You heard it.

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,650
No.

20
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,944
-I can’t hear anything.
-Liar.

21
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,321
I didn’t hear it.

22
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,448
Why not? Come on.

23
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,701
I’m not doing it.

24
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,078
Why not?

25
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,204
Not in a place like this.

26
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,538
But it’s your house.

27
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,624
Everyone’s about to come.

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,125
They’re not here yet.

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,963
No!

30
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,133
Don’t be stingy. C’mon.

31
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,869
That’s for playing hard to get!

32
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,455
Don’t toy with a man’s pure heart!

33
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,666
You’re the one who rejected my pure heart.

34
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,421
-I didn’t reject it.
-You didn’t?

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,216
I didn’t.

36
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,108
‎Um… This isn't what…

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,152
Welcome!

38
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,243
‎TAKKOBI

39
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,452
-Yeah!
-Yup!

40
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,373
Formerly the Microwaving Esper.

41
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,418
Now the Electromagnetic Esper! Enjaku!

42
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,590
-That's quick. Already 39 degrees Celsius.
-Wow!

43
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,966
She's stronger with the remote.

44
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,968
-And from that distance! Wow!
-Yeah!

45
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,846
When you stroke it, flowers bloom.

46
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,724
Flower blooming Esper, Ohsuke!

47
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,270
Thank you!

48
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,897
Only can bloom flowers!

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,025
-I'm Hanzo, the animal pleading Esper.
-Yeah!

50
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,069
Please.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,112
Here it comes!

52
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,489
-Here they come!
-Wait!

53
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,283
Here they come!

54
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:24,871
-They landed!
-Wow!

55
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,040
Amazing!

56
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,917
-That's what you call team work!
-Yeah!

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,379
Read by touch!
The Esper that can read hearts!

58
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,297
Bunta!

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,840
-Yeah!
-The touchy type!

60
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
Don't say that!

61
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,635
-Right?
-Stop it!

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,803
Now…

63
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,681
our star of the day! Shiki!

64
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,018
-We were waiting for you!
-Yeah!

65
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,523
I’m the Blow-Away Esper, Shiki.

66
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,733
-Oh!
-Yeah!

67
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,443
Great!

68
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,613
When Bunty told me
that he and everyone else

69
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,116
were secretly saving the world
with their powers,

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,117
I was shocked.

71
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,452
-Well, kinda.
-Yeah.

72
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,247
Of course, I know it's a secret.
I won't tell anyone.

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,584
All I can do is blow things away, but…

74
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,087
-Everyone is just a bit Esper.
-Yeah.

75
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,171
Yes.

76
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,384
While Bunty was away

77
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,511
on a business trip,

78
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,930
I don’t remember much, but…

79
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,017
Mrs. Enjaku was here…

80
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,399
Ohsuke, Hanzo, and Sasuke

81
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:39,112
also came to cheer me up.
I’m really grateful.

82
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:44,158
So, if my blow-away Esper power

83
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,995
can help everyone,
I’ll be happy to use them for the team.

84
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,124
-Come on. You’ve helped us plenty, right?
-Yeah.

85
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,167
-Yeah.
-We wouldn’t even be here.

86
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,086
You were a total jerk back then.

87
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,045
Like you can talk.

88
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,423
-Huh?
-Don't point at people.

89
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,966
-Yes.
-But Mrs. Enjaku…

90
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,052
-But…
-It’s hot, huh?

91
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,304
I’ll cool us down.

92
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,436
-So refreshing!
-Yeah.

93
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,479
-So cool!
-Yeah.

94
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,565
Didn’t know it could be used like this.

95
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,319
From now on,
I’ll take better care of my breath.

96
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,697
Garlic could be a weapon!

97
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,533
-True.
-The Smelly Esper is born!

98
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,535
-Huh?
-Don't say that to Shiki!

99
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,911
Okay, here we go!

100
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,372
-Everyone, strike a pose.
-Hurry!

101
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,291
-What should we do?
-Three, two, one!

102
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,460
-Bit Five!
-Five?

103
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,963
Bit Five?

104
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,048
A little bit of five.

105
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,216
I might’ve blinked.

106
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,468
It's okay. It’s in burst mode.

107
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,428
-Wait.
-I'll bring the cake.

108
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,805
-Oh, yeah.
-I don't know.

109
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,182
‎What does "Bit Five" mean?

110
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,100
‎Hey Sasuke. Okay…

111
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,479
Everyone, do you have a minute?

112
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,522
‎Okay. Got it?

113
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:00,109
Should we tell the boss about Shiki?

114
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,487
We can’t really keep it a secret.

115
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,697
We’ve already told her
about our Esper powers too.

116
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,825
She’s practically family. Don’t worry.

117
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,410
That blow-away type is strong.

118
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,120
Maybe the boss will be glad.

119
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,080
-Yeah, right?
-Yes.

120
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,290
So, when should we tell him?

121
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,875
When he’s in a good mood.

122
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,834
That’s crucial.

123
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,338
Timing it right with your boss’s mood
makes all the difference.

124
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,344
Message from the boss.

125
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,846
Emergency meeting order?

126
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,223
What a pain.

127
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,141
First time he’s called everyone.

128
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,185
Should we bring up Shiki
while we’re at it?

129
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,353
-Good idea.
-But…

130
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,939
His mood. Let's gauge his mood first.

131
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,108
Is he ever in a good mood?

132
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,692
He’s hard to read.

133
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,693
I can tell.

134
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,030
When he’s in a bad mood,
he gets wrinkles between his brows!

135
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,784
Wrinkles between his brows?

136
00:06:56,165 --> 00:07:01,462
Has anyone
noticed anything strange lately?

137
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,095
I’m the Blow-Away Esper, Shiki.

138
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,888
-Bit Five!
-Can we fit?

139
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,808
Please give me psychic powers too!

140
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,810
You can control animals, right?

141
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,271
Mind if I touch your arm?

142
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,565
That flower’s name is…

143
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,858
Shion.

144
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,032
I love you.

145
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,081
Nothing at all.

146
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,168
Nothing to report.

147
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,259
Very well, then.

148
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,722
I called you here
to discuss a special mission.

149
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,393
You’ll be transporting a certain package.

150
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,271
I can’t tell you what’s inside yet.

151
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,773
But this mission…

152
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,944
involves human lives.

153
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,159
Until the day comes,
suspend all other missions.

154
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,119
Please prepare yourselves.

155
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,829
That’s all for today.

156
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

157
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,755
Bunta.

158
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,799
Please stay behind for a moment.

159
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,512
-Just me?
-Yes.

160
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,490
Is it about Shiki?

161
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,076
If he finds out, we’ll just apologize.

162
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,746
Shiki is the daughter of the person
who helped the boss, right?

163
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,249
If he finds out we made her an Esper,
will he be angry?

164
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,751
Yeah, that could happen.

165
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,711
What’s the boss’s Esper power?

166
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,004
Huh?

167
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,173
He must have something.

168
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:12,385
-Now that you mention it…
-We’ve never heard of it, right?

169
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,514
Maybe he’s a mind-reading type,
stronger than Bunta.

170
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,601
He can probably sense things
without touching.

171
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,775
About the current issue…

172
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,278
The unidentified factor
we discussed before.

173
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,530
You said you don’t know anything about it?

174
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,865
That’s correct.

175
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,577
As expected.

176
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,664
The unexpected junction occurred in July.

177
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,752
The problem occurred
before you even joined.

178
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,130
Meaning you had nothing to do with it.

179
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,257
Yeah.

180
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,176
Please keep this matter
strictly confidential.

181
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,304
Yes.

182
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,142
What exactly is this "junction"?

183
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,227
A divide in the world.

184
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,146
A branching point…

185
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:07,982
you could say.

186
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,915
Decision Tree.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,085
A vast dataset representing the world.

188
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:33,466
Events in one place connect to others,

189
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,426
intertwining and branching out.

190
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,387
From the past, through the present,

191
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,848
and shaping the future.

192
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,351
This Decision Tree

193
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,146
represents our world itself.

194
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,232
I…

195
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,653
want to change the world.

196
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,823
I want to change the future

197
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,951
beyond the year 2025.

198
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,914
That’s what our missions are for.

199
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,006
Haven’t you ever wondered why

200
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,884
all the missions seem so meaningless?

201
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:20,262
And why do they always happen
close to your own neighborhoods?

202
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,680
Yes.

203
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,225
It’s to minimize the range of impact.

204
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,062
We accumulate small, indirect changes,

205
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,897
creating new junctions.

206
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,025
From those new junctions,

207
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,486
new futures are born.

208
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,868
But the unidentified factors
are interfering with it.

209
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,829
They…

210
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,248
They…?

211
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,459
-Are they humans?
-Yes.

212
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,920
A hero's enemy.

213
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,256
They are Villains.

214
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,465
Villains?

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,592
Because of them,
we’ve fallen behind schedule.

216
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,387
Small changes won’t be enough.

217
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,848
We need a major shift.

218
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,225
One that pushes everything
forward at once.

219
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,436
Um, Boss…

220
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,690
What kind of future do you want to create?

221
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,116
How was it?

222
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,033
Did he find out?

223
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,452
Did he read your mind?

224
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:25,828
Nothing happened.

225
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,873
Well…

226
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,709
He just said there’s still footage
of that commotion

227
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,377
from the festival online,

228
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,296
so we should avoid that area.

229
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,882
-What?
-Huh?

230
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,968
-You worried me!
-Right?

231
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,136
‎-Come on…
‎-Yeah…

232
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,848
Ten years from now,

233
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,601
10,000 people will die.

234
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,895
A major catastrophe will occur.

235
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,024
I want to stop it.

236
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,028
Ten thousand people will die?

237
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,779
Yes.

238
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,241
That’s… more than a little.

239
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,618
Much more than a little.

240
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:09,705
But we’re only "just a bit" Espers…

241
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:12,124
I never said our missions
were "just a bit".

242
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,587
The lives of 10,000 people in the future

243
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,049
rest on your shoulders.

244
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,427
Save those…

245
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,846
10,000 lives.

246
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,850
Little Bit Five.

247
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,768
Five!

248
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,062
Bit Five!

249
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,189
Just a bit… Oh!

250
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:40,402
Just a little bit, right?

251
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,096
Turning it off.

252
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:09,974
Yeah.

253
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:23,320
Today, something unbelievable happened.

254
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,448
Something not so good?

255
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,327
What I thought was just a local event

256
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,499
turned out to be
a massive global project.

257
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:44,758
I’ve never handled a job this big before.

258
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,473
Everyone’s a beginner the first time.

259
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:55,019
It's okay. You’ll succeed.

260
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,648
Positive thinking.

261
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,692
That’s who we are. Always positive.

262
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,781
If I weigh as much as a pickling stone,

263
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,742
then I’m an exabyte.

264
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,161
Exabyte?

265
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,121
Yeah.

266
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:18,626
Megabyte, gigabyte, terabyte, petabyte…

267
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,545
Then comes exabyte.

268
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,839
It means really heavy.

269
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,594
So, you're that heavy of a guy?

270
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,180
Heavy, yeah.

271
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,682
Someday,

272
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,434
you might even get tired of me.

273
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,939
If we’re both heavy,

274
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,775
we don’t need to worry about being hated.

275
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,277
From now on, we can be sure

276
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,863
that we’ll always be there for each other.

277
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,408
We can both live positively.

278
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,081
That’s what we said…?

279
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,668
Didn’t we?

280
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,711
We made that promise, right?

281
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,890
Even if the big project fails
and you lose your job,

282
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,226
I’ll take care of you.

283
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,774
So, don’t worry and sleep well.

284
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:26,986
‎Okay.

285
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,862
‎Good night.

286
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,348
You're in the way.

287
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,727
You know about Shiki’s ex-husband?

288
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,979
Don't know.

289
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,690
Is he older? Younger?
What kind of guy was he?

290
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,774
I said I don’t know!

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,651
What’s your problem?

292
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:14,033
Shiki really
loves her husband with all her heart.

293
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,993
Me.

294
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,911
Is this you bragging?

295
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,291
I’m pretending to be her dead husband.

296
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,461
Is it really okay for me
to keep accepting her love?

297
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,715
You’re saying dumb stuff again.

298
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,426
If she never finds out, it’s fine!

299
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,346
Ohsuke. Stop with that criminal mindset.

300
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,225
Shiki’s happier when you’re around.
That’s enough.

301
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,937
Keep lying to her.

302
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,148
Keep hiding it desperately.

303
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,068
You don’t understand.

304
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,780
Morning.

305
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,697
Morning.

306
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,032
Have a good day.

307
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,162
Hey!

308
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,498
-Does he know you're his dad?
-Dummy.

309
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,666
Like I’d tell him.

310
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,127
I’m just the florist guy.

311
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,671
A random musclehead.

312
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,425
I’ll hide it with everything I’ve got.

313
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,929
I’ll stay the florist guy till I die.

314
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,515
I’ll keep fooling him.

315
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,104
So, you better hang in there too.

316
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,320
-Great work. Thanks.
-Thanks.

317
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,947
Yes.

318
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,281
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

319
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,743
SKEWERED MOCHI

320
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,829
It arrived. Thank you.

321
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,708
What are you worried about?

322
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,419
Exactly.

323
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,967
Bunty bought me
a bee necklace for my birthday.

324
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:56,677
Bunty?

325
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,928
Yeah.

326
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,889
Who are you talking about?

327
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,611
I got another remote.

328
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,238
For the TV?

329
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,365
Any remote works, really.

330
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,242
I don’t even need to press the buttons,

331
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,244
but pressing helps me focus my energy,

332
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,329
so my Esper powers reach farther.

333
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,710
Looks nice.

334
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,842
You know, today,
when I told my dad about Bunty,

335
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,219
he asked, "Who’s that?"

336
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,307
A customer came by,
so I said bye and hung up,

337
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,934
but it felt weird.

338
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,649
When Bunta was away on his business trip,

339
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,819
your dad probably got mad
that you were left alone,

340
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,405
which gave him a bad impression of Bunta.

341
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,826
Then maybe I should explain.
It’s not Bunty's fault.

342
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,037
His work changed.

343
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,339
Wait. Was that trip for his handyman job?

344
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,467
Or the previous company?

345
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,349
Maybe it’s best not to tell your dad.

346
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,187
Let’s not. I don’t think
Bunta would want that either.

347
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,148
You’re happy now, right?

348
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,109
With Bunta and us together?

349
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,654
Your dad lives far away anyway.

350
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,573
You’ve got your own life now, Shiki.

351
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,285
That's right.

352
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,166
How is it recently?

353
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,294
Have you been having that dream lately?

354
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,007
Now that you mention it, no.

355
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,973
It's a strange dream, isn't it?

356
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,475
Bunty's alive and healthy, after all.

357
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,562
Yeah… Let’s just forget it.

358
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,278
When we tell the boss about your powers,

359
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,616
will he tell your dad, too?

360
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,910
Why my dad?

361
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:31,039
Isn’t the boss the president of Nonamare?

362
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,541
Yeah, but…

363
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,217
Oh, it's okay. I was mistaken.

364
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,844
Here. It’s hot.

365
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,388
Let's eat.

366
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,935
Sweet and salty. Delicious.

367
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,645
Glad you like it.

368
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:57,065
It sticks to your teeth, doesn't it?

369
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,567
Want some daikon radish?

370
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,569
Let's eat.

371
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:14,207
I thought…
you and Shiki’s father were friends.

372
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:19,796
That's why I was asked to look after her.
Was I mistaken?

373
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,799
Due to certain circumstances,

374
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:27,345
someone else asked me
to keep an eye on her.

375
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,556
It wasn’t her father.

376
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,101
I see.

377
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,938
My apologies for the misunderstanding.

378
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,233
If caring for Shiki is too burdensome,

379
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,860
I can assign someone else.

380
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,155
Oh, not at all! Shiki’s so sweet.

381
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,366
She actually takes care of me
most of the time.

382
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,079
I’m…

383
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,499
grateful to you, Boss.

384
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,794
For giving me a third life.

385
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,382
Back then…

386
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,388
Nice to meet you.

387
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,974
I’m Kizashi from Nonamare.

388
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,020
From the support facility?

389
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:21,358
-I don’t need help.
-No,

390
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,651
I’m a recruiter.

391
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,320
Would you like to work for us?

392
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,753
You used to be an excellent secretary.

393
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,923
But you embezzled company funds.
Convicted of fraud

394
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,136
and forgery of official documents,
you got ten years in prison.

395
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,305
Are you…

396
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,351
Yuuki’s subordinate?

397
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,479
You’ve got…

398
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,359
You've got some nerve showing your face!

399
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,946
Why should I be the one turning myself in?

400
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,699
Because you’re the one who did it.

401
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,451
Only because you told me to.

402
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,080
The condo, the jewelry, the designer bags.

403
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,374
You lived the high life, didn’t you?

404
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,751
Those were gifts from you!

405
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,712
You said you couldn’t leave your wife,

406
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,798
and that they were
to make up for the loneliness.

407
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,009
I know!

408
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,433
When you get out,
we’ll finally be happy together.

409
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,684
Get out of here!

410
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,395
Don't ever come back!

411
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,522
I’m sorry.

412
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,941
I have no ties to Yuuki.

413
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,487
But…

414
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,740
I know what happened.

415
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,289
You took all the blame
and served the time.

416
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,293
He never visited you once.

417
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,346
I was such a fool.

418
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,182
That’s why…

419
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,477
I'm spending my second life here.

420
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,732
All that’s left is to die.

421
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:27,817
Leave me alone.

422
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,653
Would you like to begin…

423
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,530
your third life?

424
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:38,954
There’s

425
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,164
a capsule inside.

426
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,375
Drink it,

427
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,794
and your life will change.

428
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:50,131
Your future begins here.

429
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,599
Nicely done!

430
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,978
Will I get scolded? I’ll pick it up later.

431
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,650
You know…

432
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,193
Yeah.

433
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,070
There was a man I wanted to kill.

434
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,954
I met him when I was 25,

435
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,583
and until I was 60… For 35 years…

436
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,840
For 35 years, I was devoted to him.

437
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,263
He deceived me, abandoned me,

438
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,685
and made me taste humiliation
down to my very bones.

439
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,607
In my jail cell, all I thought about was…

440
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,112
how to kill him.

441
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,949
That’s all I could think of!

442
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,372
I’ll kill him!

443
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,791
Once I get out of here!

444
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,169
Mrs. Enjaku.

445
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,549
And after I kill him, I’ll die too.

446
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,015
Then it wouldn’t be just 35 years.

447
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,519
I’d be giving my whole life to him.

448
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,069
It’s ridiculous.

449
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,863
It’s ridiculous.

450
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,662
We…

451
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,665
make a good team, don’t we?

452
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:56,341
I’m glad
you decided not to go through with it.

453
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,640
Let’s do our best on the special mission.

454
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,021
We’ve got a world to save!

455
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,357
Right.

456
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,867
Nice!

457
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,288
DAIBA MALL

458
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,127
The mission this time…

459
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,589
At the Daiba Mall in Odaiba,
a blue attaché case

460
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,758
will be handed over to an organization.

461
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,176
Please steal it.

462
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,681
Go to the nearest sea and sink it there.

463
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:48,059
Even if you steal it,
they won't call the police.

464
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,646
They can’t report it
to the authorities anyway.

465
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,984
Never take the case on public transport.

466
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,904
-Why not?
-Because you’re heroes.

467
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,157
That's how it'll be.

468
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,075
What organization is it?

469
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,452
Yakuza.

470
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,328
We're fighting against organized crime?

471
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,913
There are many kinds of organizations.

472
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,249
If it's an organization,
it has to be the Yakuza.

473
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,667
What’s inside that case?

474
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,295
He never tells us. He's so stingy.

475
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,464
Maybe he can’t tell us yet.

476
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,175
I asked before.

477
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:24,637
Why can’t we know
the mission details sooner?

478
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,017
Once you know,
change begins at that moment.

479
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,561
The earlier it starts,

480
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,731
the greater the risk of deviation.

481
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,526
So, we keep things untouched
until the last possible moment.

482
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,615
It’s like Schrödinger’s cat.

483
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,034
I see…

484
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,452
What's that?

485
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,370
-I don’t really know either.
-Explain.

486
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,499
Let’s just pretend we get it and move on.

487
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,294
Why do you think
he want us to sink it in the sea?

488
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:59,255
The case has drugs! Saltwater ruins them!

489
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,008
So, that’s why
we can’t take public transport?

490
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,010
If we get caught holding it,
we’ll get arrested!

491
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,595
It's definitely organized crime!

492
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,473
Stop jumping to the worst conclusions!

493
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,226
-Should I make some flowers bloom?
-Not now!

494
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,939
Bit…

495
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:20,068
Bit Five minus one!

496
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,736
DAIBA MALL

497
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
-It came!
-It came!

498
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,257
SP MISSION

499
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,133
SP. Special mission.

500
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,344
It feels special!

501
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,387
SPECIAL MISSION

502
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,472
STEAL THE BLUE ATTACHÉ CASE AND STOP
THE VIRUS ATTACK. TIME LIMIT - 20 MINUTES

503
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,058
Stop the virus attack?

504
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,437
You mean there’s a deadly virus in there?

505
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,022
What are you doing?!

506
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,401
-A 20-minute limit!
-If time runs out, the case goes boom!

507
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,866
He's leaving the case.

508
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,002
They're the perpetrators.

509
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,879
Before they spread the virus…

510
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,547
We grab the case…

511
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,007
And sink it in the sea.

512
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,302
Stick to the plan. Okay?

513
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,561
Hot water, anyone?

514
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,106
This one’s 39 degrees Celsius,
and this one’s 36 degrees Celsius.

515
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:44,527
They're barely different,
but which do you--

516
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,990
See you!

517
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,533
-Wait!
-Wait!

518
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,451
First?

519
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,410
Grab it by force.

520
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,412
Then they’ll chase us, right?

521
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,080
If we get caught, we’ll beat them up.

522
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,665
We'll get reported to the cops.

523
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,627
You think we can outrun them to the sea?

524
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,961
If I had serious stamina…

525
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,004
I don't…

526
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,255
You don't?

527
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,634
Then, let’s do it as a three-person relay.

528
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,430
‎Alright!

529
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,768
Wait!

530
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,775
Can we use a taxi?

531
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,319
The boss said not to take
the case on public transport.

532
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,946
But people can ride, right?

533
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,156
We’ll all meet here…

534
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,325
in the end.

535
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,559
He's late.

536
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,650
Hanzo!

537
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,237
-You okay? What happened?
-Go!

538
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,864
Leave the rest to me!

539
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,578
Alright.

540
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,085
‎Jeez…

541
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,342
‎I can't stop crying!

542
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,346
Don’t cry!

543
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,814
-That guy is crying!
-Bunty?

544
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,359
-Yeah!
-You're right!

545
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
What is this?

546
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,780
Am I going to die?

547
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,289
Bunta? What's wrong?

548
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,666
-What's wrong?
-Hey.

549
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,836
Oh, later!

550
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,890
Bunta!

551
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,768
Over here!

552
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,066
No problem!

553
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:36,532
Alright.

554
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:41,913
This won't sink.

555
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,457
If…

556
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,919
Hello.

557
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,130
What are you doing here?

558
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,009
Give me that case.

559
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,679
Quickly give it to me.

560
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,517
Thank you.

561
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,606
Who is Ohsuke talking to?

562
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,774
A student uniform?

563
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,070
I thought you saved me

564
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,823
in that explosion
during the summer festival.

565
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,700
I’m disappointed that it was all staged.

566
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,455
Hurry up and give me the case.

567
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,834
-It’s dangerous.
-What is?

568
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,043
There’s a killer virus.

569
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,421
-So--
-The dangerous ones are you villains!

570
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,719
Yeah! I got it!

571
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,642
It's you!

572
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,061
‎Why? Hey!

573
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,272
-Let go! Give it to me!
-Hurry!

574
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,523
-Give it to me!
-Shion!

575
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,656
-I'm moving.
-Wait!

576
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,658
Move, old man!

577
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,078
Dammit!

578
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,295
Another one.

579
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,012
-No use. It's not moving.
-Hey!

580
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,430
Let's escape!

581
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,848
Shion!

582
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,312
Over here!

583
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,439
Wait!

584
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:33,941
Huh?

585
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,484
-Oh no!
-Here?

586
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,862
-There’s no exit!
-Sorry!

587
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,989
"Sorry" doesn’t cut it! Huh?

588
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,453
You're Ichimatsu, right?

589
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,248
He’s not a takoyaki lover
or an Esper geek.

590
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,459
He’s our enemy.

591
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,586
A Villian.

592
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,214
Maybe…

593
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,466
an Esper himself.

594
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,346
Why do the bad guys always look cooler?

595
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,348
I was thinking that just a bit too.

596
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,934
The Young Three.

597
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,654
Hey, kid! Hand over that case!

598
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,991
They said it’s a killer virus.

599
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,826
-Killer virus?
-Killer virus?

600
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,911
Don’t play dumb!

601
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,830
You’re part of some secret group

602
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,874
planning a virus attack, right?

603
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,543
We won’t let you!

604
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,170
We’re not in any organization.

605
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,256
We’re trying to stop you.

606
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,799
You’re the evil ones.

607
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,717
We’re…

608
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,469
The ones saving the world!

609
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,553
Right?

610
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,097
-Yeah!
-Then, why

611
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,808
are you dumping the virus into the sea?

612
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,811
Why?

613
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,146
Why?

614
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,149
Contaminating the ocean…

615
00:37:58,776 --> 00:37:59,652
Bioterrorism?

616
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,824
Maybe it’s a virus
engineered to thrive in seawater?

617
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,619
Using genes from Vibrio vulnificus.

618
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,578
What’s that?

619
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,956
It causes extreme pain,
skin swelling, and tissue necrosis.

620
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,875
If it spreads through the blood,

621
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,961
it kills 80% of those infected.

622
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:17,837
Terrifying!

623
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,797
What are they saying?

624
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,549
I have no clue.

625
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,426
-Well…
-The time limit…

626
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,094
We’ve got three minutes.

627
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,389
Dangerous or not,

628
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,849
we throw it into the sea, now.

629
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,642
Yeah!

630
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,893
Let's do it!

631
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,020
I already asked

632
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,147
the sea roaches for help.

633
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,650
Ichimatsu, hold on. This…

634
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,694
If that's real, he'll…

635
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,945
Just don't open it.

636
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,405
I don't know…

637
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,491
‎Ah! Bugs!

638
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,286
Bugs!

639
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,123
What's wrong? You okay?

640
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,042
-You okay?
-Hey!

641
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,501
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

642
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,378
Hear something?

643
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,463
Nothing.

644
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,756
Kujo! Lower the frequency!

645
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,715
Give it to me!

646
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,718
Old people can’t hear the mosquito tone!

647
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,886
Who are you calling old?

648
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,512
You can read minds?

649
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,014
Dehydration attack!

650
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,060
So, it was you, you tear-jerking brat!

651
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,437
Be grateful I spared your lower half!

652
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,444
Got it!

653
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,905
I got it! Fall back!

654
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,949
Wait!

655
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,701
Wait!

656
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,038
Stop!

657
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,003
Shiki!

658
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,588
Are you okay?

659
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,423
Hand me the case!

660
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,018
Why are you trying to kill?

661
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,311
Let go!

662
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,748
Who are you?

663
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,507
I came to reset the junction.

664
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,227
They vanished?

665
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,900
What’s happening?

666
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,067
No idea…

667
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,159
Shiki! Watch out!

668
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,328
Shiki!

669
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,753
It’s empty.

670
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,382
There’s nothing inside.

671
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,428
What the hell?

672
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,057
What the hell is this…?

673
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,481
-Why are you trying to kill it?
-Let go!

674
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,275
Ten million people will die
because of you!

675
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,238
Save those…

676
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,907
10,000 people.

677
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,792
Ten million people will die
because of you!

678
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,379
Save those 10,000 people.

679
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,735
The unidentified factor verified.

680
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,082
Shiki…

681
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,918
Why?

682
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,654
‎Who is your boss?

683
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,405
‎He's being deceived.

684
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,615
‎Don't come near again!

685
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,741
‎You got it?

686
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,034
‎Is ten million people going to die

687
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,535
‎because of me?

688
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,039
‎Have I met Kizashi before?

689
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:27,956
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
