1
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,676
Three unidentified Espers
have been confirmed.

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,886
The first is…

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,805
a university student named Ichimatsu.

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,224
His Esper power is dehydration.

5
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,267
Dehydration attack!

6
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,687
He can force tears
and mucus out of others,

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,188
but it's not very useful.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,107
Be grateful I spared your lower half!

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,277
The second unidentified Esper,

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,072
a high schooler named Shion.
His Esper power is static electricity.

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,199
-The dangerous ones are you villains!
-With his youth, the output is immense

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,659
and highly versatile.

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,120
He's an Esper I'd like to recruit.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,582
The third unidentified Esper,

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,876
a woman known as Kujo.

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,587
Her car was a rental,
and her true identity remains unknown.

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,797
Her Esper power is sonic waves.

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,133
Troublesome, yes,

19
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:51,926
-but manageable.
-You okay?

20
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,887
As long as you shut it out.

21
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,265
They've been targeting

22
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,809
Nonamare for some time now.

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,438
Yet my subordinates

24
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,982
kept it from me.

25
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,318
Can I come again?

26
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,570
Please give me psychic powers too!

27
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,446
Let's keep this between us.

28
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,284
A most serious situation.

29
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,705
Ichimatsu will later

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:25,418
become Dr. Ichimatsu.
That can't be a coincidence.

31
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,632
And one more person.

32
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,760
A mysterious man dressed in white.

33
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,013
No photos exist of him.

34
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,390
He seemed older than me.

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,185
He had a stern, imposing attitude.

36
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,354
He wore all white, and…

37
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,689
His head was perfectly smooth.

38
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:50,318
He stood before me
and pointed at them, one by one.

39
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,700
He made them disappear
and then vanished himself.

40
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,664
Who is that Esper,
and where did he come from?

41
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,087
And there's another issue.

42
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,135
Shiki has taken the E-Capsule.

43
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,264
Shiki becoming an Esper
wasn't in the plan,

44
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,432
obviously.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,644
I need to check her condition myself.

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,480
That is why I decided to meet her.

47
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,815
Boss.

48
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,910
Nice to meet you. I'm Shiki.

49
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,748
I'm Kizashi. Pleased to meet you.

50
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
Boss said she's the daughter of a friend

51
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,463
and asked us to look after her.

52
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,050
Bunta, wait outside.

53
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,219
Yes, sir.

54
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,770
Shiki.

55
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,400
You accidentally consumed
the company's supply capsule.

56
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,985
That's fine.

57
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,154
It was Bunta's oversight.

58
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,740
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,909
If you refrain
from taking any more capsules,

60
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,411
the Esper state will eventually fade.

61
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,456
That's kind of a waste, isn't it?

62
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,585
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,003
Now that you're an Esper,

64
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,881
you must follow our rules.

65
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,052
No one outside must know your identity.

66
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,303
Understood.

67
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,222
That was the rule…

68
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,808
until everyone started breaking it.

69
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,562
Exposing their powers, not reporting,
and doing as they please!

70
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,780
Anyway, those are the rules.

71
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,907
Yes.

72
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,158
And one more.

73
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,826
Non Amare.

74
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,829
You must not fall in love.

75
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,586
So, that was your first time
meeting the boss?

76
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:19,092
-I thought you two knew each other.
-Nope.

77
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,551
It was my first time.

78
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,305
But…

79
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,558
Has Kizashi ever been on TV or something?

80
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,186
No idea.

81
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,231
I saw Shiki today.

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,818
We exchanged greetings.

83
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,071
I explained the rules to her.

84
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,368
Non Amare.

85
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,037
That's impossible.

86
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,498
I love my husband.

87
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,880
I love Bunty,
so that rule won't work for me.

88
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,594
What should I do?

89
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,057
I see.

90
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,103
I'll make an exception.

91
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,856
Thank you.

92
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,653
Why can't we love someone?

93
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,448
Even idols don't have that rule anymore.

94
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,994
Why is there a rule

95
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,995
to not love someone?

96
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,040
But these days, even idols…

97
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,468
Have I met you before?

98
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,727
No. This is our first time meeting.

99
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,229
Right…Of course.

100
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,368
Did he remind you of someone?

101
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,997
Just my imagination.

102
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,002
Mistaking him like that is ridiculous.
They don't even look alike.

103
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,588
That dream doesn't make sense anyway.

104
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,091
Dream?

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,761
Sorry.

106
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,764
No, it's fine. There's nothing to hide.

107
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:38,147
Remember the dream
I told you about where you died?

108
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,065
‎Yeah.

109
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,902
You didn't die. You were alive.

110
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,364
I see.

111
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,577
Either way, it's just a weird dream.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,458
Fortunately,

113
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,336
Shiki…

114
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,714
didn't remember me.

115
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,997
-Sorry for the wait!
-Oh!

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,081
-Hi!
-Hey!

117
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,583
-Hi!
-Hey!

118
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,334
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

119
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,672
Can't believe you got married, Shiki.

120
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,007
Right?

121
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,176
So, no more clingy,
high-maintenance Shiki?

122
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,093
Nope.

123
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,013
I got married, but still clingy.

124
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,934
We weren't invited to your wedding.

125
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,395
-Right?
-Nope.

126
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,774
It was just a photo wedding. You remember
the New Year's card I sent, right?

127
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,151
-Did you get one?
-No.

128
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,237
Wait. You all just didn't bother.

129
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,698
What does your husband do?

130
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,910
Bunty is a handyman.

131
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,745
-Bunty?
-A handyman?

132
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,039
He used to be in sales…

133
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,125
Well, when we met, he was…

134
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,960
DRY CLEANERS

135
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,386
So,

136
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,930
what did he say when he proposed?

137
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,223
-I want to hear it.
-Yeah.

138
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,432
It was simple.

139
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,434
On the night of the fireworks…

140
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,895
What did you just say?

141
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,150
Will you marry me?

142
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,118
Was it too soon?

143
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,749
-Shiki?
-Hey.

144
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,671
Oh, sorry. I've been weird lately.

145
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,339
-You've always been weird.
-Yeah.

146
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,217
I keep seeing someone

147
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,387
in my dreams or visions.

148
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,930
The same man shows up.

149
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,933
-A man, huh?
-Your type?

150
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,018
-A secret crush?
-No.

151
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,731
Like a cold, boring guy.

152
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,650
Once, Junji Takada appeared in my dream.

153
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,068
-That happens.
-Yeah?

154
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,778
-Right?
-There's no deep meaning, right?

155
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,363
-No, right?
-It happens.

156
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,134
I see…

157
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,851
The bug in Takoppi's place
went dead. No sound at all.

158
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,228
I guess they noticed.

159
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,566
What about Ai? Any word?

160
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,777
No response to my calls.

161
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,864
What now?

162
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,199
Sorry to keep you waiting.

163
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,369
I could only carry two cones,
so I'm going to grab mine.

164
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,459
Did you ask him to do that?

165
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,463
The kid's acting all bubbly.

166
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,720
You don't think

167
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,642
we look like a couple right now?

168
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,684
What? Ew.

169
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,519
This isn't good.

170
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,605
If my girlfriend saw us, I'd be dead.

171
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm so done with this!

172
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,235
-I want to quit.
-Same here.

173
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,033
Is your girlfriend watching?

174
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,910
-She's in Sendai.
-What?

175
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,705
My senpai is calling for me.

176
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,625
Tell Shion thanks for the ice cream.

177
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,005
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm still a student, and I need credits.

178
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,508
If I fail another year,
I'm screwed. Sorry.

179
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,884
Hey!

180
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:26,435
Even I wish this was all just a dream.

181
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,397
He came!

182
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,981
He did!

183
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,276
You told me to come,
so don't act surprised.

184
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
Glad you came.

185
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,826
-Let go!
-Have some.

186
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,369
-It's good.
-It's good.

187
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,578
It's good.

188
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,461
Nothing weird inside, right?

189
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,172
Just dead octopus.

190
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,430
Is it good?

191
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,435
That's right. It's good, huh?

192
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,440
It's becoming my comfort food.

193
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,277
Who's your boss?

194
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,904
-Ai.
-Ai?

195
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,326
That white guy is Ai?

196
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,164
No. Ai's not like that.

197
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,540
Your long-distance girlfriend?

198
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,252
Also no. Why do you even know that?

199
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,132
Then, what did you mean back then?

200
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
Let go!

201
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,303
Ten million people will die
because of you!

202
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,182
Ten million people will die because of me?

203
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,188
Maybe not directly you,

204
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,692
but your boss, Kizashi.

205
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,405
Kizashi's orders will make it happen,
so it's the same.

206
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,907
How can you be so sure?

207
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,952
I can't say who Ai is,

208
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,499
but Ai hacked
into Kizashi's communications.

209
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,544
Ai was detected and locked out

210
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,759
but got Kizashi's simulation data.

211
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,512
Simulation?

212
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,807
He used big data to model

213
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,770
how building certain junctions
could reshape the future.

214
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,356
As a result,

215
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:39,485
in the future that Kizashi seeks…

216
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,404
In that future,
ten million people will die.

217
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,615
That's the future Ai saw.

218
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,494
You guys are helping him.

219
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,538
He's using you.

220
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,546
We're saving the world.

221
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,967
Our mission is to save 10,000 lives
ten years from now.

222
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,302
That's what the missions are for.

223
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,472
-We--
-That's a lie.

224
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,267
That's a lie.

225
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,482
This conversation is going nowhere.

226
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,822
FLOWER SHOP

227
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,994
Can we talk for a bit?

228
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,267
You have a son that old?

229
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,940
There may be a misunderstanding
between you guys,

230
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,653
but we've got nothing to hide.
So, just stay calm.

231
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
He's being used.

232
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,327
Huh?

233
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,789
Shion is being manipulated.

234
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,542
It might be safer
to bring him to our side.

235
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,962
How?

236
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,841
If you tell him the truth.

237
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,843
That you're his father.

238
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,846
That would

239
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,265
reach his heart.

240
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,902
Ohsuke, what did you just do?

241
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,782
Nothing… I didn't do anything.

242
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,559
A pickling stone?

243
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,144
For my birthday?

244
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,814
You said you wanted one.

245
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,316
I said I wanted to pickle cabbage.

246
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,151
Not very romantic, though.

247
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,861
Here.

248
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,365
That was close!

249
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,908
Please use it.

250
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,284
Thanks.

251
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,381
What are you pickling this time?

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,638
You gave me this, right?

253
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,060
Who else would it be?

254
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,604
It has to be me.

255
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,942
Right.

256
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,748
Keeping up a lie is exhausting.

257
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:28,630
I'll keep it up, no excuses.

258
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,341
I'll hide it to the end. Don't worry.

259
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,182
Maybe telling the truth…

260
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,517
is an option too.

261
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,065
I might've been overthinking it.

262
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,317
Go ahead and tell her.

263
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,781
Tell Shiki the truth.

264
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,451
Say you're not really her husband,
but you love her.

265
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,497
Her husband's dead anyway.

266
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,167
He's not even competition.

267
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,754
You've already won.

268
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,259
Hello.

269
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,345
You're late.

270
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,431
We hurried, believe it or not.

271
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,225
You're super late!

272
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,895
I was in the middle
of drying Furuta's shell, you know.

273
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,563
Sorry, despite your busy schedule.

274
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,524
So, what did you want to discuss?

275
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,485
Actually…

276
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,987
Ichimatsu told me this.

277
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,698
Because of our missions,

278
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,534
ten years from now,

279
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
we will cause ten million deaths.

280
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,792
But the boss once told me this

281
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,377
and said it was confidential.

282
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,295
Ten years from now,

283
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,550
10,000 people will die.
A major catastrophe will occur.

284
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,385
I want…

285
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,388
to stop it.

286
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,890
Our mission

287
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,185
is to save 10,000 lives.

288
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,775
According to Ichimatsu,
we are being deceived.

289
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,945
He says we're working for the wrong side.

290
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,448
If we continue our missions,
ten million people will die.

291
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,035
We're not saving,
but rather people will die.

292
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:29,209
Boss is saying we will save 10,000 people.

293
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,713
But Ichimatsu says
ten million people will die.

294
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,674
Who should I believe?

295
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,135
-Of course, the boss!
-Duh!

296
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,553
What are you talking about?

297
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,597
-You don't even need to think.
-Right.

298
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,308
-But--
-Why do you think Ichimatsu is correct?

299
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,602
Yeah. He's a traitor.

300
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,020
Well…

301
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,064
If ten million people die because of me…

302
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,816
How can you fall for that?

303
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,112
Did you exchange contact information?

305
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:03,452
-You did?
-What is he? Your friend?

306
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,204
-Well…
-What's with this guy?

307
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,163
You traitor!

308
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,252
Then, let's talk it out.

309
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,130
-Everyone from both sides together.
-Huh?

310
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,715
Don't drag Shion into this.

311
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,841
Then without him.

312
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,552
But he doesn't know
that he's Ohsuke's son.

313
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,514
Wouldn't it be weird to exclude just him?

314
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,935
Say it's because he's a high schooler,
so he shouldn't be involved.

315
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,646
-Mrs. Enjaku, I'll bloom flowers for you!
-Not now.

316
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,940
So, Shion stays out.

317
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,400
Kujo, the white man,
and Ichimatsu. Those three.

318
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,903
We'll have four.
So, it'll be four versus three.

319
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,323
If I sit out, it'll be even.
Three versus three.

320
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,741
I'll hide and watch from afar.

321
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,702
-That white guy might do something again.
-Yeah.

322
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,789
-Bunta, contact Ichimatsu.
-Yes.

323
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,588
-This looks kind of like a date.
-Not even close.

324
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,059
Why at the university?

325
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,061
It's their request.

326
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,065
Hey. Let's put these together.

327
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,025
Yeah…

328
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,236
-One, two!
-One, two!

329
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,989
Sorry, I'm late.

330
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,740
Then arrange this.

331
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,453
One, two.

332
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,371
They're here.

333
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,582
-Just you two?
-You got a problem?

334
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,546
Wait, so nobody ordered anything?

335
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,633
You guys aren't the students here,
you know?

336
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,051
Shouldn't you get us something?

337
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,805
Oh, that's right.
Then I'll go buy something…

338
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,682
Where do I buy it?

339
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,517
Are you guys having fun down there?

340
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,854
What kind of meeting is this?

341
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,356
They looked good. Eat some, you two.

342
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,066
Let's eat.

343
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,487
Where's the white guy?

344
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,614
He's not one of us.

345
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,367
-What?
-But he disappeared with you, right?

346
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,827
We don't know either.

347
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,456
When we noticed, everyone was gone.

348
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,964
The white man was gone too.

349
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,716
We had no idea

350
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,261
what happened, so we just went home.

351
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,769
Maybe you're the one who helped him?

352
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,897
While we were out cold,

353
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,775
you dumped the case
with the virus into the sea.

354
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,527
And because of that, ten million will die.

355
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,989
That case was empty.

356
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,366
-Empty?
-There was no virus inside.

357
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,786
We don't understand it either.

358
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,499
Then maybe Kizashi set it up?

359
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,627
Makes sense.

360
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,172
He tricked even his own team
and used us all to stage a fake mission.

361
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,423
He made us fight for the case.

362
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,551
The boss didn't know it was empty.

363
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,428
That happens.
Missions aren't always perfect.

364
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,763
There it is again. Mission, huh?

365
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,311
I used to have a classmate named Yanagi.

366
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,481
She was top of our class and brilliant.

367
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,734
She suddenly showed up
at my company one day.

368
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,245
What are you listening to?

369
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,206
Your old band, Entropy Girls.

370
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,460
What? You came
to dig up my high school shame?

371
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,879
-It was a good band.
-Stop it.

372
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,301
Why are you here?

373
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,015
I've been doing some side work lately,
something kind of unusual.

374
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,853
Missions.

375
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,896
My job is to complete missions.

376
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,817
It seems there were
several part-time workers.

377
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,652
Each of them had a mission.

378
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,779
Stock trading, real estate deals.

379
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,699
Someone even made machines
for an optics company.

380
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,493
The pharma division had two teams.

381
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,371
Yanagi was in Team A.

382
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,789
Their mission

383
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,335
was to create a drug
that could turn people into Espers.

384
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,842
The employer sent over the drug's formula.

385
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,762
I'd never seen that synthesis method.
Strange ingredients, too.

386
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,975
Whatever we lacked, the other
part-timers got it from their missions.

387
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,686
What?

388
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,815
A drug that makes you an Esper?

389
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,528
You liked meat, didn't you, Kujo?

390
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,745
How does it smell?

391
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,128
The smell of grilled meat?

392
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,047
It's my Esper ability.

393
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,007
I can produce just a little smell.

394
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,592
Just smell? Not the real thing?

395
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,010
Of course not.

396
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,597
So, all it does is make people hungry?
Totally useless.

397
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,308
Right. It's completely useless.

398
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,185
What kind of drug is that?

399
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,316
What about this smell? Recognize it?

400
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,330
Citrus.

401
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,001
Like citrus shampoo.

402
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,504
Bingo.

403
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,300
You started using it because I did.

404
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,178
Back then, we both smelled the same.

405
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,309
We've both switched shampoos since, huh?

406
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,321
You want me to hold on to this?

407
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,615
I'll come get it when it's all over.

408
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,203
-Wait…
-See you.

409
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,748
I wanted to ask her a million questions,

410
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,084
but I just did as told.

411
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,507
A few days later, I got a call…

412
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,801
from the police.

413
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,315
It's her.

414
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,900
Yanagi.

415
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,333
Her body…

416
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,919
smelled of citrus.

417
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:36,237
TO KUJO

418
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,297
If you're reading this,

419
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,258
it means I'm dead.

420
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,760
LETTER TO KUJO

421
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,930
All my teammates are dead too.
They were killed.

422
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,308
I don't know which Esper did it.

423
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,187
This case is for insurance.

424
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,898
Hide it.

425
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,734
Use it to beg for your life
if you have to.

426
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,154
If you fail,

427
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:22,117
destroy it all.

428
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,621
And forget about me.

429
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,000
Our employer said

430
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,254
they were just creating "Kizashi".

431
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,715
That people get lost easily

432
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,260
if the sign or "kizashi" is strong enough.

433
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:44,556
Even if it leads the wrong way.

434
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,571
Are you listening?

435
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:01,990
Of course, we were.

436
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,076
It just suddenly got really heavy.

437
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,078
Like a kids' comic turning serious.

438
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,913
Hey, I'm being serious!

439
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,249
Stop eating fries!

440
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,837
We're just not used to big-picture stuff.

441
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,173
Our world's just a bit smaller.

442
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,927
Yanagi's employer was named Kizashi.

443
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,514
That's your boss, isn't it?

444
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,809
-Our boss is a good man!
-That's right.

445
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,979
Good or bad doesn't matter!
Look at what he's done!

446
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:37,358
Who is Kizashi? What's his real name?
What kind of Esper is he?

447
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,989
Hitting the table was the signal.

448
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,876
Static electricity?

449
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,461
Is Shion here?

450
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,801
This room is saturated
with Shion's static charge.

451
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,888
A high-density, unstable field of energy.

452
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,600
If I release a perfectly tuned
ultrasonic wave matching this frequency,

453
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,769
it'll trigger molecular resonance,

454
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,896
breaking bonds and releasing energy.

455
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,857
In other words,
an acoustic resonance explosion.

456
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,734
Explosion?

457
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,444
You're gonna blow yourself up?

458
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,989
The explosion will spread
from this table outward.

459
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,159
The only ones who'll die
are everyone except us.

460
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,247
Talk. Kizashi's identity,
his real name, his Esper power!

461
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,207
-We don't know!
-We don't know!

462
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,544
Then I've got no choice.

463
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,892
Do you know that assault is a crime?

464
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,477
I was just gonna blow them away a bit!

465
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,272
-A little can go too far!
-Let go of me…

466
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,156
-Huh?
-What? It's not sticking anymore.

467
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,157
The static's gone.

468
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,336
Watch out.

469
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,799
If you change your mind, tell Ichimatsu.

470
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,431
I'm so sorry about this. Excuse me.

471
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,482
My brain's blank right now.

472
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,321
Hey, if I used one of these,

473
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,531
could they have stopped her?

474
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,118
Using electromagnetic or ultrasonic
jammers might've made it worse.

475
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,453
Sorry, I'll go ahead.

476
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,914
Take care of these, okay?

477
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:06,049
How many Espers like us
do you think there are?

478
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,259
I always thought we were the only ones.

479
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,180
She said the Espers were all killed.
What do you make of that?

480
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,475
Bunta,

481
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,186
Hanzo, Ohsuke…

482
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,397
You've all been keeping secrets.

483
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,109
I can't trust anyone now.

484
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,863
-We didn't mean any harm.
-Sooner or later,

485
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,157
someone will betray us.

486
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,243
No one will.

487
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,330
Except you, Mrs. Enjaku.

488
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,375
Please stay on my side.

489
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,007
You'd believe her over the boss?

490
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,926
She didn't sound like she was lying.

491
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,470
I still think the boss is right.

492
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,143
Kujo!

493
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,604
Kujo! I…

494
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,398
can't handle killing anyone!

495
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,108
What were you trying to do at my school?

496
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,528
I screwed up. I should've put on
my headphones before shouting.

497
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,698
Blasting myself with my own power
is pretty useless.

498
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,616
Were you going to kill my friends?

499
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,911
I was bluffing! Just to scare them.

500
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,998
It would've been just a tiny pop, at best.

501
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:24,252
I almost called it
Sonic Resonance Detonation,

502
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,004
but it sounded too much like a band name.

503
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,049
Stop playing around!

504
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,719
My hands are drenched in sweat!

505
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,432
Kujo, sorry! The flower guy stopped me!

506
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,683
Figures.

507
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,269
Any luck finding out
who Kizashi really is?

508
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,937
Nope. Total miss.

509
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,482
What the heck?

510
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,158
The white man didn't show up.

511
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,828
I asked the crows to take care of Kujo.

512
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,165
You knew about Ichimatsu,

513
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,667
but you didn't report it.

514
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,963
That's a serious violation.

515
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,132
You're fired.

516
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,303
That would end your current life.

517
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,559
I'll give you a chance.

518
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:26,898
Find out who the enemy really is.

519
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,486
I'll contact you
once I find Kujo's address.

520
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,738
Goodbye.

521
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,031
HANZO

522
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,025
-Shiki!
-Yes?

523
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,862
-Shiki!
-Congrats on six months with us!

524
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,489
You've got ten days of paid leave now.

525
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,533
Take them anytime you like.

526
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,868
Six months?

527
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,457
I've been working here
for over two years, haven't I?

528
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,921
Well, it's always felt like
you've been here for years.

529
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,005
Yeah.

530
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:35,967
You seemed to know where everything was,
every step of the job,

531
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,136
without anyone telling you.

532
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,055
Before six months ago,
you were at another shop, right?

533
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,891
Another shop…

534
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,165
I'm home.

535
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,335
What's going on?

536
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,383
Shiki!

537
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,553
Shiki!

538
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,390
The photo's gone.

539
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,142
Photo?

540
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,144
From the photo wedding.

541
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,981
We took pictures, remember?

542
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,650
I wore the dress
and picked out your tuxedo.

543
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,820
The photo's gone. I can't find it!

544
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,448
Why?

545
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:46,329
It's nowhere! Why?!

546
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,128
Here.

547
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,422
Thank you.

548
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,311
Fumito?

549
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,148
Huh?

550
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
You're Fumito.

551
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,946
So, why do I call you Bunty?

552
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,046
Fumito…

553
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:39,966
Kizashi?

554
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,429
No. That can't be.

555
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,277
Bunty…

556
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,616
You're Bunta, so that's why
you're Bunty, right?

557
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,207
You're Bunty, right?

558
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,130
Bunty…

559
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,174
Bunty!

560
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,220
Bunty!

561
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,599
Bunty!

562
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,894
Bunty!

563
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,748
Sorry to come this late.

564
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,000
It's fine.

565
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,421
What would you like to discuss?

566
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,381
It's about Shiki.

567
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,387
Her memory's unstable.

568
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,973
She's confused.

569
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,976
I don't know what to do.

570
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:16,604
And now?

571
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,398
She's in bed, exhausted from crying.

572
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,120
Pickled plums.

573
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,373
Shiki made them.

574
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,460
They're still salty,

575
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,171
but she said they'll mellow with time.

576
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,966
Shiki taught me that.

577
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,349
Please. Have some.

578
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,070
She used the pickling stone…

579
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,448
that Fumito gave her.

580
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,870
Her husband's not dead.

581
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,457
You're her husband.

582
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,460
Her Bunty, right?

583
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,342
Wait.

584
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,821
You're an Esper?

585
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,657
What type of Esper?

586
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,451
I don't have a Esper.

587
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,256
-A ghost?
-No.

588
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,302
This is a 3D hologram.

589
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,139
My real body exists in the future.

590
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,770
-The future?
-The year 2055.

591
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,649
Twenty fifty…?

592
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,902
2055, to be exact.

593
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,612
Thirty years from now.

594
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,034
I see.

595
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,411
Time machines don't exist,

596
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,831
but we discovered a way
to send data to the past.

597
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,253
Think of it like
remote communication in your time.

598
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,049
I'm sorry, but I've officially lost track

599
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,260
of this conversation.

600
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,187
No, not yet.

601
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,982
Just get whatever.

602
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,068
You could eat alone, you know.

603
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,697
Okay, got it. Bye.

604
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,249
Using Shion like that?

605
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,419
Stay away from him! You hear me?

606
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,186
‎Hey.

607
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,521
What's wrong?

608
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,860
Hello…

609
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,827
Ichimatsu?

610
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,458
Ai…

611
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,964
Ai…

612
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,019
What? A virus?

613
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,186
FOLLOW REQUEST

614
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,354
What?

615
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,861
HELLO, ICHIMATSU

616
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,616
YOU'RE IN 2025, RIGHT?

617
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,328
DON'T BE SHOCKED WHEN YOU READ THIS

618
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,497
DON'T FREAK OUT

619
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,084
SERIOUSLY, DON'T FREAK OUT

620
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,337
Just say it already!

621
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,922
I'M IN 2055

622
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,383
I'M ICHIMATSU

623
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,056
YOUR FUTURE SELF

624
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,437
SO CALL ME "I"

625
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,523
I…?

626
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,612
‎Don't come near us!

627
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,113
‎Get out, you murderer!

628
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,865
‎Where is the present Fumito now?

629
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,950
‎Where and what is he doing?

630
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,202
‎Do you remember?

631
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,496
‎The last six months
‎of my memory will be gone.

632
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:26,955
‎Goodbye.

633
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,956
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
