1
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,230
Bunty…?

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,443
Bunty…

3
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,320
Bunty!

4
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,245
You should sleep closer to the middle.

5
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,708
I've fallen off every third night.
I'm used to it now.

6
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,210
That's not something to get used to.

7
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,295
Also…

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,797
This morning,

9
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,674
-I thought I heard a voice.
-A voice?

10
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,052
A voice saying, "Don't die."

11
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,513
I said that out loud?

12
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,431
Huh?

13
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,894
I keep having this dream… where you die.

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,855
Not often, but it feels so real.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,234
It's different from any other dream.

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,363
She lost her husband in an accident.

17
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,823
He died right in front of her.

18
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,825
She's projecting her late husband

19
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,327
onto you, Bunta.

20
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,416
Alright.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,596
Why do I keep dreaming that?

22
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,890
Even when I'm so happy.

23
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:35,238
Shiki isn't an employee of Nonamare

24
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,407
or an Esper.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,284
Why does she live in company housing?

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,078
Boss said she's the daughter of a friend

27
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,497
and was asked to look after her.

28
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:49,127
It was rough at first. She almost
followed her husband to the grave.

29
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
So, Mrs. Enjaku stayed near her.

30
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,762
That's…

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,141
That's dangerous. Give it to me, okay?

32
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,646
Your husband's coming home.

33
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,648
He's on a…

34
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,443
long business trip.

35
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,613
He's on a long business trip.

36
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,579
Business trip?

37
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,623
Yes. Let's…

38
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,500
wait for him together.

39
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,919
Alright?

40
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,845
That was just a lie Mrs. Enjaku told
to keep her safe,

41
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,391
but strangely enough, Shiki accepted it.

42
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,436
Bit by bit, she got better.

43
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,981
What's his name?

44
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,734
-Sasuke.
-Sasuke, huh?

45
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,863
Sasuke, you're so cute.

46
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,824
Nice to meet you. A present for you.

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,868
Thank you.

48
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,454
My name uses the kanji
"Sakura" and "Suke". I'm Ohsuke.

49
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,873
We started hosting takoyaki nights

50
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,000
to cheer her up.

51
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,879
So, there's history
behind those takoyaki nights.

52
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,590
She'd been stable for a long time,

53
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,635
but lately, she's started
breaking down again.

54
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,055
She realized her husband's
not coming back.

55
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,308
Of course she would.

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,186
But giving her another man instead

57
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,980
and her believing I'm him

58
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,565
is also insane.

59
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,192
It really is, isn't it?

60
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,114
Hanzo, what did you do

61
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,158
before joining Nonamare?

62
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,458
Mrs. Enjaku lives very simply.

63
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:55,962
Really?

64
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,130
CLEANEX TOOTHPASTE

65
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,050
She only buys things on sale…

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,093
PROVERBS FROM AROUND THE WORLD

67
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,970
…reads borrowed library books,

68
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,514
writes out sutras every day
with a ballpoint pen.

69
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,099
She lives purely,

70
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,269
freeing herself from desire.

71
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,939
-She has no family?
-None.

72
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,692
She's been through a lot.

73
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,238
So, what did you use to--

74
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324
No matter how much I pull weeds,
it never ends.

75
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,326
I love this smell though.

76
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,244
Grassy… What do you call it?

77
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,581
This smell! Hey, what's it called?

78
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,416
The smell is different depending on…

79
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,211
What, you're curious
about Hanzo or something?

80
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,212
No…

81
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,507
Not exactly,

82
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,052
but when someone hides something,
it makes me curious.

83
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,512
He's an animal nut.

84
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,347
Everyone knows that!

85
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,226
He's taken in strays
and even bought a few.

86
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,188
He says that he can't resist
when they ask to come home with him.

87
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,400
Now he avoids pet shops.

88
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,568
Sorry, Kuroda.

89
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,361
At home, he's basically

90
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,156
scooping poop all day.

91
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,532
Are you itchy?

92
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,742
Does he have family?

93
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,659
The animals.

94
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,787
Everyone knows that!

95
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,457
Not entirely.

96
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,295
Actually…

97
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,052
he's killed someone.

98
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,100
Strange company, strange jobs…

99
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,813
I figured none of the staff were ordinary.

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,483
Guess life's full of surprises.

101
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,819
Who do you mean?

102
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,696
Well…

103
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,242
Ohsuke may seem rough,

104
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,702
but he's not a bad kid.

105
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,872
He's had his past,

106
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,875
but now he's serious
about his work with Nonamare

107
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,918
and his flower shop.

108
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,587
He's always been a florist?

109
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,340
No, he started after becoming an Esper.

110
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,678
Boss approved it

111
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,513
since a florist cover

112
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,265
could be useful for missions.

113
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,809
He even rented the place for him.

114
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,065
All done with separating.

115
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,862
Weeding, litter pickup, recycling…

116
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,030
You always do this?

117
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,699
When there's no mission, yes.

118
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,785
These little acts
are just as important as our work.

119
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,413
Our work, huh?

120
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,585
Listen well. You are heroes

121
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,004
who save the world.

122
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:48,342
Heroes must have responsibility
and strong ethics.

123
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,260
Yes.

124
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,970
Something as simple

125
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,681
as cleaning your neighborhood.

126
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,976
It may seem trivial, but…

127
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,064
those small steps

128
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,816
are what eventually save the world.

129
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:08,863
Yes?

130
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,741
I get your ideals, President.

131
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,201
I do, but…

132
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,121
Having a clearer goal

133
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,666
would make it easier to work toward.

134
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,084
Bunta,

135
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,295
do you think happiness

136
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,423
can be quantified?

137
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,219
Can you put a number on saving the world,

138
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,764
such as in money or sales?

139
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,685
That mindset is the problem!

140
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,853
That is why you embezzled

141
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,315
and ruined your life.

142
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,692
You let numbers rule you.

143
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,781
Illness begins in the mind.

144
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,407
So does heroism.

145
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,035
Is that a slogan?

146
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,246
-Bunta!
-Yes?

147
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,124
"I'm just a bit of an Esper

148
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,918
and just a bit of a hero."

149
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,628
Say it.

150
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,465
-What?
-"I…"

151
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,389
I'm… just a bit of an Esper

152
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,849
and just a bit of a hero…?

153
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,184
It's not a question.

154
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,230
I'm just a bit of an Esper

155
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,606
and just a bit of a hero.

156
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,191
With more feeling.

157
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,986
-I'm--
-Take it seriously!

158
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,532
I'm just a bit of an Esper

159
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,534
-and just a bit of a hero!
-With conviction!

160
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,161
I'm just a bit of an Esper
and just a bit of a hero!

161
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,539
-One more time!
-I'm just a bit of an Esper and…!

162
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,233
You already ate some.

163
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,444
No more dried sweet potatoes.

164
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,237
I'm not stingy.

165
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,199
I just can't trust him.

166
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,036
-Who?
-President Kizashi.

167
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,246
He talks big,

168
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,165
but there's no passion…

169
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,750
I feel like he's just showing off.

170
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,501
Well, he's cool.

171
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,795
Anyone can look that cool

172
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,715
if they've got money and leisure.
Anyone can.

173
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,176
-Really?
-Well…

174
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,762
Sure, at least to that extent.

175
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,474
-Mrs. Enjaku, come on!
-All right, let's do this.

176
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,476
Ready… go!

177
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,772
Don't warm up people's bladders.

178
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,733
-What did that feel like?
-A new sensation.

179
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,777
-Don't make me laugh!
-Concentrate!

180
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:54,737
Go!

181
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,947
More!

182
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,118
And… time!

183
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,163
The result…

184
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,749
It's a record.
Thirty-five point six degrees!

185
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,835
-Oh!
-Yes! Up by one degree.

186
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,962
Human body temperature!

187
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,341
It sure is peaceful.

188
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:19,136
Drinking in daylight,
training useless powers,

189
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,473
getting paid for picking up trash…

190
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,308
That's our modern hero?

191
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,977
-Is it okay to be this relaxed?
-If you hate it, quit.

192
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,939
Hate it? No way!

193
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,859
If anything, I wish I'd found
this kind of job sooner.

194
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,486
-Another round!
-Make it yourself.

195
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,445
Yes, sir.

196
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,075
I don't even get what being a hero means.

197
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,036
What's the point of every mission?

198
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,255
-Want me to make yours too?
-No, really, it's okay.

199
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,132
-It's no trouble.
-Really,

200
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,300
I couldn't ask you.

201
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,636
Huh?

202
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,982
-Ohsuke, you said something again?
-Huh?

203
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,026
You told him I'm a murderer again, right?

204
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,779
-See!
-See!

205
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,407
Knock it off already!

206
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,950
-It's not true?
-Of course not!

207
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,870
-You almost killed him, though.
-Yeah, almost.

208
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,830
He lived, luckily.

209
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,083
Hanzo used to be a cop.

210
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,711
-A police officer?
-K-9 unit.

211
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,175
Please keep it a secret.
I don't like talking about it.

212
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,510
He beat up a guy who abused dogs.

213
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,387
It was worse than that!

214
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,514
He crammed 50 dogs

215
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,516
into a tiny room to breed them.

216
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,518
I reported him to Animal Control
and to my boss,

217
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,061
but they said their hands were tied.

218
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,273
Right?

219
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,942
It was awful.

220
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,320
I broke in

221
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,989
to free them all,

222
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,993
but I got caught halfway through
and fought back.

223
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,705
-You almost killed him?
-Yes.

224
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,249
The animals were saved,

225
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,419
but I went to prison and got fired.

226
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,922
I really thought it was my calling.

227
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,757
Back then,

228
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,135
-you weren't an Esper yet, right?
-No.

229
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,222
But I always wished

230
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,975
I could understand
what animals were feeling.

231
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,895
They say E-Capsules

232
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,981
change ability based on personality,

233
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,568
but maybe they reflect your deepest wish.

234
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,947
So, did I wish to make flowers bloom?

235
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,282
What about you, Bunta? Any clue

236
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,617
why you can hear thoughts?

237
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,454
No, not really.

238
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,833
I ran out of capsules. Give me one.

239
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,961
Go get it yourself.

240
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,505
Bunta, give me one of yours!

241
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,342
I'm almost out too.
I'm picking up more tomorrow.

242
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,429
Then go together.
Bunta, take Ohsuke with you.

243
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,568
Ohsuke, I told you before

244
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,195
to pick up your E-Capsules
while we still have stock.

245
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah. Okay.

246
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,075
Once the drug wears off,
you lose your powers.

247
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,036
Then, you're automatically terminated.
No second chances.

248
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,999
I always wondered…

249
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,960
If it makes you an Esper,
shouldn't it be called

250
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,545
an "ES-Capsule"?

251
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,885
It's the E from ESP, so it's an E-Capsule.

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,888
That makes sense!

253
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,180
You always come

254
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,600
at the last minute.

255
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,644
You have no sense of responsibility.

256
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,355
Yeah.

257
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,442
Bunta, you're exemplary.

258
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,486
Always organized and always on schedule.

259
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,322
That's just being professional.

260
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,742
I'll remind him

261
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,785
about the next pickup.

262
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,287
Much appreciated. Thanks.

263
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,122
Not at all.

264
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,251
Remember the rule.

265
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,380
No one must ever know about your powers.

266
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,174
Understood.

267
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,886
And one more thing. Non amare.

268
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,513
You must not love anyone.

269
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,683
I love you.

270
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,898
Just wondering…

271
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,485
Why is there a rule

272
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,611
to not love someone?

273
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:50,658
You have a mission to complete.

274
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:55,120
Nothing should matter
more than that mission.

275
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,709
Love always clouds judgment

276
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,504
and weakens resolve.

277
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,839
A hero's love

278
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,926
is even more forbidden than an idol's.

279
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,469
But these days,

280
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,139
even idols…

281
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,771
That goes for family too, Ohsuke.

282
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,732
I've been concerned
about your shop location choice.

283
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,235
Maybe you're getting too close?

284
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,779
Alright.

285
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,572
I'm just watching.

286
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,826
In your case, you have a unique situation.

287
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,911
And with your situation, that's unwise.

288
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,871
For your son too.

289
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,962
Yes.

290
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,928
-You sucked up to him.
-That's just how office life is.

291
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,472
It's just standard company behavior.

292
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,766
Office life, huh?

293
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,188
You live with your son?

294
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,941
What? I live alone.

295
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,903
He doesn't even know who I am.

296
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,540
Jeez… I'll get it next time.

297
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,625
-How old is he? What's his name?
-Shion!

298
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,752
Oh, later.

299
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,046
Shion. He's 17.

300
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,589
Shion.

301
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,716
It's a flower's name.

302
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,386
I wanted to choose a flower name
like yours, Ohsuke.

303
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,304
Yeah.

304
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,346
What about this one?

305
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,264
SHION

306
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,766
Shion.

307
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,102
It's a tiny, pale purple flower,
like a chrysanthemum.

308
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,229
I can't read that!

309
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,984
-Figures. I guess that's a no.
-No!

310
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,987
-This is good.
-What? But you can't read it.

311
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,323
He'll grow up smart,

312
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,699
unlike me.

313
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,077
SHION

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,036
I see.

315
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,372
Shion.

316
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,875
Ohsuke, Shion is standing!

317
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,293
You're a genius, Shion.

318
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,920
You're a genius!

319
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,884
You've eaten well. You're a genius!

320
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,307
Thank you for your work.

321
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,433
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

322
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
I'll take these.

323
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,063
-Working hard, huh?
-Since you're a dad now.

324
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,022
Thanks!

325
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,741
You're looking lively, Ohsuke!

326
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
Huh?

327
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,800
Smells fishy!

328
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,346
Is this what you're eating?

329
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,600
-Please leave me alone.
-What?

330
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,936
I came all the way here to offer you work

331
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,813
that pays better

332
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,023
than sweating on a boat.

333
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,780
There's no one left to run things.
You know the ropes, don't you?

334
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,824
Trust me on this.

335
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,746
I can't skip my boat job.

336
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,876
Relax.

337
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,337
I'll take care of your wife and kid.
All of you.

338
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,093
Shion, right?

339
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,852
Better decide while I'm still being nice.

340
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,914
Okay.

341
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,083
Good. Two hours to pack up.

342
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,178
Hey, bring the car to the fishing port.

343
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,014
Yeah. He…

344
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,489
The bastard didn't survive.

345
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,035
Unlike Hanzo, I chose to kill him.

346
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,121
Why did you beat him

347
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,416
until he died?

348
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,254
If I'd stopped halfway,
he'd have come after us.

349
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,424
You could've run.

350
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,220
If I could, I wouldn't have done it.

351
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,056
You turned Shion…

352
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,605
into a murderer's son.

353
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,403
What I regretted most

354
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,239
was the life I'd wasted up until now

355
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,491
and dreaming

356
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,828
of a normal, happy life.

357
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,085
About two years later,
I got a letter from the court.

358
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,169
CHIYODA REGIONAL COURT

359
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,380
Mizuki's new husband

360
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,007
had adopted Shion.

361
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,509
Legally, he became his father.

362
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,224
I was erased

363
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,019
from Shion's life completely.

364
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,189
That's how it should be.

365
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,322
After I was released, the boss found me
and brought me into Nonamare.

366
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,283
One mission took me near that town again.

367
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,246
Hey, Shion!

368
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,665
-Hey!
-Sorry, I'm late!

369
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,459
You're late, Shion!

370
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,211
-You have food at home?
-My mom said she'll make something.

371
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,588
Yes!

372
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,386
-Tatsuya!
-Shion!

373
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,641
-Good job!
-Nice!

374
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,643
-I did it!
-You were so cool!

375
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,145
A happy,

376
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,355
ordinary life

377
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,316
was right there.

378
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,525
-Good job!
-Yeah.

379
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,363
So, he doesn't need to know who I am.

380
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,496
But I'll always see myself

381
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,331
as his dad.

382
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,501
Watching from afar is enough.

383
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,842
FLOWER SHOP

384
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,346
Hey.

385
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,389
Don't tell anyone, okay?

386
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,391
It's lame.

387
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,978
It's not lame.

388
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,022
You're a good dad.

389
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,817
You idiot.

390
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:24,528
I'm a murderer.

391
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,907
Then you're the best dad among murderers.

392
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,330
What does that even mean?

393
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,267
Thanks.

394
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,437
Alright.

395
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,098
Were you remembering something?

396
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,685
You can tell?

397
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,979
Your back looked that way.

398
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,111
I was remembering a back.

399
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,780
My father's.

400
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,536
My dad was impatient.

401
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,498
You know how adults

402
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,626
and kids have different strides?

403
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,421
He was the kind of man
who couldn't see that.

404
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,382
One day, he asked,

405
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,303
"Wanna go to the festival?"

406
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,973
It was rare,

407
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,308
so I was so excited.

408
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,436
He just kept

409
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,314
walking ahead

410
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,316
and never looked back.

411
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:33,949
I lost him in the crowd

412
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,160
and never reached the festival.

413
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,537
Daddy…

414
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,084
That's when I remembered…

415
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,670
When I was little,

416
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:51,758
I used to think, "If only I could hear

417
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,260
what he was thinking."

418
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,804
Like his thoughts?

419
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,890
If…

420
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,226
I could've heard them…

421
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,023
I would've known he wasn't cold.

422
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,735
He was just clumsy.

423
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,823
Maybe he's thinking dearly of me.

424
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,993
If I could hear his thoughts,

425
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,245
I would have known that.

426
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,504
I was such a pure, innocent kid.

427
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:37,512
He remained the same
all the way to the end.

428
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,141
He died in a hospital bed.

429
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,439
I couldn't even cry.

430
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,193
If the parent is like that,

431
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,530
then the son would be the same.

432
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,173
I wish I could pat little Bunty's head.

433
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,016
There's a shrine festival

434
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,310
in our neighborhood this weekend.

435
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,145
Oh yeah?

436
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,400
This year, let's wear our yukata
and go together.

437
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,197
This year…

438
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,204
Let's go.

439
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,915
Let's go in a yukata this year.

440
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,679
Mrs. Enjaku's here!

441
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,935
Mrs. Enjaku's here!

442
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
Please wait a sec!

443
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,440
This Easy Bunko Bow for Beginners

444
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,525
isn't easy at all!

445
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,610
They underestimate beginners.

446
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,195
I mean, I am a beginner!

447
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,072
How's this look?

448
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,369
That's good! You look great, Bunty!

449
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,288
Oh, need help with yours?

450
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,251
Then…

451
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,880
-How about this one?
-You picked the hardest one.

452
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,508
Please.

453
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,263
He insisted on coming.

454
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,391
Want some grilled squid, Sasuke?

455
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,102
No! If you feed him squid, he could die!

456
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,438
-Seriously?
-Absolutely not!

457
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,106
Oh, they're here!

458
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,359
Sorry for the wait.

459
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,445
-Look!
-Oh!

460
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,655
Looks lovely!

461
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,115
Bunty tied it for me.

462
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,952
I forgot my camera. Hold on.

463
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,663
You're good, Bunta.

464
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,457
Just skilled with my hands.

465
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,754
Right when it was getting fun…

466
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,422
Hope it's an easy mission.

467
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,507
-Now?
-It happens sometimes.

468
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,135
Let's pretend we didn't see it.

469
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,763
Mission 77.

470
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,680
MISSION 77-SEPTEMBER 14, 2025 4:24 P.M.
STOP PEOPLE FROM DYING IN AN EXPLOSION

471
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,226
"Stop people from dying in an explosion."

472
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,644
Explosion?

473
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,438
You're kidding.

474
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,733
This… It says 4:24 p.m.

475
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,319
That's less than 30 minutes!

476
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,739
The location… It's the shrine
where the festival is at.

477
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,789
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

478
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,706
HOTDOG

479
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,251
You almost got it!

480
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,171
Sorry for the wait.

481
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,717
Let's go!

482
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,553
Ah… You know…

483
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,810
-What happened?
-Bunta!

484
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,604
-Mrs. Enjaku!
-My heart… It hurts!

485
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,772
Mrs. Enjaku? Are you okay?!

486
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,775
I can't move an inch!

487
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,652
Ambulance! Bunty! Call the ambulance!

488
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,987
No, I'll just rest!

489
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,240
But the candy apples!

490
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,492
-Candy apples?
-Yeah.

491
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,161
The famous shop is selling them!

492
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,248
I have to buy them or they'll sell out!

493
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,500
Candy apples!

494
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,709
-That!
-Yeah!

495
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,044
What "famous" shop?

496
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,965
You don't know
the Apple-Star of candy apples?!

497
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,262
-Don't move, the two of you!
-Yeah.

498
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,763
-Hey! Let's go!
-Yeah!

499
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,390
-Hey! Let's get the candy apples!
-Hey--

500
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,933
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

501
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,146
-So many people…
-This isn't good.

502
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,606
Only 20 minutes left!

503
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,483
Hey!

504
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,402
-That kid!
-Huh?

505
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,741
-Who?
-Anyway,

506
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,535
-let's find the bomb!
-Yes.

507
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,122
IZUMI SHRINE SUMMER FESTIVAL

508
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,248
Excuse me!

509
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:19,919
Here you are.

510
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,921
-Wow!
-Wait, that's a PlayStation 5!

511
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,882
Five hundred yen per try.

512
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,341
-Huh? Five hundred yen?
-Wait!

513
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,594
-I'm not sure…
-Okay! Whoever loses, goes.

514
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,846
-Okay!
-Rock paper scissors.

515
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,431
Where is the bomb?

516
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,017
Sorry! Excuse me!

517
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,728
If you're going to do that…

518
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,062
Excuse me!

519
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:41,316
There might be an explosive here!

520
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,650
We need to evacuate everyone!

521
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,027
-Explosive?
-Oh!

522
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,571
Please, find the explosive.

523
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,657
Gun powder, gas.
Something that smells unusual.

524
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,910
What's going to explode?

525
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,121
-A boat.
-How do you know that?

526
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,080
Because…

527
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,917
someone said so!

528
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,585
-A bomb threat?
-A bomb?

529
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,837
Well, not a bomb…

530
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,506
Could be a gas explosion!

531
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,927
Eat before it gets cold.

532
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,303
Ours is still hot. Eat up.

533
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,555
-Um… There might be an explosion!
-You know…

534
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:14,599
Jeez!

535
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:22,106
YAKISOBA

536
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,363
That's dangerous!

537
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:30,239
Excuse me.

538
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,116
Huh?

539
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,717
Go!

540
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,888
-It's you, huh?
-Who are you guys?

541
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,556
There's a strange smell from your bag.

542
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,309
-Are you carrying something?
-Nothing at all.

543
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,228
Please let us check your bag.

544
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,354
Why? You're not cops.

545
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,981
Show us, punk!

546
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,358
No way! Why should I?

547
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,195
Understood.

548
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,322
You don't have to show us anything.

549
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,075
From now on, you don't have to answer

550
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,285
any of my questions.

551
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,206
What's

552
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,166
in that bag?

553
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,464
Wait!

554
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,092
What's in there?

555
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,816
Got you!

556
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,236
What's

557
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,574
-in the bag?
-He knew. It's over.

558
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,576
It's him!

559
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,493
That's him!

560
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,745
-It's him!
-Yeah!

561
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,039
-Hey!
-Hand it over!

562
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,165
-Hey!
-Be careful!

563
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:03,833
-It's dangerous! Don't go near!
-Hey!

564
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:06,002
-Oh!
-Oh no!

565
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,801
MODEL SHIP, GAMES, CD

566
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,347
-You thief!
-Hey! It's a shoplifter!

567
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,725
-I'm sorry!
-What happened?

568
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,769
-Shoplifting?
-Hey!

569
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,395
Dried sweet potato?

570
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,191
Please find the thing
that's going to explode!

571
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,275
Please!

572
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,402
TAKOYAKI

573
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
Dad!

574
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,616
Dad!

575
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,618
Dad!

576
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,580
-Dad!
-Go!

577
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,000
Dad!

578
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,796
Daddy!

579
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,801
Dad!

580
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,928
Dad!

581
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,015
Here?

582
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,476
-Gas leak! Here!
-Dad!

583
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,520
Dad!

584
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:10,983
-Close it!
-Yeah.

585
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,944
-Everyone back!
-Sorry!

586
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,612
-Please!
-Get away!

587
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,489
-Please!
-Get away!

588
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,741
Who shut it off?

589
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,085
-Sorry!
-Run! It's gonna blow!

590
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,257
YAKISOBA

591
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,346
Get down!

592
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,615
What's that?

593
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,713
-Sorry.
-Excuse me!

594
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,173
Excuse me!

595
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,841
Coming through!

596
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,885
Are you okay?

597
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,346
-Don't panic. Leave slowly.
-Excuse me.

598
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,307
-Don't panic. Leave slowly.
-Excuse me.

599
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,391
Leave slowly.

600
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,906
Bunty!

601
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,200
Shiki.

602
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,786
I heard there was an explosion.

603
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,455
There was a small one.

604
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,874
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

605
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,210
No one got hurt?

606
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,629
Hanzo got a scratch.

607
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:56,839
It's nothing.

608
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,760
We missed the festival,

609
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,180
but we did get this.

610
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,389
APPLE-STAR CANDY APPLE

611
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,271
Who saved you?

612
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,942
It wasn't my dad. A stranger.

613
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,068
Kota!

614
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,404
Sorry, Kota! Are you okay?

615
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,782
I didn't see his face.

616
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,908
That was insane!

617
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,202
He lifted the whole griddle!

618
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,412
Without him, we'd have been hurt.

619
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,664
-Yeah.
-Right…

620
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,625
Please don't enter.

621
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,522
There's an unknown factor.

622
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,482
It seems like an unverified element.

623
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,486
We still don't know what it is.

624
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,950
The order came at the last minute,

625
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,160
but the mission succeeded.

626
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,539
The shrine festival

627
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,624
will be held again next year.

628
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,712
The world changes easily,

629
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,173
not always as we wish.

630
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,551
Its branches

631
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,722
are fragile… and short-lived.

632
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,726
Bud.

633
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,023
Peony.

634
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,777
Pine needles.

635
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,658
Falling chrysanthemum.

636
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,378
The end.

637
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,508
Such a short-lived life, huh?

638
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,139
-Here.
-Thanks.

639
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,355
I wanted to buy you

640
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,191
something you liked at the festival.

641
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,485
-Something I like?
-Yeah.

642
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,070
Everything you want.

643
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,280
For the little Bunty too.

644
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,534
You're a strong woman,

645
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,373
like a pickling stone.
Why don't you try to be more like pumice?

646
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,250
Pumice? The one you scrub your heels with?

647
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,587
Yeah. It's full of holes and super light.

648
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,963
That's not me.

649
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,054
You must've received

650
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:54,141
real love

651
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,768
from your parents.

652
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,107
That's why you can love others
without hesitation.

653
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,443
Like a pickling stone.

654
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,324
You talk like you're not the one I love.

655
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,211
Today…

656
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,505
I saw him.

657
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:28,509
The little me,

658
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,262
crying after being left behind.

659
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,308
I saved him.

660
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,479
I'm glad I could.

661
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:50,239
For humans, maybe saving yourself…

662
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,577
is the hardest thing to do.

663
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,643
Hey.

664
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,521
Here, your treat.

665
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,651
It's just a small cut. I'll heal soon.

666
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,031
You're welcome.

667
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,708
No.

668
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:46,212
It's not that I miss my former partner.

669
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,172
I keep it there

670
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,758
to remind myself

671
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,219
never to lose anyone again.

672
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:56,180
Mrs. Enjaku, this yakisoba's great.

673
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,515
I'm glad.

674
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,479
You bite that candy apple bold.

675
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,689
Biting is the best part.

676
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,358
An old boyfriend taught me that.

677
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,612
-What a bad guy, huh?
-Yeah.

678
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,948
He ruined my life.

679
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,149
Just a bit of Esper

680
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,402
Just a bit of hero

681
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,946
Just a bit…

682
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,115
How about work?

683
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,576
-Got a fever.
-What?

684
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,039
I called the shop and told them
I'll take the day off.

685
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,750
Are you okay?

686
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,754
Do you need anything?

687
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,757
I'm fine. Stay safe.

688
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,468
I'm off.

689
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,869
This!

690
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,662
This!

691
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,999
Shiki!

692
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,669
Did you take this capsule?

693
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,631
-The cold medicine?
-No, it's not!

694
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,257
Oh…

695
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,508
Did you?

696
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,637
Huh?

697
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,520
What?

698
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,487
I feel like someone is watching me.

699
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,490
It could be something unidentified.

700
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,075
Something is interfering.

701
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,035
The important things are truly important.

702
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,370
I don't want to lose them.

703
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,038
Non amare.

704
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,915
I can't love.
