1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,842
Decision Tree?

2
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,721
The future…

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,765
is falling apart?

4
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,268
What's going on?

5
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,487
Hello?

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,531
<i>What are you doing? We're in trouble!</i>

7
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,701
<i>Mrs. Enjaku is…</i>

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,797
Take care of the bags, okay?

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,882
-Okay.
-It's so cold.

10
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,633
I want to eat truffles
at least once a week.

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,593
Once a week?

12
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,232
Kaoru?

13
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,113
I can't have you coming here.

14
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,532
You understand, right?

15
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,743
This is my home.

16
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,120
My territory.

17
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,083
Isn't there anything else you want to say?

18
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,133
While I was in prison,

19
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,470
you didn't send even a single letter.

20
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,724
You never even came to visit.
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

21
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,768
Stop it. Calm down.

22
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,901
Damn!

23
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,279
I'm a useless person.

24
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,452
But outside of this world…

25
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,126
Police… I'm calling the police!

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,759
I have nothing to do with the future.

27
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,220
I'm a lonely dot.

28
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,514
A tiny stain.

29
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,393
But you know, even the smallest creature

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,687
has a soul!

31
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,450
Are you burning? It's hot, isn't it?

32
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,287
This is the microwave I saw in my dreams!

33
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,417
Here it is!

34
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,544
Hanzo!

35
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,628
Over here!

36
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,048
Hot…

37
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,803
I can hear it.

38
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,681
The voices are filling the air.

39
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:03,933
Voices…

40
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,978
Give me your hands.

41
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>Ah, this is hilarious…</i>

42
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>This situation is just too funny.</i>

43
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,201
<i>It's funny, you know.</i>

44
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,497
<i>All I ever wanted was to be happy.</i>

45
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,752
<i>I just wanted to be needed.</i>

46
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>I wanted</i>

47
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,759
<i>someone to love me.</i>

48
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>I wanted to be loved…</i>

49
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,391
<i>by this world.</i>

50
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,648
<i>I wanted to love…</i>

51
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>myself…</i>

52
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>and this world.</i>

53
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,947
<i>I wanted to love them.</i>

54
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,326
Die!

55
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,795
Mrs. Enjaku!

56
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,047
Stop it! Ohsuke, hold her!

57
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,050
What's going on? The remote!

58
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,551
The remote!

59
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,140
It's fine! It's okay! Put me down!

60
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,434
Okay.

61
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,027
What are you all doing?

62
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,782
I failed to kill him.

63
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,372
We failed to love.

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,338
All of us…

65
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,592
We all failed to love.

66
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,309
<i>When you enter the house, drink this.</i>

67
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,062
It will begin reinstalling your memories.

68
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,981
There is someone I want to save.

69
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,484
-<i>That person died?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

70
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>Ten years from now.</i>

71
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,445
Right.

72
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,407
I'll…

73
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,993
die.

74
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,422
<i>I cannot say ten million deaths are okay.</i>

75
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,174
Yeah.

76
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,719
Ten million lives matter more.

77
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,430
I'm not worth that much.

78
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,016
It's better if I die.

79
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,859
But if I die…

80
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,030
Bunty might do something crazy again.

81
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,868
He's overwhelming, you know.

82
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,665
He'll do something again.

83
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,417
And someone will die.

84
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,962
It's endless.

85
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,588
Boom.

86
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,218
Shiki.

87
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,971
-Yes?
-Are you okay?

88
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,806
Want to talk about it?

89
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:18,855
Bunty…

90
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,316
I love Bunty.

91
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,861
But I also love Bunty.

92
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,450
I should just die for everyone's sake.

93
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,707
But Bunty is overwhelming.

94
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,710
If I die, he'll do something again.

95
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,256
Maybe I just shouldn't meet him?

96
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,260
If I find the present Bunty and kill him…

97
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,264
But if I kill Bunty,

98
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,892
and Bunty is alive…

99
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,687
It's awful that only I
get to be happy with Bunty.

100
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,233
Oh, I got it.

101
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,111
Then I'll just kill both of them.

102
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,284
Bunty and Bunty.

103
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,829
I'll kill them both.

104
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,792
I wonder how Shiki is doing.

105
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,923
She's completely forgotten about us.

106
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,425
About you, too?

107
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,011
Of course she has.

108
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,680
She'll lose all memories

109
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,599
from the past six months.

110
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,229
Besides, we're going to die
by the end of this year anyway.

111
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,398
I hope we can go

112
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,859
without any pain or suffering.

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,695
That's not true.

114
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,450
Dying is just as painful as living.

115
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,412
You know the saying, "Birth, aging,
sickness, death," right?

116
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,416
Life is full of struggles.

117
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,088
Whichever way you turn,
there's suffering, huh?

118
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,008
If both are painful, then why…

119
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,678
do we have to die?

120
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,269
Because we're not needed by this world.

121
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,106
Is it the will of the world?

122
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,783
It's from Ichimatsu.

123
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,243
ICHIMATSU

124
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,202
A video?

125
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,205
The president's office!

126
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,709
VIDEO

127
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,545
<i>The Decision Tree has broken.</i>

128
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,966
<i>The reason is unknown.</i>

129
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,721
Because of it,
we can't run the mission simulation.

130
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,351
The reason the tree broke

131
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,145
is probably

132
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,314
the existence of Ichimatsu and the others.

133
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,233
We will eliminate unplanned factors.

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,945
Meaning Ichimatsu,

135
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,698
Kujo, and Shion.

136
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,742
These three must die.

137
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,830
<i>At the site of the major accident</i>
<i>that will occur…</i>

138
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,917
We will lure the three of them there.

139
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,920
On the day of the accident,

140
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,840
at that time, at that place.

141
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,054
<i>At the Christmas market venue</i>

142
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,765
<i>on December 24th, 2025,</i>

143
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,143
<i>the ceiling LED panels will fall.</i>

144
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,021
PANELS FELL, 34 DEAD

145
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,440
<i>The cause is insufficient bolt strength.</i>

146
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,359
<i>The tragedy will be caused</i>

147
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,402
<i>by slashed equipment costs</i>
<i>and shortened deadlines.</i>

148
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,028
SUPERVISOR APOLOGIES
"WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY"

149
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:54,654
AVOID STATING THE CAUSE CLEARLY

150
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,490
<i>Later, the site supervisor</i>
<i>of the subcontractor</i>

151
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,075
<i>will be condemned across Japan</i>

152
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,452
<i>and end up taking his own life.</i>
<i>A bitter ending.</i>

153
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,995
Are you a criminal?

154
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,622
To that place…

155
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,834
Ichimatsu and the others
will be lured there with a fake email.

156
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,880
The 34 people who are supposed to die

157
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,883
will become 37.

158
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,554
<i>No one will notice the fact</i>

159
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,973
<i>that they were never meant to be there.</i>

160
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,727
With minimal impact on the world,

161
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,604
we can erase them.

162
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,239
DEEP GRATITUDE
OHSUKE

163
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,574
Sorry.

164
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,246
Hey.

165
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,207
Are you really not on Kizashi's side?

166
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,712
We all quit being salarymen.

167
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,589
So, we're nobodies now,

168
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,883
and we're free to do whatever we want.

169
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,552
-Right?
-Yeah.

170
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,137
So, I'll say this.

171
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,641
I think the fastest way is to find
the Kizashi of this era and kill him.

172
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,436
-Kill him, just like that?
-We can't do that.

173
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,106
Kizashi is a person we need.

174
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,066
-Why?
-If we kill him,

175
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,569
someone important to us

176
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,988
will end up unhappy.

177
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,741
-Huh?
-We have our own circumstances, too.

178
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,744
Still, we can't let you guys die.

179
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,372
That's what we discussed.

180
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,458
Well, it's okay.

181
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,711
Our situations are different,
but they're willing to help us.

182
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,507
Fine, but how do we escape this?

183
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,385
This time, we know in advance,
so we can just avoid going there.

184
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,179
But he knows the future.

185
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,264
We don't know what he'll do next.

186
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,310
Meaning, we don't know
when he'll try to kill us.

187
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,483
We've hit our limit
pretending to understand.

188
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,818
We want you to explain.

189
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,405
Got something to write with?

190
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,745
We're currently in the year 2025.

191
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,998
Kizashi is in 2055,

192
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,043
30 years ahead.

193
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,463
This is the original timeline.

194
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,675
Then, if we create

195
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,719
a new junction here

196
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,513
and turn it into Timeline A…

197
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,555
Yeah.

198
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,224
Then Kizashi

199
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,602
becomes Kizashi A.

200
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,522
But Kizashi A

201
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,899
doesn't know the original timeline,

202
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,611
so how would he know what changed

203
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,112
and what didn't?

204
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,782
True.

205
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,908
ORIGINAL TIMELINE
KIZASHI 2055, KIZASHI A

206
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,328
If you keep altering things,

207
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:54,667
you get further and further
from the original.

208
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,214
To the point where you don't understand
anything anymore.

209
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,466
So, the more the world changes,

210
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,636
the more the boss himself changes too.

211
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,306
That's why he leaves records here.

212
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,768
<i>On Kizashi's computer, daily voice logs</i>

213
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,522
<i>and the big data</i>
<i>of the decision tree were stored.</i>

214
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,150
Meaning… Sorry…

215
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,781
The 30 years of data that form

216
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,367
the base of the decision tree…

217
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,285
BIG DATA, ORIGINAL TIMELINE
KIZASHI 2055, KIZASHI A

218
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,912
He stores them not in 2055,

219
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,832
but here, in 2025.

220
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,420
Because if the future changes,

221
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,884
the data left in 2025
still remain untouched.

222
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,219
So…

223
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,890
if he compares the original data

224
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,309
and the data after,

225
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,102
<i>he can find the differences.</i>

226
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,317
So you can verify

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,569
-what changed, right?
-Yeah.

228
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,281
This is getting complicated…

229
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,783
Ohsuke gave up.

230
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,368
Meaning,

231
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,581
whenever the world gets updated,

232
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,334
Kizashi has to check the data

233
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,502
-left in 2025 each time it changes.
-Exactly.

234
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,173
Like a person with amnesia

235
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,382
checking their old diary?

236
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
But even if the world updates,

237
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,014
Kizashi himself may not update.

238
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:37,770
Minor changes might not reach 2055.
Even if they do,

239
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,482
if they don't
directly affect Kizashi's life,

240
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:46,278
Kizashi will remain unchanged.

241
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,949
But if the update reaches Kizashi himself,

242
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,413
-he too will be rewritten.
-Yeah.

243
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:00,459
He may lose memories and become unable
to understand the situation.

244
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,881
Maybe we should pretend Kizashi
tricked us and go along with it.

245
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,678
To the Christmas Market.

246
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,815
<i>That is going to fall,</i>

247
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,984
<i>and 34 people will die.</i>

248
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,988
SPECIAL MISSION

249
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,614
DON'T LET THESE THREE
OUT FROM THE CHRISTMAS MARKET

250
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,122
What will you do going there?

251
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,749
The 34 people who were supposed to die…

252
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,584
We're going to save them all.

253
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,755
Wait a second.
That counts as altering history.

254
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,340
It's changing the future.

255
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,967
Yeah, but still…

256
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,137
If history is altered,

257
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,472
exactly whose viewpoint is that based on?

258
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,559
We're here, right now.

259
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,145
So, for us right here, right now,

260
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,564
what's wrong with changing the present?

261
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,358
It's not tampering with history.

262
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,737
We're creating history from now on.

263
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:11,905
All of us.

264
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,327
Would you like some?

265
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,962
Alright, let's go save them.

266
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,547
Much better than killing them.

267
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,424
We're not exactly heroes, though.

268
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,384
With the strength we have left,
we're just a bit…

269
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,511
Just a bit hero, huh?

270
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,138
-Nice.
-That's it.

271
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,354
Mr. Bee, I'm counting on you.

272
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,647
I'm counting on you.

273
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,952
‎Watch out!

274
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,621
‎Oh no!

275
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,541
Alright, scatter!

276
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,168
Everyone, get out of here.

277
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,301
2055 has been updated.

278
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,555
What?

279
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,353
CALL FROM BUNTA

280
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>Hello. This is Bunta.</i>

281
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,363
<i>How's it looking over there?</i>

282
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,783
<i>Has the future updated?</i>

283
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,701
What are you doing?

284
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,703
We're helping people.

285
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,916
The bees are helping.
They're doing a good job.

286
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,128
Just a small scale, though.

287
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,630
Thanks!

288
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,050
-Ohsuke…
-Run! This way!

289
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,051
Run!

290
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,970
He's probably being seen
as a suspicious person.

291
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,638
Mrs. Enjaku…

292
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,517
is warming up bladders.

293
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,352
-I can't hold it!
-No!

294
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,406
What are you doing?

295
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,205
The 34 people who were
supposed to die here today…

296
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,001
What would happen if they survived?

297
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,127
It's dangerous. Get out!

298
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,754
-Just like how a small bee
-Please hurry!

299
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,549
-can change the fate of the world,
-Hurry! Run!

300
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,385
the world also changes.

301
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
<i>The more people we help,</i>

302
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,980
<i>the more the world shifts.</i>

303
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,526
Each individual life

304
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,071
will eventually reach 2055

305
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,574
and will influence your path.

306
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,381
Bunta?

307
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,258
Yes.

308
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,763
What's today's date?

309
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,515
<i>Yes, the actual coordinates date</i>

310
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,684
<i>is December 24, 2055.</i>

311
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,146
<i>The observed coordinates date</i>
<i>is December 24, 2025.</i>

312
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,065
What am I doing right now?

313
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,151
<i>Carrying out a special mission.</i>

314
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,447
<i>I've restrained the boss.</i>

315
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,658
-Alright, now!
-Okay!

316
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,827
NONAMARE EMPLOYEES, ASSEMBLE!

317
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,247
Nonamare employees, assemble!

318
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,040
Please gather.

319
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,416
-Gather, Nonamare!
-Hurry!

320
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,960
-Please!
-Hurry up and gather!

321
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,294
-Assemble!
-Please!

322
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,213
‎Assemble!

323
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,465
-Assemble!
-Hurry!

324
00:20:59,049 --> 00:20:59,883
Hurry, or it won't end.

325
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,677
Initiate the backup program.

326
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,888
<i>Starting backup of Holo Link Communicator.</i>

327
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,560
We are your seniors!

328
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,229
-Seniors?
-Good work on your missions!

329
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,064
-Good work!
-Good work!

330
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,359
Currently,
we can't reach President Kizashi,

331
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,902
so we'll inform you on his behalf.

332
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,905
The special mission for today
has been canceled.

333
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,781
-Canceled?
-What?

334
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,994
Also, E-capsules are bad for your health.

335
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,162
If you keep taking them,
you'll vomit blood and die.

336
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,247
-Blood?
-Huh?

337
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,332
-What?
-Blood?

338
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,501
-That's all! Dismissed!
-Good work, everyone.

339
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,461
-Go home.
-Good work, everyone.

340
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338
-Good work!
-Good work!

341
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,965
-Go home.
-Good work.

342
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,842
Good work!

343
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,012
Alright, now it's our turn.

344
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,434
<i>Backup is complete.</i>

345
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,769
<i>Memory save is successful.</i>

346
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,653
This past year
has been a year of trial and error.

347
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,323
I've taken measures
against loss of consciousness.

348
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,699
Too bad, though.

349
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
Why are you interfering?

350
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,413
Is it okay for Shiki to die?

351
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,125
The trigger installed in Shiki
may not necessarily activate.

352
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,502
That's why I've been changing the world!

353
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:23,091
Then this will be our last resort as well.

354
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,263
I've called the real you, Fumito, here.

355
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,685
Why?

356
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,355
You will change.

357
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,775
To save Shiki.

358
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,156
We've already run
simulations involving me!

359
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,575
After a trillion attempts…

360
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,077
After a quadrillion attempts…

361
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,079
I couldn't prevent Shiki's death!

362
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,247
That was in the previous simulations!

363
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,085
We will save 34 people.

364
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,420
That was not part of the plan.

365
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,510
The world keeps changing.

366
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,971
There must still be countless things
we haven't tried!

367
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,850
We're going to change it.

368
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,811
Together,

369
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,813
you and us.

370
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,110
<i>‎Special music time on this holy night!</i>

371
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,195
<i>Please enjoy this song</i>
<i>with your loved ones.</i>

372
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,282
Oh no!

373
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,539
With this, our voices won't reach them!

374
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,623
What?

375
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,002
Hurry and run!

376
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,420
-Come on!
-Hurry!

377
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,214
-Hurry and run!
-Come on!

378
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,799
You'll die!

379
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,551
-Watch out!
-Look out! It's falling!

380
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,177
-It'll fall from above!
-Fall from above!

381
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,679
-It will fall! Hey!
-It's dangerous!

382
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,931
-Watch out!
-Excuse me! Please!

383
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,808
-It'll fall from above!
-Fall from above!

384
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,768
-It'll fall from above!
-Watch out!

385
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,145
-Look up!
-Watch out!

386
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,403
It's no use!

387
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,571
‎Wait!

388
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,573
Even if you let people out,
people keep coming in.

389
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,283
The music is so loud!

390
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,785
Mrs. Enjyaku,
can you concentrate and kill the sound?

391
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,496
No, not a big place like this!

392
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,583
For this kind
of frequency resonance effect…

393
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,669
you'll need a sonic resonance detonation.

394
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,594
Bunty.

395
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,738
I see.

396
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,616
You were just an image, weren't you?

397
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,202
Shiki…

398
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,747
-Why…
-You

399
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,583
were eating croquettes in the cafeteria.

400
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,171
Then I followed you and came here.

401
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,382
You followed Fumito?

402
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,134
Yeah.

403
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,055
I started to hate you.

404
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,851
I hated that I couldn't forget you.

405
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,608
I hated myself

406
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,360
for loving you.

407
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,323
So…

408
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,868
I decided to kill both of you.

409
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,126
Did the tree break…

410
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,588
because of Shiki?

411
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,309
Bunty.

412
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,022
I didn't take the capsules.

413
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,992
Shiki…

414
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,589
Stop! Shiki!

415
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,930
Why?

416
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,351
Bunty is a useless person, right?

417
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,981
The ten million people
who were supposed to die in my place…

418
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,152
were supposed to exist,
but now they don't?

419
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,447
Why?

420
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,449
Who decides that?

421
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,285
Do you decide?

422
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,287
Shiki…

423
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,123
I…

424
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,793
I exist.

425
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,047
You exist.

426
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,178
Why are you here?

427
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,183
Why are you alive?

428
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
That's something…

429
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,616
I've been thinking about…

430
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,039
for the past 20 years.

431
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,376
Why…

432
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,128
do I exist?

433
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,341
Why life continues?

434
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,804
I don't know…

435
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,431
Even now…

436
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,564
You also don't know, right?

437
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,158
I'm sorry…

438
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,703
for dying before you.

439
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,493
I'll end this.

440
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:07,829
Shiki…

441
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,708
Shiki…

442
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,217
Shiki!

443
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,887
Shiki…

444
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,734
Go, Kujo!

445
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:40,945
Mrs. Enjaku!

446
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,501
Y-Yes!

447
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,212
-Shion!
-Watch out!

448
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
Look! Above!

449
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,175
-What's happening?
-Let's run!

450
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,221
Why did you save me again?

451
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,890
Everyone, run!

452
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,231
Oh, wait!

453
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,573
-Shiki and the boss…
-No way?

454
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,908
-Um…
-Fumito?

455
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,828
Shiki…

456
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,955
I think she's gonna die with Kizashi.

457
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,170
Hey!

458
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,036
Let's stop this.

459
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,129
I have no choice.

460
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,429
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

461
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,185
We're the ones who have to die!

462
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,478
<i>I'm scared.</i>

463
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,568
The only ones
the world doesn't need are us.

464
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:49,324
The world doesn't judge anyone.

465
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm going to die in ten years. Then--

466
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,244
Ten years are irreplaceable!

467
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,042
For me, these six months
have felt like a lifetime.

468
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,798
Even if memories fade,

469
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,384
and even if one dies,

470
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,346
love remains.

471
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:17,810
I never said it seriously before…

472
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,317
But I love you.

473
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,197
I love you.

474
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,784
I will love the Shiki

475
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,787
who exists in this world.

476
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,300
Bunta!

477
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,722
Bunty!

478
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,716
The world is continuous.

479
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,928
We can build on the past,

480
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,098
but cannot change it.

481
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,268
What we can change

482
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,438
is the present, the here and now.

483
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,482
We can shape the future,

484
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,528
not the past.

485
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,573
Leave it to them.

486
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,870
From where… did you come from?

487
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,330
Data can be sent

488
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:06,002
to 2025 from 2055.

489
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,172
Next is 2070.

490
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,759
I will be there.

491
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,263
If Kizashi is a butterfly,

492
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,390
I'm…

493
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,393
a caterpillar.

494
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,981
I've become an old geezer.

495
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,992
In 2070,

496
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,329
are you…

497
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,123
alone?

498
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,209
Or…

499
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,135
It's a meaningless question, huh?

500
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,889
Every moment

501
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,559
is always connected.

502
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,354
You too.

503
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,023
Me too.

504
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,199
Fumito too.

505
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,135
-Call an ambulance!
-Someone!

506
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,052
Call an ambulance!

507
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,181
‎Are you okay?

508
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,391
‎Someone!

509
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:44,118
<i>Next up. Last December 24th,</i>

510
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,621
<i>at a Christmas market event,</i>

511
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,248
<i>an LED panel installed</i>

512
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,334
<i>on the ceiling fell.</i>

513
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,129
<i>Many visitors were present,</i>

514
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,839
<i>and there was a temporary panic.</i>

515
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:59,967
-Hello.
-<i>The supervisor</i>

516
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,510
-Hello.
-<i>of the event</i>

517
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,055
<i>has accepted an interview.</i>

518
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,557
<i>I would like to apologize…</i>

519
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,769
It seems they still haven't found
the person who got trapped underneath.

520
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,812
-<i>…for this incident.</i>
-Yes.

521
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,150
It's kind of like a ghost story,
which is a bit interesting.

522
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,947
<i>It was my responsibility for continuing</i>
<i>the event, despite all these factors.</i>

523
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,617
Sorry, that was insensitive.
I don't really remember.

524
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,079
‎So that it won't occur again…

525
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,372
I also don't remember

526
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,291
why I was there.

527
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,711
<i>It was considered a miracle</i>
<i>that no one died in this accident.</i>

528
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,840
-Why <i>takoyaki</i>?
-I got them.

529
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,679
Oh, right. I'm thinking
of changing my career path.

530
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,846
Change?

531
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,390
Wouldn't that be bad?

532
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,518
You're gonna make
E-capsules in the future.

533
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,146
Even if I don't make them,
someone else will.

534
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,023
It's the law of completion.

535
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,568
So, I will make a medicine
that stops the side effects

536
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,113
of the E-capsules.

537
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,575
I should be able to do it
in 30 years, right?

538
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,830
Maybe even Yanagi will rest easier.

539
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,501
Hey, how about "I"?

540
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,379
He came by once,

541
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,174
in the middle
of the Christmas Eve commotion.

542
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,594
"Sorry for watching.

543
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't worry about me. Do as you like.

544
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,517
P.S. Take care of your girlfriend,
or you'll regret it."

545
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,270
-He's really watching you, huh?
-"Or you'll regret it," it says.

546
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,106
Actually…

547
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,317
I got dumped.

548
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,321
I didn't contact her on Christmas Eve,

549
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,157
so, of course,
she'd suspect me and dump me.

550
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,910
I might get a girlfriend soon.

551
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,912
-Huh?
-What?

552
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,998
Hey! You serious?

553
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,042
I said I might!

554
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,877
-You might?
-Not yet.

555
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,171
-Are things going well with her?
-Well, yeah…

556
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,798
-Yeah, I guess…
-Which is it?

557
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,970
In my case, I have no memory
of the past six months.

558
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,598
-That much?
-Yeah.

559
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,811
When I woke up, I was living alone
on the second floor of a <i>takoyaki</i> shop.

560
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:16,979
By myself.

561
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,150
Well, since I'm single,
it makes sense that I'm alone.

562
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,319
TAKKOPI

563
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,451
TOOTHPASTE

564
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,418
NO PHOTOS

565
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,257
<i>It felt strangely spacious.</i>

566
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,929
<i>I wondered if I had</i>
<i>really been living there.</i>

567
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,357
<i>But…</i>

568
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,318
<i>it felt nostalgic as well.</i>

569
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,575
<i>I loved it.</i>

570
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,203
But

571
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,498
I don't know exactly what I loved, though.

572
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,793
That's just how I felt.

573
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,512
That bee…

574
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,892
I don't remember when I bought this,

575
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,687
but I like it.

576
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,774
Actually, I just dropped
my smartphone a moment ago.

577
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,484
Oh no.

578
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,403
I thought it was lost, but it turned up.

579
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,280
A cleaning staff picked it up.

580
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,869
<i>It was definitely my phone,</i>

581
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,328
but something was different.

582
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,791
There was a strap on it
that I had never seen.

583
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,336
Bunty…

584
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,262
Bunty?

585
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:15,848
Um…

586
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,061
My name is Fumito.

587
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,732
The kanji is "Bun."

588
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,193
So, I was called "Bunty" when I was a kid.

589
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,656
So, I thought you were calling me.

590
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:34,783
Bunty.

591
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,494
Yes.

592
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,631
By the way… What's your name?

593
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,259
-Shiki.
-Shiki?

594
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,436
Sorry to keep you waiting.

595
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,189
Thanks for waiting.

596
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,526
-Mission complete.
-Yeah!

597
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,611
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

598
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:16,158
Bit five minus five!

599
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,619
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

600
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,662
Yes!

601
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,248
That took a while.

602
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,833
Shiki and Fumito's Lovey-Dovey Operation.

603
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,793
There it is.

604
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,420
Stop naming the mission that.

605
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,964
Self-deprecating isn't good.

606
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,634
What do you think, Sasuke?

607
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,511
Oh!

608
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,471
Don't step on my foot.

609
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,890
-Be gentle.
-He said, "Please."

610
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,394
You don't have
that Esper power anymore, right?

611
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,187
But he knows the word "please,"

612
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,648
so even without the Esper power,
it doesn't change much.

613
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,317
We were just a bit Espers to begin with.

614
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,319
It was convenient, though.

615
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,071
But you'll bleed again.

616
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:55,239
I'm still bleeding a bit.

617
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,409
From the eyes, nose, ears…

618
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,244
-Huh?
-You okay?

619
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,705
-Eat some liver.
-Yeah.

620
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:09,295
We all survived 2025

621
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,089
by defeating the law of completion.

622
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,175
From now on,

623
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,677
let's cling persistently and steadily.

624
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,845
Yeah.

625
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,806
Let's make flowers bloom in the world!

626
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,435
-Living is our mission, right?
-Yeah.

627
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:28,188
If we keep living,
the shape of the future will change.

628
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,273
Yeah.

629
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,777
That will save Shiki, the world,

630
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,280
and us.

631
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:39,617
Right, Sasuke?

632
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,118
Alright.

633
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,704
-Yes.
-Okay.

634
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,831
Let's go, Sasuke.

635
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,983
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
