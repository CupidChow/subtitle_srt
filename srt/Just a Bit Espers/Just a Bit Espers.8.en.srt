‎Today's record. Actual coordinates.

00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,802
‎February 10th 2055

00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:14,180
‎Observer coordinates. February 10th 2025.

4
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,811
The Holo Link Communicator

5
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:23,356
I had them build
in this era is finally complete.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,192
My body,

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,236
eyes, and ears…

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,613
I finally obtained it.

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,825
A 120-degree field of view.

10
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,202
Not too inconvenient.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,207
I cannot touch anything,

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,585
but I can make it look like I'm sitting.

13
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,131
Everything I perceive
through the Holo Link Communicator

14
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,092
is sent back to me in 2055.

15
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,428
And then…

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,682
I finally saw her.

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,977
With my own eyes.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,647
Shiki in 2025.

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,195
Shiki… Alive.

20
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,657
Let's reinstall it again.

21
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,284
If I drink it…

22
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,286
I'll forget the last six months?

23
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,789
Yes, and everything
will go back to normal.

24
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,251
Okay.

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,797
Goodbye.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,720
Bunty is Bunta.

27
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,350
My Bunty is Bunta! Not you.

28
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,064
I'm surprised.

29
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,442
This can't be happening…

30
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,695
It's the perfect opportunity.

31
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,948
Let's talk about Nonamare.

32
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,325
All of you

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,661
were chosen by me.

34
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,621
Under what conditions?

35
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,874
That is to be outside the decision tree.

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,419
Whether you exist or not
doesn't change anything.

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,339
If I hadn't given you E-Capsules,

38
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,385
all of you would have died this year.

39
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,930
Non amare.

40
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,392
You must not love.

41
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,229
Because none of you…

42
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,483
were needed.

43
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,703
Ohsuke, I'm firing you.

44
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,498
Mrs. Enjaku and Hanzo.

45
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,375
You two are fired as well.

46
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,004
You kept failing to report things,

47
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,589
and you abandoned your mission.

48
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,258
Thank you for your service.

49
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,887
Vacate your housing by tomorrow.

50
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:03,433
Go wherever you please.

51
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,145
Bunta,

52
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,814
come to Nonamare tomorrow.

53
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,205
Bunty, you don't have to go.

54
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,959
Everyone, don't worry about it.

55
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,797
You're all important.
You're not unnecessary!

56
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,558
Ohsuke!

57
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,685
Oh!

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,728
-Ohsuke!
-You okay?

59
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,897
It's nothing.

60
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,900
-Ohsuke!
-Ohsuke!

61
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,318
-Hey!
-Come on! Ohsuke!

62
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,111
-Ohsuke!
-You okay?

63
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,322
-Ohsuke!
-Hey!

64
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,617
Here.

65
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,869
Got it. Thanks.

66
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,625
Sasuke says Ohsuke has a strange smell.

67
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,045
He says we all have it,

68
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,422
but Ohsuke's is the strongest,

69
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,091
then Mrs. Enjaku,

70
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,261
then me, then Bunta.

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,931
Shiki-san only has a faint trace of it.

72
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,308
It's the order we became Espers.

73
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,066
Is it because of these?

74
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,988
Side effects.

75
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,993
Yes.

76
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,453
It's possible.

77
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,959
The E-Capsules are not
approved yet in the future.

78
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,672
Everyone who became an Esper

79
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,216
before us died.

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,220
-Why?
-Did you hear that from Kujo?

81
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,888
I'm asking you.

82
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,851
Did they die from the E-Capsules?

83
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,816
True. All first-generation Espers

84
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,943
have died.

85
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,697
We didn't know
the proper dosage back then.

86
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,367
There might have been issues
with the compounds we used.

87
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,996
You knew it was dangerous

88
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,416
and still made us take them?

89
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,377
People who were going to die anyway…

90
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,923
died from side effects.

91
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,468
Why be angry?

92
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,199
I'm returning this.

93
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,076
And also this.

94
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,290
RESIGNATION LETTER

95
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,750
My resignation letter.

96
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,087
Not that you can touch it.

97
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,258
Please complete the mission.

98
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,847
Only you can do it.

99
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,232
I'm not doing it!

100
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,483
You will.

101
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,655
Just as I have no choice
but to rewrite the past,

102
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,074
you also have no choice.

103
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,244
You must complete this mission.

104
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,134
Were you okay? Did you quit?

105
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,055
You won't have to see him again?

106
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,269
Good.

107
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,272
Let's go home.

108
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,201
Takoyaki.

109
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,956
I really want takoyaki.

110
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,822
Please take care of them for a while.

111
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,616
ANIMAL DAYCARE

112
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,827
I'll come back for you.

113
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,496
Be good, okay?

114
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,497
I'm counting on you.

115
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,416
It's okay. I'll be okay.

116
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,223
Mrs. Enjaku,

117
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,601
do you really not want to stay with us?

118
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,982
That house was prepared
by President Kizashi.

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,318
I don't want to owe him anything.

120
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,114
Bunta taught me how to stay

121
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
at an internet café, so I'll be fine.

122
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,419
What am I…

123
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,841
supposed to live for now?

124
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,642
I remembered something.

125
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,810
CLOSED FOR BUSINESS
PLEASE TAKE FREELY - FLOWER SAKURAYA

126
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,481
The reason why I'm able to bloom flowers.

127
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,486
A child's eyes are beautiful, right?

128
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,740
Untouched by anything dirty.

129
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,035
They're so clear, they almost appear blue.

130
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,331
I wished that the world he saw
was something beautiful.

131
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,667
So, I wanted to show him…

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,003
beautiful things.

133
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,589
That's why…

134
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,967
I became an Esper who makes flowers bloom.

135
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,848
But I was wrong.

136
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,813
At the root,
I'm an Esper who might kill people.

137
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,024
That's what I am.

138
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,863
I scared Shion.

139
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,073
I made him hate me.

140
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,495
Who needs

141
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,374
someone like that

142
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,337
as a father?

143
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,388
I lectured Shion.

144
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,183
I told him to stop using his esper powers,
and to stop messing around.

145
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,102
When I told him

146
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,064
"I" disappeared again because of him,

147
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,274
he was totally crushed.

148
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,611
I regret saying too much.

149
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,280
It's a good lesson for a kid, right?

150
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,826
"I" is still gone?

151
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,039
Am I really going to die?

152
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,502
You'll be fine.

153
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,796
You lived

154
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,507
until 2055 once already.

155
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,051
You're not dying that easily.

156
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,974
This world has something like inertia.

157
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,814
I know about inertia,
but why does that matter now?

158
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,317
Altering history always causes pushback.

159
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,237
The world tries to return

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,448
to its original path.

161
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,242
It's a theory.

162
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:47,998
So you won't die that easily. Relax.

163
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,004
First, stop taking the E-Capsules.

164
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,801
I'm healing, and I told Shion
to stop taking them, too.

165
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,348
So, Yanagi and the others didn't die
from someone's Esper attack,

166
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,809
but from the side effects
of the E-capsule?

167
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,728
Yeah. Kizashi admitted it.

168
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,941
But Kizashi brought the recipe
for the E-capsules and had them made.

169
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,068
He basically killed them, right?

170
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,114
He only realized the side effects

171
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,824
after they died.

172
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,034
He didn't intend to kill them.

173
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,664
Even if that's true for Yanagi,

174
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,666
what about you guys?

175
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,837
He knew you could die
and still made you take them.

176
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,965
Why defend him?

177
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,386
Because now I understand

178
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,222
what "saving the world" means.

179
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,686
Anyway, that's how it is.

180
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,902
This case belonged to Yanagi,

181
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,780
but Nonamare
came to my company looking for it.

182
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,201
They didn't check my house,

183
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,369
but they might show up again.

184
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,454
Why not throw it away?

185
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,082
I can't do that.
We haven't solved anything.

186
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,126
What's this memo?

187
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,420
Notes left by the dead Espers.

188
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,965
Passwords for the CEO's office and such.

189
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,383
Why would they have that?

190
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,262
Because they prepared the office
and computers as part of their missions.

191
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,854
Maybe I should sneak in
when Kizashi goes out.

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,440
Even if he goes out,

193
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,068
he's a hologram after all.

194
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,070
He's invincible, huh?

195
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,489
He has no physical form,
so none of our powers work on him.

196
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,752
Hey, Bunty. How about this?

197
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,053
They won't find it in here.

198
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,556
Hidden in plain sight.

199
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,730
Hey, Bunty.

200
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,067
Should we move?

201
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,614
I like this place,

202
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,075
but I don't want to stay here anymore.

203
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,705
Is that bad?

204
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,709
No. Let's do it.

205
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,336
What kind of place do you want?

206
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,009
Big windows and a big living room
where everyone can come over.

207
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,554
Let's go to a realtor on my next day off.

208
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,101
There's somewhere I want to take you
on your next day off.

209
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,604
Where?

210
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,398
Enoshima.

211
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,485
You always wanted to go, right?

212
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,864
You planned out the route from Kamakura

213
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,867
and chose where to visit and where to eat.

214
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,454
You made a schedule of the places

215
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,539
you wanted to re-visit again.

216
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,960
That was…

217
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,299
That was?

218
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,094
A mistake.

219
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,349
It was a memory from the future.

220
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,143
It wasn't my memory with you.

221
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,647
So, I don't want to go there anymore.

222
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,984
Let's go.

223
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,736
Let's go

224
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,614
and overwrite those memories.

225
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,668
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

226
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,091
-This is Jojuji Temple.
-Jojuji, huh?

227
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,260
What a nice temple.

228
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,485
-Look, squirrels.
-There are squirrels.

229
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,073
TEMPLE

230
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,097
It made me really happy.

231
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,060
When you said,
"Let's overwrite the memories."

232
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,440
It's weird, huh?

233
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,109
Being swayed by memories of the future…

234
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,030
Exactly. Let's paint over them
in one swoosh.

235
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,532
-In one swoosh?
-Yeah.

236
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,783
In one swoosh!

237
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,076
In one swoosh, right?

238
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,666
Oh…

239
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,004
-Sorry. One moment.
-Yes.

240
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,966
It's cute, huh?

241
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,678
2025 NEW WHITEBAIT RICE BOWL KEYCHAIN

242
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,143
Enjoy your meal.

243
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,729
Looks so good.

244
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,857
So many tiny lives…

245
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,818
Let's dig in and eat them all.

246
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,570
Brutal.

247
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,160
-Fresh. Really good.
-So good.

248
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,094
‎You came all the way here,
‎so you should get whitebait.

249
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,680
-Whoa, they're transparent.
-Want some?

250
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,100
Here you go.

251
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,142
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

252
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,856
2026 POPULAR WHITEBAIT RICE BOWL KEYCHAIN

253
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
Cute.

254
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,776
Want to get matching ones?

255
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,869
-So cute.
-Yeah.

256
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,704
-How is it?
-How is it?

257
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,064
The place has a nice vibe,

258
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,733
but it's too big to use.

259
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,735
Unless we were opening a shop…

260
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,699
It's perfect! I really love it here.

261
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,369
We could watch the moon in autumn.

262
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,917
-Here, Bunty.
-Yes.

263
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,419
-Here.
-Thanks.

264
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,503
Okay.

265
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,714
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

266
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,181
-Oh!
-Oh no!

267
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,141
-I think it likes me!
-What?

268
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,231
I've never made takoyaki
without octopus before.

269
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,733
The look of octopus is just too much.

270
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:55,569
Hey, is it still takoyaki without octopus?

271
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,863
An identity crisis.

272
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,616
-This is no-identity takoyaki.
-Big Bang.

273
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,161
The expanding universe
eventually collapses.

274
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,331
-Boom.
-Boom.

275
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,625
It's hot!

276
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,795
Bunty, look.

277
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,174
My dad sent me this. Isn't it awful?

278
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,386
Does that mean we end at 25 years?

279
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,068
‎-So cute.
‎-So cute.

280
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,830
Forty-six, 47,

281
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,458
48,

282
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,085
49,

283
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,504
50.

284
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,091
-Okay?
-It's really nice.

285
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,013
After 51 years,

286
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,140
it depends on our stamina and health.

287
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,601
How long can we live?

288
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,647
Not confident.

289
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,151
I feel like I can.

290
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,239
With you, Bunty, I could go on forever.

291
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,032
Eternity.

292
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,409
Always.

293
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,995
Then,

294
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,289
let's aim for eternity.

295
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,749
Aim for it?

296
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,710
A fleeting kiss.

297
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,096
No.

298
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,045
-Go! Bunty, go!
-You go, Shiki!

299
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,282
Drink this.

300
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,496
If you drink it, you'll lose
these six months of memories.

301
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,875
You can start over completely clean.

302
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,463
Is that his order?

303
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,634
It's my mission for today.

304
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,221
Seriously?

305
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,516
Yes.

306
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,523
I chose you, you know?

307
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,403
Shiki-san…

308
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,199
don't lie.

309
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,994
Your heart's easy to read,

310
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,373
even without touching it.

311
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,754
-Shiki-san…
-Stop calling me Shiki-san!

312
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,840
You also…

313
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,427
You also…

314
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,721
stopped calling me

315
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,016
Bunty from earlier today.

316
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,487
Your Bunty…

317
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:10,824
isn't me.

318
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,579
Bunty!

319
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:20,375
Bunty!

320
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,086
I'm right here.

321
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:49,029
Just as I must rewrite the past,

322
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,908
you must complete this mission.

323
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,580
There's a sight

324
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,124
I cannot forget.

325
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,835
A moment burned into me forever.

326
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,229
Bunty?

327
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,778
I'm glad…

328
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,030
you're alive.

329
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,122
Shiki…

330
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,043
What happened?

331
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,896
Shiki?

332
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,067
Shiki!

333
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,085
Shiki?

334
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,549
Shiki!

335
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,852
After that…

336
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,023
the memory never fades.

337
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,527
It is burned into me and never goes away.

338
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,572
Shiki's…

339
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,075
final form…

340
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,497
When I learned I could access the past,

341
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,000
I felt salvation.

342
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,545
For 20 years,

343
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,757
I was empty…

344
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,885
barely breathing.

345
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,098
If I could rewrite that moment,

346
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,559
that instant…

347
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,562
If I could…

348
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,398
bring Shiki back…

349
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,195
First, I reached out to an investor.

350
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,491
I gave him a little information
about the future

351
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,992
and let him build wealth.

352
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,038
With that money,

353
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,500
I hired engineers and researchers.

354
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,544
I had them create things
this era did not have.

355
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,881
The Holo Link Communicator,

356
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,175
the Nano Receptor,

357
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,427
and the E-Capsules.

358
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,265
E-Capsules
are perfect for controlling people.

359
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,977
People are drawn to unknown power.

360
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,231
Once they have power, they will use it.

361
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,526
They take the chance
when they begin to believe

362
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,403
they are saving the world.

363
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,279
That's fine.

364
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,198
Mission after mission,

365
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,117
the world changes.

366
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,286
Change it into the correct shape.

367
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,331
The world didn't save Shiki.

368
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,501
So, I will.

369
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,962
I will save Shiki's world.

370
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,797
And save my world.

371
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,466
Even if 10,000 people die,

372
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,428
even if a million die,
even if ten million die,

373
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
so what?

374
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,521
But the world won't change so easily.

375
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,857
A resistance to interference

376
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,359
from the future appeared.

377
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,194
As if the world itself were pushing back.

378
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,030
I wonder if I'll make it in time.

379
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,495
As a safety measure, I decided to attempt

380
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,915
memory installation, as my last resort.

381
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,296
I'll use Shiki's stored brain data

382
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,132
and install her future memories

383
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,635
into Shiki of 2025.

384
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,347
I'll plant a trigger inside her.

385
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,810
To put her far away
from that horrific end.

386
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,315
So she won't choose the junction

387
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,776
that leads to that horrific end.

388
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,741
Like an angel putting its hand

389
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,993
on her shoulder.

390
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,497
When the moment comes,

391
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,832
it will whisper to her, "Not that way."

392
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,959
That system…

393
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,338
is the trigger inside her memory.

394
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,051
Give this…

395
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,013
to Shiki.

396
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,978
I know…

397
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,233
you will for sure…

398
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,945
carry out the mission.

399
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,617
Because…

400
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,329
you love Shiki too.

401
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,175
I'll leave here.

402
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,479
When you enter the house, drink this.

403
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,858
It will begin reinstalling your memories.

404
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,155
I don't want to drink it.

405
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,077
Don't be selfish.

406
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,747
How long do I have to look after you?

407
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,585
Work or not,

408
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,337
it's a burden.

409
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,007
You're a burden.

410
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,385
You are too much.

411
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,847
You were too high-maintenance.

412
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,227
This mission was too much for me too.

413
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,734
Thank you for everything.

414
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,160
Everything will disappear.

415
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,082
I'll forget you.

416
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,589
I love you.

417
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,010
And you love me, don't you?

418
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,647
I can't hear your thoughts anymore.

419
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,608
I stopped taking the medicine.

420
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,445
Goodbye.

421
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,048
Shiki and Kizashi,

422
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,552
stop deciding how I should feel.

423
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,767
No one loves anyone…

424
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,327
Mission complete!

425
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,442
What are you talking about?

426
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,445
I'm not dying.

427
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,241
I promised I wouldn't leave you.

428
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,039
Everyone? Everyone won't die either.

429
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:09,338
A text! Look, she's doing fine!

430
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,841
ENJAKU

431
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,720
I'LL SEND THE COMMEMORATIVE PHOTO

432
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,603
What?

433
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:26,105
Mrs. Enjaku,
you're not at an internet café?

434
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,735
It all felt like a dream, huh?

435
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,904
What?

436
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,865
I thought I wanted to die
as soon as possible.

437
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,744
But somewhere along the way,
I started thinking

438
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,913
maybe the world needs me.

439
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,833
Heroes are a sweet dream.

440
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,504
But all lies.

441
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,550
In the end, it's poison
that eats away your body.

442
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,224
I thought about it

443
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,060
every day in prison.

444
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,607
The man who ruined my life…

445
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,567
YUKI

446
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,277
I want to shove his head

447
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,447
into a microwave

448
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,157
and press start!

449
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,452
TODAY'S MISSION
MISSION 161

450
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,622
BRING ICIHMATSU

451
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,633
Ichimatsu.

452
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,888
What? Hey!

453
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,066
Somebody!

454
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,736
Somebody help!

455
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,656
Somebody help!

456
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,789
Nice to meet you.
Dr. Ichimatsu, in your younger days.

457
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,877
You are Kizashi?

458
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,378
Yes.

459
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,261
Why do you guys interfere?

460
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,598
Because you stole the recipe,

461
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,851
my future self almost gets killed!

462
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,163
I want to make a deal with you.

463
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,042
In 2055,

464
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,378
I will turn myself in.

465
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,841
If I do that, your death sentence is gone.

466
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:00,843
You walk free.

467
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,056
What is the catch?

468
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,891
You back off now.

469
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,103
No more interference.
Do not get in my way.

470
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,283
Because of your interference,

471
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,410
my schedule is slipping.

472
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,456
-Schedule?
-Change the world.

473
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,417
My plan.

474
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,880
Why do you want to kill

475
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,840
ten million people?

476
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,718
I do not want to kill them.

477
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,889
But if the world is set into
the correct shape, that is what happens.

478
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,683
Correct shape?

479
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,936
There is someone I want to save.

480
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,815
That person died?

481
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,026
Yes. Ten years from now.

482
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,950
If I could die in her place
and save her, I would.

483
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:09,745
If I die, she ends up
living an unhappy life.

484
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,125
That is what the simulations showed.

485
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,877
Even after trying a trillion ways,

486
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,796
even ten quadrillion ways, it failed.

487
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,675
Even so, you cannot let ten million
people die who were not meant to die.

488
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,219
Is the problem
that the number is too large?

489
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,512
The fewer, the better?

490
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,101
You think it's wrong for a nation to fall,
but fine if a small country disappears?

491
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,478
Even one person
in a small country has a life.

492
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,355
That is a cheap argument

493
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,859
from someone
trying to erase ten million lives.

494
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,988
You say you will turn yourself in,

495
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,531
but if you succeed in rewriting the past,

496
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,241
the current you will vanish, right?

497
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,579
And if she lives in the future,

498
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,332
you are never born, right?

499
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,128
As expected of you, Dr. Ichimatsu.

500
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,339
So, you never planned to turn yourself in!

501
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,633
Think one step further.

502
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,428
If the world is corrected,

503
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,223
the version of me who tries
to rewrite the past is never born.

504
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,393
That means the future
where the E-Capsule recipe is stolen

505
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,438
also disappears,
and you guys are never framed.

506
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,023
Everything is resolved.

507
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,025
-Resolved?
-Yes.

508
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:23,486
What about me?

509
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:28,908
Even if the future changes,
the me here right now does not change.

510
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,660
-So?
-I'm…

511
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,123
Then I am stuck believing ten million
people died because I failed to stop you!

512
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,419
You are thinking too seriously.

513
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,381
-Try to be more relaxed.
-I am not that kind of person!

514
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,008
I obsess and regret forever,

515
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,094
and my hands sweat nonstop every time!

516
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,597
If ten million die,

517
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,349
I will be drenched for life!

518
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,270
I cannot accept your deal.

519
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,359
I cannot say ten million deaths are okay.

520
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,903
I cannot say that.

521
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,742
You're foolish.

522
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,997
Go ahead

523
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,708
and regret that choice again.

524
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,968
What should I do with this?

525
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,512
Hey!

526
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,702
Thanks.

527
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,912
Why are you here?

528
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,250
Sorry.

529
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,524
Shiki. What happened?

530
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,071
It's burning. It hurts.

531
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,699
My stomach is burning.

532
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,577
Hot. It hurts.

533
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,788
No way.

534
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,209
I cannot feel anything.

535
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,673
Shiki!

536
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,383
Shiki!

537
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,344
Shiki!

538
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,596
I want to go home.

539
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,270
Right.

540
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,232
I died.

541
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,278
I am going to die…

542
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,968
Not so high.

543
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,848
With inertia, will it work?

544
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,285
What's going on?

545
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,945
‎Bunty and Bunty.

546
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,281
‎I'll kill them both.

547
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,284
‎To die is as hard as to be able to do it.

548
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,704
‎Alright, should we save the day?

549
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:26,997
‎Just a bit hero, okay?

550
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,915
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
