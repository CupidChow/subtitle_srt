1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,340
The bees are flying

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,719
Wild roses are blooming

3
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,472
Around the pond

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,434
‎The wild roses are blooming

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:18,977
-How are you feeling?
-Huh?

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,770
Since the fever.

7
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,898
Not feeling sick?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,694
Not at all. Thanks for asking.

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,988
Shiki accidentally took

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,950
an E-capsule.

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,874
What?

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,084
Where did you store it?

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,627
On the top shelf above the sink.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,048
My ex-wife couldn't reach there
because she was short.

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,845
So, I just kept it there.

16
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,142
It seems Shiki ran out of cold medicine

17
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,352
and mistook the capsules for it.

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,689
Just a bit of a hero, Just…

19
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,358
It wasn't like

20
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,110
I could make her throw it up afterward.

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,948
You don't have to look at me like that.

22
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,366
So, you had a wife?

23
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,452
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,414
Anyway, about the E-capsule…

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,001
We should probably report it…

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,755
to the boss, right?

27
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,133
We just got scolded last time.

28
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,219
He didn't have to get that angry, right?

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,845
ONLINE NEWS

30
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:36,846
CLOSE CALL AT THE FESTIVAL!

31
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,889
WHO ARE THE THREE HEROES
WHO PREDICTED THE EXPLOSION?

32
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,142
The rule of Nonamare is…

33
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,312
Our identities must never be revealed!

34
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,273
Technically, they didn't, right?

35
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,233
Ohsuke!

36
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,986
Maybe not this time.

37
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,034
But a moment's carelessness
could cause disaster.

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:01:59,828
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

39
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,329
Um…

40
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,039
May I ask a question?

41
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,040
Go ahead.

42
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,253
I understand why we hide our powers,

43
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,423
but helping people isn't wrong, is it?

44
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,635
You are only "just a bit" of a hero.

45
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:19,139
Your powers aren't great enough
to make you true heroes.

46
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,101
You're just slightly
above ordinary humans.

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,354
Those few fragile hairs on your head

48
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:31,151
can make you think you're a mighty hero
once people start praising you!

49
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,821
Craving fame

50
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,448
leads only to ruin.

51
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,661
Sometimes, even if
someone takes an E-capsule,

52
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,038
it doesn't activate their ability.

53
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,876
Maybe just wait and see.
If nothing happens, then that's that.

54
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,085
-True.
-Right?

55
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,089
Noticed anything strange lately?

56
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,133
Strange?

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,802
Like a change in your body

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,680
or being able to do something
you couldn't before.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,474
There is.

60
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,561
A sixth sense.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,521
A sixth sense?

62
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,314
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,482
I feel like someone is there.

64
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,362
Like someone's always watching me.

65
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,198
I can sense spirits.

66
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,576
Cursed ones too.

67
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,705
That's what you saw
on TV last night, right?

68
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,497
PARANORMAL TV SHOW

69
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,379
Yes, you're right.

70
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
If, for example,

71
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,721
you could become an Esper…

72
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,225
Like have psychic powers?

73
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,184
Yeah.

74
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,020
What kind of power would you want?

75
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,817
Maybe the power to erase stains instantly.

76
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,197
-From shirts… Like laundry stains.
-Right.

77
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,116
Cleaning!

78
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,830
Concentrate.

79
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,667
-Huh?
-Believe the stain will vanish.

80
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,584
Concentrate.

81
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
From your heart.

82
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:24,889
Right. Concentrate.

83
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,976
Concentrate more.

84
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,022
No way that would work.

85
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,112
Why'd you get soy sauce on it anyway?

86
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,823
I'll bleach it… myself.

87
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,410
Anything unusual lately?

88
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,163
Unusual?

89
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,168
Nothing so far.

90
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,130
"So far"?

91
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,218
Is something bothering you?

92
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,263
The schedule's gone off track.

93
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,349
We were supposed to reach a point

94
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,268
through repeated missions.

95
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,687
The schedule is delayed.

96
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,734
An unidentified factor.

97
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,153
Something is interfering.

98
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,197
At this rate, we won't make it in time.

99
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,120
We may need more missions ahead.

100
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,330
Can I count on you?

101
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,665
I'm relying on you, Bunta.

102
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,543
Of course.

103
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,962
I've realized

104
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,714
the meaning of this work.

105
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,801
Saving others in secret

106
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,304
is another way of saving yourself.

107
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,640
Isn't that it?

108
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:52,894
Excellent.

109
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,731
You're developing a sense of leadership.

110
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,690
Leadership?

111
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,902
You have what it takes to lead.

112
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,488
Guide the others.

113
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:07,742
Yes, sir!

114
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,246
Last month,
the waste sorting procedure changed.

115
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,791
-Please choose someone from your group
-Okay.

116
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,292
-to take charge.
-I will.

117
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,587
I'd like to thoroughly implement
the procedure.

118
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,880
-Is that fine?
-Press that…

119
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,423
Anyone want to take charge?

120
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,971
-Should I do it?
-Is it okay?

121
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,057
-Yeah!
-Please do!

122
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,308
‎No…

123
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,978
-Naito, I'll make fresh tea.
-Okay…

124
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,147
Excuse me.

125
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,198
I hate to bring this up,

126
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,078
but the other night,
in the next town's park,

127
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,871
you were with a homeless man, right?

128
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:59,001
I know you used to live like that,

129
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,170
but things are different now, right?

130
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,339
I'm sorry. I'll be careful.

131
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,365
You look like
a completely different person.

132
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,908
That's the mission, isn't it?

133
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,166
Mission 92.

134
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,876
Catch the bouquet.

135
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,337
Mission 93.

136
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,922
Refill the copier paper!

137
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,883
Mission 94.

138
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,676
Drain the bathwater!

139
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,845
Mission 95.

140
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,556
Swap the plain sheets for floral ones!

141
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,189
Mission 100.

142
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,232
Make her eat the carrot!

143
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:03,900
‎PROUD OF ITS SWEETNESS

144
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,403
Man, I just want to save more people!

145
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,405
You're fired up.

146
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
Hanzo,

147
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,242
that's what being a hero is about.

148
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,204
You've changed.

149
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,874
Guess I've developed self-awareness.

150
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
Look! Thirty-eight degrees!

151
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,299
With one hand!

152
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:33,012
Once I learned to focus power
in my fingertips, it worked.

153
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,680
You're evolving.

154
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,059
Maybe your power is electromagnetic waves?

155
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,144
What do you mean?

156
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,563
A microwave
is an electromagnetic wave, right?

157
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,733
But emitting electromagnetic waves
from your hand…

158
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,653
Even if it's just a bit, that's amazing!

159
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,196
Electromagnetic waves?

160
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,406
I've been training too.

161
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,243
I can ask birds for a favor now.

162
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,827
Next are bugs.

163
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,454
The smaller the brain, the harder it is.

164
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,413
Bugs?

165
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,581
I'm testing pill bugs now.

166
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
I said no, Sasuke!

167
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,254
The cheese is good, right?
So, please, can you listen to me?

168
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,798
The fancy cheese you had before is better?

169
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,841
But it costs more than my meal.

170
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,928
Fine, I'll buy it then.

171
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,264
-You can eat that first.
-You can understand them?

172
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,723
They talk?

173
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,520
Not in words, but more like their beliefs.
It might be their feelings.

174
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,814
-You should train too, Bunta.
-No.

175
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,234
I can only hear through touch.

176
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,320
You can hear anywhere you touch?
How about toes?

177
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,738
Hold on.

178
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,949
-Try it!
-What do you mean?

179
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:35,908
-Yes, here.
-Now?

180
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,368
-Here!
-Okay.

181
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,287
-You mean Hanzo's toes?
-Yeah.

182
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,663
-Huh?
-Okay.

183
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,748
-No way!
-Come on!

184
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,084
Guess what I'm thinking!

185
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,877
I'll do it, then.

186
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,678
-A little louder.
-Try higher up.

187
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,313
This looks kind of indecent.

188
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,522
Quiet!

189
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,692
I want okonomiyaki.

190
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,861
-Got it!
-What did he say?

191
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,446
He's a traitor!

192
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,618
I wonder if you can hear it clearer
if it's closer to the head.

193
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
What about your own inner voice?

194
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,747
Why would I want to hear that?

195
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,999
Maybe there is a voice you haven't heard.

196
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,629
Still no power from Shiki?

197
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,256
She says she's got a sixth sense.

198
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,424
Sixth sense?

199
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:34,967
She can see ghosts?

200
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,385
Is that even a psychic power?

201
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,846
She said she feels like
someone's watching her.

202
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,973
Maybe it's a stalker?

203
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,267
She's cute, after all.

204
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,446
Sorry. We're closed.

205
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,866
Closed…

206
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,163
Wait.

207
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,666
What are you looking for?

208
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,045
Girls in my class said
this shop has flowers

209
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,256
you can't find anywhere else.

210
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,425
So, I thought I'd buy some.

211
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,346
-For your girlfriend?
-I don't have one.

212
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,140
It's for my mom.
Her wedding anniversary is coming up.

213
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,525
What kind of flowers does she like?

214
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,069
Not sure.

215
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,655
What about you?

216
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,949
Which ones here do you like?

217
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,213
Ohsuke's late.

218
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,715
He said there was a plant delivery today.

219
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,093
Flower shops take online orders now, huh.

220
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,431
-I'm home!
-Welcome back.

221
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,557
TAKOYAKI TAKKOPI

222
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,517
Why okonomiyaki?

223
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,394
-Ask this guy.
-He's the traitor.

224
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,812
I like takoyaki too!

225
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,355
Of all days…

226
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,899
Please come in.

227
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,866
This is a customer
from the dry-cleaning shop.

228
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,993
Nice to meet you. I'm Ichimatsu.

229
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,871
I love takoyaki!

230
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,915
-Love!
-Takoyaki!

231
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
Yeah!

232
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,669
-Love!
-What is that?

233
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,005
-What is that?
-Love!

234
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,589
‎What?

235
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,631
-Love!
-Huh?

236
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,491
Takoyaki Research Club?

237
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,117
-Yes.
-Didn't know that existed.

238
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,746
-Oh.
-I found it in a customer's laundry.

239
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,625
-I told him we used to be a takoyaki shop.
-Yeah.

240
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,542
Yes.

241
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,212
So, I asked,
"Was the shop called Takoppi?"

242
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,463
-And she said, "Yes."
-Yeah.

243
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,089
Sorry, it's okonomiyaki today.

244
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,674
No, it's great.

245
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
-Close enough, right?
-Yes.

246
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,595
-Do you want more?
-Yes.

247
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,888
-Oh?
-Please.

248
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,306
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

249
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,975
Nice to see someone young.

250
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,060
You have a great appetite.

251
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,937
-I'll put mayo on for you.
-I love it.

252
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,938
Here.

253
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,774
So, what do you do
in the Takoyaki Research Club?

254
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,903
Make takoyaki and eat it
or go out to eat it,

255
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,488
then make more, then go out to eat it.

256
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,615
Study, kid.

257
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,826
-Is your university nearby?
-Yes.

258
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,827
Tokyo Institute of Technology.

259
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,664
-Huh?
-You're smart!

260
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,624
-Wow.
-Not really. I repeated a year.

261
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,001
-Even though…
-Wow!

262
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,879
Where'd you go to college, Bunta?

263
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,714
Don't ask that now.

264
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,383
So,

265
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,510
how do you all know each other?

266
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,807
Besides me,
they all work at the same company.

267
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,602
We're kind of like handymen
who do all sorts of odd jobs, you know?

268
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,647
Do you do things
like stand in line for people?

269
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,815
-Yes, we do that too.
-Oh,

270
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,109
maybe I'll hire you sometime.

271
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,736
Do you have a website?

272
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:27,366
It's not an amount
a student can afford though.

273
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,201
We're handymen,

274
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,746
but not your average handymen.

275
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,832
We work with higher ideals.

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,834
We're

277
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:40,588
inspired by the greatness

278
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,755
of that ideal.

279
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,468
What ideal is that?

280
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,599
World peace?

281
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,269
Wow!

282
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,687
Amazing!

283
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,649
Bunty's my husband.

284
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,116
I'll go get the takoyaki sauce.

285
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,451
Oh, sorry.

286
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,328
She's cute and a great person,

287
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,163
-but why?
-Why?

288
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,915
Yes?

289
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,460
Why…

290
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,838
is takoyaki sauce so good, huh?

291
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,426
-Okay.
-Yes.

292
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,219
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

293
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,554
Alright.

294
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,723
-Okay.
-Thank you.

295
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,642
-Ichimatsu.
-Yes?

296
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,019
You're still young,

297
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,146
with a bright future ahead.

298
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,651
Stay away from old folks like us.

299
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,529
Yeah, but you're not that old.

300
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,200
Shiki may look young,
but she's actually pretty up there.

301
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,079
I don't care about age at all.

302
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,247
Oh, really?

303
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,875
Young folks these days.

304
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,669
Really…

305
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,302
I'm home!

306
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,350
You're so late!

307
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,643
I stopped by somewhere.

308
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,852
Where?

309
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,729
Why do you care?

310
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,691
Just because your dad's on a business trip
doesn't mean you can go wild.

311
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,109
Ow!

312
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,694
Today's dinner is hamburger steak.

313
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,533
We're a normal family, right?

314
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,410
What?

315
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,036
I'm taking a bath first.

316
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,543
Normal's fine, isn't it?

317
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,758
GRADUATION CEREMONY

318
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,392
Well then.

319
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,310
Um…

320
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,065
You're the guy from the festival, right?

321
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,694
You saved us.

322
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,821
With the yakisoba griddle!

323
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,240
-Oh, that.
-That…

324
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,534
That thing's super heavy, isn't it?

325
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,123
I've been doing hard labor for years.

326
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,417
That's awesome!

327
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,003
Mind if I touch your arm?

328
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,131
Whoa. It's big.

329
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,261
Alright.

330
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,359
About earlier…

331
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,737
Sorry for saying such a rude thing.

332
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,241
About you being old.

333
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,871
I'm older than you,

334
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,165
so that was out of line.

335
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,751
Bunty.

336
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,252
Yes?

337
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,755
You were jealous, weren't you?

338
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,551
That's why you said that, right?

339
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,888
No, I was just worried.

340
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,265
Worried?

341
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,019
What if he's a stalker?

342
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,605
He said he's from
Tokyo Institute of Technology,

343
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,608
but he didn't even look that smart.

344
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,777
See? You are jealous.

345
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,987
It's not like that.

346
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:38,367
He's just a chick barely growing feathers.
No need to get jealous.

347
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:42,329
I have a mission to save everyone.

348
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,374
Yeah. World peace, right?

349
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,501
World peace.

350
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,964
World peace.

351
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,389
-Hey, Ichimatsu.
-Hey.

352
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:15,445
Recent applied studies
on competitively inhibiting DHPS

353
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,241
have focused on mechanisms that resemble
the structure and behavior of compounds

354
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,325
like p-aminobenzoic acid…

355
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,838
He really is a student here.

356
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,424
I'm still suspicious.

357
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,553
TAKOYAKI RESEARCH CLUB

358
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,846
I just dropped by,

359
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,347
since I had some work nearby.

360
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,893
But has Ichimatsu been
in the Takoyaki Research Club for a while?

361
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,645
No, he suddenly joined last month.

362
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,148
He's a repeat junior,
so he should be busy though.

363
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,067
We're triple repeaters,
and we don't have any free time either.

364
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,362
-But we can't help it. It's love.
-Takoyaki…

365
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,531
-Love!
-Love!

366
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,616
Together?

367
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,451
-Love!
-Love…

368
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,414
-It's him.
-Maybe so.

369
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,127
Yup.

370
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,381
Excuse me.

371
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,344
I'm a friend of Ichimatsu,
who lives in his neighborhood.

372
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,429
Just between us,

373
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,933
my daughter's actually crazy about him.

374
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:26,767
‎-Huh?
‎-Yeah.

375
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,728
Could you tell me

376
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,397
what type of girls he likes?

377
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,982
His type?

378
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,734
What do you think?

379
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,529
I don't know.

380
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,949
But if Ichimatsu's type
really is the neighbor's daughter

381
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,785
and I say he likes the opposite type,

382
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,079
she might think, "Oh, I'm not his type.

383
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,288
I'll just give up."

384
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,708
If that happened,
I'd feel awful for Ichimatsu.

385
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,834
That's long.

386
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,503
So, the best answer is…

387
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,382
He probably likes all kinds of girls!

388
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,343
That makes him sound shallow, doesn't it?

389
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,886
Oh, right.

390
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,890
You tend to overthink, don't you?

391
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,976
I get that a lot.

392
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,647
Ichimatsu's type?

393
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,441
Yeah. What type of girls does he like?

394
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,651
The cute type?

395
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,615
-Watch out.
-Sorry.

396
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,660
He's in a long-distance relationship,
I think.

397
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,453
Not sure though.

398
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,415
I heard he's in
a long-distance relationship.

399
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,916
Oh, right.

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,543
Is there an age-gap?

401
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,046
-I think it's a high school classmate.
-Oh, really?

402
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,757
-So cute!
-Right?

403
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,593
Wait, there are others…

404
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,639
He seems like an ordinary student.

405
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,438
‎-Right.
‎-True.

406
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,526
Thank you for waiting.

407
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,278
-Thank you.
-Okay.

408
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,904
Looks delicious.

409
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,490
Sorry to drag you out on your day off,

410
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,743
especially when there's no mission.

411
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,702
No problem.

412
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,912
We help each other out.

413
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:16,209
But we're unstoppable.

414
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,254
We can infiltrate
anywhere now, mission-style.

415
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,131
I was just watching.

416
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,883
No.

417
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:30,182
But I didn't think
you cared so much about Shiki.

418
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:34,519
If a coworker, well, not technically,

419
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:40,400
but someone you live with
might have a stalker,

420
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,152
of course, you'd worry.

421
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,614
True.

422
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,911
No one knows
how long this setup will last.

423
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,001
You're only pretending

424
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,920
to be her husband

425
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,589
because her memory's confused.
It wouldn't be a surprise

426
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,466
if it ends anytime.

427
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,638
When it does, you'll just move out.

428
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,724
It's all part of the arrangement.

429
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,146
Don't call it that.

430
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:24,903
Because she really believes
I'm her husband.

431
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,281
I've heard her thoughts over and over.

432
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,575
If someone else moved in,

433
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,537
she'd believe that person
is her husband next.

434
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,330
For real.

435
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,379
Would it really be that easy?

436
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,759
You can't even explain
how you got accepted, right?

437
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,386
How and why it happened.

438
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,348
You know,

439
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,517
I took an E-Capsule

440
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,645
and started communicating with animals.

441
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,815
It's something
that can't really be explained.

442
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,444
Normally, it shouldn't be possible,
but I can do it.

443
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,031
Nothing surprises me anymore.

444
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,868
Otherwise,
you wouldn't survive in Nonamare.

445
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,583
Non Amare.

446
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,628
You must not love.

447
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,297
I…

448
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,049
love Sasuke and the animals.

449
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,304
Don't tell the boss.

450
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,308
I love this job too.

451
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,852
And the team.

452
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,191
Love, huh?

453
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,320
This is a lesson I learned.

454
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,281
You have to treasure what's precious

455
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,868
before you lose it.

456
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,332
I love you too, Bunta.

457
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,420
You know, Hanzo,

458
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,964
maybe you are popular?

459
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:09,841
What's that supposed to mean?

460
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,801
Now, it just made my heart flutter!

-Excuse me.
-Welcome.

468
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,716
Is Shiki here?

469
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,010
Bunty?

470
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,721
You're Bunty, right?

471
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,848
-Well…
-Hey!

472
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,643
Bunty came!

473
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,020
-Um…
-Bunty? Which Bunty?

474
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,816
Bunty?

475
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,278
It's Bunty!

476
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,487
Hello.

477
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,030
I wanted to meet you.

478
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,574
Don't make your wife cry again!

479
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,784
Sorry.

480
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,036
I was just passing by.

481
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,746
It's her birthday, after all.

482
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:23,957
Back from work?

483
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,376
-What?
-Back from work?

484
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,003
No, I mean…

485
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,213
Birthday?

486
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,589
Yeah, her birthday's today.

487
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,509
So, you came to pick her up.

488
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,263
Today is her birthday?

489
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,061
Really bad!

490
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,482
A present…

491
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,026
What should I get her?

492
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,694
Jewelry?

493
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,778
No.

494
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,905
Better to go safe. Something practical.

495
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,452
That won't beat a pickling stone.

496
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,252
It doesn't have to be better.

497
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,755
Why am I trying to compete?

498
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,133
A couple's gift?
What kind of gift is that?

499
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,845
We used to pretend
we didn't notice each other's birthdays.

500
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,097
How can I top a pickling stone?

501
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,682
Compared to a pickling stone,

502
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,933
what counts as winning?

503
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,353
What counts as losing? I don't even know.

504
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,730
I guess jewelry.

505
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:33,109
Plain, simple, and a bit expensive.
It's the safe choice.

506
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,030
Safe? Would that make her happy?

507
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,491
I want her to be happy.

508
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,242
I want to make her smile.

509
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,038
What would make her happy…
What would make her happy?

510
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,966
‎KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

511
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,186
Bunty!

512
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,105
Say something!

513
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:20,824
What's wrong?

514
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,538
Happy birthday.

515
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,583
I wanted to give you something,

516
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,294
but I had no idea.

517
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,714
I didn't know what made you happy.

518
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,050
I didn't know what you liked.

519
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,386
I didn't know.

520
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,722
So, I couldn't buy anything.

521
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,185
No, not that I don't know,

522
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,813
but realizing how much I don't…

523
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,774
I don't know…

524
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,031
Sorry!

525
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,701
I'm sorry!

526
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,921
I don't really know you either.

527
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,009
Your past jobs,

528
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,511
memories of your dad…

529
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:29,350
I also didn't know you could get
so competitive over little things.

530
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,313
Sorry, I'm petty.

531
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,691
That's just who you are.

532
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:41,070
Even panicking over a gift…

533
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,947
That's you too.

534
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,286
Even that pickling stone made me happy.

535
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:56,211
Isn't this where you hug me back?

536
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,132
Am I not loved?

537
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,314
Bunty?

538
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,818
Yeah?

539
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,070
My birthday.

540
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,991
It's tomorrow.

541
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:38,837
Who was that?

542
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,145
Damn it!

543
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,284
He chased me down. That was close.

544
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,208
I told you, I got away.

545
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,673
You worry too much, Ai-chan.

546
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,845
It's great you get to do whatever.

547
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,351
I found him.

548
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,062
I'm going to meet him.

549
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,356
The name's Kujou.

550
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,066
Mr. Kujou.

551
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,490
Sorry, I'll call you back.

552
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,586
It's open.

553
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,382
Pill bugs?

554
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,303
-What?
-Don't scream!

555
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,846
-Hey!
-What the…

556
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,972
Ow!

557
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,390
Wait!

558
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,351
-What's going on?!
-Don't "what's going on" me!

559
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,186
You've been stalking my wife!

560
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,358
You thought you lost me, huh?
You're too soft!

561
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,609
You rookie chick!

562
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,154
Stop tailing girls
and focus on your studies!

563
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,202
Yes.

564
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,203
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,332
Don't ever go near her again.

566
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,250
He thinks I'm stalking Shiki.

567
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:43,670
I'll go along with it.

568
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:46,881
You're…

569
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,342
not a stalker, are you?

570
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,054
No…

571
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,055
What are you after?

572
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:03,481
I'm sorry! The truth is…

573
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,150
It's this…

574
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,322
Psychic Power Research Club.

575
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,407
Please take me…

576
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,867
as your disciple!

577
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,378
Here.

578
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,800
Mind if I stop by again?

579
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,344
Anytime.

580
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,054
Okay then.

581
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,808
Shion.

582
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,273
That flower's name is Shion.

583
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,901
Oh, really.

584
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,656
I saw him make a morning glory bloom.

585
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,868
I smelled takoyaki,
so I looked in from outside.

586
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,204
Then I saw a man gently stroke
the morning glory vines,

587
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,081
and then they bloomed.

588
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,879
Hanzo, you can control animals, right?

589
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,132
And you, Bunty. What's your power?

590
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,056
Please, give me psychic powers too!

591
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,974
"Give me"?

592
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,642
All right.

593
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,770
I'll grant them.

594
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,899
But in return, you must tell no one.

595
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:33,154
Not even your long-distance girlfriend
from high school.

596
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,405
-How did you know?
-First,

597
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,159
do 100 sit-ups every day!

598
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,788
All of us train daily.

599
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:46,167
We do 100 sit-ups, 50 push-ups,

600
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,960
and 30 minutes of wall-sitting.

601
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,547
That's how we build our strength
and mastered our skills!

602
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,925
-Skills…
-There's no easy pill

603
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,387
that gives you powers instantly!

604
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,474
Only blood, sweat, and tears!

605
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:02,934
Yes.

606
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,148
Do your best.

607
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,775
I'll do my best!

608
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,444
-Begin 100 sit-ups!
-Yes!

609
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,490
One, two…

610
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,077
What do we tell the boss?

611
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,704
Hanzo.

612
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,333
Let's keep this between us.

613
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,752
In any company,

614
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,131
there are things better left unreported.

615
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,844
The boss wouldn't want to fire all of us.

616
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,806
We contained the problem before it spread.

617
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,976
With that determination, he won't talk.

618
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,352
Really?

619
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,777
Thanks.
I'll buy some fancy cheese for you guys.

620
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,487
What kind of teeth do they even have?

621
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,656
Strong enough to chew concrete.

622
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,575
Wow.

623
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,122
Pill bugs and us, we're both unstoppable.

624
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,999
-Unstoppable?
-A little.

625
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,876
Just a little bit unstoppable.

626
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,836
That makes no sense.

627
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,673
It really helped having you with me.

628
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,467
I couldn't have done it alone.

629
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:20,803
Hanzo.

630
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,472
I love you.

631
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,017
That made my heart flutter!

632
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,979
Ninety-eight, 99,

633
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,814
100.

634
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,308
Even remotes emit electromagnetic waves…

635
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,223
Where?

636
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,350
What's unexpected?

637
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,269
Where does it start?

638
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,071
A safe gift or a bold one.
Which is better?

639
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,324
A bold one. What about you?

640
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,826
A safe gift.

641
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,411
What?

642
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,955
If it's too bold, it could backfire.

643
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,707
Like a sea cucumber?

644
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,668
-That's bold.
-Do you like them?

645
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,087
I don't hate them.

646
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,257
-Jellyfish?
-I like those.

647
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,425
Me too.

648
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,427
I want to go to the aquarium.

649
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,595
Ah, you mean not to eat.

650
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,972
You meant to eat?

651
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,435
-The sea?
-Love it.

652
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,521
-The mountains?
-If it's picnicking.

653
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,399
-Amusement parks?
-Love them. Roller coasters?

654
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,277
-Hate them.
-Bungee jumping?

655
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,653
Don't see the point.

656
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,114
Wow, we're not compatible.

657
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,074
We can't agree on everything.

658
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,870
Rainy days?

659
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,413
I like them.

660
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,914
Rain boots?

661
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,374
Love them.

662
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,792
And raincoats too.

663
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,002
Thought so.

664
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,504
The smell after rain.

665
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,715
Love it.

666
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,884
Same here. We're the same.

667
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,514
So cute. I like these.

668
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,977
A bit cheap for a gift, isn't it?

669
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,355
Look! This one is you.

670
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,065
I'm a bee?

671
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:23,194
Like a bug that swarms around
sweet, delicious nectar.

672
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,945
Please stop. It sounds bad.

673
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,197
A worker bee, then.

674
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,282
That's sad.

675
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,079
Look. They've got phone straps too.

676
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,122
Oh, yeah.

677
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,458
Okay.

678
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,341
You sure this was okay?

679
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,052
I wanted something matching.

680
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,847
How is it? Do you like it?

681
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,769
I do.

682
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,814
A bug clinging to your chest.

683
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,732
Stop it.

684
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,692
You said it first.

685
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,279
Here you go.

686
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
Thanks.

687
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,142
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

688
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,565
One's enough,
or the cake will be full of holes.

689
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,691
-Really?
-Yeah.

690
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,696
Happy birthday.

691
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,323
Thank you.

692
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,075
Any wishes for the year?

693
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,790
To get along with Bunty this year.

694
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,338
And next year and the year after
and forever after that.

695
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,965
May we always be happy together.

696
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,595
I only asked about this year.

697
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,514
A bit greedy, don't you think?

698
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:02,102
Do you like greedy, clingy girls?

699
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,152
I love you.

700
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,206
Here I go.

701
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,402
Esper?

702
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,207
I found it.

703
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,779
‎-‎An enemy to the hero?
‎-Villian?

704
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,739
‎Espers are probably…

705
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,824
‎Big Five!

706
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,493
‎Hanzo!

707
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,662
‎-Ow!
‎-‎You can't read minds?

708
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,954
‎Watch out!
‎You guys are the villains, aren't you?

709
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,748
‎Stop the tears!
