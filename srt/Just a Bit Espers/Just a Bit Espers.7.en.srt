1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,216
‎-Hey!
‎-Come on!

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,592
Stay safe!

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,469
Time machines haven't been invented yet?

4
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:13,054
They haven't.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:17,100
But a way to send data was discovered.

6
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,309
Data has no mass.

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,687
It's just zeroes and ones.

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,483
We use wormholes in digital space.

9
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,237
We can send things from 2055 to 2025.

10
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,781
If we try 2026, it gets lost.

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,285
By 2027, nothing gets through.

12
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,078
Because they're prime numbers?

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,288
Exactly. I'm so smart!

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,749
Whatever. Forget the details.

15
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,333
Can you tell me

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,878
what my future self

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,046
wants me to do?

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,507
I invented a drug.

19
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,720
Its recipe was stolen
and transmitted back to 2025.

20
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,639
That drug didn't exist then,

21
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,391
so it counts as altering history.

22
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,103
And they think I'm the one who did it.

23
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,733
If things stay like this,
I get the death penalty.

24
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,863
Tampering with history is a serious crime.

25
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,365
Wait.

26
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,952
If you get executed,
that means I get executed!

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,871
Exactly.

28
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,083
That's why you need to find
the real culprit there

29
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,751
and stop any changes to history.

30
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,510
What are these
appearance forecasts based on?

31
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,846
There's a method
to observe the world's data.

32
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,351
Tampering with the past strains spacetime,

33
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,769
and it shows up in the data.

34
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,980
Places with a strong distortion…

35
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,068
It's where Espers

36
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,778
who shouldn't exist are showing up.

37
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,157
If word about Espers gets out,
you'll get fired.

38
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,618
How do you do it?

39
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,995
Espers?

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,125
APPEAR

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,751
They really do exist.

42
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,005
Her husband's not dead.

43
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,508
You're her husband.

44
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,302
Her Bunty, right?

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,179
You're Fumito.

46
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:19,597
So, why do I call you Bunty?

47
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,518
You're Bunta, so that's why
you're Bunty, right?

48
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,104
Wait.

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,191
This is

50
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,235
a 3D hologram.

51
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,738
My real body exists in the future.

52
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,823
The future?

53
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,658
The year 2055.

54
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,368
Thirty years from now.

55
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,662
Think of it like

56
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,998
remote communication in your time.

57
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
Are you Fumito,

58
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,755
Shiki's husband?

59
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,258
And?

60
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,552
You're from the future?

61
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,602
The Fumito in Shiki's memory

62
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,604
is the Fumito of this era.

63
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,232
I'm his future self,

64
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,152
30 years later.

65
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,157
So…

66
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,702
where's the Fumito of this era?

67
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,663
What is he doing right now?

68
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,583
If he's alive,

69
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,252
he should live with Shiki!

70
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,380
She loves Fumito!

71
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,925
It's not possible.
That is why you are here!

72
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,226
Know your place.

73
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,064
Do you want to throw away your life now?

74
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,652
Quit your job?

75
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,613
Lose everything again?

76
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,581
You will keep living

77
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,584
in that company housing

78
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,795
and keep working, just as before.

79
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,131
Because of certain circumstances,

80
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,593
Shiki's memory is easy to overwrite.

81
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,388
One night of sleep

82
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,807
and she'll recognize you

83
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,142
as the Bunty she loves.

84
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,062
I don't want to hold

85
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,024
a grudge just because one employee

86
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,151
was rude to me.

87
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,904
For now,

88
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,408
I can still let this go.

89
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,708
I guess…

90
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,419
you are right.

91
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,591
Did I come off as…

92
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,680
rude just now?

93
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,597
You did.

94
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,808
I sincerely apologize!

95
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,894
My tongue slipped!

96
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,022
Maybe I had too much coffee!

97
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,816
Please rest well.

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,111
-Good work today.
-Good work today!

99
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,822
Bunta.

100
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,327
You forgot this.

101
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,883
I'm like a salaryman, huh?

102
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,603
Hello?

103
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,859
It's about Ichimatsu…

104
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,367
What's wrong?

105
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,246
Hello…

106
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,967
I only grabbed him.

107
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,844
Listen, I'm…

108
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm…

109
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,973
-I'm your--
-Don't come near me!

110
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,643
Get out, you murderer!

111
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,527
Ichimatsu!

112
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,197
Ichimatsu!

113
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,166
Ichimatsu! Is he okay?

114
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,793
Shion! Stop.

115
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:01,671
Ichimatsu!

116
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,423
What happened?

117
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,342
He's trying to say something.

118
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,345
Ichimatsu! Don't talk, just think!

119
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,681
My throat hurts.

120
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,517
-I need oxygen.
-He says his throat hurts.

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,602
He needs oxygen. Get oxygen.

122
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,438
It's in the clubroom! I'll get it.

123
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,901
He's dried out. His airways are probably
too dry, making it hard to breathe.

124
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,112
How did Ohsuke's flower blooming power

125
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,114
-cause this to happen?
-Reactive oxygen.

126
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,326
He uses reactive oxygen to accelerate
growth and make flowers bloom.

127
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,495
A flower bloomer
is really an Esper of oxidation.

128
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,374
-Oxidation?
-Oxidation damaged his cells and DNA.

129
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,502
It's basically aging.
Ichimatsu, where's the E-capsule?

130
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,879
My desk…

131
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,338
In the drawer.

132
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,048
It's in the desk drawer.

133
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,550
Ichimatsu is a dehydration Esper.

134
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,219
If he can control the fluids
inside his body,

135
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,097
-it might help repair the damage.
-Got it.

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,641
I'm cold.

137
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,853
If he takes them all, he'll get a boost.

138
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,146
-Get a hold of yourself.
-Drink.

139
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,609
Ichimatsu, drink!

140
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,861
Drink!

141
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,852
‎TAKOPPI

142
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,687
Good morning.

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,606
Morning.

144
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,234
You going in early today?

145
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,489
No… I woke up for no reason.

146
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,578
‎Oh!

147
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,580
Smells good.

148
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,838
I'm heading out.

149
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,340
Have a good day.

150
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,820
‎LAUNDRY SHOP

151
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,614
Two of these.

152
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:59,158
-And one jacket?
-Yes.

153
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,704
Have you been well?
Everyone was worried about you.

154
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,581
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,709
When did I quit here?

156
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,004
-I have no memory of it.
-You don't remember?

157
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
No.

158
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,717
In April, you suddenly stopped coming.

159
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,888
A couple of days later, a resignation
agent came saying that you quit.

160
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,726
On your last day,

161
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,312
you disappeared mid-shift.

162
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,233
One moment you were here,
the next you were gone.

163
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,069
When in April was that?

164
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,655
Um… On the day of the blackout.

165
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,116
Blackout…?

166
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,197
We finally got the nano-receptor

167
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,825
from the new B team.

168
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,537
It took nearly six months to rebuild.

169
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,332
Now that Bunta knows about me,

170
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,418
I need to prepare.

171
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,712
The mission will proceed separately.

172
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,590
There isn't much time left

173
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,550
to alter the past.

"Place the enclosed vial

on Takoppi's porch shelf."

179
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,862
Makes no sense at all.

186
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,434
You're from the neighborhood council. Hi.

187
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,729
Did something happen to Senda?

188
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,982
Yes, he had an accident in August.

189
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,325
He died instantly.

190
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,415
MAMORU SENDA

191
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,376
Wake up and eat this.

192
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,461
I'll lift you. One, two.

193
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,058
Tastes good.

194
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,227
Right?

195
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,312
I'm a pretty good cook.

196
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,651
Why couldn't I do this for my wife?

197
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,280
My ex. We divorced.

198
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,994
I thought doing housework
made me less of a man.

199
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,830
How pathetic.

200
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,626
Her doing everything for me
meant she loved me.

201
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,379
That's what I thought.

202
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,840
Quit making that face!

203
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,302
How about now? With Shiki?

204
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,597
It's my job after all.

205
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,435
Doing nothing is what
a useless worker does.

206
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,353
Job?

207
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,230
Yeah.

208
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,524
It's a job.

209
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,613
Hurry and eat. I got to wash those.

210
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,657
I'm sick, so be nicer to me.

211
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,784
I'm not your girlfriend in Sendai.

212
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,495
Even though you came
every day for me like you were.

213
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,041
Don't worry about it.

214
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,461
I owe you for what Ohsuke did.

215
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,716
I'm really sorry for what he did.

216
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,599
Ai… That's not

217
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,726
your girlfriend's name, right?

218
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,896
You kept saying it while you were out.

219
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,607
Ai, come out.

220
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,818
Ai, don't disappear.

221
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,738
Who is she?

222
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,330
WILL BE CLOSED FOR A WHILE

223
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,887
Sasuke.

224
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,849
Did Hanzo ask you to come?

225
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,690
DON'T FREAK OUT, I'M IN 2055

226
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,983
I'M ICHIMATSU, YOUR FUTURE SELF
SO CALL ME "I"

227
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,527
-The future Ichimatsu?
-Yeah.

228
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,115
It's me. So "I."

229
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,952
-Can it talk?
-It can't.

230
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,079
It's been silent

231
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,374
since that day in Odaiba
when we all fought.

232
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:48,048
I didn't believe
it was my future self at first.

233
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,800
But…

234
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,886
it knows everything only I'd know.

235
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:57,224
Like when I stuck a pencil lead
into a socket and almost died.

236
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,394
You didn't tell somebody that?

237
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,148
It knew when I started
growing pubic hair, too.

238
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,359
-That's something you'd tell your friends.
-No, you don't!

239
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,903
-I never told anyone!
-Really?

240
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,078
The Esper capsules are "I"'s invention.

241
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,790
Whoa. You're incredible!

242
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,085
Kizashi stole the recipe,

243
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,921
and he's altering history with missions.

244
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,550
As a result, ten million people will die.

245
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:39,808
But is "I" allowed to tell you that?

246
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,853
Isn't that altering history too?

247
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,937
It is.

248
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,400
But Kizashi's alteration is worse.

249
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,152
That's why stopping him takes priority.

250
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,282
To minimize the impact,

251
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,410
the person involved,
which is me, was chosen.

252
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,709
If I fail,

253
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,506
"I" gets executed.

254
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,259
Funny, right?

255
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,056
It ordered me around from the future,

256
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,642
made me do everything…

257
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,479
then…

258
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,482
just vanished.

259
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,070
No matter how much I call it,

260
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,614
it won't answer.

261
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,414
Dammit.

262
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,750
What's wrong?

263
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,462
Does it hurt?

264
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,632
"I" disappearing

265
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,676
means two possibilities.

266
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,680
Maybe I should tell you now.

267
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,558
-What?
-If someday

268
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,643
I disappear without warning,

269
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,979
think of two possibilities.

270
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,357
Case one,

271
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,734
the future changed.

272
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,571
This world isn't parallel.

273
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,739
It's one continuous timeline.

274
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:23,996
If 2025 changes,
everything after that changes.

275
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,999
Which means there's a future
where I no longer need to contact you.

276
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,960
Sounds good then?

277
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,671
The problem is case two.

278
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,300
You die because history was changed.

279
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,388
If something happens and you die,

280
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,806
I disappear too.

281
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,227
Makes sense.

282
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:58,113
But people don't just drop dead in Japan.

283
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,657
Ichimatsu! Ichimatsu!

284
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,327
"I"…

285
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,206
"I"… I'm dying.

286
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,209
I'm dying right now.

287
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
I'm disappearing.

288
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,880
Here.

289
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,968
I'm cold. Disappearing. Freezing.

290
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,803
I'm disappearing.

291
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,264
It's so…

292
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,935
so unbelievably…

293
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,730
lonely.

294
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,698
I'm gonna die, eventually.

295
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,409
You survived, right?

296
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,121
You ate udon and you're alive!

297
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,126
-"I" disappeared.
-We don't know that yet!

298
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,003
Something probably happened,

299
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,130
the future changed,

300
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,466
and it'll pop right back!

301
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,387
"Pop right back," seriously?

302
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,973
Yeah, pop!

303
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,891
Like pop!

304
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,061
It'll just pop right back, right?

305
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,813
‎So…

306
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,022
‎It's okay.

307
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,046
‎MAMORU SENDA

308
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,506
He went back to his parked car

309
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,676
to pick something up

310
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,888
and stepped into the road…

311
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,017
and that was his end.

312
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,648
I wanted to see…

313
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,318
his black egg painting.

314
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,866
Senmaru died because of us, didn't he?

315
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,454
We don't know how much
the missions were involved.

316
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,290
Remember what Bunta said.

317
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,875
According to Ichimatsu,

318
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,710
we are being deceived.

319
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,921
If we continue our missions,
ten million people will die.

320
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,216
We're not saving,
but rather people will die.

321
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,511
Are people just going to die off slowly?

322
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,931
Not in a big event, but one by one,

323
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,018
in a miserable way.

324
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,829
A mission in one hour.

325
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,790
Where?

326
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,211
Mission 155.

327
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,631
"Place ten concrete blocks
in front of the apartment."

328
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,217
Makes no sense.

329
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,635
Missions

330
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,887
never made sense, right?

331
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,474
Ichimatsu lives here, right?

332
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,102
You think this is unrelated?

333
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,399
If the timeline was altered so you'd die,

334
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,403
-can't you alter it back?
-How?

335
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,825
Espers aren't supposed to exist
in this era, so if we use our powers

336
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,953
-and do something big--
-Hey!

337
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,747
Don't get mad.

338
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,043
Will Ichimatsu trip and die?

339
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,629
He won't die from tripping.

340
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,840
But Senmaru died.

341
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:51,263
Ichimatsu just recovered, right?
He might trip and die.

342
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,726
Should we…

343
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,062
lay them down instead?

344
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,899
Yeah. Lay them flat,
so they're not in the way.

345
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,323
What if they're too hard to see

346
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,451
and he trips and dies anyway?

347
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,496
I feel like he'll die,
no matter what we do!

348
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,796
I regret it…

349
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,258
Involving you, Shion.

350
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,010
‎Huh?

351
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,055
I wasn't thinking.

352
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,641
I was selfish.

353
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,606
I just wanted an ally.

354
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,984
Someone I could talk to in this era.

355
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,236
-I am your ally.
-Yeah. But still…

356
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,073
You're only 17.

357
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,327
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

358
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,136
Welcome home.

359
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,930
I'm back.

360
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,975
I'll help right away.

361
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,311
It's fine. Just relax.

362
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,189
No, I can't do that.

363
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,956
Bunty.

364
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,963
What am I thinking right now?

365
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,050
I can't hear you like that.

366
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,013
You're mean.

367
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,892
I really can't hear you.

368
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,361
Then listen properly.

369
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,865
Did you stop loving me?

370
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,910
Do you not want to be with me?

371
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,125
There's no way I'd stop loving you.

372
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,547
Your face got wet.

373
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,132
‎Oh.

374
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,438
I wish I could hear you.

375
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,702
I'm hungry and sad!

376
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,294
Oh yeah.

377
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,006
Do you remember where I lived

378
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,801
before we got married?

379
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,352
Did you forget?

380
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,447
It was in Machiai-higashi, right?

381
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,116
The apartment near the station.

382
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
Right.

383
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,247
What was nearby?

384
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,254
We ate at that diner a lot.

385
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,465
The one with the good croquettes.

386
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,594
Kashio Restaurant, right?

387
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,100
Why the quiz?

388
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,395
Just thinking about the old days.

389
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,859
KASHIO RESTAURANT

390
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,451
-Croquette set meal, please.
-Okay.

391
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,579
One croquette set meal.

392
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,580
Okay.

393
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,920
-Thanks for the meal.
-Thank you.

394
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,965
See you, Mr. Croquette.

395
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,845
Thank you.

396
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,141
‎KASHIO RESTAURANT

397
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,566
Fumito?

398
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,244
Who are you again?

399
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,138
A new junction appeared.

400
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,475
The year 2055 has been renewed.

401
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,566
HEY! "I"!, CAN YOU HEAR ME? "I," RESPOND!

402
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,026
Ichimatsu, you there?

403
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:39,986
Ichimatsu?

404
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,823
Hey, Ichimatsu.

405
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,622
"I"!

406
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,999
You popped back! "I"!

407
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,225
Bunta…

408
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,353
met me.

409
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,775
You were totally silent.

410
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:22,487
Looking at the logs,
there's no record of communication.

411
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,323
But I thought I talked to you every day.

412
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,700
What do you mean?

413
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,327
Something happened over there,

414
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,496
and the part of history
that involves me changed.

415
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,165
There was a disturbance.

416
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,334
Disturbance?

417
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,462
I think it tried to contain

418
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,048
the contradictions
that arose in the world.

419
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,633
But I'm not sure.

420
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,471
Research on past access is banned,

421
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,099
so we don't know much.

422
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,936
You must be hungry.

423
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,659
Sasuke!

424
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,335
I'm just…

425
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,130
really glad you're back.

426
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,676
I lost contact with "I,"

427
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,386
and I kept thinking I'd die tomorrow

428
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,889
or any moment--

429
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,350
A FEW WRINKLES ARE NO BIG DEAL
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT

430
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,937
"I."

431
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,734
"I"!

432
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,335
Where's Sasuke?

433
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,047
They said it's minor. Just a light burn.

434
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,011
What happened?

435
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,432
It's my fault.

436
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,601
That doesn't explain anything!

437
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,938
Shion came…

438
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,901
for revenge.

439
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,661
Sasuke protected me.

440
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,714
You protected him like I told you to, huh?

441
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,967
Good boy.

442
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,260
Sasuke…

443
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,346
I'm sorry.

444
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:55,974
Ohsuke,

445
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,476
you've got blood near your eye.

446
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,853
It's nothing. No big deal.

447
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,652
He's the enemy.

448
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,737
Go to hell!

449
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,785
Buzz, buzz, buzz

450
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,122
The bees are flying

451
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:26,254
Wild roses are blooming around the pond

452
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,049
Buzz, buzz, buzz

453
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,053
The bees are flying

454
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,641
Like I said, I'm single.

455
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,809
Since when?

456
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,227
Always.

457
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,856
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-Huh?

458
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,817
Do you know a woman
who works at the dry cleaners?

459
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,903
The person who works
at my usual dry cleaners is an old man.

460
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,199
Are you mistaking me for someone?

461
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,203
Buzz, buzz, buzz

462
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,457
The bees are flying

463
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,712
Morning dew sparkles

464
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,923
And the wild roses sway

465
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,137
Buzz, buzz, buzz

466
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,557
The bees are flying

467
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,107
Are you following so far?

468
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,276
Well, I guess.

469
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:34,238
True, it seems you know a lot about me.

470
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,532
And you are

471
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,785
a hologram.

472
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,039
Maybe I can believe
you are from the future.

473
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,708
Thanks.

474
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,753
Now, it's April 2025, right?

475
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,299
We meet one year from now.

476
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,718
April 2026.

477
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,805
When I come here for the first time,

478
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,641
I forget my ID

479
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,477
in my laundry.

480
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,854
You learn my name,

481
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,650
we get close, we date,

482
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,777
and we get married.

483
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,238
Okay…

484
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,074
We will live upstairs
at the takoyaki shop.

485
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,119
And you'll get a job
at Kobayashi Laundry nearby.

486
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,914
If you know that in advance,
isn't that kind of boring?

487
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,958
You'll forget about today anyway.

488
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,462
That's the nano-receptor.

489
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,720
If you drink it, you can receive data

490
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,515
using the power here.

491
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,102
It's like Wi-Fi in your era.

492
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,605
What happens if I drink it?

493
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,566
Your memories get installed.

494
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,236
-Whose memories?
-Future memories.

495
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,779
Your future memories.

496
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,118
My future memories?

497
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,244
Yeah.

498
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,372
From yesterday until 2035.

499
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,874
Ten years of memories.

500
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,877
Those memories

501
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,920
will get stored deep inside the brain.

502
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,048
When you wake up,
you'll forget everything.

503
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,427
Then what's the point of installing it?

504
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,765
To…

505
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,560
save you.

506
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,409
Buzz, buzz, buzz

507
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,122
The bees are flying

508
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,675
It's convenient, isn't it?

509
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,638
Technology 30 years from now.

510
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,973
You remembered everything?

511
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,142
You came to the shop

512
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,728
in April.

513
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,316
The installation failed, you remember?

514
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,110
During the blackout.

515
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,195
Right.

516
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,073
It was a small blackout

517
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,243
affecting about 3,000 homes.

518
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,621
There was no record of it,

519
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,791
so I had missed it.

520
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,753
Shiki.

521
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,090
Shiki!

522
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,802
Shiki!

523
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,512
The installed memories

524
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,640
-weren't optimized yet.
-Shiki!

525
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,558
So, when you woke up,

526
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,894
you were confused.

527
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,607
The memories that
should've been deep inside

528
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,442
came to the surface,

529
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,445
mixing future and present.

530
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,282
You kept coming here,

531
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,245
looking many times

532
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,540
for your husband, Fumito.

533
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,085
Even though you hadn't even met him yet.

534
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,424
You'd cry, saying he died,

535
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,260
and cry saying he wasn't here.

536
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,638
I couldn't leave you alone,

537
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,308
so I had you live here,

538
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,560
even though it was
one year earlier than planned.

539
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,938
I prepared the same items

540
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,566
as the ones in our future home.

541
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,694
For you to live peacefully.

542
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,032
Instead of me,

543
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,867
I had Mrs. Enjaku visit you.

544
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,203
Eventually, you got better.

545
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,665
But I didn't think you'd need

546
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,753
a replacement husband.

547
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,798
I looked for someone suitable.

548
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,134
Someone with a similar build,

549
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,345
respectful to women,

550
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,555
safe, hardworking,

551
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,307
obsessed with evaluations,

552
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,684
and loyal to his boss.

553
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,853
A strong corporate-slave type.

554
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,482
Him being stingy wasn't an issue.

555
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,943
His name…

556
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,071
was Bunta.

557
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,080
Don't worry.

558
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,791
The nano-receptor left in your body

559
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,918
made memory imprinting easy.

560
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,504
We'll redo the install.

561
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,298
The same vial

562
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,591
is right there.

563
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,314
If you drink it,
the reinstall process will begin.

564
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,358
This time,
your memories will be optimized.

565
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,444
Your confusion will stop.

566
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
You'll feel at ease.

567
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,952
These six months were all a lie.

568
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,789
It was hard, wasn't it?

569
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,460
When the reinstall happens,

570
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,755
you'll lose your memory
of the last six months,

571
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,341
but that's how memory works.

572
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,844
No one…

573
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,971
has a flawless memory.

574
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,892
If I drink it…

575
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,147
I'll forget the last six months?

576
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,483
Yes, and everything
will go back to normal.

577
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,286
Okay.

578
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,589
Goodbye.

579
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,655
Bunty is Bunta.

580
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,327
My Bunty is Bunta.

581
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,665
Not you.

582
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,509
-Bunty…
-Shiki…

583
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,766
I'm surprised.

584
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,436
This can't be happening…

585
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,736
Please…

586
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,572
leave for today.

587
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,492
Shiki…

588
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,786
is saying the same.

589
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,873
You think…

590
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,502
you can give me orders?

591
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,254
Trying to…

592
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,465
erase me like this…

593
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,094
You'll disappear anyway.

594
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,725
Great, now that everyone's here.

595
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,273
Boss!

596
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,276
-What happened?
-Bunta.

597
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,319
What's going on?

598
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,197
It's the perfect opportunity.

599
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,283
-Let's talk about Nonamare.
-Sasuke.

600
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,702
Sorry. Stay here.

601
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,456
All of you were chosen by me.

602
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,543
Under what conditions?

603
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,628
That is to be

604
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,339
outside the decision tree.

605
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,428
Whether you exist or not
doesn't change anything.

606
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,346
If you disappear, no one will notice.

607
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,892
You affect nothing in this world.
That's what you guys are.

608
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,355
If I hadn't given you E-capsules,

609
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,151
all of you would have died this year.

610
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,616
Non amare.

611
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,036
You must not love.

612
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,581
Because none of you…

613
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,877
were needed.

614
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,028
‎My resignation notice.

615
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,072
‎Nice to meet you, Professor Ichimatsu.

616
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,490
‎-Oh!
‎-Ohsuke!

617
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:22,159
‎My whole life has led to this.

618
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,370
‎I have to do this mission.

619
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,247
‎You also love Shiki.

620
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:27,915
‎THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
