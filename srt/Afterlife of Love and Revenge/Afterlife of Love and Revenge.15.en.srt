2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
This is the heirloom
my father left for me!

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,120
Compensate me!

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,360
Are you listening to yourself?

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,120
You ran into me obviously.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,480
How can you blame me?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
Mother,

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,480
help me out.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Are you injured?

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,680
Mother, I'm okay.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,240
Why didn't you watch
where you were going?

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Mother.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,560
I know you well.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,160
You always lie.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,000
I know what vase

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
this is.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
It's only worth a few coins.

18
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,680
How dare you cheat her?

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
Dear,

20
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm coming for you.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm not living anymore.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
Let's take a look.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
Mother, it's okay.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's take a look in there.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
Mother,

26
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,360
it's okay.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,360
Don't worry.

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,560
She won't die.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,560
She won't die?

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,880
(She used this trick
in the previous lifetime)

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,440
(for money as well.)

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,840
(Otherwise,
we would've got cheated again.)

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,160
You're so mean.

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,200
I think she's fine.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,840
Longyue, how did you know that?

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
The rope was cut
before she hung herself.

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Sister,

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,960
why are you so free
to come to our house?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,280
I'm here to visit my good sister.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,840
Why are you crying?

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm not crying.

42
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,400
You're here.

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,920
I heard that your family
has become rich.

44
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Who is that?

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,120
I thought I could be benefited from it.

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
It's her elder sister.

47
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,320
Her husband's family is richer than us.

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,120
Look at your life.

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,080
So, she always bullies
our sister-in-law.

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,160
You don't even have a nice jewellery.

51
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,880
You're so poor.

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,240
So, she needs money to dress herself up?

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's help her today.

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,600
Okay.

55
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,960
Watch this.

56
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,120
Sister-in-law,

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,920
how can you do this by yourself?

58
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
Luckily, you sent the silly maid

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
away.

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,640
But,

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
Qingmu and I have hired
a new maid for you.

62
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,840
She'll be here tomorrow, right?

63
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,320
Yes.

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
A new maid?

65
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,040
You even have a maid?

66
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,120
Sister-in-law,

67
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,600
I know you sisters are
not meeting very often,

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
but you need to manage

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,000
the store.

70
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,440
You're even managing the finance?

71
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,160
Not just that,

72
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
she's managing the whole store.

73
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,880
Why are you so rich

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,200
but you're wearing a torn shirt?

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,560
Be careful.

76
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,320
This is the fabric that we ordered

77
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
from Jiangnan.

78
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
Sister,

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
don't you know about this?

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,480
Are you so outdated?

81
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,080
Of course I know.

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,200
I was just joking with my sister.

83
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Okay.

84
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm relieved that
you're living a good life.

85
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm leaving now.

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,680
Go now.

87
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm not seeing you out. Bye.

88
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,040
I'm not seeing you out.

89
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,280
Sister, take care.

90
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,880
Eat more.

91
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

92
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,520
Here, a piece of red braised meat.

93
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,840
No need.

94
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
I've eaten too much.

95
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,360
Listen to her and eat more.

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,760
Mother.

97
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,840
What about me?

98
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,520
Don't you have hands? Take yourself.

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,680
Here.

100
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,840
One more piece.

101
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,400
Dear, eat this meat.

102
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400
My wife treats me well.

103
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,080
Mother.

104
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,880
Make a paper kite for me.

105
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
What paper kite?

106
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,160
Eat now.

107
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm not eating.

108
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,720
Dear, look.

109
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,800
The imperial examination
is around the corner.

110
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,280
I'm not taking it.

111
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
I think it's good to run a store.

112
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,360
No way.

113
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,840
My husband will become
the deputy chancellor.

114
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,080
Are you trying to chase me away?

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,320
Aren't you afraid that I'll be sad?

116
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Of course not

117
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,560
because

118
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
I'll be going with you.

from the immortal world♪

the tips of my fingers♪
