00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Why are you not running?

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,120
Can you respect my profession?

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,760
Move aside.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,240
Don't you know Mr. Zhao Baidou?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,520
Of course I know him.

10

Isn't this Longyue?

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,120
Where are you going in a rush?

12

Are you going to meet your lover?

13

Shame on you!

Why are you pretending?

Which lover is this?

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,440
You're really famous.

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
Stay low-profile.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
Take it here.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,320
What?

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,520
Are you pretending?

You're not bad.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,520
How's it? Is it enough?

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Not bad.

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Take it as the medical fee.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
How dare you slap me?

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,920
You took away our medicine.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
Didn't you?

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
If you dare touch me again,

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,440
I'll not go easy on you.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,800
Really?

38
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,320
Don't run!

Stop right there!

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,040
They've left?

49
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,240
If you didn't hit Zhao Baidou,

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,640
we wouldn't have known
that he's such a coward.

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,480
So, Zhao Baidou isn't that scary.

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,680
Yes.

53
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,040
My husband and I will be
selling medicine.
