4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,880
Dear.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,960
Didn't you say you'll help me?

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,480
You didn't keep your promise

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,080
and told Qiaoyan about our relationship.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,280
But luckily that happened,

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
and we can publicise our relationship,

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,360
right?

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,400
What have I done to deserve this?

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,360
Mr. Qi.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,320
Mr. Qi.

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
Mr. Qi, something bad happened.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,000
What's wrong?

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,880
Didn't you see I failed the examination?

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,960
What?

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,360
Mr. Chu has just come to
the Chancellor's residence?

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,320
Who are you then?

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,280
Grand Chancellor,

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,480
actually, I wanted to tell you earlier.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,720
I'm not Chu Yuzhi.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,440
I'm Li Qingmu.

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
Longyue is not my servant,

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,920
but my legal wife.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,600
You...

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,800
How dare you.

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,200
Offending Chu family is like
offending our neighbour nation.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,800
It could lead to the war
between two nations.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Okay.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,080
Since you've admitted your mistake,

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
don't blame me for being merciless.

33
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,080
You can just kill me,

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,360
but

35
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,440
Miss Qiaoyan has eloped and...

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,720
Are you threatening me?

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,280
I'm just thinking for your own good.

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,080
Longyue is going to meet

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,400
Chu Yuzhi as Qiaoyan.

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,600
As long as you don't expose her,

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
we can help you

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,280
to solve this problem.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,360
I...

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,720
I trusted you,

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,000
and you

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,640
lied to me together.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,160
You...

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,080
Master.

49
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Grand Chancellor.

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,280
Physician,

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,840
how's my father?

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,080
Mr. Qi,

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,880
Longyue has solved Chu Yuzhi's matter.

54
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,880
Who cares about Chu Yuzhi now?

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,080
My father was sick because of you.

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
If His Majesty found out about this,

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,320
you'll be punished.

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,200
Mr. Qi, don't be angry.

59
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,440
Why not like this?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,560
Let me tell your fortune for you.

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,680
Tell my fortune?

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Got it.

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
The Great Physician will be

64
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
coming to your residence with

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,280
the Full Restore Pill in three days.

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Your father will be healed by then.

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,000
Pang Longyue,

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,320
my father is sick.

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
You're still lying to me.

70
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
You don't believe me, do you?

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let me tell another fortune for you.

72
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,960
In the afternoon on the 5th day
of the 8th lunar month,

73
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,680
the capital will be raining heavily
for three days.

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
Isn't it afternoon now?

75
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,000
This is awesome.

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,560
Pang Longyue, you're great.

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,180
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

78
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:45,140
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:52,060
♪My heart won't change
even if time passes♪

80
00:03:52,060 --> 00:04:00,540
♪I'll wait for the love
in the old place as promised♪
