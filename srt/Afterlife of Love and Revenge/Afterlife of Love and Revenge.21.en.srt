2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,360
Miss Qiaoyan,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,960
listen to our explanation.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,920
It's okay.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,120
This matter

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,440
is easy to be solved.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,480
I can just leave.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,240
I'm really happy.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,640
Let me be frank to you all.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,840
Actually, I have someone I love.

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,640
Also, I'm planning to elope with him.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,160
I was afraid to hurt Mr. Chu.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,920
This is great.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm leaving now.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,640
I'm leaving now.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,720
I wish you all the happiness.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,080
I wish you all the happiness, too.

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,880
Qiaoyan.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,880
Come back if you're not happy.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,400
Let me know that you're safe.

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,400
Jingyu, I got it.

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,520
I'm leaving now.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,960
Okay.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,920
Take care of yourself.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,680
(How do I explain to my father?)

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,360
Such an unfilial daughter.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,920
Father.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,400
You rascal.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
You only told me now.

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,000
You can't even stop
a woman from leaving.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,080
No way.

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,400
I need to send someone
to catch Qiaoyan back.

33
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,160
I can't let her do whatever she likes.

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,760
Master.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,880
Master.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,160
I realised that Mr. Chu and
his servant, Longyue,

37
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,840
are having an affair.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,880
Father.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,600
Listen to me. That's not the case.

40
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,960
I'll handle this matter.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,560
Get back to work.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Father.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,040
You still have me,

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,640
right?

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,160
Let me handle this. Don't worry.

46
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,800
This is great.

47
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Ask Longyue

48
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,920
to hold Chu Yuzhi.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,600
I can then send some to catch Qiaoyan

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,360
back.

51
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,320
Father, that's not what I meant.

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,200
I didn't expect that.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I didn't expect that either.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,440
Dear,

55
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,760
I think Qiaoyan eloped dashingly.

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
Why not...

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,200
Why not we elope, too?

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,680
No way.

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,600
My husband is destined to become
the Deputy Chancellor.

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
The imperial examination
is more important.

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,160
Great.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,960
I've finally got the evidence.

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,240
Someone, come here!

64
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,480
The two adulterers are about to elope!

65
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,560
Master!

66
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,440
Why are you shouting here?

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,800
Master,

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,200
look at how shameless they are.

69
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,680
I just heard about how

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
they're going to elope.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't be ridiculous.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,080
You didn't hear anything.

73
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
You've been in the Chancellor's
residence for so long.

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,520
Haven't you learned of

75
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,400
what not to interfere with?

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,520
From today onwards,

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,960
get out from my residence.

78
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,000
You can never step in here anymore.

79
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Master, I was wrong.

80
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,360
Miss Longyue.

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Mr. Chu.

82
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,320
Please help me to talk to Master.

83
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,480
Madam Zhang,

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
you're old.

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
It's time for you go back
to your hometown.

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,480
Did you hear what Miss Longyue said?

87
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,080
Get lost!

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,680
Yes.

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,980
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,940
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

91
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,860
♪My heart won't change
even if time passes♪

92
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:06,340

in the old place as promised♪
