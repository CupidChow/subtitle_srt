2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,720
I've done writing.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,200
(Master Zhang's Charm)
Come and see, everyone!

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,800
It's given by Master Zhang to dispell
diseases and get rid of disasters.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,600
Is it true?

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,480
Of course!

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,520
- Give me one!
- Me too!

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,840
Here. Everyone will get one.

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,480
Take turn. Everyone will get one.

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,480
Don't be tricked by him.

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,720
Why would Master Zhang
give them the charm?

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,680
Everyone in Qingshui County knows that

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,960
I was possessed by evil spirit.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
If it wasn't for Master Zhang,

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
how would I be healed?

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,640
Longyue, you're great.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
You're so good at lying.

18
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,280
Shuangyue,

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,280
how do you know I'm lying?

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,120
I think you spread the rumour.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,520
Longyue,

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm so sad to hear you say that.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,600
Why would be I harming you?

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
That's right.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,480
Stop pretending.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,680
I've got someone to investigate.

27
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,040
It's you

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,120
who spread the rumour through
Zhao Qianjin and Zhao Baidou.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Today,

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,600
I'll tell you before everyone here.

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll open up Li's medicine store.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,160
I'll also get all your customers.

33
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,000
Longyue, you're so full of yourself.

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,000

Who wants your meat buns?

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,480
Who wants your lousy medicine?

51
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
Your medicine is lousy!

52
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,040
Okay.

53

Dear, rest for a while.
Drink some water.

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,760
I'm not drinking.

What are you talking about?
There are so many people here.
