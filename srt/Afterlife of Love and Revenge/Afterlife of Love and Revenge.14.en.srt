2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,880
You're so busy.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,640
Now, Pei Medicine Store has closed.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,960
Our medicine store has reopened.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,240
Tell me honestly.
How much have you earned?

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,680
After buying over Pei Medicine Store,

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,760
we've used all the money we earned.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,360
Stop telling me that you're poor.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,480
All the chores

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,160
were done by me.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,600
How can you not
share some money with me?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,960
You want to have a share?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Sure.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,200
Really?

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,320
Help out in the store for wages.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,120
After all,

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,960
you just want me to do many chores.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,760
Mother asked you to come, right?

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,040
So what if I asked her to ask you?

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,240
Mother,

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,880
let Qingmu explain to you later.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,080
How dare you say that?

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,800
Qingmu has been influenced by you.

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,480
My son and his wife are rich,

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,600
but you never honour me, your mother.

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,120
I'm just a joke now.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,600
A joke in the entire village.

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Somebody in there?

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,640
(Da Niu)
Somebody in there?

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,120
Da Niu?

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,560
What are you doing here?

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,360
It's Dragon Boat Festival.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,440
I'm here to visit

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
my grandaunt.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
He's ill-intentioned.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right.

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
You must be Pang Longyue.

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,800
Who are you?

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,560
When Li family was building the house,

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
my father contributed the most.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
Half of the house

42
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,280
should be mine.

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
It's fine if you don't want to share it.

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,000
Give me money.

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,720
We have heavy debts.

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,880
We have no money for you.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,760
I don't care!

48
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
I'll not go easy on you!

49
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,320
- Mother!
- Be careful!

50
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,400
What?

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,960
You've earned so much.
Are you trying not to pay me?

52
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,440
It has nothing to do with you
whether we're earning money or not.

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
If you don't give me money today,

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,480
I'll destroy your house.

55
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,600
You just want money, right?
I'll give you money.

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:05,960
Don't be scared.

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
Longyue.

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
That should be enough.

59
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,640
No, this is not enough.

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,320
I didn't even collect rent from you
all these years.

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll come back next time.

62
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,680
Why are you so unreasonable?

63
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,960
Qingmu, he took our money.

64
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Give it back or I'll beat you.

65
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Don't beat me, Niu. I'm scared.

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Here.

67
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,440
Dear.

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,240
Take this, too.

69
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,320
You know your place.

70
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,600
Qingmu.

71
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,560
Da Niu is greedy.

72
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
Giving him money
won't solve the problem.

73
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Mother, I need to go out.

74
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,600
Where are you going?

75
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
Qingmu is really a coward.

76
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
If my husband is still alive,

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,080
we won't be bullied.

78
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
You're a jinx!

79
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,080
You...

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Shut up!

81
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,080
If you ever scold Longyue again,

82
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
I'll not go easy on you!

83
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Let's go.

84
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,000
Come and rest for a while.

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,160
Drink some tea.

86
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Thank you, mother.

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,600
Did you hear that

88
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
the officers are here to arrest someone?

89
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
Who?

90
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
Da Niu.

91
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,880
Da Niu?

92
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,240
I heard that he was charged
for blackmailing others

93
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
and he was arrested

94
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
with evidence.

95
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,200
That's great.

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,600
Qingmu is back.

97
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,720
Did you see how Da Niu was arrested?

98
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,640
Of course.

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,320
Don't say I didn't remind you.

100
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,000
If you don't get the money,

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,800
you'll be embarrassed.

102
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll get Pang Longyue
to give me the money.

103
