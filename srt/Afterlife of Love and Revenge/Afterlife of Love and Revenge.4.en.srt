2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,280
(Madam Jia, Madam Yi)
Let me tell you.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,000
The newly-wed bride in Li family
is a fierce lady.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,160
(Madam Cui)
She bullies her mother-in-law every day.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,520
(Madam Cui)
She only feeds her leftover food.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,360
I heard that she is the

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,280
reincarnation of an evil lady.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,160
She starved her mother-in-law to death.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,720
Not only she starved
her mother-in-law to death,

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,880
she even buried her.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,560
You're good.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,840
You got the news fast.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,080
Yes.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,400
This is bad.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,760
She's burying her.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,400
No, I must tell Madam Zhao.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,080
What are you going to tell Madam Zhao?

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,520
What does Madam Cui know?

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,800
What's going on?

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
How dare you ask me?

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,600
Everyone on the street knows

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,960
you've buried your mother-in-law.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,880
Otherwise,
why are you digging your yard?

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
Ridiculous.

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,320
You spread the rumour

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
and you're asking me here?

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,480
This is my yard.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,880
Can't I dig a hole and plant flowers?

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,200
You're disrespecting me.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,080
You're so impolite.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,240
I was talking to you nicely

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,080
and you scolded me.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,760
Is it me being impolite or you?

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,000
Longyue, how can you talk
to Madam Cui like that?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you arguing about?

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,960
Madam Cui, don't bother her.

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
I must reason it out with her.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm telling you.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,760
I'm not going to lend you money.

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
I want to see how your son can
take his examination in the capital.

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,160
How can you change your mind?

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
What should we do

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,880
when the debt collectors are here?

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,160
That's your family's problem.

45
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,640
No.

46
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,640
Madam Cui, please show mercy.

47
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,240
Zhao family is famous
for being infamous.

48
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,200
You know that.

49
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,880
Didn't we have a deal?

50
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,840
That's before.

51
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,560
Now, you have this jinx.

52
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,800
You old woman, am I a jinx?

53
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,000
If I were jinx,

54
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,360
I'll take your life first.

55
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,120
You evil lady.

56
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,840
- What are you doing?
- Try me.

57
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,640
I'll teach you a lesson today.

58
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,160
Enough.

59
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,760
Move aside.

60
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Qingmu, your wife is rude.

61
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,000
You're Madam Cui.

62
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,600
I almost couldn't recognise you.

63
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,480
We haven't met for a few days

64
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,720
and you've become younger.

65
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Don't lower yourself to her level.

66
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,960
I told her a few days back that

67
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
she's narrow-minded.

68
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,480
Madam Cui's born with
talent and beauty.

69
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,880
How can you be envious?

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,960
Qingmu, you know me well.

71
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
Come on.

72
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,160
Dear, don't you think

73
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
she looks like

74
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
crookneck pumpkin?

75
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,480
Madam Cui.

76
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
Don't be angry.

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
I'll chase her out, okay?

78
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,160
We'll talk after you chase her out.

79
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,560
Stop lying here.

80
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,200
She's just the daughter
of a constable from Lin County.

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
Even her father dislikes her.

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
Why won't I do that?

83
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
You're great.

84
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll lure Qingmu away tomorrow.

85
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,200
Then,

86
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,920
I'll chase this jinx out.

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,660
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

88
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:05,620
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

89
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,540
♪My heart won't change

90
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:21,020
