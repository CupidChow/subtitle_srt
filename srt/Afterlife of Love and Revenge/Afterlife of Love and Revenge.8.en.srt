00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,520
Sister-in-law,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,760
that's our hard-earned money

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,000
from yesterday.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,520
It's also our capital.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,320
How can you just take it away?

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,040
Someone in my family is sick
so I need money.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,800
Could money be more important
than a life?

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,120
But, it was not easy for us

10
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,320
to earn the money yesterday.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
Can't you think for us?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,920
Seeing a physician is more important.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
Sister-in-law, don't worry about
paying back the money.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,880
After a few days,

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,680
I'll pay you back with the interest.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,880
I hope you're telling the truth.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Qingmu.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Look at how you've spoiled her.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,320
Why would I be lying to you?

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,120
Why did you talk like that?

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,120
My money!

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,320
That's all my saving!

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,720
Shut up!

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,120
Who asked you to believe

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,920
those swindlers?

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,040
You were dreaming about getting rich.

27
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,160
Also,

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,600
you even cheated Qingmu's money,

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,920
saying that you need it
for a sick family member.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,720
I think you're sick!

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Think about it!

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,200
The stuff is here.
Did you bring the money?

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
Yes.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
(Man with pockmarks)
Is anyone following you?

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
No, I'm being very careful.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,520
Then who are those two people?

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
You nerd.

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
You don't even know who I am.

39
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
I am

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,520
known as Tea Whirlwind.

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,920
Longyue, what are you doing?

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Give it back to me.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,280
Are you asking for trouble?

44
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,200
Swindler, you're good at acting.

45
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,160
Swindler?

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm a guard

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,120
with a sword.

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,120
Otherwise, I can't get
such good quality tribute tea.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,000
Guard with sword? Tribute tea?

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,920
This is just tree leaves.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Guard?

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,400
I can't believe you've found me
even though

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,440
I've hidden myself for many years.

54
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,040
No...

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes.

56
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,200
They were all killed by me.

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Yes.

58
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
Sir, I was just bluffing.

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm not a guard.

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm just a swindler.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,880
What?

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
I've killed so many people.

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't mind killing one more.

64
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Please show mercy.

65
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
I can't hear anything.

66
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,680
My hearing is bad.

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,600
Let me tell you.

68
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,480
It's too late.

69
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
We've informed the magistrate, right?

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,280
You swindler!

71
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,800
Hold it right there!

72
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
Hu's mother.

73
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,280
This is bad.

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
This is bad.

75
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,720
