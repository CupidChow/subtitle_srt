It's so late already.

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm sleepy.

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,880
I'm going back first.

00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,080
Dear.

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,240
Don't go back

You...

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,040
Hello.

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,080
What are you doing here in the morning?

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,160
You've frightened me.

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,040
I...

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,400
I...

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,000
I missed you.

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
What?

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,920
I missed the herbal tea you made.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,360
Can you not speak
and leave a big pause?

21
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,120
You're sick.

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,400
Well,

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,960
this is a gift for you.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,600
Where did you get this from?

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,240
This...

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,560
Qiaoyan didn't want this.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,520
It's not bad,

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,800
so I picked it up for you.

29
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,720
(Qi Jingyu, why are you so useless?)

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,560
(Can't you just tell her honestly)

31
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,920
(that you bought it for her?)

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,080
Thank you

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
for giving me what she doesn't want.

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,360
No...

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,520
No worries.

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,760
How do you feel after
drinking the herbal tea?

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
It's not as sweet as you.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,640
What? It's sweet?

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,400
What are you doing?

40
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,840
You're here.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,400
I kept this for you.

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,560
This is the

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
"kissing herbal tea" I brewed.

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm not drinking it.

45
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,080
It's not tasty.

46
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,480
He's sick.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,200
He said it was sweet just now.

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Whose bed is this?

49
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,080
Madam Zhang,

50
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,880
it's not mine.

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,320
It belongs to the servant, Longyue.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,800
Really?

53
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
What's going on?

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,320
This is the gift the Grand Chancellor
wanted to give to His Majesty.

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,600
It was stolen yesterday

56
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
and it's found on your bed today.

57
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,600
How dare you, you lowly servant.

58
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,000
You even stole
the Grand Chancellor's good.

59
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
How can you just run your mouth?

60
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
I'd say it's stolen by you.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
How dare you deny?

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,760
Tell me what's going on.

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,120
Miss Longyue didn't come back
last night.

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,720
She only came back at dawn secretly.

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,680
You must have gone to steal.

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,680
I'm innocent.

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,720
I didn't steal anything.

68
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,640
Who can prove it?

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,640
- I can prove that.
- I can prove that.

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,880
- She was with me last night.
- She was with me last night.
