2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,320
Hold it right there!

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,840
Where are you going?

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,960
I'm Mr. Chu's servant.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Surely I'm looking for Mr. Chu.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,160
Mr. Chu is being with Miss Qiaoyan.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,840
Who are you to go disturb them?

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
Brush the manure bucket.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,480
Do I need to brush it so clean

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,360
for you use it as bowl to eat?

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,040
How dare you talk back?

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,120
You...

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,880
Mr. Chu,

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,800
this servant is rude.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,240
I'm disciplining her for you.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,560
Madam Zhang, you're right.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,760
She doesn't seem like
she can do any chores.

18
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,760
She doesn't know
how a clean thing looks like,

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,680
that's why she was quibbling.

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,160
Why not

21
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,560
you show her, Madam Zhang?

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Look carefully.

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,720
Great!

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
Madam Zhang can brush it so well.

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm worried for others to handle this.

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,840
Madam Zhang, I'll let you
do this from now on.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,720
Okay.

28
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
This is weird.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,520
What's Chu Yuzhi's relationship

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,160
with that servant?

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,400
This is not right.

32
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,400
Li Qingmu,
come out here! Where are you?

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,960
Dear, are you looking for me?

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,600
Who are you calling?

35
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,960
I think Miss Qiaoyan looks
more like your wife.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,280
I shall look for her then.

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,240
I dare you.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,240
My wife is angry.

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,880
I wonder how you'll stop being angry?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
I'm not angry.

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,440
You've finally admitted
that you're my wife.

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
I dare you to do that again.

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,520
Now, things have become like this.

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,400
I wonder what we should do next.

45
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,640
We can only take one step at a time

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,600
and plan slowly.

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,600
But,

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,240
you must not push me away anymore.

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,560
Otherwise, something bad might happen.

50
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,160
What's that?

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
If we stop being intimate,

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
I'm afraid I'd forget who my wife is.

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,360
You're good.

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,600
Say it again

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,520
and I'll pinch you.

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,440
I was wrong.

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,760
Sir, I told you to

58
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,280
be careful when you eat.

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Mr. Qi is here.

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,720
I'll leave you both.

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm leaving now.

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
You two...

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,320
(It's all Qing Jingyu's fault.)

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,360
(If it wasn't for him,)

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,080
(Qingmu will not impersonate Chu Yuzhi)

66
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,200
(and I don't have
to stay at this place.)

67
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,840
Madam Zhang,

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,520
your new clothes are nice.

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,200
The material is obviously
the premium coloured brocade.

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,320
Of course.

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
This is given to me by Miss Qiaoyan.

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,200
I've

73
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,120
made the latest design.

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,960
We need to wear decently to work.

75
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,480
Unlike someone

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
who is wearing a torn dress.

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,960
I thought she's begging for food
in the street.

78
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,960
This material is the tribute
from the western region.

79
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,240
Not everyone knows how to appreciate it.

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Forget it.

81
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,240
Longyue,

82
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,840
Mr. Chu is looking for you.

83
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,360
Okay.

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,480
You don't say.

85
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,920
Her dress really looks unique.

86
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,600
What's unique?

87
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,520
Get back to work.

88
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,720
Yes.

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,640
What?

90
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
You missed me for not
seeing me for half a day?

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,380
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

92
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,340
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

93
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,260
♪My heart won't change
even if time passes♪

94

in the old place as promised♪
