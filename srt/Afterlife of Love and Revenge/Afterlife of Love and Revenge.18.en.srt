2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,880
Listen to my explanation.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,920
I knew you have
an unusual relationship.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,880
Dear, you're here. Hurry.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,600
So, you distracted me

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
to test our relationship.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,640
How dare you betray my sister?

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,200
Move now. I need to tell my father.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,800
Go ahead.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,600
I wanted to help you in
this year's imperial examination.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,600
Mr. Qi, it seems like
you don't need it anymore.

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,320
You'll help me?

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,600
I don't believe that.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
You don't have to believe me.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,160
You can just wait and get whipped

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,840
on your bottom by the Grand Chancellor

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,720
as the previous years.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,800
How long did you rest in the room
last year?

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,840
Five months.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,760
How will you help me?

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
No need to bother about that.

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,440
Don't forget.

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,880
I, Chu Yuzhi,

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,920
am the famous genius.

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,040
If I said I'll help
you get the top scholar's title,

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
it will happen.

27
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,960
You said so.

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,000
However,

29
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,480
I have a condition.

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
You can't tell others about

31
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,360
my relationship with Longyue.

32
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Deal.

33
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,080
Mr. Qi,

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
do we have to be so mean?

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
We need to humble her.

36
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,400
This is what you should do.

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
Why should I brush
all these chamber pots?

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Just obey my word.

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,600
Stop talking.

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,320
What's going on?

41
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,280
This is Mr. Qi's command.

42
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,320
Why is she not brushing it?

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,640
Mr. Qi is...

44
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Mr. Qi.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,480
What's going on?

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,200
Mr. Qi, she's disobeying you.

47
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
She's not willing to
brush the chamber pots.

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,880
She even used Mr. Chu as an excuse.

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,720
How dare you.

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,520
Madam Zhang,

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,840
you got it wrong.

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,160
When did I say

53
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not brushing it?

54
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,480
Mr. Qi,

55
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,600
I like you so much.

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
Why would I not listen to you?

57
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
I know you're not that daring.

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,800
That's right.

59
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
What are you doing?

60
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,880
Stay away from me.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,560
Are you despising me?

62
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,840
Don't come near.

63
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,520
Stay away from me.

64
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,400
It's so smelly.

65
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,120
You...

66
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,640
Stupid servant.

67
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,880
Luckily I ran away quickly.

68
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,160
It's frightened me.

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
What's this?

70
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,800
It's so hot. I'm suffering.

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,200
Don't come near.

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,120
What are you doing?

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,520
You're sweating a lot.

74
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Your body is heaty.

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,400
Here.

76
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
I've brewed herbal tea for you.

77
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
You'll be fine after drinking this.

78
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not drinking it.

79
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Did you put something in there?

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Mr. Qi,

81
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,400
I brewed this for you.

82
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Drink it.

83
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm not drinking it.

84
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,520
Will you drink it or not?

85
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,080
Will you drink it or not?

86
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,080
I'm drinking it.

87
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Be nice. Drink it yourself.

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,760
How is it?

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,280
It's

90
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
so tasty.

91
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,800
Stop frightening yourself from now on.
