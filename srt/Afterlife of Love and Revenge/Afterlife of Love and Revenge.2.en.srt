00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,640
Longyue,

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,840
you weren't willing to marry me,
were you?

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,600
They're all spreading the rumour

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,160
that I'm a woman of easy virtue.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,280
Do you believe that?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,200
That's great.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
They all said that I'm a pervert.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,160
We're

10
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,720
a match made in heaven.

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,200
(Looking at him now,)

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,400
(my husband is quite handsome.)

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,880
(I shall not hesitate.)

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
Longyue, are you awake?

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm going back.

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,800
Longyue, I'm afraid you're not
used to doing chores.

17
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,120
So, I've asked a servant to stay here.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,880
(Pei Jinheng)
Longyue,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,760
(Pei Jinheng)
don't marry him.

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,720
(Pei Jinheng)
Come with me.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,040
Look at you.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,120
It seems like

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
the rumour about you
being a woman of easy virtue

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,480
is real!

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,120
No.

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,560
On the first day of your marriage,

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,600
(Mother in law)
you've brought the adulterer home.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
No, I...

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,480
Shut up!

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,840
(Constable Pang)
Why did I have

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,440
a shameless daughter like you?

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,360
From now on,

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,080
you're no longer a part of Pang family.

34
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
(It seems like Shuangyue)

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,920
(kept Pei Jinheng here as a trap)

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,160
(in the previous life.)

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,160
This man is useless

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
and broke.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,360
Once I've thought of how
you need to suffer

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,520
with a loser like him for
the rest of your life,

41
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,400
I really think it's unfair for you.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,960
How great would it be
if I can get married to Jinheng.

43
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
Longyue,

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,640
I'll give you a surprise.

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Come with me quickly.

46
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,480
Jinheng is inside the room.

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,600
Longyue!

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,920
Longyue!

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,160
Someone!

50
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,240
It's on fire!

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Longyue!

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
There's someone in there! Save her!

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,680
Shuangyue?

54
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,040
You're shameless.

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,720
You're not my daughter!

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,400
Father.

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,320
Father, listen to my explanation.

58
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,800
It's Longyue.

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,480
She wanted to have an affair
with Pei Jinheng

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,120
and she locked me in the woodshed.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
You know that

62
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Longyue and Pei Jinheng
were childhood sweethearts.

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,880
They've been in love.

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
Say something.

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,640
I...

66
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
I'm indeed here to meet Longyue.

67
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,600
Longyue,

68
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,200
you're shameless.

69
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
It's obvious that
they're having an affair,

70
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,800
why are you scolding me?

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,040
You...

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Father,

73
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
Longyue was with me all the time.

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,640
She didn't go to the woodshed.

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,600
Father, did you hear that?
It's obviously...

76
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,320
Shut up!

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
If your sister didn't find out about

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,840
how you're having an affair,

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,320
I wouldn't have let you marry him.

80
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,840
Now, even your sister has been

81
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,760
influenced by you.

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,960
Constable Pang.

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,320
This is your family matter.

84
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Please handle it back home.

85
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,040
Li Qingmu!

86
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,120
How dare you!

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
Since you don't want to admit Longyue,

88
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,000
she'll no longer be your daughter.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,840
She'll be Li Qingmu's wife.

90
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
No one in the world can bully my wife.

91
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
Not even

92
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,000
you.

♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,140
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

95
