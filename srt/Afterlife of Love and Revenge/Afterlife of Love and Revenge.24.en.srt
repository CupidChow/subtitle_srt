00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,280
Grand Chancellor.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,320
How do you feel now?

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,920
I've never been better.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,320
Thanks to Great Physician's medicine.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,720
No way. She doesn't know
anything about medicine.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
Let me get Mr. Qi here.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,880
Grand Chancellor,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,280
this is the Full Restore Pill.
Please take it now.

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,240
Hurry.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,520
Grand Chancellor.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,960
Father.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,120
Father.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
What did you feed him?

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
Wasn't my father healed?

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,160
There's poison in the medicine.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,720
Pang Longyue, how dare you
poison the Grand Chancellor?

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,800
You can't frame me like that.

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,880
The Grand Chancellor didn't even
drink Longyue's medicine.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,400
You simply used the wrong medicine.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,920
The Grand Chancellor was just having
his qi messed up

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,280
and he woke up for a while.

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,440
Think carefully.

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,120
If you keep defending her,

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,920
you'll be beheaded together with her!

26
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,440
You...

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
Lock her up in the storeroom first.

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
I'll investigate the matter.

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,960
Longyue,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,480
if you really did it,

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,600
I can't help you.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:25,760
Who is it?

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,400
Sir,

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
there's darkness on your forehead.

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
You'll encounter bad things lately.

36
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,800
You shouldn't do the night watch.

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,680
Shut up.

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,360
Ghost!

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,520
It can't be.

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,080
Ghost!

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,720
Ghost!

42
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,040
You're a pervert.

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
Father, wake up.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,320
Great Physician.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Are you able to save my father?

46
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,720
Pang Longyue used the strong poison.

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm afraid the Grand Chancellor
can't make it.

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,440
I have a solution.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I have a great medicine

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,360
that can save
the Grand Chancellor's life.

51
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,000
It's Longyue's poisonous medicine again?

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,200
Mr. Qi.

53
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,440
I can't take the risk anymore.

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,880
I got it.

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't move.

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Get up.

57
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,400
Li Qingmu,

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,160
are you really going to die for her?

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Longyue,

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,720
come in.

61
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:38,920
Go get

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,320
the Grand Chancellor up.

63
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,840
Madam Li, they want
to kill the Grand Chancellor.

64
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,400
Go now.

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,240
Mr. Qi, her medicine is poisonous.

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,360
It's working.

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,840
Father.

68
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:57,680
Dear.

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,120
Father.

70
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,160
Father!

71
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,640
Father!

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,720
Guards!

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,560
Guards!

74
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
Arrest them!

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,240
Arrest them!

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,040
Mr. Qi, they're harming
the Grand Chancellor.

77
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
They're rebelling!

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,960
I want to kill you all!

79
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,880
Father.

80
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Father, you're awake.

81
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
Great Physician,
after taking the medicine,

82
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,640
I'm full of vitality now.

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
What I had yesterday was poison.

84
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,120
The second medicine

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,080
that I took is the medicine
that healed me.

86
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,160
Great Physician, you looked young,

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,720
but you're capable.

88
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,040
I want to return you the favour
for saving me.

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
If you're willing,

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,040
I want to take you as my goddaughter.

91
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,080
What

92
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,200
do you think?

93
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Sister?

94
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,040
Miss Longyue.

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
You changed your attitude so fast.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,880
No way.

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
This can't be possible.

98
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
Arrest this useless physician.

99
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,880
This can't be possible.

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
This can't be possible!

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
This can't be possible!

102
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,400
Thank you.

103
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,840
Thank you.

104
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,880
You should

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
thank Miss Longyue.

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
She begged for mercy for you

107
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,960
and the Grand Chancellor forgave you.

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,680
Thank you, Longyue.

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,720
However,

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,520
she asked me to tell you that

111
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,680
you shall

112
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,840
never appear before her anymore.

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
From today onwards,

114
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,240
you'll be my goddaughter.

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,200
Qi family will be your family.

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,680
Just let me know if you need anything.

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Thank you, godfather.

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,640
I have an idea.

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,680
I want to hold a wedding
with my wife once again.

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
I want to hold the banquet again.

121
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,840
We did it hastily last time.

122
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,760
Your family didn't even attend it.

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,840
Now, you have a family.

124
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,160
I want to give you a grand ceremony.

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,240
I want to tell everyone that

126
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,360
you're my wife, Li Qingmu's wife.

127
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Dear.

128
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,720
Dear, you're back.

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,480
Getting married is tiring.

130
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,120
I even fell asleep.

131
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,400
Today is our wedding.

132
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,480
Let's do something different.

133
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Just in time.

134
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
I also have an idea.

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
I wonder if you can do it with me.

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,480
What's it?

137
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,080
Not bad.

138
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
You looked better than me

139
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,280
when you're wearing
the wedding dress.

145
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,880
Here's His Majesty's edict.

146
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
Li Qingmu, the scholar from
Qingshui County of 23rd year of Liang

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,400
is the top scholar.

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,200
He'll be awarded with 500 taels of gold
and 300 taels of silver.

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
He'll become the Deputy Chancellor

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,280
and take office immediately.

I'm okay.

164
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,240
He's resigned.

165

He said he wants to work in the
paddy field with you in the hometown.

He doesn't listen to me
