2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,920
Miss Zhao, are you
going home for a meal?

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,960
Don't come near. Help!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Miss Zhao!

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,320
Why is the rain getting heavier?

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,280
What's wrong? Why are they running?

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
You need to give us
an explanation today!

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,200
That's right!

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,760
Master Zhang from Puning Temple
said that

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
Pang Longyue's possessed by evil spirit.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,080
Master Zhang has left Puning Temple.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,880
It must be a rumour.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,760
If we don't kill the devil,

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,680
the whole village will
be killed instead.

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,720
How do you want to deal with her?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,080
Divorce her

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,440
and chase her out.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,080
Some experts will kill her.

19
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,400
Chase her out!

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,680
Qingmu.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,520
Our yang qi will be sucked away

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,600
when one's being possessed.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm not young anymore.

24
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't want to see you die.

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,960
Okay.

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll invite everyone here
to see how I kill the devil.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,320
Okay.

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,160
Someone's killed!

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
I didn't get it wrong.
She's Pang Longyue.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,920
This is bad luck. Chase her away.

31
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
Why should I? You go.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,720
You go.

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,400
When is the rain going to stop?

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,720
It's so late now.

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,440
Why isn't Longyue home?

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,520
Didn't she hear anything

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,400
and dare not come home?

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,080
After all, Master Zhang is famous.

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,680
Yes.

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Where are you going?

41
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,520
I'll go pick her up.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
No.

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,720
Who knows
if you're going to tip her off?

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
Madam Cui.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
I sleep with her every day.

46
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
Maybe I got some back luck from her.

47
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Don't blame me

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,040
if you're infected.

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,720
You...

50
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,640
Don't come near.

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,280
Don't leave!

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,400
Where are you going?

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
Is that Longyue?

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,480
Aunt!

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,680
Aunt!

56
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,280
Ghost!

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,520
Hu, don't be afraid. Come to me.

58
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,320
Ghost!

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,320
Ghost!

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,680
Dear, I'm home.

61
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,360
Dear, why are they running?

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Qingmu.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Them?

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,160
They're competing.

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,880
Look at the blood.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,680
The evil spirit has manifested.

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,120
Blood?

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
The dress' colour is fading.

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,000
Look.

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop giving reasons.

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,120
If we don't kill you,

72
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
the whole village will be killed.

73
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
Come here! Kill her!

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,560
Kill her!

75
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
Move aside!

76
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
You said the devil will
suck your yang qi.

77
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,320
If she can't suck my yang qi,

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,280
does that prove that she's not devil?

79
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
How do you prove that?

80
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,160
Of course I can prove it.

81
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,740
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

82
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:48,700
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

83
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:55,620
♪My heart won't change
even if time passes♪

84
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:04,100
♪I'll wait for the love
in the old place as promised♪
