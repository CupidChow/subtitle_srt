00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,240
Dear, we're about to reach the capital.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,400
It must be tiring for you.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,800
Your belonging!

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,360
That person is weird.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,800
Be careful!

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm the constable's daughter.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,120
Do you think that
you can bully us easily?

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,600
You lowly servant,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
how dare you attack me?

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,040
Go take her down

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,120
and send her to the court.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,080
Hold on. What about you
who attacked me first?

(Qi Jingyu)

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,800
I just wanted to see
if you can protect my sister

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,480
or not as my brother-in-law.

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Brother-in-law?

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,160
Brother-in-law?

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,000
Come on, Chu Yuzhi.

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,600
Have you forgotten about me?

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm Qi Jingyu.

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,360
Although we last met...

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
Although we last met 10 years ago,

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,120
I remember the jade that

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,120
you're wearing.

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,920
This is the gift my father gave
to my future brother-in-law.

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,640
Qi...

28
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,640
Qi Jingyu?

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,920
I remember now.

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,280
You're the useless young master
that didn't get to pass

31
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,920
the imperial examination
for eight times.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
I have yet to take
my eighth examination.

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,440
How dare you.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,080
You beat me up and cursed me?

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:21,960
Mr. Qi,

36
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,480
even if she's a servant,

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,760
she's my family's servant.

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,400
Mr. Qi, are you trying to
show off your power

39
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,040
as soon as we met?

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Since my brother-in-law
is speaking for you,

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,800
I'll just let this slide

42
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
and let you go.

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,080
Quickly come back with me.

44
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,760
Let's go.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Dear,

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,160
why did you say that you're Mr. Chu?

47
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Dear,

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,320
Mr. Qi is arrogant

49
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,280
and revengeful.

50
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,440
If I told him that I'm not Chu Yuzhi,

51
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,080
he will not go easy on you.

(Grand Chancellor Qi)
Mr. Chu Yuzhi.

57

We have a guest.

58
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,400
Greetings, Grand Chancellor.

59
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Don't call me that.

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,440
Call me father-in-law.

61
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,840
After more than 10 years,

62
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
you've become more handsome.

63
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,080
You're indeed General Chu's son.

64
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,200
Father asked me to send his regards.

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,720
Okay, I've discussed with your father.

66
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,600
We'll both hold the wedding banquet.

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,360
We'll hold it here first.

68
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
Quickly get Qiaoyan here

69
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,520
to meet her fiance.

70
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,440
Father,

71

Go ahead.

73
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Come and have a seat.

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
You lowly servant,

75
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
why are you still standing here?

76
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
We don't have enough servants.

77
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Go and help out.

78
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,920

Go!

85
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm Mr. Chu's servant.

86

I can't do this.

87
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Stop mumbling.
