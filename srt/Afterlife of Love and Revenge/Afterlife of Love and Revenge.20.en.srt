00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,640
- She was with me last night.
- She was with me last night.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
Mr. Qi and I

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,160
were studying together
the whole night yesterday.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,920
Longyue was helping us
to prepare the ink

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,080
and never left.

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,280
Yes.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,680
This jade bracelet

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,320
must be placed here by someone

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
to frame Longyue.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
There are only

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,520
the two of you here.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,200
How dare you.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,920
It's you, lowly servant.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,200
Mr. Qi and Mr. Chu,

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,800
I'll chase her out.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,680
It's not me.

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,200
It's not me, Madam Zhang.

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
Enough.

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,880
Since the bracelet is found,

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,320
just let it slide.

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,000
Stop giving her a hard time.

24
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,360
Just do as Longyue said.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
If there's next time,

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,840
I'll not forgive you.

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,560
Yes.

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,440
(Why did this lowly servant)

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
(do to Mr. Qi and Mr. Chu?)

30
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,720
(Even Mr. Qi favours her now.)

31
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,560
Ever since we came to
the Grand Chancellor's residence,

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,640
life has been tough.

33
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,440
Life is difficult.

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
Will you accept this?

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,560
Longyue...

36
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Chu Yuzhi?

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,240
Come on, Qi Jingyu.

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm warning you.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
It's impossible for you two.
Don't you...

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,560
No.

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,080
I wanted to give the flower to you,
Longyue.

42
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
I like you.

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,080
Me?

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320
It's impossible.

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,680
Here you go.

46
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,600
Why are you giving me a bronze mirror?

47
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
I want you to check on yourself.

48
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,600
You looked ugly,

49
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
but you think too much.

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
How dare you scold me?

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,840
Longyue, think carefully.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,800
If I marry you,

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,320
you'll become my first wife.

54
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,040
He can only marry you as a concubine.

55
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,400
Let me tell you.

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,240
No matter what happens,

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm not going to be with you.

58
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,600
Is it possible to be with him?

59
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,680
Would you rather be his concubine?

60
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,400
Of course.

61
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,840
(Of course.)

62
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
(I'm his legal wife.)

63
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,400
Fine, I'm leaving.

64
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm so frustrated.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm so frustrated.

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,120
She'd rather become a concubine
than marry me.

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,440
(Qi Qiaoyan)

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,120
Jingyu.

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,600
What's wrong?

70
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,600
Qiaoyan, it's good that you're here.

71
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,800
I have something important to tell you.

72
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,320
Go ahead.

73
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,520
Chu Yuzhi

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
is in a relationship with his servant.

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,920
They're in a relationship.

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
What?

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,880
I've seen it myself.

78
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,560
Really?

79
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
I'll bring you there to expose them.

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,320
I wonder what Qi Jingyu's thinking.

81
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
He hated me a couple of days back.

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,040
Now, he has changed.

83
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,240
That's because my wife is too charming.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,720
Did you hear that?

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
He called her his wife.

86
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Could this be my fault then?

87
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,920
How can I blame you?

88
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
I mean

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
it's all my fault.

90
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,920
I shouldn't have let you

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,160
act as my servant.

92
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,600
Did you hear that?

93
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,400
He doesn't even care about you.

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,240
But we can't help it.

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
Miss Qiaoyan, listen to my explanation.

96
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,080
We are...

♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

98
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,860
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

99
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,780
♪My heart won't change

♪I'll wait for the love
in the old place as promised♪
