(Three Years Ago)
Where did the witch go?

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,920
She's been married for so long yet she
doesn't want to consummate her marriage.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,160
(Pang Longyue)
She was abandoned by her family.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,680
She thought she's a young lady
from the family of a constable?

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,680
So what if you're the deputy chancellor?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,240
I'll kill myself if you come closer!

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,520
Longyue, it's me.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
Shuangyue.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,520
It's okay now, Longyue.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
I've convinced father now.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,080
(Pang Shuangyue)
He asked me to take you home.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,680
Father has finally believed
that I'm innocent?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,920
It's okay now, Longyue.

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,000
Longyue!

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,640
It's okay now.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,360
Longyue!

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Where are you?

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,920
Let's run! Hurry!

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,520
Be careful.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,640
No, Shuangyue.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,720
They're about to catch up with us.

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,480
Longyue, I can't run anymore.

24
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,080
Help!

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
Let me out!

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
Help!

(Li Qingmu)
My dear, it's dangerous.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,160
Quickly follow me home.

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,000
You beast.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,800
I'll never consummate
the marriage with you.

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,880
Longyue, you've got me wrong.

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,480
Longyue.

34
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,320
Shuangyue, let's go.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Longyue.

36
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,040
Longyue,

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,560
where are you going?

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,280
Shuangyue.

Qingmu.

42
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,520
Run now.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,480
Shuangyue,

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,040
why?

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm your sister.

46
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,080
You're my sister.

47
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
You're the eldest daughter that

48
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
gets everyone's favour since young.

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,480
I told father that

50
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,240
you're having an affair
with Pei Jinheng.

51
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,720
As long as you're chased out
of the house,

52
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,480
father will only have me.

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,120
Throw them both into the coffin.

Okay.

59

I'm not touching you.

60
