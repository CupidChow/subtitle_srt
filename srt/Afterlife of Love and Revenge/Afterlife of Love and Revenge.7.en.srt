00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,880
How are we going to pay the debt?

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,960
The imperial examination is coming
in another month.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,840
We can't even pay the debt.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,280
How will we have the money
for you to go to the capital?

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,080
I heard that your sister and her husband

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,800
have opened a medicine store
in the market.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,680
Their business is good.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,520
Why not

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,200
you go and borrow money from her?

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,160
Her husband?

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,000
Pang Shuangyue and Pei Jinheng

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
were having an affair at our place.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,680
Who else can she marry

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,240
if not him?

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,840
No need to look for her.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,080
I'll go to the market tomorrow
with Qingmu

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,520
and earn money with him.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,880
What if you can't earn any money?

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,200
If we can't earn any money...

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,120
If we can't earn any money,
we won't come back.

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,720
Okay.

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,320
That's what you said.

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
Don't miss this!

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,240
Miss,

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
do you need some medicine?

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,200
Sir, buy some medicine.

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,280
We just dug this out.

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Buy some.

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
It's not easy for you, dear.

31

Wipe your sweat.

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,400
Many people are looking at us.

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,160
No one is looking at us now.

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,040
Get out!

35
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,720
How do you buy medicine
if you have no money?

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,600
(Pei Medicine Store)
Get lost.

37
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,280
It's a misunderstanding.

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,680
I just forgot to bring my wallet.

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,080
The patient is dying now.

40

How much is he owing you?

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,480
Do you have money?

57

Isn't that just noble dendrobium?

58

We have it, too.

I heard that you're in heavy debt.

64

So, I thought you're not
having a good life.

65

I'm not sure
if you're having a good life,

67

we're living a good life.

You're just lying.

I wish your business prospers.
