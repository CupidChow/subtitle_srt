00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,160
What time is it now?

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,240
Won't you start cooking?

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,040
This is bad.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,280
She hit her sister-in-law.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
What's going on now?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,360
How dare you.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,480
You beat your sister-in-law today.
Will you be burning the house tomorrow?

9

I...

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Li family doesn't want a wife like you.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Get lost.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,000
I have no time for you.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,440
Stop looking.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,800
Qingmu went to his granduncle's house
in Lin County.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,360
He can't help you.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,160
The breakfast is so hot.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
I think you're planning to kill me.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm sorry, mother.

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
I'll make sure it's turned cold
before giving it to you.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,040
Please don't chase me out.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,880
Make sure you understand

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,800
this is Li family's residence,

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,760
not your home.

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,120
I'm sorry, mother.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
Mother.

Why are you here?

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,040
Don't move.

29
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,280
Put it down.

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,600
Put it down.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,880
This is Li family's residence,
not my house.

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,200
I'll leave by myself.

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,240
(Not only will I not be bullied,)

34

(I'll live a carefree life.)

35
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Mother, this is weird.

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
Why do we keep losing things at home?

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
I didn't get to eat any tasty food.

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,840
It's all gone in a split second.

39
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Yes.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,760
Even the liquor in the jar
is getting lesser.

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Did the thief come in?

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,800
Look around.

43
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,680
There's no one.

44
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
Was it taken away by a stray cat?

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
Where did you come from, thief?

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,900

That's right.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,480
I'm Li Qingmu's future wife,

51
