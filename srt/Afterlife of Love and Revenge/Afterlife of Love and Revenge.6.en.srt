2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,320
Get out.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,120
If Qingmu didn't insist on marrying you,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
you can never enter
Li family's residence.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,160
It's good that you're here.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,080
There's a score I need to even with you.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,200
What?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
Why are you pretending?

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,200
Get down from my bed now.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,000
Your bed?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,120
Lanhua is my chosen daughter-in-law.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,440
Granduncle gave us some money

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,120
but Qingmu used it to
buy medicine for you.

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,640
Aren't you a jinx?

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,320
Get out of Li family.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,760
Forget it.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,160
I'm

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,760
kind.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll just keep you here as a maid.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm a little thirsty.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,720
What are you waiting for?
Pour some tea for her!

22
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,520
Useless!

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,920
Don't you even know how to brew tea?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,720
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,680
The medicine store is still losing
and owing others money.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,120
My father

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,520
has prepared the money to

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,640
pay his son-in-law's debt.

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,000
What a shame that

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,080
Qingmu can't become his son-in-law.

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,720
Otherwise, he doesn't have to worry
about the examination fee.

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,520
Then,

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,280
Qingmu would rather have debt
than marry you.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
Why is that?

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Pang Longyue!

36
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,440
I wanted to keep you here as a maid!

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,880
Don't force me to chase you out
and sleep in the street.

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,160
Okay, don't be angry.

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,640
Let me pour you some tea.

40
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,040
That's more like it.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,240
I didn't hold it tight.

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,440
You did it on purpose!

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,440
Let me pour you another cup.

45
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,880
Hurry up!

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,920
You...

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,880
Me what?

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,560
Mother!

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Mother!

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,440
Mother, she was hiding in the closet,
eating and having fun.

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,280
I found out

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
and she's bullying me.

53
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,840
Who?

54
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,040
Me.

55
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,040
I've chased you out.

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
How dare you come back?

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,280
In this house,

58
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,440
no one else has the right to
chase me out besides Qingmu.

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,800
You bad girl.

60
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,800
Okay.

61
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Let me show you
if I have the right or not.

62
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,720
You unfilial son.

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
If you keep protecting her,

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
I'll disown you.

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,040
I'll listen to you.

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,240
I'll divorce Longyue and marry Lanhua.

67
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,360
Really?

68
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,320
Dear.

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,840
Yes.

70
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
Lanhua is still better.

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
You've finally come to your senses.

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,920
Chen family is so generous.

73
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
We must treat Lanhua well.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,240
You all know that

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Lanhua wants to get
some maids, don't you?

76
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
My requirements are not high.

77
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,200
I just need two maids.

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,880
We can't afford to hire a maid.

79
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,840
From now on,

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,760
sister-in-law and mother
will become the maids.

81
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,120
Mother is not young anymore.

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
How can she do the chores?

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,200
Don't worry.

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,920
She's just assisting you.

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,000
You have to do most of the chores.

86
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,400
No.

87
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,560
Mother,

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,040
we're not able to serve a rich lady.

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,680
Mother, who do you think

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,360
is better between Lanhua and Longyue?

91
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,560
Longyue is better.

92
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,480
Mother!

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
If that won't work,

94
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,880
I just want Pang Longyue as my maid.

95
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,560
No way.

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,440
Why?

97
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,120
Because Longyue is my wife.

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
You're too much!

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,100
♪You're the fated love coming
from the immortal world♪

100
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:53,060
♪You tie the red strings on
the tips of my fingers♪

101
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,980
♪My heart won't change
even if time passes♪

102
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:08,460
♪I'll wait for the love
in the old place as promised♪
