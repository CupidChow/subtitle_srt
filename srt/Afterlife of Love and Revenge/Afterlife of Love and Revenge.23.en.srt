2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,080
Longyue, you're awesome.

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,400
The Great Physician is here.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,640
Just listen to him.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
His Full Restore Pill will be
able to heal your father.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,520
My father will be fine.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,480
Great Physician.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,480
Great Physician.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Shuangyue?

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,000
Let me go in.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,200
She's helping my father inside.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,080
Let me tell you.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,440
She's not the Great Physician.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,880
She's my little sister, Pang Shuangyue.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:38,960
Great Physician.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,400
Grand Chancellor has taken the medicine.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
He'll be healed in three days.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,360
Pang Longyue,

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,160
I saved you from your sickness

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,400
and you owed me one.

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,200
I didn't expect that

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,360
you hated me until now just because

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,720
I exposed how you were
selling fake medicine.

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,720
You're being ridiculous

25
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,000
and jeopardising my reputation.

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm being ridiculous?

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,160
This is great, Pang Shuangyue.

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,760
Would you dare swear
that you're not Pang Shuangyue?

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
If I'm not the Great Physician,

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
my whole family will die.

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
How could you say that?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,300
(Great Physician)

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,720
Where did you get the name tag?

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
What did you do to the Great Physician?

35
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,480
Qi Jingyu,

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
she's not the Great Physician.

37
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Believe me.

38
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,960
But, she has the name tag.

39
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,680
But, have you forgotten that
I'm the Great Fortune Teller?

40
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,880
The Great Fortune Teller?

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,280
I can do fortune-telling, too.

42
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
Seriously?

43
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,800
Great Physician, please tell my fortune.

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
You need to eat every day.

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,320
You're scared of coldness in the winter.

46
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,000
You're scared of heat in the summer.

47
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,060
Scared of cold in winter,
scard of heat in summer.

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,360
Great Physician, you're so right!

49
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,960
Longyue, she's so right!

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Come on, Qi Jingyu.

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,320
Are you an idiot?

52
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,680
Pang Shuangyue, let me tell you.

53
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,360
Shut up.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,320
Don't be rude to the Great Physician.

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,880
Let me tell you.

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,200
I have the formula of Full Restore Pill.

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,120
If you don't listen to me,

58
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
just wait for your father
to go to heaven.

59
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,560
Put me down, Qi Jingyu!

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
Pang Shuangyue, you'll regret this!

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can your Full Restore Pill
really heal the Grand Chancellor?

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
I'm sure it can.

63
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,280
Okay.

64
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,880
Get the medicine prepared

65
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,680
and we'll find a chance to
feed it to the Grand Chancellor.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
Mr. Li.

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,400
This is for you.

68
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,480
Is the sun rising from the west?

69
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,080
Don't you only love Pang Longyue?

70
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,760
I was young and childish.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,560
Do you think I'll believe you?

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,960
It's up to you.

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,160
After all,

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,600
the flower is here.

75
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Forget it.

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,360
I regret it.

77
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,880
You...

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,960
What are you doing?

79
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,200
Pang Shuangyue, you should ask yourself.

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
The Grand Chancellor is sweating a lot.

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,080
How do you explain that?

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,280
He's cooling down.

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
What do you know?

84
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,240
What about now?

85
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,720
He's about to wake up.

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,440
Wake up?

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
I think he's dying!

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,520
Pang Shuangyue,

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
you don't care about yourself

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
for the sake of harming us?

91
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,360
Longyue,

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,760
do you know how I got through
the past few months?

93
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,960
My store was gone.

94
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,880
Even Pei Jinheng left me.

95
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,680
Father doesn't allow me to go home.

96
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,200
You've taken everything away from me.

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,080
I want to take away everything
from you as well!

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,360
You...

99
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm thirsty.

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Get me a cup of water.

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,200
