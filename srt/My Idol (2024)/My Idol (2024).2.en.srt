1
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,212
Have a seat here.

2
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:46,838
Yes.

3
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,303
Was everything okay for your family?

4
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,890
Yes, I appreciate your concern.

5
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,892
No. You've been through a lot...

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,393
So, Woosang

7
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,730
Are you really going to stick with athletics?

8
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,069
I really want to continue.

9
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,073
Told you earlier, the team is shutting down.

10
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,533
Right.

11
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,578
Let's see, the list...

12
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,789
It's based on last competition's records,

13
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,915
so you...

14
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,590
Ah...

15
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,970
Why don't you hit the books again and

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,722
try for a community college at least?

17
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,641
I'm aiming for a sports university.

18
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,392
I know, I get it...

19
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,645
But you haven't won any competitions,

20
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,730
and a sports university might be too much.

21
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,734
Maybe it's time to think about your family.

22
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,862
How about the other members?

23
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,530
Hah...

24
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,325
Look, your situation is different

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,410
from the other kids.

26
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,662
You know?

27
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,080
Woosang.

28
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:03,915
Still,

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,377
I'd like to give it a try until I can't anymore.

30
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,504
Please,

31
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,423
could you give me just one chance?

32
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,387
Alright then, let's do this.

33
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,306
Run the 200m in 22 seconds,

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,183
like last competition's third place,

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,644
I'll try to convince the principal

36
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,437
to let you compete.

37
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,649
Well, I can't guarantee everything,

38
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,734
but if you place in this competition,

39
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,862
you'll find chances to keep running.

40
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,907
Thank you, sir!

41
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,701
Hah...

42
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,743
But Woosang,

43
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,371
you should also think about reality

44
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,456
along with your dreams.

45
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
Like everyone else,

46
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,044
you need to compromise sometimes.

47
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,673
That's how people live.

48
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,386
You think I always dreamed of being a teacher?

49
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,054
No way.

50
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,890
I had my own dreams too.

51
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,808
But hey,

52
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,768
look at me.

53
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,104
I'm doing alright

54
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,856
living alone in Busan,

55
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,733
away from my family.

56
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,111
Running around with you guys, smelling the sweat,

57
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,738
it's not half bad.

58
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,910
Hey, Woosang!

59
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,246
Thank you for your concern.

60
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,458
Still, I'd like to give it my best shot as far as I can.

61
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,336
Hah...

62
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,962
Alright, I understand.

63
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,923
You can go now.

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,507
I'll call you later.

65
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,976
Thank you.

66
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:47,852
Hah...

67
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,063
Wait a minute.

68
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,997
What's this?

69
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,833
Make sure you're eating well.

70
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,003
Oh, come on in.

71
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
Come on in.

72
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,219
Please, have a seat.

73
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:26,993
Yo! Yo! Yo!

74
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,619
Why'd Coach Phys Ed call you in?

75
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,996
Is the track team really done for?

76
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,915
Get lost, not in the mood.

77
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,043
What the hell?

78
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,544
Don't take it out on us!

79
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,379
Looks like it might actually be done for.

80
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,507
Hey, what are you doing after school?

81
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,051
Why, what's up?

82
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,218
Duh, what else?

83
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,678
Hey, no practice today, right?

84
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,638
Wanna hit up the PC bang?

85
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,225
Nah, I'm good.

86
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,102
Come on, let's go!

87
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,729
C'mon, you're free anyway.

88
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,646
Let's go!

89
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,272
No thanks.

90
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,565
You guys go on.

91
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,250
Woosang?

92
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,592
Come on! Keep running!

93
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,259
Huh?

94
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,219
Don’t stop!

95
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,053
Huh?

96
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,389
Hey... Why... here?

97
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,264
What do you think?

98
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,600
Saw you struggling, so I came to help!

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,102
Me? Struggling?

100
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,022
Not there yet.

101
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,573
Can't quit before I've even really started.

102
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,575
I've got a test today.

103
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,827
Test?

104
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,078
Yep.

105
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,582
If I nail this, I'm in for the next race.

106
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,211
I'm going to show them at this race.

107
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,171
I'll prove I can keep going.

108
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,675
What about you?

109
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,806
Jaemin.

110
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,642
Are you really going to do that?

111
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,519
Yes.

112
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,354
Hah...

113
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,439
Take your time and

114
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,025
talk to your parents before deciding.

115
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,113
I'm not giving up on track.

116
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,114
I'm fine.

117
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,451
I understand.

118
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,496
But you'll need your parents' approval for the transfer,

119
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,790
so let them know I'll call soon.

120
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,127
Alright, you can go now.

121
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,342
Ah, Jaemin.

122
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes.

123
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,264
What's the reason for that?

124
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,891
The reason?

125
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,115
Are you okay?

126
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,075
I'm fine.

127
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,410
I just had a cramp in my leg.

128
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,791
But I'm fine.

129
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,298
So, what have you decided to do?

130
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,551
Me?

131
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,847
Woosang.

132
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,600
Do you know why I run?

133
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,394
Not really.

134
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,731
Watching you gave me the courage to believe

135
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,734
I could run even further.

136
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,826
I support you, no matter what.

137
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,452
You are...

138
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,621
my idol.

139
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,112
Jaemin.

140
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,904
Hm?

141
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,199
Won't I come across as stupid or selfish?

142
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:20,286
I know you're not.

143
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
It's okay.

144
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,207
Jaemin.

145
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,751
What now?

146
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,171
Can you say that again?

147
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,006
You are...

148
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,093
my idol.

149
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,439
Twenty-two seconds, Woosang!

150
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,317
Okay,

151
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,235
prepare and...

152
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,073
get ready!
