1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:05,964
And they're off!

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,924
Great start for Lee Woosang!

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,801
They're flying out there!

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,727
Lee Woosang running in lane 3 on the straight.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,687
Wow, he's incredibly fast!

6
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,122
Gold medal in the 200 meters!

7
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,082
Almost there for the gold!

8
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,301
Lee Woosang! Lee Woosang!

9
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,260
Almost there!

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,554
Just a little more!

11
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,974
Keep running,

12
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,267
Woosang!

13
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:45,271
MY IDOL

14
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,944
I'm afraid...

15
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,780
this might be our last meet.

16
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,407
Well, you guys have been...

17
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,786
You're back.

18
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:00,870
Yes.

19
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
Sorry I'm late.

20
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,551
Okay, since we're all here now,

21
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,219
I'll quickly recap.

22
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,471
Our last meet is scheduled.

23
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,390
The competitor is...

24
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,307
Sung Jaemin,

25
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,725
Ha Chiwon,

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,102
Seok Minseon,

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,645
Baek Minsu.

28
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,729
We have four competitors.

29
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,732
They were chosen based on their last records.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,526
About closing down the team...

31
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:36,322
you know, with our results not being great and all...

32
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,410
Anyway, let's not argue about it.

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,202
Got it?

34
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,579
Okay.

35
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:46,708
Okay, everyone go back to your classes and get ready.

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,376
We'll talk one by one later.

37
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,586
That's it.

38
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,301
Coach

39
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,179
What do you mean by that?

40
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,390
Ah, well...

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,767
I know this might be a bit shocking,

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,436
but let's talk about it later.

43
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,068
Let’s just go.

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,954
What happened, huh?

45
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,248
Just relax, okay?

46
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,381
Don't worry, just tell me.

47
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,802
So, our team's been underperforming, right?

48
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,263
I heard the school wants to

49
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,974
replace us with a more promising sport.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,768
What on earth...?

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,646
What about us?

52
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,357
I don't know.

53
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,568
We might have to transfer to another school...

54
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,528
or...

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,116
And the lineup?

56
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:03,952
Um...

57
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,954
well...

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,416
I heard they went with the last competition

59
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,710
because you couldn't compete.

60
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,629
It seems you were left out

61
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,255
since you didn't place.

62
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,639
By the way, did everything go alright?

63
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,350
Ah...

64
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,521
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,398
I'm sorry I was so out of it.

66
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,775
No worries, that can happen.

67
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,697
So...

68
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,117
What are you planning to do?

69
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:48,663
About what?

70
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
About the athletics.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,173
Let's talk about it later.

72
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,061
Can't you just leave your uniforms alone?

73
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,814
I've gotten taller, that's all.

74
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,734
The bell just rang. Is it okay if we go?

75
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,862
Fine. Just wear your uniforms tomorrow.

76
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,487
Understood?

77
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,905
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,532
Ugh...

79
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:26,909
Hey

80
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,411
Are you on the track team?

81
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:29,746
Yes.

82
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,373
Aren't track athletes students?

83
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,918
You're wearing your PE kit, not your uniform.

84
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,336
I had a track team meeting...

85
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:38,212
Huh?

86
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,298
Which class are you in?

87
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
I'm in Class 2.

88
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,682
Ugh...

89
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,143
I have your class second period.

90
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,978
Let's change before then.

91
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,938
Got it?

92
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,898
Yeah.

93
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,402
Ugh...

94
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,404
These athletes...

95
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,782
Argh...

96
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,214
Hi, Woosang!

97
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,423
Hi!

98
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,466
Was everything alright?

99
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,425
Yeah.

100
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,387
What's with the self-study?

101
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,846
Come on, you know.

102
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,724
Having seniors do online lectures and self-study.

103
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,687
Hard work never betrays you, kids!

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,272
What's that?

105
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,316
Our homeroom teacher!

106
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,234
Ain't it spot-on?

107
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,401
100 days left till the CSAT.

108
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,028
Keep it down, guys!

109
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,159
Keep it down, guys!

110
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,369
Alright, buddy.

111
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,662
Eyes forward!

112
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,871
Who's the boss now?

113
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,633
CSAT D-DAY
102

114
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,273
What should I do?

115
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,528
Hey!

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,655
What are you doing here?

117
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,868
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

118
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,327
Class? Not in the mood.

119
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,704
Hah...

120
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,831
Seriously, what are we gonna do now?

121
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,000
Didn't think they'd actually close the team.

122
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,003
Hey, what was it with Woosang?

123
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,504
You saw that?

124
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,756
Duh, You guys are tight.

125
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
What'd he say?

126
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,844
No idea.

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,263
Never mind.

128
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,973
He must be so stressed.

129
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,517
What's he gonna do?

130
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,936
None of us will give up our spot.

131
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,148
What about you?

132
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,193
Why? Wanna make room for Woosang?

133
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
I’m just asking.

134
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,738
Ugh, I don’t know.

135
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,614
It pisses me off

136
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,699
how people shit on her for being dark.

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,243
Why are people so nosy?

138
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,244
Totally.

139
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,954
It's not their life.

140
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,416
Hey, watch your language.

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,293
Shit? You're a girl.

142
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,795
Shit... Look who's talking.

143
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,216
Just do what you want.

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,634
What?

145
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,303
You should do what you want.
