00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,940
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,240
(Receive your punishment.)

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,210
Receive your punishment.

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,779
Receive...

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,849
Receive your punishment.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,189
Get this instead.

7
00:00:19,489 --> 00:00:20,960
I found my clothes.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,429
The guys from Exit Three Gang...

9
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,530
sent this package
by express delivery.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,140
We can invoice that, can't we?

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,710
How can you sleep in this situation?

12
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:38,210
Look. A police officer...

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,640
was disgraced on the street.

14
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,710
Who printed this out?

15
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,579
It's so big.

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,359
Is there anything you want
to say to the viewers?

17
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,490
Dear viewers
and the citizens of Gudam,

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,929
I, the head of Gudam office,

19
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,130
will make Gudam a place...

20
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,500
where everyone wants to live in...

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,799
and where everyone feels safe.

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,340
Please support me.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,010
All right. Gudam placed first...

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,840
in the categories of welfare,
public order, and economy...

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,939
on the evaluation
of regions in Seoul.

26
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,379
She's the hardest
working person in Gudam.

27
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:16,549
This was an interview with the head
of Gudam Office, Jeong Dong Ja.

28
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,950
Cut. Good work, everyone.

29
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,989
- Good work.
- Good work.

30
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:21,989
It's done.

31
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,359
You look so good on the screen.

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,859
Didn't I seem too tough?

33
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:30,329
- No, no.
- Was it okay?

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,430
You seemed tough,

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,129
but you seemed humane as well.

36
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,269
By the way,

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,870
Is the site for the history museum
not settled yet?

38
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,569
Everyone's asking about it.

39
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,379
Have you not convinced
President Seo?

40
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:47,349
I will finish it off today,
so don't worry.

41
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:49,750
Then why are you taking time here?

42
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,219
Go finish it.

43
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,519
Okay, I got it.

44
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,290
Let me feed those old people first.

45
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,290
Goodness.

46
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,030
(A salubrious and crime-free city)

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,840
A petition urging to investigate
without sanctuary...

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,110
has been made to the Blue House.

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,409
Hear me out.

50
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,349
Is the law a joke?

51
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,180
If we don't listen to them,
they say we're wrong.

52
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:29,419
Gosh, they're so uncivilized.

53
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,259
Then are you saying that
your judgment is correct?

54
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,090
Yes. I believe I am just.

55
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,129
One more question, ma'am.

56
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,629
Enough!

57
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,699
This is the true nature
of the prosecution.

58
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,270
This was Oh Bo Young of UBS News.

59
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,469
Hey!

60
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,080
Talk properly, you jerk.

61
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,009
Say, "She sells seashells
by the seashore."

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Sleep with me?

63
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,819
This jerk...

64
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,819
- still doesn't get it.
- They're doing it again.

65
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,229
- It's because he's ugly.
- Goodness.

66
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,360
Come on, now. He's a foreigner.
Cut him some slack.

67
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,969
If he wants to make money here,
shouldn't he speak our language?

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,770
Am I right?

69
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,340
What?

70
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,099
- Answer me.
- Sir.

71
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,080
- There you go again.
- He's my Thai friend.

72
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,479
Hey, he's a Korean police officer.

73
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,250
- Hello.
- I'll see you around.

74
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,020
Goodbye.

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,120
Goodbye, sir.

76
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,560
Eat up.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,830
Here, have some of this.

78
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,900
Thank you.

79
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,069
- It's good.
- Is he doing well?

80
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,169
- Yes.
- I see.

81
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,740
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure. Have more.

82
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,639
Have some of this. Hello.

83
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,210
President Seo is here.

84
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,449
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

85
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Get out.

86
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,949
Darn it.

87
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,919
Sit down.

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,360
President Seo.

89
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,870
Was the price I asked
for that land unreasonable?

90
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,610
Was it? I believe I offered you
a reasonable price.

91
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,709
So why aren't you listening to me?

92
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,740
Well...

93
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,579
The value differs
for every institution...

94
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,509
Darn it. What are you saying?

95
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,490
Why can't Koreans get it
when we speak nicely?

96
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,889
Why?

97
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,689
Shouldn't we be reasonable?

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,529
Let's talk this out through
common sense and reasoning.

99
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,199
- All right.
- You understand me, right?

100
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,860
I trust that you do.

101
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,069
Why aren't you answering?

102
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,670
Okay.

103
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,470
You better not go back on your word.

104
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,639
Mr. Hwang.

105
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,610
Could you please give me
some time to consider this?

106
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,720
Did you say, time?

107
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:19,519
He just won't do.

108
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,699
Let's go back to the good, old days.

109
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,500
Hold still, please.

110
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,680
Who's our special guest...

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,139
who has made Father Lee
so happy from the early morning?

112
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,579
He's from a Yeosu diocese.

113
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:42,910
He's Father Lee's former pupil.

114
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,819
Is he not officially appointed?

115
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,649
No, he'll be here as a guest.

116
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,019
Please carry these.

117
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,889
Goodness.

118
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,920
- You bought so much.
- Goodness.

119
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,660
I'll do all the cooking today,

120
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,930
so don't try to help me.

121
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,000
Hello, Father.

122
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,680
My brothers,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

123
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,180
What do you think?
You already know.

124
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,079
It's about that again?

125
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,689
My thoughts on that haven't changed,

126
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,120
so please tell your president so.

127
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,759
Oh, right. Would you like
to have some snacks?

128
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,389
Gosh, you're irritating me.

129
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,660
- You better listen to me.
- Please watch what you say.

130
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,269
Look at that.

131
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:38,040
The Holy Spirit is talking
through him. Am I right?

132
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,269
Wait. Wait!

133
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,879
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the police.

134
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,379
Do that.

135
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,250
Please don't be like this,
and come have some snacks.

136
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,649
I don't like snacks...

137
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,350
because they get stuck
in between my teeth.

138
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,350
I'll be visiting here every day
from now on, okay?

139
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,170
(Daebum Trading)

140
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,670
- Hey.
- Yes?

141
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,370
You've been here for so long,

142
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,199
so why are you still bad
at adjusting the water level?

143
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,009
Should I bring more water?

144
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,170
Is this Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

145
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,579
- Get out. Leave.
- I'm sorry, sir.

146
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,050
How's President Seo doing?

147
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,420
He has a few cuts,
but his brain is undamaged.

148
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,250
I guess his head's doing fine.

149
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,389
Go get his seal on the contract.

150
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,220
- He'll give it right away.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,519
Good.

152
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,230
Did Jang Ryong visit the cathedral?

153
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,230
He did.

154
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,360
You need to pressure them
night and day.

155
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,769
- We don't have much time.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:42,829
All right.

157
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,269
This tastes disgusting.

158
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm here.

159
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,870
I'm happy you came.

160
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,709
Are you not eating well?
Why are you so frail?

161
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,480
If you want to look cool,
you need to be slim.

162
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,009
Let's go in and eat.

163
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,050
I made seaweed soup
and boiled beef, your favorites.

164
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,250
Don't make it sound like I came
back home after giving birth.

165
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,820
Let's go.

166
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,860
In Jesus' name we pray,

167
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,759
- amen.
- Amen.

168
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,230
- In the Father, the Son...
- In the Father, the Son...

169
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
- Amen.
- Amen.

170
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:51,139
You must be close to Father Lee.

171
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,799
Yes.

172
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,870
How long have you two
known each other?

173
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,769
- Since a long time ago.
- I see.

174
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,179
How long ago?

175
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,580
A very long time ago.

176
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,450
- That means...
- You should eat.

177
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,820
All right.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,490
What brings you here
from Yeosu?

179
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,620
- Sister.
- Yes?

180
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,690
- Let's eat first.
- Okay.

181
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,429
I caused trouble there.

182
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,799
I beat a believer and his underling
to a pulp.

183
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,200
I heard one of them
still can't close his mouth.

184
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,580
I'm sorry.

185
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,149
Goodness.

186
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,850
A priest shouldn't make such jokes.

187
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,259
It's not a joke.

188
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,159
I'm not kidding.

189
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,330
Come on, let's eat first.

190
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,009
Father Lee prepared all of this
just for you,

191
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,649
so you should eat up.

192
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:12,019
I had a bowl of jajangmyeon
before coming here.

193
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
I see.

194
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,250
Why did you have it
if we're going to eat...

195
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,690
Because I wanted to eat it!

196
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,259
- Goodness.
- I'm so vexed.

197
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,460
You didn't have to get
so angry with me.

198
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,460
All right.

199
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,870
Have some of this seasoned eggplant.

200
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,570
I...

201
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll get up first.

202
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,509
Father Kim.

203
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,110
You should pray
after you finish eating.

204
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,309
We can do that.

205
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:41,149
Father Han,
please escort him to his room.

206
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,320
- It's all right. I know this place.
- Still...

207
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,850
This place isn't a maze, come on!

208
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,950
Darn it.

209
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,960
What's with his temper?

210
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,500
With all due respect,

211
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,399
before the ordination,

212
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,539
you all receive
a personality test, right?

213
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,669
Yes, we do.

214
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,409
Why do you ask?

215
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,809
Does Father Kim seem very strange?

216
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,649
Well...

217
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,289
He seems to be so quiet,
but then he suddenly...

218
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,860
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,129
It's not easy to be like that.

220
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,960
Every now and then,
there are short-tempered priests.

221
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,899
No.

222
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,129
This is a different level
of anger...

223
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,000
than the one we're familiar with.

224
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,639
How do I put it?

225
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,870
I sense a bit of madness in him.

226
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,149
A minute.

227
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,590
Hold on.

228
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,740
You weren't sleeping?

229
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,570
It's too early.

230
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,809
Take it out.

231
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:18,539
What?

232
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,850
You were drinking. Look.

233
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,320
I made your favorite appetizer,
so take it out.

234
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,320
Can you see through walls now?

235
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,799
Do you want some?

236
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,269
Come on, that's yours.

237
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,639
I brought mine.

238
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,009
All right, I'll pour you some.

239
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,950
It's good.

240
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,990
You're allowed to have
two more glasses.

241
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,759
You have to lead
the service tomorrow.

242
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Me?

243
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,830
Help me out so that
I can rest at least a week.

244
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,470
How could you put me to work
the moment I come here?

245
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,440
Why do you think
I allowed you to come here?

246
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,009
Give it to me.

247
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:27,009
By the way,

248
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,049
why aren't you asking
about what I did?

249
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,279
It's not surprising.

250
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:36,149
You were always a troublemaker.

251
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,120
But still,

252
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,230
I'm sure you heard
about my situation.

253
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,730
Why did you accept me back here?

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,299
Will you not accept
your sick son back home?

255
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,110
You and I are linked spiritually.

256
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,210
So wherever you go
and however it may be,

257
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,049
we will always meet again.

258
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,850
Goodness, I guess I'll have
to keep seeing you.

259
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,820
Don't cause trouble,

260
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,789
and don't get involved in anything.

261
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:18,529
Live a quiet life.

262
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,129
If you cause trouble,
it pains my spirit.

263
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:32,039
Welcome, Sister.

264
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,279
Welcome.

265
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,080
- Hi.
- Hello.

266
00:14:40,419 --> 00:14:41,820
Go say hi.

267
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,659
Welcome.

268
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,360
Hello, Sister Angela.

269
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,460
Hello, Father.

270
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,629
Is that young priest new here?

271
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes. He'll only be here for a while.

272
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,139
I'll see you later.

273
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,269
Okay.

274
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,669
- Welcome.
- Hello.

275
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,679
Look at that face. He's cute.

276
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,990
Hello.

277
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,460
Go in.

278
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,360
Hello.

279
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:35,809
The Lord is with you all.

280
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,879
- Please be here with us.
- Please be here with us.

281
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,179
Today, I will be sharing
the gospel with you.

282
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,779
- Please speak to us, dear Lord.
- Please speak to us, dear Lord.

283
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,990
"Love your enemies..."

284
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,490
"and pray for those
who persecute you,"

285
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,029
"that you may be children
of your Father in heaven."

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,629
That is what the Lord says.

287
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,370
How can we become
true children of God?

288
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,710
That is a never-ending question
for us.

289
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,580
The first step in becoming
the Lord's children is...

290
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,919
The first step in becoming
the Lord's children is...

291
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,490
by admitting our sins...

292
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,519
Hey!

293
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,059
You, over there. You.

294
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,759
2, 4, 6, 8. You, in the 8th row,
holding that bread.

295
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:35,929
Leave.

296
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,100
How dare you munch during...

297
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,909
Leave this instant.

298
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,259
Pull.

299
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,330
I said, pull.

300
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:12,769
Okay.

301
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,569
Where was I?

302
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,140
I forgot! Darn it.

303
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,880
Father.

304
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,829
How can we become
true children of God?

305
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,859
That is a never-ending question
for us.

306
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,529
But...

307
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,109
Why do you ask for forgiveness
only when you come to church?

308
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,839
You should ask those you have
done wrong for forgiveness first.

309
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:53,779
Don't say it half-heartedly.

310
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,549
Make sure your apologies come
from deep down within your hearts.

311
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,180
Go do that.

312
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,819
Once they forgive you, then you can
ask God for forgiveness.

313
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,289
You ask if we can do it for you?
No. Do you know why?

314
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,589
Because we aren't the ones
who make the final decisions.

315
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,160
We're the messengers.

316
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,910
What's with his temper?

317
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,339
How can we ask every single
one of them for forgiveness?

318
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,309
If we don't do that, he's saying
that we can't confess our sins.

319
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,309
It's so weird.

320
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:31,650
- The priest is weird too.
- I know.

321
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,619
- In the Father, the Son...
- In the Father, the Son...

322
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,160
- and the Holy Spirit.
- and the Holy Spirit.

323
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,960
- Amen.
- Amen.

324
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,900
It's been three weeks
since my last confession.

325
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,769
I've been chafing
at my colleagues...

326
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,839
and even cursed.

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,670
Did you apologize and ask them
for forgiveness?

328
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:55,869
No.

329
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,769
Sincerely ask them
for forgiveness first.

330
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,039
You can go.

331
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,210
Wait. Just like that?

332
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,849
Yes.

333
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,220
Father.

334
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,220
Will you not read the scripture
or give me penance?

335
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,150
No. Ask for their forgiveness first,
and then you may come back.

336
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,589
But...

337
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:17,759
Father.

338
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,630
What was that back there?

339
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,069
Is something the matter?

340
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:31,480
Gosh, he looks
even more dazzling up-close.

341
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,579
Isn't what you're doing
against canon law?

342
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,680
I think a believer complaining
to a priest like this...

343
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,319
is even more against it.

344
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,220
You were the one who was being
insincere back there.

345
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,190
I believe I was just.

346
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,259
Yes. I believe I am just.

347
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,259
One more question, ma'am.

348
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,829
Enough!

349
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:52,829
("The Prosecution Believes
They Are Just")

350
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,829
Apologize.

351
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,700
If not, I'm going to report this
to the diocese.

352
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,970
Do that then.

353
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,740
Do you know who I am?

354
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,109
Goodness.

355
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,410
Hey, old man.

356
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,750
Are you dying to brag
that you're a prosecutor?

357
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,849
I guess Father Lee already told you.

358
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,720
No, I saw you on TV.

359
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,619
This was your last image.

360
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,019
Did you watch that?

361
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,259
Except for that last part,
I looked pretty nice.

362
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,660
Yes, your eyes looked nice,
old man.

363
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,829
"Old man"?

364
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,700
That's a lame, old joke.

365
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,269
Many old men attend churches,
cathedrals, and temples.

366
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,710
They pay hefty offerings
and commit hefty sins as well.

367
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,880
But they just come to make
themselves feel better.

368
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,150
They don't care about the people
whom they've hurt.

369
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,490
Nobody is hurt because of me.

370
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,849
Look, Sister.

371
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,589
Drawing a cross on your forehead
with holy water...

372
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:52,759
won't get you into heaven.

373
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,230
Those who only attend services
so that they can sin in peace...

374
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,529
won't go to heaven even if
they take a shower with holy water.

375
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:58,529
Got that?

376
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,099
I will let you off this time...

377
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,970
since you're astonishingly handsome.

378
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,480
She really knows how to press
my buttons.

379
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,160
- Father.
- Yes?

380
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,190
Father Lee wants you to greet
the children at the orphanage.

381
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,829
He told them
that a new priest is here.

382
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,259
He's exhilarated.

383
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,000
He's making me do all the work.

384
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,869
Keep it.

385
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:53,049
Why are you paying so much donation?

386
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,579
It's for you.

387
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,089
You can use that money
to eat whatever you want.

388
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,960
You're giving me this
to do you a favor, right?

389
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,529
I'm just giving it for you to use.

390
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,000
Take it back.

391
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,769
Our church will take care
of the facility management.

392
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,910
If you entrust me
with the facility management,

393
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,140
the kids and disabled
will live comfortably.

394
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,039
I'll renovate the building...

395
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,279
and feed them well.

396
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:24,250
It's hard,
but I can still manage it.

397
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,279
Why are you stopping me
from doing good deeds?

398
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,890
There are many other good deeds
you can do.

399
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,890
You know,

400
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,990
I'm rich.

401
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,829
I don't need money.

402
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,529
Father.

403
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,930
Why do you always smile
when I put pressure on you?

404
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,000
I'd rather see you get angry.

405
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,670
Hey!

406
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,940
Have some noodles before you go.

407
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,789
One!

408
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,789
- 2.
- 3. Turn your head.

409
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:09,630
Darn it.

410
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,200
This is Gudam Police Station's
Violent Crimes Team.

411
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I'm Detective Koo Dae Young.

412
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,970
Pardon? A robbery case?

413
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,210
Where is it at?

414
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,880
Sail-dong, 84-1. 2nd floor of
Gguldanji Supermarket.

415
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,480
Okay.

416
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,849
You need to go to the groundbreaking
ceremony of Gudam History Museum.

417
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,380
- I need to get to this place.
- Detective Heo can take care of it.

418
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,420
But he's have ramyeon.

419
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,390
- I'll take care of it.
- You scumbag!

420
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,859
Here.

421
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,890
There must be conscripted policemen
since it's an official event.

422
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,390
Come on. We need one of our guys...

423
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,299
to attend, so that Mr. Hwang
doesn't lose his face.

424
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,200
What face?

425
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:52,470
A detective isn't some kind of
an honorary ambassador.

426
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,309
- The chief is there.
- I should go then.

427
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,509
There you go.

428
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,210
You can do it!

429
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,410
- See you later, sir.
- See you later, sir.

430
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,220
CEO Hwang Cheol Bum from
Daebum Trading is here with us.

431
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,990
Dear guests on the stage,

432
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,890
please come down.

433
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,359
By turning the first sod,

434
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,390
the construction of
Gudam History Museum will begin.

435
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,329
(Groundbreaking Ceremony
of Gudam History Museum)

436
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,099
Evil business man
Hwang Cheol Bum should explain...

437
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,369
about the Illegal site acquisition.

438
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,380
- He must explain!
- He must explain!

439
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,740
- On the count of three,
- He must explain!

440
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,680
you can throw the dirt to the front.

441
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,980
- You can't cross this line.
- One.

442
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,380
Two.

443
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,819
- Three.
- Run, run!

444
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,420
He must explain about...

445
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,190
Stop Hwang Cheol Bum
from committing crimes!

446
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,490
Let go of me!

447
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,460
Hwang Cheol Bum must step down!

448
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,599
- Hwang Cheol Bum must step down!
- Hwang Cheol Bum must step down!

449
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,700
- Hwang Cheol Bum must step down!
- Hwang Cheol Bum must step down!

450
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,140
Withdraw from your position.

451
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
We'll wrap up...

452
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,240
the official ceremony of
today's event.

453
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,640
Captain, where are you going?
What's this?

454
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:09,049
What? Hey!

455
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,450
- Thanks to all citizens...
- Come here!

456
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,079
- What's going on?
- Gosh!

457
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,519
(Hwang Cheol Bum should explain!)

458
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,750
They're hitting people.

459
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,519
How come the policemen
are just leaving?

460
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,130
Why are they beating people?

461
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,529
Don't cause trouble,

462
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,670
and don't get involved in anything.

463
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,599
- That's...
- Let's just go.

464
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,500
- Pardon?
- Let's go.

465
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,069
But we have to help.

466
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,670
The police will take care of it.
Let's go.

467
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,910
How come the police is evacuating?

468
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,539
- We have to go say hello...
- Father!

469
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,680
Please help us!

470
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,180
We're just poor little lambs.

471
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,119
Father, please don't abandon us.

472
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,190
- Please don't abandon us.
- Let's go.

473
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,890
- Please don't abandon us.
- Let's just go.

474
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,930
- Let's hurry and leave.
- Father has abandoned us!

475
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,160
When did I abandon you?

476
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,930
Dear God!

477
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,339
Why did it have to thunder now?

478
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:17,779
Darn it.

479
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,619
- Where are you going?
- Get him!

480
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,990
Hey, stop right there!

481
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,789
Wrap it up well.

482
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,420
Don't worry. Safe trip home.

483
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,500
You evil jerk!

484
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,170
- Darn it.
- Let go of me, you jerk.

485
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,269
- Come here, you lunatic.
- Let me go.

486
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:43,740
- Let me go!
- Stay still.

487
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,279
- Hold him tight.
- Let me go.

488
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,140
Do you want me to break your bone?

489
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,750
- Let go of him.
- Let me go.

490
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,750
Let go of him.

491
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,680
What?

492
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,589
What, you jerk?

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,490
What?

494
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,930
(The Fiery Priest)

495
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,930
What's your title?

496
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,569
I'm Detective Koo in Violent Crimes
Team of Gudam Police Station.

497
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:45,839
How can you just stand and watch
when people are getting beaten?

498
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,839
Sir.

499
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,039
You shouldn't cause
any trouble with this, okay?

500
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,210
This is our new detective.
Say hello.

501
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,109
All right, check it out.

502
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,210
You need to pick your partner.

503
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,349
- Thank you in advance.
- Why am I getting a bad hunch?

504
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:00,549
I'm sorry to have worried you.

505
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:03,720
You can just destroy them
like how you always have.

506
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,089
I also love leisure time the most.

507
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:06,519
Do you really want to die?

508
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,859
I told you not to behave like this.

509
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:10,190
These guys
are good-for-nothing trash.

510
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,630
I released him with a warning.

511
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,900
You shouldn't have gone
easy on him.

512
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,960
Why are you yelling at me, Father?

513
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,930
Conviction and judgement
come before anything...

514
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,900
Then why are you so judgmental
of everything I say?
