1
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:04,839
Who's the detective in charge again?

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,379
It's Detective Koo Dae Young.

3
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:14,990
That means you're not willing
to reinvestigate the case.

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,390
Yes. Sorry?

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,059
Didn't they tell you to assign...

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,719
the best detective you got?

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,890
Yes, Detective Koo is the best one.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,730
What am I going to do with his face?

9
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:30,269
What should I do?
I might end up killing him.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,799
I'll assist him also.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,770
No, you two should go out
for investigation,

12
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:37,479
and Detective Seo should help them
in the police station.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
But I'm a field detective.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
Be quiet.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,210
Please change to another detective.

16
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:44,780
I can't work with him.

17
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,549
What?

18
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,049
You're being too harsh on me.

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
I'm the hidden gem
of Violent Crimes Team.

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,829
Please watch what you say.

21
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:57,130
Gem, my foot.

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,530
You should stay here
and keep pigging out on snacks.

23
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,700
You're making me competitive.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,189
What if I solve the case?

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,689
Solve the case? Then I'll treat you
to lamb skewers.

26
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:32,159
That won't do.

27
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,299
How about beef special cuts?

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,209
Okay. I accept it.

29
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,670
Okay.

30
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,040
The cooperative investigation
officially starts now.

31
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,810
(Episode 9)

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,310
- Father.
- What?

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,849
Judging from your record,
I'm a year older than you.

34
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,920
So?

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,019
Why aren't you using honorifics
when you talk to me?

36
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,150
How do you call a priest?

37
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,819
Bride.

38
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,959
That's what you call a woman on
her wedding day. It's "Father".

39
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,159
- Now, what does "Father" mean?
- It means "Dad".

40
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:03,799
So should I or should I not
use honorifics with you?

41
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,170
- You're so stubborn.
- That's settled, then.

42
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,439
- Where are we going?
- We're going to eat first.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,349
Where are we going to go
after we're done eating?

44
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
Sir.

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,389
We're going to meet the lady who
claims she got sexually harassed...

46
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,250
and the director of the church.

47
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,819
But you met them a few days ago.

48
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,020
I'm going to pressure them
properly this time.

49
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,490
That's not going to get rid of
the truth, you know.

50
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,830
- Detective Koo.
- Yes?

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
Have you ever been beaten up
with a cow's rib?

52
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,599
What's the matter with you?

53
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,770
You're always threatening me
to beat me up.

54
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,069
That's why...

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,310
you shouldn't make rash comments
about what's true or not.

56
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,780
But the truth is what matters most
to a detective.

57
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,319
How can I not talk about that?

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,030
Okay, fine.

59
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,189
You have such a bad temper.

60
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,629
Everything is
a lethal weapon to you.

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,099
Let me make myself clear.

62
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,400
If you ever ruin
what I'm trying to do...

63
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,599
or get in my way, you'll seriously
end up in the fiery pit.

64
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,710
Father.

65
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,379
I'm the detective,
and I'll be the one investigating.

66
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,780
You're just an observer,
someone who watches from afar.

67
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,479
You can be the observer.
Anyway, don't act up.

68
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,919
Why would I act up?
Does he think I'm a kid?

69
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm a grown man.

70
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:42,490
I can hear you.

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
What's with his temper?

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,830
He's the one who should
do something about his temper.

73
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,129
What?

74
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,469
I was just smacking my lips
as I eat.

75
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,639
Eat quietly.
Did you not learn any manners?

76
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,370
Why would you make sounds
as you eat?

77
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,539
It's a habit of mine.

78
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
Where's the rib?

79
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:01,080
Okay. Gosh.

80
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,080
What's wrong with you?
I was just eating.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,449
Ma'am, can you get rid of this?

82
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,849
My gosh, seriously.

83
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,029
The pope? My gosh.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,199
How does this make sense?

85
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm sure someone coached him
to make a move like this.

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,209
Otherwise, this couldn't have
happened so quickly.

87
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,610
What kind of jerk is helping him?

88
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,379
You can go to National Assembly
or the Blue House.

89
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,550
If things don't work out,
you can tattle to the pope.

90
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,490
Tattle it. Tattle.

91
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,360
Pope! Pope, pope, pope!

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,819
Help me, pope!

93
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,959
If you happen to find out
who's helping him,

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,500
I want you to indict him as well.

95
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,430
Yes, sir.

96
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,569
By the way, didn't you say the cops
appointed someone to the case?

97
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,370
Don't mind that.

98
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,509
That priest will most definitely
start causing trouble.

99
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,779
You know that, right?

100
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:13,519
So try to come up with a way
to get rid of him in one go.

101
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,670
- How much do we need to pay?
- 26 dollars.

102
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,699
Okay, thank you for the meal.

103
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,310
- What?
- Pay for your meal.

104
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,810
Ask the accounting team
to expense it for you.

105
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,810
No, that only applies to what I ate.

106
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,410
You can ask the church
to expense it for you.

107
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,279
How much are you going to pay
with this card?

108
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,509
- 26 dollars.
- Okay.

109
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,819
Hey!

110
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,819
- Did you already process it?
- Yes.

111
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,129
But that was my... Are you Catholic?

112
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,529
26 dollars...

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,970
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

114
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,100
Do you have any idea on
how we can stop that priest?

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,069
My gosh, seriously.

116
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:09,709
He has the pope supporting him,
so we need a legitimate reason.

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,410
I actually thought of something.

118
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,949
What is it? Hurry and tell me.

119
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,279
One of our people can dress up
as a monk in disguise.

120
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,920
- A monk?
- Yes.

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,220
Our guy will meet that priest
as if they met by coincidence.

122
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,819
Then he can start a fight
and get beaten to a pulp by him.

123
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,660
That will eventually become a fight
between two religions.

124
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,230
And the blame will naturally
go to that priest.

125
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,860
And then...

126
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,600
Is that your idea? Make someone
dress up as a monk in disguise?

127
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,899
- Yes.
- Are you saying he should...

128
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:37,699
bump into him as he walks past him?

129
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:38,939
That's right.

130
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,610
And he should stare at him
as if he feels really offended.

131
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,040
Stare at him? Stare at him?

132
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:03,259
No?

133
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,959
I think it's a pretty good idea.

134
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,269
Can you get rid of your arm warmers?
We're not living in the 80s.

139
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,110
Yes?

The idol star that got indicted
for the Nonhyeon-dong meth case...

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,279
just asked if he could meet you.

142
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,689
Really?

143
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,990
Tell him to drop by.

- I'm sorry, sir.

that you're gangsters.

Sir, we're clearing up
the reconstruction site today.

Shouldn't you drop by?

152
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,649
- No, you should go instead.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,259
But I already told you this
last time. Did you forget again?

I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
My gosh.

177
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,100
How is that going to open the door?

178
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,070
Does he think he's shooting
a movie or what?

179
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:34,250
What? Hey... How...

180
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
My gosh.

181
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,070
Who do you think you are
opening my door like that?

182
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,340
I didn't do it.

183
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,340
He did that because you wouldn't
come out when you're clearly in.

184
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,779
If I don't come out,
then you should let me be.

185
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,549
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm a detective.

186
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,279
A detective. I'm a detective.

187
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,720
Why is the perilla leaf so prickly?

188
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,490
Are you a Father?

189
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,460
Why?

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,320
Are you upset about
my daughter's testimony?

191
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:21,659
Where is your daughter?

192
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,429
- What about my daughter?
- I need to ask her something.

193
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,299
She's gone on a trip to Europe.

194
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:27,769
- A trip to Europe?
- Yes.

195
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:29,269
- Where in Europe?
- She's in Europe.

196
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,070
Where in Europe?
I can't even contact her?

197
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,139
I can't even contact her either.
She will when she wants to.

198
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,710
- When is she back?
- I don't know about that.

199
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,980
Does it make sense that
you don't know when she's back?

200
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,450
It does make sense...

201
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,309
if your daughter is like your enemy.

202
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,120
I have nothing to say,
so please leave.

203
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,820
- She doesn't make sense.
- Let's just go.

204
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,090
- Let's go.
- Hey!

205
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,759
- That lady is scary.
- Let's just go.

206
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,860
- Wait.
- She's not an average woman.

207
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,429
- No, she just doesn't make sense.
- She's not lying.

208
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:56,789
Let's just stop.

209
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,799
I'm going to report you
to the police.

210
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,029
- Wait.
- Go on. Report us then.

211
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,500
Stop. Let's just leave.

212
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
She said she doesn't know.

213
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,669
Do you think
she really doesn't know?

214
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,240
I have a feeling
that it's the truth.

215
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,970
Don't say that.
It makes me want to hit you.

216
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,580
Why is everyone in
this neighborhood gangsters?

217
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,279
The first day of investigation is
already driving me mad.

218
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,450
- Hey!
- Don't go.

219
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,450
Don't go.

220
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,090
- Did he move out?
- Yes.

221
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,320
But it wasn't exactly moving out...

222
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,059
since all he had
when he left was a bag.

223
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,259
Where did he say he was going?

224
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,389
He said he was going abroad.

225
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,529
- Where exactly?
- I don't know about that.

226
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,429
He said he won't be back
for a while.

227
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,870
I thought he was running away.

228
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,539
He ran away?
Did he do something wrong?

229
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,639
Didn't you know that he's a gambler?

230
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,149
Until recently,
loansharks and gangsters...

231
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,049
came here regularly.

232
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,879
I thought the church was
meant to be a great place.

233
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,649
I can't believe he was given
a respected responsibility.

234
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,289
What about his family?

235
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,090
His wife left
with the kids years ago.

236
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,759
Who would want to stay with him?

237
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,799
Thank you.

238
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,970
Don't you see it straight away?

239
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,580
- See what?
- Gamblers...

240
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,710
They'd do anything if
they can get their debt paid off.

241
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:24,120
Don't derogate gamblers like that.

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,350
They are so many
innocent gamblers too.

243
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,049
Innocent?

244
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,389
Did you call gamblers innocent?

245
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,000
Since you mentioned, do you want to
see the most innocent person here?

246
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,730
Who? Who's innocent?

247
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,000
Gaozi stated that
when the human nature...

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,570
is indifferent to good and evil,

249
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:51,340
it's the same as how the water
is indifferent to the east and west.

250
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,850
Hence, there's no good or evil
in human nature.

251
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,610
This is his four character idiom.

252
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,889
The first class of the semester
is already difficult.

253
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,059
It is true though.

254
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,059
How would you know if
you're good or evil...

255
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,799
since birth?

256
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:13,529
Am I right?

257
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,899
Yes, you are.

258
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,509
Hey, have some noodles
before you leave.

259
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,919
How am I right?

260
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,519
You're born evil.

261
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,990
Like me.

262
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,120
Wait.

263
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,559
Are you looking after
that annoying Father?

264
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,559
Yes, Detective Koo is doing so.

265
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:46,960
I guess a useless man like him
can be useful sometimes.

266
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,870
- Mr. Hwang.
- What is it?

267
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,700
I think you should come out
right now.

268
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,409
What now?

269
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,740
Why are you bothering me?

270
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,240
Move. I just need a minute.

271
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,409
We can't even if
it's for a minute or a hundred.

272
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,580
Let's just leave.
What would Mr. Hwang know?

273
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,990
I won't take long.
I'm also a busy man.

274
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,149
Just a moment.

275
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,620
What do you want?

276
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:17,860
What brings you all the way
to our office, Father Kim?

277
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,960
You're here too.

278
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,429
Let me ask you a question.

279
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,169
Why would you ask me here?

280
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,340
Do you want to come in and have some
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Coffee?

281
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,909
I bought it from a famous cafe
in Gangneung.

282
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,179
You can have it by yourself.

283
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,779
- Where are the other two?
- The other two?

284
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Who?

285
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,049
Your acting skills are the best.

286
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,590
You look less suspicious.

287
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:45,659
Why are you being like this
out of the blue?

288
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,519
You're lacking context.

289
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,629
The lady who gave false testimony
about Father Lee...

290
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,029
and the director of the church.

291
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,070
Those two people? What about them?

292
00:14:55,669 --> 00:14:56,730
Are they having an affair?

293
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,139
Wait.

294
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,970
Why are you asking that
to Mr. Hwang?

295
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,179
You should just shut your mouth,
Detective Koo.

296
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,279
Why should I?

297
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,279
What are you trying to do by
making a mess in this neighborhood?

298
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,820
If you continue like this,
I can't help you out.

299
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,450
That's right.

300
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,960
That's what a true hero
should be like.

301
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,460
I told you to shut your mouth.

302
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
Wait.

303
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,330
You're saying that to a detective
of the violent crime squad.

304
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,399
I'm busy.

305
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,399
Where did you send those two people?

306
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,009
Why are you asking me that?
This is so frustrating.

307
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,570
You bribed them, lied, and hid them.

308
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,210
Would the police know
or the prosecutor know?

309
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,480
These gangsters must've done it.

310
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,149
I'm so innocent.

311
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,759
I'm a businessman
who obeys law and orders.

312
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,490
What are you going to do
if I find those two people...

313
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,259
and reveal that you hid them?

314
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,029
Let's have a bet?
What should we bet on?

315
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:02,200
Eel? Lobster? Or your wrist?

316
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,769
None of those.

317
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,440
Why don't you just
let me hit you once?

318
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Father Kim.

319
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,070
Please watch what you say.

320
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,240
Don't interfere when
your elders are talking.

321
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Leave.

322
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,779
Sounds good.

323
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,549
I'll stay still so that
you can hit me.

324
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,820
But if not, you'll be
the one getting hit.

325
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,090
Okay.

326
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,860
I'll stay still
with my legs wide open.

327
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,769
Is he filled with
the Holy Spirit backwards?

328
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,039
Check the departure records
of those two people.

329
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,710
Those two people left far away.

330
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,980
Just do as I say. Why are you
talking back so much today?

331
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,809
This is driving me mad.
Why are you like this to Mr. Hwang?

332
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,980
You don't even have any evidence.

333
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,519
How much did you get
from Cheol Bum?

334
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,250
You're testing my patience.

335
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,960
Don't say things like that.

336
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,519
Then why are you siding him?

337
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,590
Siding him?

338
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,490
You don't have any proof.

339
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,829
You should keep your manners
while you investigate.

340
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,400
You might become
Cheol Bum's slave at this rate.

341
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,730
You're really making me
lose patience.

342
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,470
(Daebum Trading)

343
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,569
- Wait.
- What now?

344
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,339
After you get the departure records,
get all the CCTV footage...

345
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,839
of Gudam Church during the incident.

346
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,210
That's a lot of...

347
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,309
Gosh.

348
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,950
Darn it.

349
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,190
Calm down and do it slowly.

350
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,859
See, it works.

351
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,160
Hurry.

352
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,529
I'm innocent.

353
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,000
I just tried once because...

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,839
Chairman Kim's son asked me to.

355
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,069
Why am I at fault?

356
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,740
You confessed that
you started distributing.

357
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,440
They said if I don't confess,

358
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,579
they will arrest
my boss and team members.

359
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:56,609
Hey.

360
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:00,150
Every month, there are hundreds
of victims like you who lie.

361
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,319
Let's put an end to this properly.

362
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Please, I beg you.

363
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,990
My mother...

364
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,529
My mother is in great pain.

365
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,960
Gosh.

366
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,269
You're great at acting.

367
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,099
You should start acting
after your stay here.

368
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,640
You're going to become big
in the future.

369
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,670
I'm really telling the truth.

370
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,880
Mr. Kim.

371
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,309
Law is an inanimate object.

372
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,750
No matter how much
you shout and cry,

373
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,119
it won't respond to you at all.

374
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,650
That's what law is.

375
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,390
Let's learn about the real world
and grow up from this experience.

376
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
Ms. Park.
Chief Prosecutor is asking for you.

377
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,539
What have I been telling you?

378
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:01,450
That Father is going to
keep bothering us.

379
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,250
Can't we just ignore
the CCTV footage request?

380
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,019
Wake up. Did you forget?

381
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,819
The Pope is siding him.

382
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,390
Contact this number
and collect the footages.

383
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,029
Who's this?

384
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,200
Who else? The person in charge
of that center's data.

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,329
He's under the director.

386
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,700
Why are you standing still?

387
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,039
Yes, all right.

388
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,619
How many times
do I have to tell you?

389
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:42,349
Collecting these footages
of the incident is no joke.

390
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,490
But we still have to.

391
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,420
It's a clue behind
Father Lee's path.

392
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,289
Well, we can't handle
that kind of work.

393
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,430
I'll do it.

394
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,660
I'll go to the situation room
and get the footage from that day.

395
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,900
Can I do that, sir?

396
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,829
Newbie, you have a lot to do.

397
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:58,539
I can just stay up a few nights.

398
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,670
You have to get some sleep.

399
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:05,339
Lack of sleep can lead to
all kinds of diseases!

400
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,180
She said she'll do it!

401
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,349
Why are you complaining so much?
You are not the one doing it.

402
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,019
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

403
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,890
I've checked the two people's
departure records,

404
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,950
and it turns out
they're both not in Korea.

405
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,890
Where did they go to?

406
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,660
The woman went to Dubai.

407
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,500
- Dubai?
- Yes.

408
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,660
But that's in the Middle East.

409
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,900
Didn't you say she went to Europe?

410
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,940
Europe?

411
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,640
- Well...
- She had a layover in Dubai.

412
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,210
She had a layover and went to
The French Republic afterward.

413
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,250
What about
the director of the church?

414
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,980
Well, he...

415
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,650
He went to France.

416
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,759
(The French Republic is France.)

417
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,660
The woman went
to The French Republic,

418
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,329
and the man went to France?

419
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,500
That's right.

420
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,670
Yes.

421
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:13,980
Fix that before you go!

422
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,410
(Gudam Police Station)

423
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,279
Hold on, Father.

424
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,019
Hold on.

425
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,660
Is police station some kind of
a middle school classroom?

426
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,859
You yell and kick things
when you get angry.

427
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,059
You must draw the line somewhere.

428
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:34,329
Even if you might not be pleased,
please behave.

429
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,829
Would you like it
if we cause a scene...

430
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,470
and kick things at your church?

431
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,299
You guys deserve more than that.

432
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,240
Gosh, seriously.

433
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:44,140
Isn't your duty...

434
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,210
to forgive people and the world?

435
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,150
Why are you at our throat?

436
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,420
Fake forgiveness?

437
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,289
That's the evil in itself
and the source of evil.

438
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,490
So I don't forgive anyone easily.

439
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,029
"Your troubleshooter, Gudam
Police Station"? What a nonsense.

440
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,130
I should break that also.

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,130
No, no you can't break this.

442
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,369
You should kick me instead.

443
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,769
Go ahead and break it. Go on.

444
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:16,710
It's better to hurt the cardboard.
It's a nonliving thing anyway.

445
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,279
Darn it.

446
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,119
(Your troubleshooter,
Gudam Police Station)

447
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,150
(CCTV within Father Lee's path)

448
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:48,809
Ma'am, get me a dish of fried
cartilage and a bottle of soju.

449
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,940
- Give me the original bottle.
- Sure.

450
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,150
Who told you to sit here?

451
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:58,250
I'll treat. Let's drink together.

452
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,920
Can't you just leave?

453
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,119
Thank you.

454
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,230
Are you acting up?

455
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,559
I'm just asking you to
drink with me.

456
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,230
What do you mean I'm acting up?

457
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,259
It seems like you won't
pour me a glass,

458
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,529
so I'll drink it on my own.

459
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,670
Wouldn't it be nice...

460
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,710
to have a drinking buddy
despite our titles?

461
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,910
I don't trust people who drink.

462
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,519
Sure, go ahead
and drink on your own.

463
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,769
Ma'am, please get me
one more bottle.

464
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,279
He's the leader of Daegakgyo,
Ki Yong Moon.

465
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:07,880
Please say hello.

466
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,190
It's an honor to meet you.

467
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,829
My name is Ki Yong Moon.

468
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:16,259
I've heard a lot about you.

469
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,799
So you've been working hard for
Gudam physically and spiritually.

470
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,369
I'm just trying to be good help
even if it might be inadequate.

471
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:31,470
Mr. Hwang scouted Mr. Ki to Gudam.

472
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,980
Mr. Hwang scouted a useful man.

473
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,150
Thank you, sir.

474
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,619
From next month, he'll be in charge
of welfare facilities.

475
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,589
He'll prepare the establishment
of our foundation as well.

476
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,829
I'm just saying this out of concern.

477
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,029
You have to do a good job
so that there won't be any trouble.

478
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,299
We hate when troubles come up.

479
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,299
I'm sure you'll
take care of everything well.

480
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,410
I'll do my best.

481
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,150
This is Ukha.

482
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,250
What's this?

483
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,920
It's a small token
of appreciation...

484
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,089
from my followers and me.

485
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Ukha?

486
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,579
I prefer toads over frogs.
Toads are much cuter.

487
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,859
I'm Detective Seo Seung Ah
from Gudam Police Station.

488
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,990
I'm here to collect the original
footage I mentioned in the document.

489
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,230
All right. Please wait for a little.

490
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,299
Father.

491
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,569
Can I give you a piece of advice?

492
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,769
Up to you.
I won't listen to it anyway.

493
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,079
Here you go. I'll compare
the situation to baseball.

494
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,910
The current score is 9 to 0.

495
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,319
- 9 to 0.
- 9 to 0.

496
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,319
9 to 0.

497
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,950
It's the bottom of the ninth,
and there are no runners.

498
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,849
You are the last player.

499
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,029
But you hit a grounder!

500
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,259
But... But...

501
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:37,900
that's when the coach
and the players are all switched.

502
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,839
So what's the point of calling
the owner of the baseball club?

503
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,609
You should play a winning game.

504
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,079
I don't know anything
about baseball.

505
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:51,779
Do you have no sense of reality
because you're a priest?

506
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,220
Or are you still being like that
even though you know?

507
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,119
You stirred up things everywhere,
even in the Vatican City.

508
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,329
Why on earth
are you being like this?

509
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,759
I told you not to
run your mouth in front of me.

510
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,970
You think I'll go easy on you
because I'm drunk?

511
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:14,670
Is it because you have a strong
sense of justice as a priest?

512
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,809
The thing about justice today...

513
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,750
It's as worthless
as the underpants of Superman.

514
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,980
It's totally ridiculous.

515
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,789
Mr. Koo, Superman these days...

516
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:32,960
doesn't wear that anymore.
Watch the movie.

517
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,329
No matter how hard you try,

518
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,230
even if you were to be born again,

519
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,740
there are things
that you can't solve and fix.

520
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,440
Even the pope, or even
the grandfather of the pope...

521
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,549
What? Are you going to hit me again?

522
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,319
Go ahead!

523
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,349
But don't hit my nose.

524
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,690
You jerk.

525
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,319
Father, you're not normal.

526
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,390
Why don't you know?

527
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,339
Let's stop.

528
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,210
Where are you going?

529
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,410
You'll pay for this, right?

530
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,720
How can he remember that
when he's all drunk?

531
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,259
Yes, Mr. Lee! I'm working, sir.

532
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,700
Dae Young, I got a call
from the situation room.

533
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,240
The CCTV footage has been arranged,
so don't bother with it anymore.

534
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,910
Already? Okay, then. Salute.

535
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,880
Hey, keep an eye on Seung Ah
just in case.

536
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,480
Yes, sir. I'll do that. Salute.

537
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,009
He's completely drunk.

538
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,450
Salute.

539
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:11,490
Why does he always hang up
when I'm still talking?

540
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,009
This is tougher than I thought.

541
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:54,000
Take it easy.

542
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,599
No one will give you any credit...

543
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,269
even if you faint
from working too hard.

544
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,140
Did you drink?

545
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,410
Yes.

546
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,150
Then you should go and sleep.
I still have a few things to check.

547
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,789
Don't doze off there.

548
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:21,559
You should continue after
getting some sleep.
