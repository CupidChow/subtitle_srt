1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,040
Get ready. We're going to start now.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:05,639
Yes.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,550
Don't answer me.

4
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,619
Yes.

5
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:18,859
That punk.

6
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,129
Song Sac!

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,899
Yes

8
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,039
Yes, yes

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,740
Yes

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,579
Yes, yes, yes, yes

11
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,350
- Yes, yes, yes, yes
- Yes, yes, yes, yes

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,920
- Yes
- Bam

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
- Bam, bam
- Bam, bam

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,619
- Yes
- Bam

15
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:50,119
What do you say?

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,469
Today won't go smoothly either.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,840
My gosh. You're right.

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,010
Those jerks...

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,780
Can I have a bottle of soju
before we begin?

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,319
I don't think I can
do this when I'm sober.

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,250
No, you can't be on a mission
when you're drunk.

22
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,420
- Let's go first.
- My gosh.

23
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,230
Introduce yourselves now.

24
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:42,370
I'm Han Choon Sam from Yanbian.

25
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:44,739
I'm Song Sac from Thailand.

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,879
I'm Bayapad from Mongol.

27
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,349
Father.

28
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,590
You should be more assertive.
Don't be intimidated.

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,620
Ask them this threateningly.

30
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,989
"Have you ever had human meat?"

31
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,530
Hey.

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,400
Have you guys ever had human meat?

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,770
No, I haven't.

34
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,270
Stop all that nonsense.

35
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,780
I know. Why would anyone eat that?

36
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,879
- Have you had one?
- No, I haven't. And you?

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,050
It's not delicious.

38
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,030
Their families must be rich.
They seem like they never starved.

39
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,360
Russia has a lot of things
to eat now.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,960
It's not under
Gorbachev's govern anymore.

41
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,669
Gorbachev? That's so long ago.

42
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,969
Don't you know who I am?

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,909
This is nonsense.

44
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,210
You've seen too many movies.

45
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,780
Stay quiet until 11:30pm.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,979
And stop yelling.

47
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:54,650
You can stay relaxed
only until then.

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,949
Once I get out...

49
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:57,050
You're at it again.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,719
I'll scold you.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,560
Yes, Ms. Park?

52
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:06,389
What?

53
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,699
An informant?

54
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
Yes, ma'am.

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,240
The informant? I see.

56
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,139
The informant? I see.

57
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,210
The informant? I see.

58
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,990
Game start.

59
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:47,229
You went home soon after
you came to work.

60
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,770
I heard you took sick leave.

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,300
But you seem fine.

62
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,370
Did Chief Kang tell you to
come check on me?

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,500
Let's get to the point.

64
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,310
How could you do that...

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,009
to Rising Moon?

66
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,909
I heard you did that...

67
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,210
because of the guy
who tried to kill you.

68
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,219
But you went too far.

69
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,990
- I went too far?
- Ms. Park.

70
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:08,349
Aren't you on our side?

71
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm on no one's side.

72
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,520
You guys like going solo.
That's exactly what I'm doing.

73
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,100
Don't make your stance so ambiguous.

74
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,970
Otherwise, I won't be able to
go easy on you anymore.

75
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:24,069
You don't have to do that.
Instead, you should take...

76
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,269
the responsibility for instigating
Congressman Park's murder.

77
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,439
My gosh.

78
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,269
How can I take responsibility for
something I didn't do?

79
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:34,610
Then you should take responsibility
for Father Lee's death.

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,779
I will...

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,449
if it can be dealt
with me going down alone.

82
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,990
But...

83
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,959
I won't be the only one to go down.

84
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,360
Let's settle this...

85
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:51,500
once and for all someday.

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,100
My gosh.

87
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,339
What should I do with her?

88
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,480
The key has arrived.

89
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,050
Are they in good quality?

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,250
Yes, they were made in
a company famous for...

91
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,490
duplicating fingerprints.
There must be no problem.

92
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,920
I heard they must be
meticulously duplicated.

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,490
I shouldn't be worried, right?

94
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,860
That's amazing. Have a drink.

95
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,629
Goodness, your men...

96
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,439
What? What do you want me to do?

97
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,470
Hoon Seok.

98
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,839
Let's place them
on the count of three.

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,250
One,

100
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,610
two,

101
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,149
three.

102
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,189
There's one fingerprint
that doesn't match.

103
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,189
What?

104
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,689
What went wrong?

105
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,199
It's Ms. Jeong's fingerprint.

106
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Darn it. Let's place them again.

107
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,699
1, 2, 3.

108
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,509
There's one fingerprint
that doesn't match.

109
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,279
Give it to me! What is this?

110
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:19,779
Hey, I told you to
never use Chinese products.

111
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,189
Do your job properly.

112
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,930
Is something not going well,
Mr. Hwang?

113
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,029
No. Nothing's working out.

114
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,529
They're all getting complicated.

115
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,740
Then put aside your worries...

116
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,899
- and get enlightened...
- Never mind.

117
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,670
The permit for the foundation
will be given soon, right?

118
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,980
I think so,
but what use will that be?

119
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,480
We don't have any facility
to manage ourselves.

120
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,519
Yong Moon, do whatever it takes
to own management rights...

121
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,180
of welfare facilities
as soon as possible.

122
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,860
I can do whatever it takes?

123
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,490
If we idle our time away,
we will lose everything.

124
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,730
We've been too gentle with them.

125
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,800
Of course.
You found your enlightenment...

126
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,100
in the wilderness.

127
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,540
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

128
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,379
We have only one hour left
to the point of operation.

129
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,209
What should we do about Jang Ryong?

130
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,519
Let's deal with it now.

131
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:30,050
You always wear the same thing.

132
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,689
What if they recognize you?

133
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,259
I only have this mask.

134
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,189
I knew we'd have
a lot of operations like this,

135
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:37,160
so I bought matching masks for us.

136
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,129
Why should I wear that with you?

137
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,259
It's for our operation.

138
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,769
Open the bag in the back seat.

139
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,370
What is it again?

140
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,379
Hey! How can I wear this?

141
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,889
I won't wear it. I'll never do.

142
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:03,790
Wear it!
If you don't, they'll recognize you.

143
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,319
No!

144
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,089
You have to wear it!

145
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,329
Would you wear it if you were me?
I won't wear it!

146
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:11,430
Here, here. Wear it.

147
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,930
I said no.

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,569
Hey! Watch where you're going!

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,810
Who dares to block us?

150
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,839
Are we bumper cars or something?

151
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,980
What's with that
shepherd mask?

152
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,490
And what's with that yellow dog?

153
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,190
Put your hands up.

154
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,360
Give me your wallet, phone, car key,
and everything else!

155
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,870
Are we in New York or something?

156
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,240
Why would they point
their guns at me?

157
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,470
Give me all of them!

158
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,309
Should I give it to him?

159
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,379
- What a chaos.
- Open the door.

160
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,110
Okay, okay! What?

161
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,009
I gave you all.
I gave you everything we have.

162
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,149
We don't have anything.

163
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,590
There's no bad dog in this world.

164
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,029
A shepherd? What's going on?

165
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,799
Does it make sense?

166
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,370
- In big daylight...
- Broad daylight.

167
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,600
In broad daylight,
we lost everything...

168
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,470
to a shepherd and yellow dog.

169
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,679
- In Korea.
- I know.

170
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,110
- Do you have a secret phone?
- No.

171
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:36,179
Okay. What about a spare car key?

172
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,750
- No.
- Okay. Let's all die.

173
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,019
What are you, shadows?
Are you shadows? Are you?

174
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,919
What now?

175
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,289
Be thankful that
your warrant was denied.

176
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,629
I didn't do anything
to justify one.

177
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,529
- Come by when the club reopens.
- Get lost.

178
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,940
Detective Seo, he's on his way.

179
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,240
(Criminal Division)

180
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,179
My team leader told me about
the Rising Moon informant.

181
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:10,480
The informant? I see.

182
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,590
Yes.

183
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,490
You have info on something
other than the drugs?

184
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:25,159
Okay. Sorry,
but I'm working on something now.

185
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,370
I'll come over in an hour.

186
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,830
We can leave from your office.

187
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,070
Okay, Ms. Park.

188
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,480
(Seoul Gudam Police Station)

189
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,919
He looks busy.
I think he took the bait.

190
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,159
I got out.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

191
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,429
Get rid of the ledgers and product.

192
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,259
What did I say? Faces don't lie.

193
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:58,429
Let's go.

194
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,580
Darn it.

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,149
My gosh.

196
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,019
Did you have to do this
when we're short on time?

197
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,789
I had too many buns.

198
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,850
I can't poop myself on the job.

199
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,559
- Why are you wearing that?
- I'm embarrassed.

200
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,129
It got on me!

201
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,980
What kind of dog poops sitting down?

202
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,620
That yellow dog has a temper.

203
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,659
Let's wrap this up
and get some gamjatang.

204
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,570
Now I'm getting a signal.
If only you hadn't pooped.

205
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,539
Gambling, cheating,
and delinquent loans...

206
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:15,269
won't be your downfall
but your pooping will, I swear.

207
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,740
That sounds like a curse.

208
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,039
- Father.
- What?

209
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,909
Aren't you doing too much
for Ms. Park?

210
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,320
Why? Are you afraid
I'll get stabbed in the back?

211
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,419
That too.

212
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,690
And anger doesn't
get over like that easy.

213
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,419
I should give her a chance
to make amends.

214
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,960
You also got one.

215
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,759
That's true.

216
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,759
Even saints have a past,
and sinners have a future.

217
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,299
For her future,

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,830
I should give her a chance.

219
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:46,440
And I might do my best as well.

220
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,570
You sounded like
a real priest just then.

221
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,450
Detective. Put pressure on them.

222
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,519
(Criminal Report)

223
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,919
(Reason for repatriation)

224
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,389
Hey, Russia, you poor guys.

225
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,419
You killed two people here?

226
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Two people each?

227
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,330
My gosh. You're really scary folk.

228
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:13,559
Won't they get executed in Russia?

229
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:17,129
What do you mean?
We didn't kill anyone.

230
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:20,769
I don't care.
Explain yourself in Russia.

231
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,139
These papers were sent over
this morning.

232
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,179
What?

233
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,879
I think something's wrong.

234
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,419
Someone's messing with us.

235
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,190
- What should we do?
- What a mess.

236
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,460
Pay the price for what you did.

237
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,529
Papers don't lie.

238
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,200
Should I say I didn't do it too?

239
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,899
Be quiet. Shut your mouths.

240
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,570
If we go to Russia now,

241
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,409
we'll be shot.

242
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:00,279
Take us back to
the detention center.

243
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:02,909
No! Don't talk such nonsense.

244
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,620
We'll die in Russia.

245
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,259
Come on!

246
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,190
Come on. Get out!

247
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,009
On your knees!

248
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,279
- Save us.
- Put your guns down!

249
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,779
Get out.

250
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,850
Go on your knees. On your knees!

251
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,789
You two, come here. Hurry.

252
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,460
On your knees. On your knees!

253
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,929
Go on your knees!

254
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,169
Goodbye. This is a gift from Anton.

255
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:16,889
Let's get away.
What if they wake up?

256
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,090
I'll go alone then.

257
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,490
If you want the key, come along.

258
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,899
- Wait for me.
- Me too.

259
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,379
They're gone.

260
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,950
Why are you wearing those things?

261
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,190
- I almost died trying not to laugh.
- You did laugh.

262
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,289
- It was funny though.
- Why did you buy these?

263
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,820
Did you have to overreact
when you went down?

264
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,590
- This isn't an 80s movie.
- You looked even worse.

265
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,129
- Go back to the station.
- Okay.

266
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,799
- We'll bring those two in.
- Got it.

267
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,830
Come along.

268
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:05,899
- I need bigger holes for breathing.
- Go that way.

269
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,539
You drive.

270
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,509
(Pumpkin Night Club)

271
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,649
That place looks like it's closed.

272
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:20,919
This is where they usually keep
illegal liquor.

273
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:24,559
That's right. I get the feeling
this is their headquarters.

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,659
Shouldn't we call for the backup?

275
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,129
It could end soon if they
already moved everything.

276
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,960
True. It's more fun
when the backup gets here late.

277
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,629
I'll go in alone.

278
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,399
Are you serious?

279
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,909
There's something in there.
I can't ignore that.

280
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,379
You're a real cop, aren't you?

281
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,779
Wait in the car.

282
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,279
No, no. I'm coming too.

283
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,250
It could be dangerous.

284
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,149
Don't worry.

285
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,850
I'm a phoenix. Phoenix Seon!

286
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,919
Justice and trust.

287
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,620
Let's go! I'll get you all.

288
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,569
My legs are killing me.

289
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,369
This will lead to the hall.

290
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,710
How do you know that?

291
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:16,539
For five months as a rookie,

292
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,740
all I did was raid illegal bars.

293
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,880
You got a really
tough initiation in the field.

294
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,789
Use your brain, Detective Seo.

295
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,230
Don't they lock up?

296
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:43,569
- Stay right behind me.
- Yes, ma'am.

297
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,839
Hey. Wait for me.

298
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,450
She's so quick.

299
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,599
Look at all that illegal liquor.

300
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,700
What is he swinging around?

301
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,240
Hey, hey!

302
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,440
I told you not to play with that.

303
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:24,210
It's Superintendent Nam's treasure.

304
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,640
He always says
some Romanian craftsman made it.

305
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,150
Go upstairs and get rid of
the secret ledgers and the drugs.

306
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,750
- We're all dead if we get caught.
- Yes, sir.

307
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,359
It's that way.

308
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,390
Hey. Say something before you leave.

309
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,829
This place is so high up.

310
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,640
It's time to get to work.

311
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,880
Don't get too nervous
and start questioning.

312
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,849
"Why were you targets?"

313
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,349
What happened?

314
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,420
Why did the two dogs
try to kill you?

315
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,319
Did you abuse animals?

316
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,460
We almost died too. Explain.

317
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,559
We don't deserve to die.

318
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,630
We just did as we were told.

319
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,730
Don't you get what's happening?

320
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,039
Our paperwork is fake.
Everything's wrong.

321
00:19:27,569 --> 00:19:31,170
Do you think your gang betrayed you?

322
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,519
Turn yourselves in
and give information for a deal.

323
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,920
And go to prison in Korea.

324
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,990
Oh, that's right. My friend...

325
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,460
is in the prison for foreigners,
and he said it's nice.

326
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,930
I'd rather go to South America.

327
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,500
I hate Korea and Russia.
I'll go to South America.

328
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,539
- I'll come too.
- That's like...

329
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:01,869
drinking Chinese wine
at a samba festival.

330
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,170
South America?

331
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,539
Say South America's
hard to get to and very dangerous.

332
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,109
South America's just as dangerous.

333
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,849
Go to where you were
and turn yourselves in.

334
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,750
Why do you insist when I said no?

335
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,119
Let's part ways now.

336
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,089
Why won't you listen?

337
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:17,549
Why should I listen to you?

338
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,390
If you get in my way,
you'll get hurt.

339
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,099
Hey. Those look like ledgers.

340
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,769
- Those suitcases.
- That must be the drugs.

341
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:35,809
Right?

342
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:38,210
Don't you smell
the scent of meth from those?

343
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,210
They must be taking them
to somewhere.

344
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:45,250
- You're right.
- Right? I'm always right...

345
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,450
My goodness.

346
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:51,319
That's gross.
He snorted into my ear.

347
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,819
You cheeky thing. You duped me?

348
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,559
It's your fault for falling for it.

349
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,490
How did you know
I'm stupid and easily influenced?

350
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,259
- It's on your face.
- Darn you.

351
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,329
Aren't you 2 scared?
2 women here alone?

352
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,069
Can you not talk about genders here?

353
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,339
Yes, that's old-fashioned.

354
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,910
- Get them.
- Get out of here.

355
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,140
I'll follow you later.

356
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,539
I can't do that.

357
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,210
Someone has to stay safe
to keep the case alive. Go.

358
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,250
I can't go.

359
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:19,579
Go, Ms. Park.

360
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,549
I can't go any further back.

361
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,289
- Get out of here.
- But...

362
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,230
Keep them occupied.

363
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,690
Darn it.

364
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,799
I'll introduce you
to a detective I know.

365
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,440
To clear your name.

366
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,539
How can I trust you?

367
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,109
Why is he so stubborn?

368
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,680
He's not half as stubborn as you.

369
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Stay still.

370
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:55,019
Song Sac, if he won't listen,
take him down.

371
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,619
Okay.

372
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,329
I mean, my shoulder. My shoulder.

373
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:05,059
My shoulder.

374
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,269
Stay here!

375
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,269
I'll kill you.

376
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,849
Don't you have a mom?

377
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,690
I don't.
I don't even know where she is.

378
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,690
But I worked
like a dog to save up...

379
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,529
to give her a good life one day.

380
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,430
Your mom must be back home.

381
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,029
Clear your name, pay the price,

382
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,400
and go back to Russia
to look after her.

383
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,109
Now...

384
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,079
for the killer move.

385
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,480
You mean that?

386
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,019
I was eight.

387
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,660
The last time I saw my mom,

388
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:10,759
I said this.

389
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,259
"Mom."

390
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,730
"Even if you leave me,
I won't be sad."

391
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,470
"Because..."

392
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,980
"if you're happy,
I would be happy too."

393
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:28,609
"And mom,"

394
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,349
"I won't be lonely."

395
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,549
"The memory of playing with you,"

396
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,250
"your voice, and your smell."

397
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,960
"Are all with me."

398
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:45,859
"Mom."

399
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:48,799
"In the next world..."

400
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,069
- Mom...
- Mom...

401
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,410
"I'll be born as your son again."

402
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,309
Mom...

403
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,750
"I love you, Mom!"

404
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,690
Mom.

405
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,099
Mom...

406
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,319
It makes me sad whenever I hear it.

407
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Mom.

408
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,960
Why are you wearing that?

409
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,700
I don't want you to see me cry.

410
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,829
You're really crazy.

411
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,109
Wait. Darn it.

412
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,079
What now?

413
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,650
No, why should I make a sacrifice?

414
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,150
Park Kyeong Seon.
Wake up. Keep going.

415
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,519
We need to leave
before the cops get here.

416
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,869
Mission clear.

417
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,440
Ms. Park. Why did you come back?

418
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,369
Would you leave if you were me?

419
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,710
Just the thought of it
made me feel bad.

420
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:14,809
It's so heavy.

421
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,680
Darn it. You're all dead.

422
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,089
I just got angrier.

423
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,029
Are you ready? Go.

424
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,170
What's this?

425
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,920
Ms. Park.

426
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,759
Detective Seo.

427
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,029
- You're awesome. Take them in.
- Okay.

428
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,829
- High-five.
- Yes.

429
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,210
Chief Prosecutor Kang
made Mr. Lee to kill me.

430
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,980
What? Chief Prosecutor Kang?

431
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,480
My goodness.

432
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,819
You'd have stopped him
if you'd known.

433
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,519
Cheol Bum, don't try to get revenge.

434
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,289
Take a detour. Patch things up.

435
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:35,730
Everyone's way too on edge.

436
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,559
What went wrong?

437
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:39,299
It's Ms. Jeong's fingerprint.

438
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,170
You disrespected
Chief Prosecutor Kang too.

439
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,440
I respected him in my way.

440
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,740
I'll call a meeting.

441
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,069
Let's get reorganized.

442
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,660
Let's talk over some juice.

443
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,900
What's wrong with your thumb?

444
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,069
This?

445
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,839
I visited a factory yesterday
and touched a machine.

446
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,410
I ruined my print.

447
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,440
Until the new flesh comes in,

448
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,980
I can't access the safe.

449
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,119
- Where's Mr. Hwang?
- You can't go in there.

450
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,319
What's going on?

451
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,750
Mr. Hwang.

452
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,390
You're under arrest for instigating
the murder of Congressman Park.

453
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,099
The warrant's still valid
for three more minutes.

454
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,140
There's nothing you can do.

455
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,869
We're leaving.

456
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,740
You'd better brace yourselves.

457
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,109
I'll see to it that
you all starve to death.

458
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,509
You're not going anywhere.

459
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,450
(We'll work hard for our citizens
with warm hearts.)

460
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,619
We still have three minutes.

461
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,589
Anton.

462
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:20,259
Who instigated the murder
of Congressman Park?

463
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,039
And who instigated...

464
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,410
the murder of me, Prosecutor Park,
who's pretty as usual?

465
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,950
There's one more left!

466
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,660
Who ordered you guys
to attempt murder?

467
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,410
My goodness,
it's 11:30pm on the dot.

468
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,849
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,819
What's all this? What's going on?

470
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:21,160
Put your hands down. Put them down!

471
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,660
Why are you upset
when we arrested suspects?

472
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,400
How could you arrest everyone
without any solid evidence?

473
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:35,509
That sword... Where did you get it?

474
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,309
I got it luckily.

475
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,319
Superintendent Nam, you should be
locked behind bars also!
