00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,940
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,970
Hey, Song Sac.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,679
Don't you have a chicken sandwich?

4
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:14,650
I'm so sick of gimbap.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,460
It's so popular that it gets
sold out as soon as it's displayed.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,989
Why don't you just say thank you
and eat whatever I give you?

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,329
Why do you complain so much?

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:24,629
Please keep one for me next time.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,500
That's my wish.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,769
What happened to your lips?
Did Jang Ryong hit you again?

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,109
Hey.

12
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,340
Why don't you fight against him?
Why do you always get beaten up?

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,280
I'll beat him up one day.

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,649
I'll beat him up hard.

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,950
Peter Piper picked...

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,450
Wait and see, Jang Ryong!

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,619
Hey, hey.

18
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,789
If you feel down
after getting beaten up,

19
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,130
you should think of something happy.

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,189
Something happy?

21
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,159
Think of something happy.

22
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,829
- Thailand.
- Tom yum kung.

23
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,899
Jang Yong, that little...

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,109
Think of something
that makes you really happy.

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,680
For instance,
imagine smelling fried chicken...

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,680
that a delivery man is holding
in an elevator.

27
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:19,049
I know. That smell is really nice.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,920
I love the smell of
jjajang ramyeon...

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,790
in an internet cafe.

30
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,760
Just thinking of it makes me drool.

31
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,260
Here's another one.

32
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,060
The smell of pork belly grilling...

33
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,200
inside a studio apartment
where its door is open.

34
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,900
Right. The smell of pork belly...

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,739
Yo Han, didn't you hear something?

36
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:43,640
I haven't eaten anything yet,
so you can't hear anything.

37
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,840
There's a customer, you pig.

38
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,409
How can you call me that? No wonder
Jang Ryong always beats you up.

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,060
Jang Ryong. Jang Ryong, that jerk.

40
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:08,129
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,569
I'm just telling you this
because you're a regular.

42
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,740
You're really beautiful.

43
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,740
I've been meaning to tell you
since last month.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,840
- Excuse me, part-timer.
- Yes?

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,680
It's very rude to judge
someone's face directly.

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,719
And who are you to judge my face?

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,949
It's not a judgment.
I'm praising your beauty sincerely.

48
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,090
Would you like it
if someone tells you...

49
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,090
that you look like baozi?

50
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,430
What's baozi?

51
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,430
It's a Chinese dumpling.

52
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,830
(Big Dumpling)

53
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,569
And also...

54
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,129
Big Dumpling is
buy 1 get 1 free, right?

55
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,340
Yes, it is.

56
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,909
I look like a Chinese dumpling.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,610
Even if such thoughts
come across your mind,

58
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,080
control your mind
by drawing a cross, okay?

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,680
Yes, ma'am.

60
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,280
Why are you yelling at him?

61
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:59,580
I'm just correcting
what he's done wrong.

62
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,020
I didn't yell at him, Father.

63
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,659
Gosh, you smell like alcohol.

64
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,590
Even so, you shouldn't have
yelled and talked down to him.

65
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,460
It's the abuse of power. Right?

66
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,330
What do you mean by that?

67
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,300
It's heartfelt advice...

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Which year were you born in?

69
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,599
Oh, I was born in 1993.

70
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,370
1993?

71
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,870
No way.

72
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,580
Father, he was born in 1993.

73
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:27,949
1993?

74
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,449
What happened
in the Galaxy in 1993?

75
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,520
Oh, in 1993, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
was discovered,

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,789
and it's known to have
collided with Jupiter...

77
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,419
Excuse me. I'm a lot older than you.

78
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:44,030
"A lot older than you". You're just
an old grumpy person. Right?

79
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm leaving, grumpy person. Bye.

80
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
Goodbye.

81
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,039
I can't believe you were born
in 1993. You don't look like it.

82
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,740
Darn it, who spilled water...

83
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,280
on the ground?

84
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,349
- Gosh.
- What a sight to see.

85
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,449
Father.

86
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Get up.

87
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,789
Why did you drink so much?
Are you okay?

88
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:15,889
What's happening?

89
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,759
It's me.

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,370
Hello, Prosecutor.

91
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,839
How could you touch the body
of a priest without permission?

92
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,610
What would I get from
touching your body?

93
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,209
Why are you accusing me of that?
My goodness.

94
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,850
If you touch me one more time...

95
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,449
If you touch me one more time...

96
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,850
What should I do?

97
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:43,050
Hey. I'm leaving.

98
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,959
What are you doing?

99
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,230
My gosh.
Are you allowed to behave this way?

100
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,029
Whatever. I'm going home.

101
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,069
How much do you need
to be rotten...

102
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,170
to be satisfied, Prosecutor?

103
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,009
What a thing to say.

104
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,339
Father.

105
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,310
I can't be corrupt because
I don't have the power yet.

106
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,220
You're not getting this
when you're so smart.

107
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,759
It's not the power
that goes corrupt.

108
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,930
Only the corrupt people
approaches the power.

109
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,600
In that sense,
you're on the right path.

110
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,100
You're right on it.

111
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:32,540
I got you all right, so go home.

112
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,069
Wash up and go to bed, okay?

113
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,310
Okay.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,550
Thank you so much
for serving our country today.

115
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,889
Gosh, he always offends me
in a holy way.

116
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,870
You're not getting this
when you're so smart.

117
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,810
It's not the power
that goes corrupt.

118
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,839
Only the corrupt people
approaches the power.

119
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,610
In that sense,
you're on the right path.

120
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,319
You're right on it.

121
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,389
Yes, Ms. Park.

122
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry to call you at this hour.

123
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,199
How many years were we going to
sentence that idol star?

124
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,040
Let me see.

125
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,939
4 years and 3 months.

126
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,410
He won't be released until 2022
when the World Cup is held in Qatar.

127
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,449
Is there anything you want to say?

128
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,449
Let's cut the sentence in half
and let him watch the World Cup.

129
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,589
Make a new document tomorrow.

130
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,920
Yes, Ms. Park.

131
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,680
Stop peeing, you jerk!

132
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,079
It stinks.

133
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,649
I can't sleep because it stinks.

134
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,990
Did you have a beer?

135
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,930
You pee a lot if you drink beer.

136
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,730
What's there in life?

137
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,100
That's how life goes.

138
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,240
That's how life goes.

139
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,310
(The Master of Swords)

140
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,779
Bang.

141
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,430
It's hot.

142
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,300
Have some. It's really good.

143
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,240
Did you wake us up
so we can have this?

144
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,769
Why are you already asleep?

145
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,509
You should have this
late-night snack. It's really good.

146
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,170
Have one each.

147
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,079
- We should pray before...
- Here.

148
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,819
It's so hot.

149
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,950
Cool it down and eat it slowly.

150
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,919
Did something happen?

151
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,059
Nothing happened. Why?

152
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,330
Do you want some soju?

153
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,799
I'll just have this.

154
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:49,230
I feel like something is missing
with just this.

155
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,200
Soy sauce. I'll bring some. Hold on.

156
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,139
Soy sauce.

157
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,009
Have some with soy sauce.

158
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,649
I'll make it for you.

159
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,320
- Now...
- Gosh.

160
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,549
My gosh. What's going on?

161
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,120
- Just leave it, Father Kim.
- I'm sorry.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,259
It's okay. Just leave it.

163
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,029
Sorry for being careless.

164
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,190
You should sleep.
We'll sleep after eating this.

165
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,059
- Will you?
- Yes.

166
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,370
Then I'll head back in first.

167
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm the happiest when...

168
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,169
others enjoy eating
the dumplings I bought.

169
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,809
So please cool it down
and eat it slowly like this.

170
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,279
- Father Kim.
- Father Kim.

171
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,590
Cool it down and eat it like this.

172
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,919
I'll dip it in the soy sauce
for you.

173
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,759
It shouldn't be too hot now.

174
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,389
That's great.

175
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:49,129
It's cooled down now.

176
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,029
Have some.

177
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,470
- I'll head back in first now.
- Yes.

178
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,370
- Goodnight.
- Yes.

179
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,409
What kind
of religious lifestyle is this?

180
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Why is he being like this today?

181
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:12,779
I feel bad seeing him smile.

182
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,490
You feel bad, right?

183
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,220
I feel scared.

184
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,559
He's bursting out of anger,
and his emotions are in a mess now.

185
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,289
Are you going to scold me today too?

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,169
You're scolding me nonstop.

187
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,830
What are you doing? Evacuate now.

188
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,259
Evacuate.

189
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,070
Didn't you say there were
no children in there?

190
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,669
Yes, there weren't. Let this go.

191
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't lie, you punk.

192
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,799
What? Aren't you going to let go?

193
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,139
There were children in there.

194
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,870
I told you that everyone
who's not Korean...

195
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,409
can be killed since
they're our enemy.

196
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,379
They're children who are clueless.

197
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,950
All of them are our enemy!

198
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,919
Should children be exceptions?

199
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,950
- Are they exceptions?
- They were clueless children.

200
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,559
Be ready to step down
when we get back.

201
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,259
Understand?

202
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,429
They were clueless children.

203
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,259
Who are you nagging?

204
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,750
I couldn't even...

205
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,590
protect you either, Father Lee.

206
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,179
You were the person I wanted to
protect until the end of my life.

207
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,850
I don't know what else
I'll be able to protect...

208
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,679
anymore.

209
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,649
Why aren't you eating?

210
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,090
I already ate.

211
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,519
What do you mean you already ate?

212
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,620
I can tell that
you had a drink yesterday.

213
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,360
Have some to cure your hangover.

214
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:49,330
It's okay.

215
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,799
Do you not like our Russian dish?

216
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,529
It's a dish from our hometown.

217
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:59,570
I heard that you can't control
that annoying Father properly.

218
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,740
Do you think you can
loosen up like that?

219
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,370
You should do it properly.

220
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,679
What if things get big?

221
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,450
Don't worry. That won't happen.

222
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I trust you.

223
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Look at my eyes.

224
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,559
Look. Look at these faithful eyes.

225
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,230
If you handle this well,

226
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,399
I'll lead you
to the land filled with honey.

227
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,470
Can I leave, please?

228
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,169
Finish it before you leave.

229
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,809
It's okay.
You should leave if you're busy.

230
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,240
You can go.

231
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,720
Isn't your old partner's anniversary
of death close, Dae Young?

232
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,590
Look at your pupils.

233
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,129
Stop staring at me.

234
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,299
Don't forget the lesson that
your old partner taught you,

235
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,100
Dae Young.

236
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:33,960
Young Cheon, is that you?

237
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,240
Young Cheon, what...

238
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,169
Young Cheon, wake up.

239
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,629
Yes.

240
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
Okay. Got it.

241
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,230
What?

242
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,569
Look at this first.

243
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,309
It's the CCTV
at the entrance of the church.

244
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,039
After the time that Father Lee
supposedly left the church...

245
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,150
at 11:20pm...

246
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,049
It skipped two minutes.

247
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,450
Yes, it seems like it's still since
there are no cars,

248
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,720
but the two minutes
of the footage is missing.

249
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,220
The screen might've lagged.
That happens sometimes.

250
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,289
Is this a random videotape
that lags without a reason?

251
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,029
This isn't all.

252
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,799
Down this road, all the CCTV
are missing one minute...

253
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,670
of footage in order.

254
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,210
Is this the original file?

255
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:58,650
The situation room said it is.

256
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,279
What did they say about
the missing time?

257
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,890
I was told that there's an error
sometimes due to its old age.

258
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,460
They said they're preparing
for an upgrade or something.

259
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,319
Digital technology
can't always be perfect.

260
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,490
Your phones can lag sometimes too.

261
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,130
Again. How can you break
the police's table like this?

262
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,630
Are you kidding with me?

263
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,140
Are evidential data like movies
which can be edited?

264
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,109
What do you mean by that?
What do you want us to do about it?

265
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,309
Excuse me, Detective Koo.

266
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,940
CCTVs in convenience stores
nowadays...

267
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,339
aren't even like this.
Did you know that?

268
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,779
Why are you being like this again?
You even damaged our property.

269
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,289
You need to compensate for this.
I'll send the bill to the church.

270
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,400
My gosh.

271
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,440
I'll actually send
the bills this time.

272
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,940
(Warm and trustworthy police
that serves our citizens)

273
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,250
(Your troubleshooter,
Gudam Police Station)

274
00:19:25,569 --> 00:19:29,839
Teacher, where do we take
our photos now?

275
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,339
Well...

276
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,250
Isn't that man
a Father from a church?

277
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,680
I don't think so.

278
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,819
A Father like that doesn't exist.

279
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,440
Thank you, chief.

280
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,640
Did you get rid of the original
footages from the CCTV?

281
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,380
Okay, I'll pass it on
to the Chief Prosecutor.

282
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:09,109
Okay.

283
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,180
Why?

284
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,450
Ms. Park.

285
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,789
Are you still against arguing
with a monk that...

286
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,990
I mentioned yesterday?

287
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,430
You're rather persistent.

288
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,700
Can't you be like that with work?

289
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,970
How can you suggest something
like that in a time like this?

290
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:41,240
This is
the special prosecution unit.

291
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,579
What?

292
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:46,849
Yes, all right.

293
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,990
Ms. Park, Mr. Kim the idol...

294
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,089
attempted suicide by hanging
himself in the detention center.

295
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,230
He is moved to a hospital, but
he's still in a serious condition.

296
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,630
Ms. Park.

297
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,200
How did you handle the situation...

298
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,369
and make him attempt suicide?

299
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:09,769
You said you were confident.

300
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,940
Did you cause this after saying
that you were confident?

301
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:16,680
Reporters are going to crowd
around here and there. You know?

302
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,349
I'll handle the reporters properly.

303
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,089
Forget it. Just get off work now
before they arrive.

304
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,619
Got it?

305
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,730
Yes, Director.

306
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,029
I apologize.

307
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,230
Don't worry too much.

308
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,470
Well, we can... Yes.

309
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,539
I understand.

310
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:52,220
Police officers,

311
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,049
I'm sure you have difficulties
handling trauma you experience.

312
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,690
The National Police Agency is
carrying out new treatment...

313
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:02,259
program and our clinic is in charge
of counseling Gudam Police Station.

314
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,299
A round of applause.

315
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,609
If you're going through mental
difficulties, you can contact us.

316
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,940
Please don't hesitate.

317
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,710
Isn't the doctor pretty?

318
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,049
How is she pretty?

319
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,430
All appointments are confidential.

320
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,670
Thank you.

321
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,539
Thank you.

322
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,779
There's no secret
in this small town.

323
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,180
Everyone will find out somehow.

324
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,750
Don't worry about that.

325
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,720
Okay, I won't.

326
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,359
(Let's not buy
from stores that tout.)

327
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:23,109
What are you looking for?

328
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,910
You.

329
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:30,250
Have a seat. You don't have to
get up to greet me.

330
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,019
Sit down.

331
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,019
You look the same.

332
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,160
Hae Il.

333
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:42,529
The genius hacker
who hacked NIS...

334
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,529
is living like this now.

335
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,799
It's all in the past.

336
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,029
What brings you here suddenly?

337
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,299
What do you mean?

338
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,240
I'm here to ask you a favor.

339
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,640
Didn't you know?

340
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,609
I've stopped hacking a long time
ago. I can't help you out anymore.

341
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,349
- Really?
- Yes.

342
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,349
Since some of your deeds have
statute of limitation left,

343
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,420
- Sorry?
- I should bring some up.

344
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,089
- Wait.
- How many charges do you have?

345
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:12,720
Finance, media, and what else?
Pornography?

346
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,029
Pornography wasn't me. That...

347
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,230
You let me go last time,
but why are you doing this now?

348
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,700
Are you going to
listen to me now or what?

349
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,369
What is it?

350
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:27,700
It's simple.

351
00:24:28,569 --> 00:24:30,039
The whereabouts of two people.

352
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,740
Well, that's simple.

353
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,950
So what price are you thinking of?

354
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,890
How does a Father have money?
I'm a Father.

355
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,119
What?

356
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,559
Go to this location
and secure the witnesses.

357
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,000
What are you going to do
with the money?

358
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:29,630
Apart from paying off your debt.

359
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,470
I'll leave this country...

360
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,200
and hide for a while.

361
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:35,839
What about you?

362
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,910
I'll pay off my debt first...

363
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
and enjoy all I can.

364
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,109
I'll enjoy myself until the end.

365
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,779
You must be kidding.

366
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:50,819
You were really in France.

367
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,089
But...

368
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,359
instead of Seine River,

369
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,690
I see the Bukhan River flowing.

370
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,400
Help.

371
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,000
Gosh.

372
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,640
I was assuming that you were tailed.

373
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,710
Hold on.

374
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,250
You'll go to the fiery pit
if you hit women.

375
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,839
(The Fiery Priest)

376
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,049
Just stop them no matter what!

377
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,420
(The investigation
faces difficulties.)

378
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,150
You lost whom?

379
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:28,720
Why are you doing this?

380
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,420
The only way to live
as a decent human being...

381
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,220
is to grab opportunities
given by God.

382
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,359
Yesterday you were
helplessly drunk,

383
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,890
today you're reckless Father Kim.

384
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,890
(The pseudo goes for the children.)

385
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,829
This man will take care of you
from now on.

386
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,029
The Father is here.
He neglected his own God...

387
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,430
and came to our savior.

388
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,170
- Father.
- Father.
