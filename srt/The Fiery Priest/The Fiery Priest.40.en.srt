(Final episode)

3
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,439
Did you call me?

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,280
Yes, I have a question for you.

5
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,750
Go ahead.

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,880
The documents
of the Rising Moon case,

7
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,550
Rising Moon's account files,

8
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,349
and the report of investigation
into corrupted officials of Gudam.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,390
Did you really investigate those
on your own, Prosecutor Kim?

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,859
- Yes.
- I'm not trying to blame you.

11
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,969
You are trying
your best to solve the case...

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,629
but it seems like
I don't know about that.

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,440
Please tell me.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,439
I can't put on a screen
of indifference anymore.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,840
I have a senior prosecutor.

16
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,939
She is
Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon...

17
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,880
at Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office.

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,149
"Park Kyeong Seon at Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office"?

19
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,920
All of us have committed crimes.

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,219
So let's just admit and cooperate.

21
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,119
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:54,759
Admit and cooperate about what?

23
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,799
You have dragged me into this mess!

24
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,829
You asked me to help you first,
you psycho!

25
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,640
I don't belong to Gudam,
understand?

26
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,700
In fact, you came to see...

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,310
me and Superintendent Nam first.

28
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,140
What "fact" are
you blabbering about?

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,439
Anyway, I've never done that.

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,879
I'm the victim!

31
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,980
I'm the only one wearing
a patient gown here!

32
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,879
I'm the one...

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,319
who has been falsely charged.

34
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,290
My only life motto is enlightenment.

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,359
And they asked me for money.

36
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,260
How could
high-ranking officers do that?

37
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,790
- Ouch!
- What did you say?

38
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,200
You brought us
the golden toad first!

39
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,299
Why are you hitting me?

40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,569
I'm going to turn into...
Do you know how old I am?

41
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,000
- Guess how old I am!
- What did you say?

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
- Guess!
- That's enough!

43
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,579
It's hard to carry on
a conversation!

44
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,409
Sit down.

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,680
Are you supposed to change your
clothes and be with us?

46
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,719
He's right.
But you look so excited yet.

47
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,219
Don't you worry about that.

48
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,859
I will deal with you first
and then go to prison.

49
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,359
By the way, Chief Prosecutor Kang
ordered to murder Congressman Park.

50
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,200
Hwang Cheol Bum and your underlings
conducted the murder, right?

51
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,829
I was there,
so don't even think about lying.

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,569
With that being said,

53
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,870
Congressman Park is responsible
for all these.

54
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,240
We were dragged...

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,310
and Congressman Park
set the whole plan.

56
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,479
That's right! Congressman Park
did everything!

57
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,250
My goodness. That's enough.

58
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,780
You can't just put the blame on him
just because he's not here with us.

59
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,050
Mr. Park.

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,889
This is just ridiculous.

61
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,729
Chief Prosecutor Kang
and Superintendent Nam.

62
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,340
You are no better than waste!

63
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,870
Who did what?

64
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,340
How did you...

65
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,610
You were dead. You were dead!

66
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:21,009
You've been pretending
to be dead up until now?

67
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,680
- What a fraud.
- You did method acting.

68
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:27,050
Are you now out of breath?

69
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,110
You were murdered by
an unidentified culprit.

70
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,449
The nurse witnessed...

71
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,319
We should lie to deal
with those who lie.

72
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,289
I will expose everything today!

73
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,689
My goodness.

74
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,889
I will expose everything.

75
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,000
Everything even Chief of Borough
doesn't know!

76
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,800
Take your time.

77
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,300
Ease your anger and relax.

78
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,870
I...

79
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,110
won't move as you wish.

80
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,909
Oh, my. All of a sudden?

81
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:04,780
The believers of my enlightenment
won't let you get away with this.

82
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,789
What are "the believers of
your enlightenment" going to do?

83
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,759
They will arm themselves
with my enlightenment...

84
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,860
and...

85
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,460
exterminate you.

86
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,529
Understand?

87
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:20,129
Me?

88
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,170
Then let's see what happens.

89
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,339
Many people are shocked by
the truth of Maegakgyo.

90
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,910
The video recording of
the usual speech and behavior...

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,980
of Ki Yong Moon,
the master of Maegakgyo,

92
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,050
has been revealed
by an anonymous source.

(Ugly Truth about Master
of Maegakgyo, Ki Yong Moon)

Eliminate ugly believers.
They make me sick.

95
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,819
They will never find enlightenment.

96
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:45,920
I can't see any enlightenment
in their faces.

97
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,490
How come we don't have
enough money this month?

98
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,529
Is it that hard to make
stupid people fall for us?

99
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,000
- My goodness.
- Enlightenment!

100
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,699
Enlightenment. My foot.

101
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,670
Let's empty their pockets
until they end up on the streets.

102
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,670
Okay?

103
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,540
My goodness!
That video clip was on my phone.

104

110
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,079
We can get anything from everything.

111
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,949
We get anything, everything.

112
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,329
We can't get caught.

113
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,600
Hang in there a bit longer.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,100
If we hide for long enough,
they'll give up on us.

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,800
How much longer must we wait?

116
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,800
It's been two weeks already.

117
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,639
It's still bearable.

118
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,980
Save up on the water.

119
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,279
The police will be sick of
looking for us.

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,079
The idiot cops.

121
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:22,550
They won't know we're here.

122
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,829
My gosh. What's that?

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,569
Hey, you lot are still here?

124
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,870
Isn't it humid in here?

125
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,939
You knew we were here?

126
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,339
Yes, we've known for a week.

127
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:45,110
Then why didn't you come for us?

128
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,649
Sorry. We had
some more pressing cases.

129
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,050
Darn you.

130
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:52,920
What? Shall we come back later?

131
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,589
Shall we block the entrance?

132
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,720
No, no, we'll come with you.

133
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:00,120
Order us some food. We need food.

134
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,829
We want food.

135
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:05,060
Order us anything
that won't take too long.

(Ewha Womans University)

137
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,439
Why did you bother coming here?
You're embarrassing me.

138
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,970
How many years must you stay?

139
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,209
I don't know.

140
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,180
Are you here to tease me?

141
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,779
I don't know
how long you'll be here,

142
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,819
but if I'm able to
stay here in Korea,

143
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,889
I'll make a lot of money.

144

145
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,889
come to me.

146
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,259
No thanks. Get on with
your own life.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,029
I'll...

148
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,240
manage somehow on my own,
so you fend for yourself.

149
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,170
Take care.

152

Watch out for other motorcycles.

153
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,879
You ride crazy fast.

154
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,519
You'll get killed that way.

It's really over, isn't it?

165
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,139
Yes. It's all over.

166
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,509
Did you hand over all the files?

167
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,750
Yes. I scraped everything together
and shipped them all off.

You've all been through
so much. Seriously.

He's recovering at a fast pace.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I think this is my last week.

173
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,500
As a cop.

174
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,070
Yes. This is a real conclusion.

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,710

176
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,980
I'll leave.

What do you mean you'll leave?

178

No. You must stay.

Yes. I think it's wrong
for you to quit too.

00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,860
I think so too.

as if it's a good thing?

Why not? It's nice to walk together.

No.

if you want to confess
and then become the Lord's child.

209

364
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,420
Let's take a selfie.

365
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,759
Me too, me too. I want to be in it.

366
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,960
- Me too.
- Me first.

367
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,359
See? Papa!

368
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,119
Why isn't he coming? He's so slow.
Gosh, really.

369
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,430
I faithfully bow or depend
on Amitabha... You crazy punk!

370
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,359
May the Lord be with you.

371
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,230
People cannot even live 100 years,

372
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,430
but they live
with anxieties of 1,000 years.

373
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,829
Gosh, really.

374
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,599
You're here.

375
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,769
The weather is great.

376
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,740
Oh, my. What's this?
Why the Buddhist monk?

377
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,509
I told you it's a priest.
You got the wrong concept.

378
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,880
- Gosh, I'm so stressed.
- Gosh, I'm so stressed.

379
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:22,349
It's the integration of religions.

380
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:24,420
Why isn't Detective Seo here yet?
Where is she?

381
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,029
Look at me carefully.
It's a very graceful movement.

382
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,900
What's that?

383
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,200
Look at them. It's driving me crazy.

384
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,299
Nothing is going as I planned.

385
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,569
Goodness.

386
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:50,750
I need to get them
on a shuttle bus to the fiery pit.

387
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,150
Let's go!

388
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,849
Shall we go?

389
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,119
(The Fiery Priest)

390
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,880
(Thanks to all the viewers
for watching The Fiery Priest.)
