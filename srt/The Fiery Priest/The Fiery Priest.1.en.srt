(Episode 1)

2
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,270
How dare you!

3
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:01,899
How dare such
a loutish evil spirit...

4
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,099
throw a fit in this town?

5
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,109
You not only hurt the elders
of this town...

6
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,540
by harassing them...

7
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:11,109
but you also
went inside the body...

8
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:14,010
of the first son who has to
carry on a family line.

9
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,579
You're making so much trouble.

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,780
My goodness.

11
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,579
What's wrong with my son?

12
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:22,950
How can I save him?
What should I do?

13
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,689
He's a shameless evil spirit.

14
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,989
What did he say?

15
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,400
He said if you pay enough money
for him to travel, he'll leave now.

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,900
Are you sure you will?

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,870
- Please hold on.
- Okay.

18
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,469
My gosh.
Hurry up and give me your money.

19
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,239
Hurry up and give it to me.

20
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,079
- My goodness.
- Borrow someone's if you have none.

21
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,180
Hold that thought.

22
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,420
Father Kim?

23
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,599
They should pull out this huge rock.

24
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,629
I could've been hurt. How annoying!

25
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,439
Father Kim, I'll take care of this.

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,400
Why is my briefcase so heavy?

27
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,509
This evil spirit won't go away
with Catholic exorcism.

28
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,580
He's right, Father Kim.

29
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,979
Shaman Chundong here
will get rid of...

30
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,819
I think he's just dirty,
not possessed.

31
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,620
If you're confident,
then give it a go.

32
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,620
He was under control because of me.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,530
The evil spirit in him
is a pretty strong one.

34
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,689
What are all these?

35
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,710
Dear leader of all angels,
St. Michael the Archangel.

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,210
Please protect us from the fight
against violence and power.

37
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,620
Protect us from the fight against
the evil spirits under the sun.

38
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,520
Gosh, it really hurts.

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,319
Evil spirit, hang in there.

40
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,430
What?

41
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,830
I think he's crying.

42
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,659
Are you hurt?

43
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,400
All right.

44
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,340
If you bear the pain...

45
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,039
after I hit your shin...

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,110
and the back of your hand 20 times,

47
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,340
then you'll pass the second test.

48
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,810
It's my earnest hope...

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,909
for Satan to stop
possessing humans...

50
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,849
and harming the church.

51
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,919
Sir.

52
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,189
I think the evil spirit is gone.

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,659
Seeing your complexion,
it's still in you.

54
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,689
It's really gone.

55
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:42,360
What?

56
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,159
You have no patience at all.

57
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,699
What on earth happened?

58
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,770
Cheol Yong told me that...

59
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,340
The evil spirit is still in there.

60
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,870
I was totally fooled.

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,039
Go and wash.
You smell like stinky tofu.

62
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,280
You scumbag.

63
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,080
Go home right now.

64
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,379
That evil spirit...

65
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,120
You're dead meat, jerk.

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,719
Come here.

67
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,289
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

68
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,229
Who are you guys?

69
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,529
You shouldn't have
interrupted our exorcism.

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,259
What were you thinking?

71
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,579
Gosh, darn it.

72
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:52,860
Hey!

73
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,199
Gosh, why is he following me?

74
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,069
I'm going to kill you
once I catch you.

75
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:06,740
Didn't I tell you not to scam...

76
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,079
the elders?

77
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,579
Have you still not come
to your senses?

78
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,319
Come here. Get over here.

79
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,990
- I taste blood.
- Gosh, my neck!

80
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,060
- What?
- Your nails are hurting me.

81
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,959
You didn't plan this alone, did you?
Who told you to do this?

82
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,060
Mr. Oh!

83
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,069
Mr. Oh, the loan shark.

84
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,279
Is Mr. Oh inside?

85
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,319
You talk very rudely for a priest.

86
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,060
Brothers, please step to the side.

87
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
We don't go easy on priests,
pastors, or monks.

88
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,629
I never asked you to go easy on me.

89
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Hey.

90
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,670
Gosh, my arm.

91
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,060
Brothers, you'll end up in hell
if you hit a priest.

92
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,600
I should book a bus that's headed
to hell for all of you.

Paul.

95
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,610
You should come outside
while I'm being nice.

96
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,009
Do I need to shout
for you to listen to me?

97
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,250
Hurry up and come outside!

98
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,230
Gosh, it's so cramped in here.

99
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,500
Would you like a cup of coffee?

100
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,700
Hey, I'll be off now.

101
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:55,809
I'll come back for the cups later.

102
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,429
Goodness, Father.
What is wrong with you?

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,600
I know the Bible says it's a sin
to give out private loans.

104
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,269
But it's also a form of business.

105
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,700
Plus, I give a lot of offerings.

106
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,769
I'm not here for that.

107
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,070
I heard you were the one...

108
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,179
who told Cheol Yong to scam
the elders in the neighborhood.

109
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,740
Oh, that.

110
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,850
I was just trying to revitalize
shamanism in our neighborhood.

111
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,320
Cut the nonsense.

112
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,019
The people in the marketplace are
practically broke because of you.

113
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,429
On top of that, you even tried
to scam the naive elders?

114
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:50,230
Gosh, don't be so angry.

115
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,559
My guys always get beaten up by you
every time they try to collect.

116
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,700
And now, you're even
going to beat me up?

117
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,700
Forgiveness and love.

118
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,399
You should be doing
what God told you to do.

119
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,669
Wait a minute.

120
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,269
He's telling me something.

121
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,720
God...

122
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
just told me to beat you up.

(The Fiery Priest)

124
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,039
(Seoul Central
District Prosecutor's Office)

125
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
- She's here.
- It's her.

126
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
- Prosecutor Park.
- Hurry.

127
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,350
Gosh, you startled me.

128
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:51,289
- Are you filming me?
- Are you Park Kyeong Seon,

129
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,360
the prosecutor in charge of
the Nonhyeon-dong meth case?

130
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,659
Yes, that's me.
Can you give me a minute?

131
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,600
Let me put my bangs down.

132
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,100
The public doesn't seem to agree...

133
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,700
with the primary investigation.

134
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,299
I just asked you
to give me a minute.

135
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,399
Don't you think you wrapped up
the investigation too quickly?

136
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,700
We have testimonies
saying the same thing.

137
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,240
I don't want to do the interview.

138
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,379
Kim Keon Yong was the
distributor and main culprit,

139
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,009
but he was only accused of
abusing and possessing meth.

140
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,009
Meanwhile, Kim,
an idol singer who was...

141
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,210
only guilty of possessing the drug,
was accused of distributing it.

142
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,779
And some people think you went
easy on Kim Keon Yong...

143
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,450
because he's the son
of Hanjoo Group's chairman.

144
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,590
What are your thoughts on that?

145
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,360
Listen to me.

146
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,019
Let's say I have candies at home.

147
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,490
If people come over to my house
and eat those candies,

148
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,529
would that make me a distributor?

149
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,259
Or would it be the person
who took that candy...

150
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,730
and gave it away to other people
outside my house?

151
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:36,570
So are you saying Kim Keon Yong
was the one who had candies at home,

152
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,539
and the idol star was the one
who took that candies...

153
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,600
- and gave it away to other people?
- Bingo.

154
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,440
But didn't Kim Keon Yong possess
a huge amount of drugs?

155
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,509
Why are you acting like
you work for a tabloid?

156
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,080
We never announced whether it was
a large amount or small amount.

157
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,120
But the public are still
very much suspicious of this case,

158
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,950
so could you please say a word
to explain?

159
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,419
- Prosecutor Park, please.
- Tell us what you think.

160
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,490
- Please say something.
- Prosecutor Park.

161
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,759
- Wait.
- Prosecutor Park.

162
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,659
I hope you all become rich.

163
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,299
- Ma'am!
- Prosecutor Park.

164
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,539
I'm so embarrassed.

165
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,240
How in the world
are you handling things?

166
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,909
We have proof that Kim Keon Yong
was the distributor,

167
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,909
and the testimonies of other
drug abusers are all coherent.

168
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,450
We should arrest
Kim Keon Yong first.

169
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,519
Please issue an arrest warrant.

170
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,990
Didn't I tell you to make...

171
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,320
the idol star become
the main culprit?

172
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,590
I was going to do that.

173
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
But I don't think it'll be possible
because the culprit...

174
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,059
is Chairman Kim Joong Chul's son.

175
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:38,659
The press already...

176
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,799
Let me get this straight.

177
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:44,240
You're going to get a warrant
and arrest the culprit...

178
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,070
which will make everyone
in the country trust you.

179
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,809
Meanwhile, they'll all be cursing
and badmouthing me.

180
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,009
Is that what you want?

181
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,980
- No, that's not it.
- My gosh.

182
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,120
Gosh, why do I have so many selfies?

183
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,500
The technology is crazy these days.

184
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,370
There's not a single outdoor lamp,
but I can see everyone so clearly.

185
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,370
Gosh.

186
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,179
Goodness.

187
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,149
Is this you?

188
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,419
Why would you even bother
counting the bills?

189
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,159
I'm pretty sure the owners
of the illegal massage parlors...

190
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,129
gave you more than enough money.

191
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,600
Prosecutor Park, you're mistaken.

192
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,100
I'm mistaken?

193
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,000
Cut the nonsense,
and listen to me carefully.

194
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,139
Do you want to get fired
for bribery...

195
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,769
and live the rest of your life
in shame?

196
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,179
Or will you do as I say...

197
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,610
and keep your job until you retire?

198
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,190
If you come here one more time
regarding this case,

199
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,289
I'll make sure I completely
destroy your career...

200
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,960
and your life.

201
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,259
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,730
You see,

203
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,370
our brains...

204
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:26,740
aren't just in our skulls
to fill in the space.

205
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,769
So what should we do with them?

206
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,179
What should we do?

207
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
We should use them.

208
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,350
Exactly.

209
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:38,679
Go use your brain!

210
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:45,720
Stress.

211
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,730
(Yeosu Police Station)

212
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,590
Why did you do that?

213
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,830
How could a priest be so impatient?

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,870
It's not about being patient.
You know what he did.

215
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,399
What did I do? Do you have proof?

216
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,110
Do you have proof of my scheming
with the shaman?

217
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,009
Proof? I've heard everything.

218
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,940
What are you looking at?

219
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,210
- Stop it!
- Did you see his face?

220
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,210
That's enough!

221
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,350
Words cannot be used as evidence.

222
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,450
Darn it, that little...

223
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,350
I almost cursed. I'm sorry.

224
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,620
Father Kim, please sit down.

225
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,690
I'll scold him,
so please spare us this once.

226
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,259
- I'd like to.
- Please...

227
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,730
But I can't let this one go.

228
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:28,899
My employees are all hospitalized.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,100
- One of them broke his jaw.
- Hey.

230
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,639
- Be quiet.
- I'm telling you.

231
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,769
Where is he?

232
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:37,940
- Please be quiet.
- He's here.

233
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,409
Are you okay, Father Kim?

234
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:41,379
If you hit them with love,
that is reasonable.

235
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,710
- You did well.
- Sir.

236
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,049
They should switch places.

237
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,620
- That little...
- What do you mean?

238
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,350
Can't you see that I'm bleeding?

239
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,289
- Be quiet!
- Stop!

240
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,690
- I had my reasons.
- Stop it.

241
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,159
- Please calm down.
- I will...

242
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,659
- carry the cross.
- Stop it.

243
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:57,190
- Please be quiet!
- Sit down, please.

244
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,269
You guys are always like this.

245
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,600
(Receive your punishment.)

246
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,970
Hello.

247
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,669
I come to you to help.

248
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,539
I give it my all.

249
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,879
I'm Detective Koo Dae Young...

250
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:13,940
of Gudam Police Station's
Violent Crimes.

251
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,950
If you're a victim
of an illegal doing,

252
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,919
please report to me.

253
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,590
I will punish all the wrongdoers.

254
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,090
Goodness, you wish.

255
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,590
Goodness, Ms. Han.

256
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,029
Are you Miss Korea?
Why do you wear that?

257
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,460
It's a campaign.

258
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,059
I come to you to help,
and I promise to punish.

259
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,299
It sounds great.

260
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,929
Don't be ridiculous.

261
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,440
No matter how much we report,
the police ignore us.

262
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:40,669
I'm sure you help.

263
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:44,340
Do something about those Russians
from the neighborhood.

264
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:47,139
They get drunk
and cause trouble here.

265
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,279
We're always so anxious.

266
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,649
How dare they?

267
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,779
If they come again...

268
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,490
We will call you and only you.

269
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,990
Ms. Kim, you dyed your hair.

270
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,559
Enjoy the food and be happy.

271
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,529
Next time, give us
one more bowl of soup.

272
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,430
- All right.
- Eat first.

273
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,559
Yes, eat up.

274
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:09,470
Yes?

275
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Sir.

276
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,569
Until when do I need to do this?

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,140
This is so humiliating.

278
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,240
If you don't do that, I can't assess
your performance at all.

279
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,150
If you want to gain points,
keep it up until this month.

280
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Right.

281
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,089
I heard you're going to confront
those from Exit Three Gang.

282
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
What time?

283
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,019
You're coming?

284
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,859
Of course, I'm part of the team.

285
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,259
Right, I forgot.

286
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,029
They're at that
Hyundai Employment Agency, right?

287
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,029
Should I go there right now?

288
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,470
Hey, plans might change later,

289
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,700
so wait for my call.

290
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,940
I'll prove it to you this time...

291
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,710
how competent I am.
I'll prove my dignity.

292
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,339
When I...

293
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,509
I...

294
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Hello?

295
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,920
He always hangs up on me.

296
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,589
(Director of Seoul Central District
Prosecutor's Office)

297
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,730
It's an honor.

298
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,329
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

299
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's drink.

300
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,130
Cheers.

301
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,569
- Thank you!
- Cheers!

302
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,569
It's been a while.

303
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,609
Look at her.

304
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:25,940
What has she been doing all along?

305
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,380
She was learning under me.

306
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,880
It's truly an honor
to meet you, sir.

307
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,549
If you help me out,
I'll give it my all.

308
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,450
She's truly amazing.

309
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,690
She is.

310
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,319
Which class are you in?

311
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,559
I'm in the 40th class, sir.

312
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,730
She's your senior then.

313
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,130
Well, yes.

314
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,930
But I started three years earlier.

315
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,069
Oh, I see.

316
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,769
I'm sorry I didn't know, sir.

317
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:51,839
It's all right.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,640
About Chairman Kim Joong Chul's son,

319
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,440
can you handle it?

320
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,410
I don't know about anything else,

321
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,779
but I am extremely resilient, sir.

322
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,180
You can trust me.

323
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,480
Resilience alone won't do.

324
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,750
You need to be strategic.

325
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,849
You're right. I'll plan out
a great strategy.

326
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:11,420
She's amazing, isn't she?

327
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,859
You will feel secure
with her by your side.

328
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,160
Let me pour you a drink, sir.

329
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,700
- Join me from today on.
- Goodness.

330
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,099
I might not be able
to protect you from typhoons,

331
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,500
but I sure can
protect you from the wind.

332
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,900
Thank you, sir!
I'll devote my life to you!

333
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,970
Great.

334
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:31,170
Let's clink in hopes that
he will become the chief.

335
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,609
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

336
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,009
Let's go!

337
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,059
Stop right there, will you?

338
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,490
What?

339
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,359
Why were you acting
so conceited back there?

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,470
How dare you talk to me like that?

341
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,869
Since you won the director's favor,
are you looking down on me?

342
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:00,839
You're right. I've been looking
down on you for the past 10 minutes.

343
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,039
I can't look up at all.

344
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,980
- Hey.
- How dare you blabber back there?

345
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,849
Do you think a training institute
is a joke?

346
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,880
What do you say?

347
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,650
Shall I round up your class?
Just for you?

348
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,559
Aren't you also here
to gain their favor?

349
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,220
Then what should we do?

350
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,660
We should act modest
and do our jobs well.

351
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,900
Let's do our best.

352
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't ruin the atmosphere.

353
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,400
Gosh.

354
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,069
If you're scared, just show it.

355
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,339
Don't laugh.

356
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,839
Let's do our best, okay?

357
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,779
Also,

358
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,549
stop eating the appetizers.

359
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,119
You're gobbling them all up.

360
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm also hungry.

361
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,059
You know very well...

362
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,569
how much Father Kim contributed
to this neighborhood.

363
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,200
Who guided
all the juvenile delinquents?

364
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,339
You little...

365
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:11,839
Don't fight and get along.

366
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,940
Don't make me repeat myself.

367
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,309
All he did was beat them up.

368
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:19,220
We also use physical punishment
at the temple.

369
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,579
If they need to be awakened,

370
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,220
it's only natural
to use physical punishment.

371
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,589
That isn't all.

372
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,759
Who took care of the orphans
the most passionately?

373
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,660
The kids love him.

374
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,700
They sure do.

375
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,869
Still,

376
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,400
I can't let this one slide.

377
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:40,799
They need to settle it.

378
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,470
Is there no way?

379
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:44,940
I can't find
any other solutions, either.

380
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,480
All right, then.

381
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,650
Let's pray that he will be able
to find a solution.

382
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,480
Dear Lord.

383
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,420
Please cast away all the devils
that are in his head.

384
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,390
- Father, the Son,
- We pray desperately.

385
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,390
- and the Holy Spirit...
- Sit down.

386
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,190
Please stop.

387
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,859
Please lead him.

388
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,630
Please stop!

389
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,059
- Stop!
- Dear Lord.

390
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,069
- Through the Holy Spirit...
- I said, stop.

391
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,299
Darn it.

392
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,539
There is one way, but...

393
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,609
But I'm not so sure.

394
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:42,799
Why can't you sing past that?

395
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,369
I'm running out of breath.

396
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:47,200
Have you not stopped smoking?

397
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,339
I'm reducing.

398
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,210
You should quit. Your body will rot.

399
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:06,289
What a lovely surprise.

400
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,630
It's Father Matteo.

401
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:10,289
Have you been well?

402
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,960
Of course.

403
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,130
Is Father Kim Hae Il
doing well as well?

404
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,829
Well, yes.

405
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,369
I'm actually calling
because of him.

406
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,660
Is he still suffering?

407
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,160
Father Kim.

408
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,730
Please come on out.

409
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,170
I must've gained weight.
It used to fit me.

410
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,470
Hey, why's everyone onto this?

411
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,970
I think the chief wants to
get credit for this.

412
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,539
He needs to catch a gang or two...

413
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,380
and show a few photos
of their hideout.

414
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:35,579
- Of course.
- Attention, everyone.

415
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,779
Hurry up and hit these guys.

416
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:40,380
Catch them,

417
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,549
and take photos of their hideout.

418
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,789
It's a highly confidential case,

419
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,589
- so keep it under wraps.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:24:47,589 --> 00:24:49,289
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

421
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,200
Hey, hurry up.

422
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,460
- Did you get the location?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,799
Did you call the guys
from Exit Three Gang ahead?

424
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,799
- I sent them texts already.
- Okay.

425
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,470
- Let's go.
- Wait a minute.

426
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,569
I have to tell Dae Young
what's going on.

427
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,569
I'm sure Mr. Lee already did.

428
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,380
Let's go now.

433
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,799
What's taking them so long?

434
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,970
What's that?

435
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:33,799
Did they go up through that?

436
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,740
(Karaoke)

437
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,809
Darn it.

438
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,559
Welcome.

439
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,960
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

440
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,559
It's good to see you.

441
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,559
You all know the procedure, right?

442
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, we do.

443
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Put handcuffs on,

444
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,430
and say only what you were
told to say, okay?

445
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,799
- Yes, sir.
- This is the evidence?

446
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,440
- You can take photos.
- You're so well-prepared.

447
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,299
We're going to take pictures
of the evidence.

448
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,970
You're under arrest...

449
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,039
for operating illegal
gambling house. Got it?

450
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,039
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

451
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,039

Stand straight!

454
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,279
That jerk.

455
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,119
Receive your punishment.

456
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,230
Who are you?

457
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,130
What are you doing?

458
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:45,140
It's so hard to find
a bathroom in this building.

459
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,480
There's tissue
I've been looking for.

460
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,509
I need a lot of this.

461
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,279
Excuse me.

462
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,190
I'm about to wet my pants.

463
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,390
I'm dying here.

464
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,059
Turn your head.

465
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,759
I really have to go.

466
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,400
Swing! Strike out!

467
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,400
It's the bottom of the ninth inning.

468
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,069
The current score is 9 to 0.

469
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,240
It's 9 to 0? How terrible.

470
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,910
Oh, right.
Did I text Dae Young or not?

471
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,210

if I'm embarrassed.

Detective Koo,
what are you doing here?

481
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,930

I'm so glad you came fast.

483
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,259
Hold on.

484
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,670
No.

485
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,509
No picture taking. Hey!

486
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,349
The condition of releasing me
was for me to leave here?

487
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,250
You need to hurry.
We don't have much time.

488
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,190
Father Kang, please explain
in detail. What's going on?

489
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,420
If you don't leave before dawn,

490
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,019
they'll issue an arrest warrant.

491
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,460
Mr. Oh is determined to arrest you.

492
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,970
You should stay with
Father Lee Young Jun for a while.

493
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,279
Have you already contacted...

494
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,839
Why on earth did you do that?

495
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,450
Of course he should know.

496
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,079
He's like a father to you.

497
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,079
Why must I leave this place?

498
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,250
All those who have committed crimes
are still roaming around.

499
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,990
You need a treatment, Father Kim.

500
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,059
I don't need that.

501
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,299
What do you mean?

502
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,369
You can't control yourself at all.

503
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,269
How can you put up with trash
like Mr. Oh?

504
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,369
If you can't, then you should
stop being a priest then.

505
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:30,670
Then you can do whatever you want.

506
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,980
I've overlooked everything...

507
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,519
even though you broke several rules.

508
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:43,289
There was a reason I did that,

509
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,920
and I believed that you could
control yourself.

510
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:48,960
But I don't trust you anymore.

511
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,460
You're just full of anger.

512
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,869
I'll tell the other priests
and the kids in the orphanage...

513
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,079
that you've left.
