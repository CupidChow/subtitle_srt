1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,949
Wait!

2
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:22,929
Did you do this...

3
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,730
to my sister?

4
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,689
Seung Ah.

5
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,130
Wake up, Seung Ah.

6
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,040
Hey, you.

7
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,040
How dare you do this to someone?

8
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,560
(Episode 33)

9
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,229
Ms. Park, are you okay?

10
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,500
Yes, I'm okay.

11
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,639
I'm okay too.

12
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,699
My sister...

13
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,110
Detective Seo. Detective Seo!

14
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,810
(Emergency Medical Center)

15
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,060
What do you want?

16
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,229
Joong Kwon, you son of a gun!

17
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,030
I clearly told you beforehand
that I won't stay still.

18
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,400
So why are you cursing at me?

19
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,639
Didn't I tell you not to mess
with the others?

20
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,669
How could you...

21
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,340
What? How could I what?
I didn't kill all of them.

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,110
I told my guys to make sure
they don't die,

23
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,979
so they beat them up
just until the brink of death.

24
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,520
That's all they did.

25
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,659
And one of the guys here...
Hey, you're Catholic, right?

26
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,729
He's also Catholic,
so he just went to see the nun...

27
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:18,000
and had some apples there.
Right? Exactly.

28
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,769
I'm going to...

29
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,540
find you no matter what.

30
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,139
Do whatever you want.

31
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,379
I ordered some whelks,
so I'll talk to you later.

32
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm going to hang up now, you punk.

33
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,259
I'm back...

34
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,029
I...

35
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,079
Sister Kim.

36
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,920
Fortunately, she doesn't have
any critical injuries.

37
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:17,959
She just has a severe concussion.

38
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,959
What about your other team members?

39
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,860
They didn't get severely injured,
so they moved to the general ward.

40
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,470
Father Kim, can we talk
for a moment?

41
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,709
Who in the world did this?

42
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,009
You know who they are, right?

43
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,850
They're mercenaries
hired by Joong Kwon.

44
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,220
"Mercenaries"?

45
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,019
They're from the special forces
just like me.

46
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,490
And they work
as foreign mercenaries.

47
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,319
They're professional assassins.

48
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,730
He's right.

49
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:58,199
That jerk didn't use martial arts.
He was literally trying to kill me.

50
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,160
They're really strong.

51
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,230
Who's Lee Joong Kwon?

52
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,000
He used to be my superior
in the Counter Terrorism Unit.

53
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,970
Then is he the guy who ordered you
to throw the grenade at the kids?

54
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,550
That jerk...

55
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,420
I guess he's still just as nasty
as he used to be.

56
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:23,589
Where are all these jerks?

57
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:26,290
I'm going to arrest all of them!
Those darn punks.

58
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,060
To be honest, I don't really know
where they are.

59
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,029
Gosh, Detective Seo...

60
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,269
They completely ruined
her pretty face.

61
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,310
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

62
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,910
They did this
because you guys work with me.

63
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,540
How is this your fault?

64
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,550
They're just nasty jerks originally.

65
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,750
I'm going to go back to the church.

66
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,819
You're not going somewhere
all by yourself, are you?

67
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,259
No.

68
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,240
I told you that I'll come for you.

69
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,929
Get up.

70
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,129
Gosh, you really haven't
changed at all, Hae Il.

71
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,070
You're just as same
as you used to be.

72
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:57,039
Hae Il, can't you just kill me
in one go?

73
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,750
Wait.

74
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,720
There's one thing
you must keep in mind.

75
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,379
If you kill me,

76
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,350
you'll end up losing
an important witness.

77
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,289
A witness of what?

78
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,090
A witness of Father Lee's murder.

79
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,429
Aren't you going to kill me?
Go ahead.

80
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,769
Kill me.

81
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,070
Explain what you mean.

82
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:27,470
Kill me, you jerk. Kill me!

83
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,539
Kill me!

84
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,539
Hurry up and tell me!

85
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:33,779
Tell me.

86
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,009
I'd love to tell you
everything in detail,

87
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,980
but it's not the time yet.

88
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,090
What?

89
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,330
Are you looking into my eyes
to check if it's true or not?

90
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,429
It's true.

91
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,299
When is the right time to tell me?

92
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,340
In about 10 days after I take care
of something really important.

93
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,379
I'll give you a week.

94
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,279
If you don't tell me within a week
or it turns out to be a lie,

95
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,820
I'll make you regret
not having told me today.

96
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,120
Okay, do whatever you want.

97
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,759
Hey, Hae Il.

98
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,259
Why are things so complicated
between us?

99
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,950
I called and told him
that you're okay,

100
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,279
so don't worry too much.

101
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,259
Father Kim.

102
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,669
What in the world did you do?

103
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,549
I didn't do anything.

104
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,620
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

105
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,419
Don't say that.

106
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,259
No one is blaming you for this.

107
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,659
You must not back down...

108
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:28,889
at times like this. You must fight.

109
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,529
You must not give in.

110
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,620
Why did you bother coming here?

111
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:00,190
Do you eat well?

112
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,330
So-so.

113
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,200
You're the only one who visits.

114
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,899
If you'd trusted
and stayed with me...

115
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,100
Oh, well.

116
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,970
I heard the Wintis lawyers
quit again?

117
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,570
They got the picture.

118
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,809
I'm the tail they're cutting loose.

119
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,379
Superintendent Nam and I
have to take the fall.

120
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,419
Who would want to represent me?

121
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,419
Dong Ja.

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,450
I don't know about anything else,
but Chief Prosecutor Kang...

123
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,929
I'd like that.

124
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,899
No matter how
you scold, curse, and mock me,

125
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,470
you're still my sister.

126
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,899
I was a lowly Yeosu thug...

127
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,639
and you got me where I am now.

128
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,509
So...

129
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,909
I'll look after you.

130
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,350
I'm so touched.

131
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,340
Seung Ah. Seung Ah.

132
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,110
Wake up. Seung Ah.

133
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:28,509
Those scumbags need to pay.

134
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,350
How dare they go after Seung Ah?

135
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,460
Are you Hwang Cheol Bum the dog?

136
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:46,659
What?

137
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,379
Stay out of it.

138
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,289
You're a sly one,
making the first move.

139
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,320
Who are you?

140
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,159
Come here. Come to me.

141
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,929
I give you an A plus...

142
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,899
no, just an A.

143
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,330
I'll see you around.

144
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,710
What's this?

145
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,080
You contributed greatly
with your wealth of information,

146
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,789
so I got you a present.

147
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,259
Golden arm warmers!

148
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,759
Thank you.

149
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,429
These aren't ready-made.

150
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:57,269
I went to a market,
bought the fabric,

151
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,669
and had the arm warmers sewn
stitch by stitch...

152
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:03,309
at my neighborhood sewing shop.

153
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,909
It's very rare. Rare and handmade.

154
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,379
Thank you so much.

155
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,149
- Golden arm warmers!
- Golden arm warmers!

156
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,279
That's really funny...

157
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,490
but cool too.

158
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,120
For you, I got some red ginseng.

159
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,289
This is mine?

160
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,230
Thank you so much, Ms. Park.

161
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,899
I'll have one now.

162
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,399
- Ms. Park, have one.
- Can I? Thank you.

163
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,240
Did the presents cheer you up?

164
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,450
We're flying high,
so let's go after someone else.

165
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,350
Just name the target.

166
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,590
I'll dust them down and clean up
like a street cleaner.

167
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,720
Who is it?

168
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,090
This time, it's not
someone that great.

169
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,460
Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae.

170
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:58,659
Kang Seok...

171
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,970
Your superior?
That chief prosecutor?

172
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,309
They beat up
the Violent Crimes Team?

173
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,909
Yes. It looks like
they are very skilled fighters.

174
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,840
The fool who attacked you...

175
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,750
should be one of them.

176
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,179
Lee Joong Kwon
brought in some assassins.

177
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,350
To get rid of me and
Father Kim at the same time?

178
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,360
Poor Father Kim.

179
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:31,129
You don't have to apologize.

180
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,000
It worked out.

181
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,730
We have a reason to fight back.
That jerks.

182
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,669
The jerks who hurt our rookie.

183
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:41,509
The trash still left over.
We'll get them all.

184
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,039
I'll help break into
Mr. Hwang's safe too.

185
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,580
How did you know? That's a secret.

186
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,690
We share details on future missions.

187
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,389
I'm not a gossip.

188
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,659
We're not stealing. We'll return
the money to where it belongs.

189
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,230
We should do this.

190
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,930
Then shall we start tomorrow?

191
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,869
I will discharge myself tomorrow.

192
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,539
This isn't just money.

193
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,549
It's a tower of greed
they built over seven years...

194
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,549
while giving up their humanity.

195
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,880
I will topple the tower
in front of their eyes.

196
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,789
And those who look upon it
as if it's a deity...

197
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,789
will also go down.

198
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,269
Ms. Park. Do you remember
anything about the safe?

199
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,000
It has fingerprint verification.

200
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,369
The brand was "Munchenbraum"?

201
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,640
I think it was a German product.

202
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,900
Why are they coming back out?

203
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,869
What happened?

204
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,309
We can't go any further.

205
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:26,680
The tunnel will collapse
before we reach the safe.

206
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,950
You said Russian
coal mine technicians dug it.

207
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,279
They quit halfway
because the earth is too soft.

208
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,250
We can't do this.

209
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,019
I put a fortune into this.

210
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,890
Let's finish this.
We're almost there.

211
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm out!

212
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,230
You and your enlightened self
can go ahead.

213
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,400
Hey, Godzhayev. Come back!

214
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,200
Where do you think you're going?

215
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,670
Godzhayev.

216
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,000
You can't go. Go back inside.

217
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,910
Leave then.

218
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,140
Darn it. Those fools.

219
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,680
My goodness.

220
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:09,150
The vault is dust-proof,
explosion-proof, and waterproof.

221
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,920
The floor and walls are
doubled-up plates of 100-ton steel.

222
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
The conclusion is,

223
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,460
we can't break in.

224
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,890
Let's give up then.

225
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,359
Come on.
Don't ruin the mood just yet.

226
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,329
The unusual thing is,
once the door closes,

227
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,140
the amount of oxygen
inside decreases.

228
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,940
After 15 minutes,
you'll likely die of hypoxia.

229
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,539
Because of stealing the safe?

230
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:33,440
Apparently. A thief once broke in
and got back out after a few days.

231
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,480
They created that system afterward.

232
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,650
The building has only one
basement entrance in the center.

233
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,980
It's hard to sneak in.

234
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,720
How are we to get in
and break into the vault?

235
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,519
It's a problem.

236
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:00,769
Let's do this.

237
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,910
Do what?
Exchange everything into coins?

238
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,940
I wish I could beat you up.

239
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,440
Listen carefully.

240
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,279
Money that's hidden like this
is hard to get to, right?

241
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:15,750
But the money that's on the move
is easy to get.

242
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,819
We'll make them move the cash?

243
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,230
You're smart.

244
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,400
How can we do that?

245
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,299
That's not hard.

246
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,529
I'll do this.

247
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,200
According to the police,

248
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,339
Gudam-gu's Congressman Park Won Mu
who was killed yesterday...

249
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:12,539
was under investigation as the last
joint-owner of Rising Moon.

250
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,779
Police believe someone...

251
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,450
had killed him to hide that fact.

252
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,519
They handled him well this time.

253
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,490
I thought they could never
be able to do it.

254
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,720
What's that look about?

255
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,589
Well...

256
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,430
It's nothing.

257
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,869
What? What is it?
Just tell me.

258
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,730
Congressman Park passed away.

259
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,000
Superintendent Nam
and Ms. Jeong...

260
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:41,640
won't be able to
get out of prison.

261
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,309
The only person we have left...

262
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,539
is you.

263
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,210
- What are you trying to say?
- By any chance...

264
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,980
"If it wasn't for that jerk,
Chief Prosecutor Kang,"

265
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,480
"the safe would've been mine."

266
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,450
If there was anyone
thinking like that...

267
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't swear like that.

268
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,289
I'm sorry, sir.

269
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,589
Anyway, if it wasn't for you,

270
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:04,130
anyone can take
the money in the safe.

271
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,130
Especially, the owner of the safe.

272
00:22:06,529 --> 00:22:08,069
Are you talking about Cheol Bum?

273
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:11,200
What were you planning to do
with the shares...

274
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,569
for Superintendent Nam
and Ms. Jeong?

275
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,170
It's obviously mine.

276
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,109
I'm sure that Cheol Bum
knew that already.

277
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:23,579
"Chief Prosecutor Kang, that jerk.
That jerk will take everything."

278
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,079
You jerk...

279
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,950
I'm sorry, sir.
I just wanted to lend realism.

280
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,890
Well, he does have a sharp sense.

281
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,960
I don't think you should
keep the money in there.

282
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,759
It's like...

283
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,670
entrusting a cat to take care
of a warehouse full of fish.

284
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,240
My goodness. Thank you for visiting
my humble office.

285
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,309
Hey, I know it's humble,

286
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,150
but I thought you would have
tiger skin...

287
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,619
and frames with phrases like
"One mind" at least.

288
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,190
But this is neat.

289
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,059
Only older seniors used to do
things like that.

290
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,589
I'll get straight to the point.

291
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,089
I thought about your offer.

292
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,000
Is it really 50 percent?

293
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,170
Would I tell you
anything unreliable?

294
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,039
So?

295
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
When will you ditch
Chief Prosecutor Kang...

296
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
and Lee Joong Kwon?

297
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,309
I'm looking for the right timing.

298
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,210
Don't let go of that timing.

299
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,480
Chief Prosecutor Kang is the best
when it comes to betraying first.

300
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,490
If he strikes you first,

301
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:38,519
that means he's very anticipated
about something.

302
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,630
I'll keep that in mind.

303
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,000
And don't believe what
Chief Prosecutor Kang says.

304
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,160
"I'm hungry." "I'm sleepy."

305
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,230
Everything he says besides that
is a lie. Do you understand?

306
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes, I understand.

307
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:55,640
I can't believe that
I'm joining hands with a gangster.

308
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,220
Anyway, Chief Prosecutor Kang should
fall into Ms. Park's trap.

309
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:08,819
Our Old Man, Ms. Park,
speaks so well.

310
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,250
Since when was she "Our Old Man"?

311
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,259
Cheol Bum will count the day
Chief Prosecutor Kang...

312
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,589
took the money as D-day...

313
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,299
because he would've already sensed
that Chief Prosecutor Kang...

314
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,599
is trying to take the money alone.

315
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:21,970
Gosh, if that's true,

316
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:25,200
Mr. Hwang will gather
all of his men.

317
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,369
That's the problem.

318
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,910
No matter how strong
Lee Joong Kwon's mercenary is,

319
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,039
- he can't win multiple opponents.
- He can't win multiple opponents.

320
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,609
Daebum Trading has so many people.

321
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,549
We should take them down
so that Chief Prosecutor Kang...

322
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,150
can easily take the money.

323
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:41,079
How should we take down
Cheol Bum's men?

324
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,390
Gosh, my stomach hurts.
Let me go to the bathroom first.

325
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,230
Where do you think you're going?

326
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,630
Why are you going to poop
while eating something this good?

327
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,130
It's because of the drinks
I had yesterday.

328
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,130
My intestines haven't completely
gotten rid of the alcohol yet.

329
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,170
I told you that poop will ruin you.
Go after finishing that.

330
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,500
I'll finish it when I get back.

331
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Right.

332
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,410
We can take them down like that.

333
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,950
You're not making any sense.

334
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,420
It does make sense.

335
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,759
You don't have to always go
head-on when you fight.

336
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,319
There are various tactics.

337
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,190
There may be "various tactics",

338
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,890
but I don't think this is one.
It's just crazy.

339
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,829
We're already there. Come on.

340
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,000
- Are you sure this place is okay?
- Yes, it's really okay.

341
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,940
(Jul Jul Oriental Medicine Clinic)

342
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,880
We just wasted our time.

343
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
If it's not in Korea
and banned on imports,

344
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,119
where are we supposed to get this?

345
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,589
We can just think
that we learned something.

346
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,759
Let's go.

347
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,359
Come over here.

348
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,130
You wasted my time.

349
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,700
You're taking the money?

350
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,130
Yes. We don't need to
follow the rules now, right?

351
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,299
All of us had to agree
in the past, but...

352
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,140
Do as you wish.

353
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,309
But how much are you taking?

354
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,480
Mine and Superintendent Nam's.

355
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,049
It's exactly half of the total.

356
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,180
You can do whatever you want
with Ms. Jeong's share.

357
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,089
I'll be visiting tomorrow, and
I'll tell you the exact time later.

358
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,490
Okay. I'll get it prepared.

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,460
If he strikes you first,

360
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,470
that means he's very anticipated
about something.

361
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,839
And don't believe what
Chief Prosecutor Kang says.

362
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,039
"I'm hungry." "I'm sleepy."

363
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:45,109
Everything he says besides that
is a lie. Do you understand?

364
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,049
Tomorrow is the day.

365
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:51,920
Gather everyone, and get them armed.

366
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,349
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,390
Don't let them take even a penny.

368
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,089
And make sure they can't
walk out on their own.

369
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,539
(NIS Counter Terrorism Unit Chief,
Oh Jung Gook)

370
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,440
You look better than I thought.

371
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,710
You look great with the cope.

372
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,549
You seem like you can't live quietly
wherever you go.

373
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,549
I'm sorry. I tried to live quietly.

374
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,650
Why did you suddenly wanted
to see me?

375
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,019
You don't need anyone like me.

376
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,259
I'm about to wage war with those
I've been chasing until now.

377
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:43,700
But I need something.

378
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,539
Is it big?

379
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,609
No.

380
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,710
Okay.

381
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,509
It's just this once.

382
00:27:58,619 --> 00:27:59,619
In return,

383
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,819
make sure you get
Lee Joong Kwon too.

384
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,059
The company wanted to get him
for leaking information,

385
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,660
but there's no evidence
since he's a sly one.

386
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,359
And he even quitted his job.

387
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,099
That's why you should get him.

388
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:17,730
And make sure he pays for his past.

389
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,269
Yes, sir.

390
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:24,109
Hae Il.

391
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,880
I don't expect you to accept this,

392
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,319
but don't you want to come back?

393
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,890
Based on what I heard,
you didn't change much.

394
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,430
Let's talk about that later.

395
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,259
Fine.

396
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,269
So what do you need?

397
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,730
Flying elbows!

398
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,700
Powerful kicks!

399
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,039
You'll feel my wrath.

400
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,880
Next time,

401
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,710
I'll make sure I avenge you,

402
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,380
my sister, Seo Seung Ah.

403
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,980
(Next time, I'll make sure I avenge
you, my sister, Seo Seung Ah.)
