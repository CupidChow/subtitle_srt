1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,109
Why did he get caught?

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:09,480
I know.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,349
Kneel and put your hands
behind your head.

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,329
Sure, I'll do that.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,160
(Episode 23)

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,600
Why are you just standing still
and not catching the suspect?

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:28,269
Right.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,670
We have to close this path
as he might run away.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,770
That's right.
The suspect might turn around.

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,109
Turn around, my foot.
The tables have turned.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,109
- Arrest him.
- Yes, sir.

12
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:42,450
Ms. Park, you can't go there.
Ms. Park...

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,880
What's this?

14
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,079
What's going on? What is it?

15
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,890
I was with Congressman Park,

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,960
and some thug threw me
down on the ground.

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,729
The thug you're talking about
is that guy.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,789
Really? Oh, my.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,530
Grab me.

20
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,869
Grab me. I said, grab me!

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,709
You scumbag. Where are
all your buddies? Where did they go?

22
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,840
I said, grab me! Hurry!

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,079
- Grab me!
- What are you doing? Arrest him.

24
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,409
- Yes, sir.
- Ms. Park. Come this way.

25
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,079
This scumbag's eyes are bright.

26
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,180
We have to check his face.
You scumbag...

27
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,019
Go easy on me!

28
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,290
Let go of her!

29
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Otherwise, I'll shoot!

30
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,329
Put your guns down! Put them down!

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,629
- Put them down!
- Okay.

32
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:32,829
Put them down now!

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,329
You scumbag, I'm going to kill you.

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,700
My gosh.

35
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,439
What's this sharp feeling?

36
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,969
Is that a knife behind my back?

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,140
- That jerk!
- Oh, gosh!

38
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,409
Throw... Throw the guns to the back.

39
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,950
Hurry up and throw them to the back.

40
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,510
- What... What should we do?
- Hurry up!

41
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,920
- Okay, let's put them away.
- Step back.

42
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,650
Don't make any rash movements.

43
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,989
- I might die if you make a mistake.
- Catch him. Catch him.

44
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,290
My gosh, I think...
I think I really might die today.

45
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,420
What am I going to do?

46
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,030
- Catch him.
- What? You want me to catch him?

47
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,000
My goodness.
Why did you say that so loudly?

48
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,159
My gosh.

49
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,610
I think it's best
that you surrender.

50
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,840
Do you know who I am?
I'm Park Kyeong Seon from...

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,879
My goodness!

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,879
- Shoot him!
- My goodness.

53
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,349
- Catch him!
- Catch that punk!

54
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,090
- Hurry!
- Catch him!

55
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,219
Catch that punk! Catch him!

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,090
Catch him!

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,530
Hurry up and go after him!

58
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Ms. Park.

59
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
My goodness, it hurts so much.

60
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,300
- Let's go!
- We need to catch him!

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,430
- Hurry!
- Come on!

62
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,069
Give me your hand.

63
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,409
- Catch him!
- Hurry up.

64
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,009
Let's go.

65
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,939
Gosh, she caught me.

66
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,439
How did she know?

67
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,080
Gosh, how did she find out?

68
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,330
My gosh, seriously.

69
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,060
I guess she recognized
my attractive eyes.

70
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,300
My goodness.

71
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,860
She's as smart as I am.

72
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,870
I must be crazy.
Now is not the time for this.

73
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,750
Who was it?

74
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,580
Who in the world was it?

75
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,150
We're trying our best to find out.

76
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,349
You should've still
gotten the job done...

77
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,319
regardless of
the unexpected situation.

78
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:14,389
I'm sorry, sir.

79
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,899
Do you think we have an enemy
that we don't know about?

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,269
I'll look into it and deal with it.

81
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,370
You...

82
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,899
You... Do your job properly
and get rid of Congressman Park.

83
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,709
We can't do anything right now
because he's in the ICU.

84
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,810
We'll take care of him
once he moves to the general ward.

85
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,709
You punk, you're always like this.

86
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,449
If Congressman Park wakes up,

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,180
everything will be over.

88
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,620
Do you understand?

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,069
How could you lose him
when he was right there?

90
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:57,470
I mean, you showed up
out of nowhere.

91
00:04:58,139 --> 00:04:59,240
So you're blaming it on me?

92
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,610
Am I the reason why
you failed to catch the criminal?

93
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:03,310
No, that's not what I meant.

94
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,379
I guess I made a huge mistake.

95
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,009
I'm such a slow-witted
and unfortunate prosecutor.

96
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,379
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

97
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,379
I made such a huge mistake.

98
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:15,550
Go ahead and write your report.

99
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,120
Write that you couldn't catch him
because of me.

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,459
I'll wait here until you're done.
Tell me when you're finished.

101
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:22,889
I won't write it like that.

102
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,259
Don't say that.
Go ahead and write it.

103
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,529
It wasn't your fault.

104
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,470
Detective Seo, can you order
a bowl of Mapo Tofu for me?

105
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,740
Yes, you should order that for her.

106
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,069
There's no Mapo Tofu
in this neighborhood.

107
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,579
Go ahead and write the report.

108
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,610
(Seoul Gudam Police Station)

109
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:41,810
Doesn't it seem like
Ms. Park knows something?

110
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:43,449
Yes, I felt the same thing.

111
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,120
But why do you think
she let him run away if she knew?

112
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,790
She's trying to play it smart.

113
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,889
She let go of the fish she caught...

114
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,290
so that she can catch
the entire school of fish.

115
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,160
She's a very evil and clever woman.

116
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,000
I knew she was weird when she didn't
order anything for me at her office.

117
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,629
She ordered Mapo Tofu
and ate it all by herself.

118
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
- Really?
- Yes.

119
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,000
Thanks to you, Father Kim,

120
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,709
Congressman Park was able
to stay alive.

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,810
We can't exactly say he's alive.

122
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,350
He has to live in a vegetative state
his entire life.

123
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,220
But don't you think there's a slight
possibility that he might wake up?

124
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,449
They're so brutal.

125
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,850
They were going to kill him and make
it seem like he committed suicide.

126
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,060
This cannot be accepted!

127
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,089
The Lord's teachings
aren't enough to make...

128
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,129
those devils
repent of their sins.

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,759
Yes... Yes, you're right.

130
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,230
I... I agree with him.

131
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,899
The Lord didn't guide people
with just his words.

132
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,540
People who never repented
of their sins...

133
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,800
eventually got hit by lightning.

134
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,939
Yes. He also got rid of Sodom
and Gomorrah with burning sulfur.

135
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,709
And the stubborn Pharaoh ended up
losing his eldest son.

136
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,009
You know what he did when
the world was full of sins, right?

137
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:52,180
He got rid of everything
in this world with a huge flood.

138
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,949
Yes, that's right.
I personally think God's justice...

139
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,490
must be rendered in Gudam-gu
by taking action,

140
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,920
not just by spreading God's words.

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
- What do you think, Father?
- You're right.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,389
Right?

143
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,699
At this point,

144
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,970
I think a rage virus has spread
throughout the neighborhood.

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Aren't you going to answer that?

146
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,290
(Prosecutor Park)

147
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:36,160
She might mention something
about yesterday,

148
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
so record our conversation
from outside.

149
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm sure she's up to something.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,629
Why else would she let you run away
when she knew it was you?

151
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,339
Anyway, don't get swayed by her.

152
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,470
Make sure you keep quiet.

153
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,370
Have you ever seen me get swayed?

154
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,540
Make sure you keep a straight face.

155
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,579
Okay, don't worry.

156
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,350
I kept a straight face
ever since I was five years old.

157
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,430
You were the guy at the villa
and the guy wearing...

158
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,100
the black mask yesterday,
weren't you?

159
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:12,660
What? Me?

160
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,670
What are you talking about?

161
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,540
Breaking and entering. Theft.
Attempting to murder a congressman.

162
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,199
Do you know how long
you'll end up in jail for all that?

163
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,910
You can't just pretend
like it wasn't you.

164
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Why are you yelling at me?

165
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:29,250
I really don't understand
a word you're saying.

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,180
Okay.

167
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,690
How about you explain to me
why you did all this?

168
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,549
If I can seem to understand,

169
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,230
I'll give you time so you can
deal with it or turn yourself in.

170
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm not doing this to get you
locked up in jail, Father Kim.

171
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm trying to give you
a chance here.

172
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,539
Come on.

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,139
Do you have evidence to prove
that it was me?

174
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,279
From now on,
whatever happens to you,

175
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,649
you'd better not ask me
for any help.

176
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,850
I'm going to pretend like
I don't know you.

177
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,350
If I were you,
I'd say something out of gratitude.

178
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,450
My gosh, seriously.

179
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,490
Listen to me, Prosecutor Park.

180
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,059
Why are you trying to make it sound
like I'm someone mysterious?

181
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,960
You're a civilian,

182
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,059
but I can't access
your background information.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,669
Isn't that mysterious enough?

184
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,639
When a civilian's information
is blocked,

185
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,340
that means he's either
a government agent or a spy.

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,840
But my hunch tells me
that you're not a spy.

187
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,440
So I'm 100 percent sure that
you're a government agent.

188
00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:35,009
Are you from the NIS?

189
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,120
Isn't it illegal to do
a background check on civilians?

190
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,820
And you're acting like
I'm Jason Bourne or something.

191
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
What's with the fuss?

192
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,919
You're more like Tsunami Bourne.

193
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,460
See? I told you, didn't I?

194
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,299
I said he looks like he used to be
a government agent.

195
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,759
Nice guess.

196
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,370
I thought he was
an undercover detective...

197
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,230
who came to dig into
Gudam-gu's irregularities.

198
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,370
I won the bet,
so give me 30 dollars.

199
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,179
This is 10 dollars short.

200
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,350
I deducted withholding tax.

201
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,620
Plus, we're not even sure
if it's true.

202
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,360
Let's bet again next time.

203
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,789
Listen to me.

204
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,559
I'm an ordinary priest
who led an ordinary life...

205
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,700
after having majored
in Korean literature.

206
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,769
You majored in Korean literature?

207
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,470
Then you must be
quite knowledgable...

208
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,210
with basic Korean literature
and classical literature.

209
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,840
Of course.
Why do you even bother checking?

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,710
Then let me give you a quiz.

211
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,149
You need to get
at least 7 out of 10 right. Okay?

212
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,720
My gosh, that's so unnecessary.

213
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,389
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, let's do this.

214
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,830
In Cho Ji Hoon's "Buddhist Dance",
he sends something.

215
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,360
What does he send?

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,629
An origami crane.

217
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:02,000
Seo Jeong Joo's "Portrait".

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,299
For 23 years,
he was raised by what?

219
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,840
The energy he got from food.

220
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,870
(Answer: The wind)

221
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,169
In, Lee Sang's "Crow's eye view",

222
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,279
how many kids run on the street?

223
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Five.

224
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,049
"We do a love song,
do a love song, darling."

225
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,220
What's the name of the song...

226
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,350
from the Korea dynasty
that has these lyrics?

227
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,789
"Ring Ding Dong".

228
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,759
In the very end of
"When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom",

229
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,259
what kind of relationship
can we assume...

230
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,429
that Heo Saeng Won has with Dong?

231
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,799
An inappropriate relationship.

232
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,600
Gosh, forget it.
You didn't get anything right.

233
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,029
I mean, it's been ages
since I graduated from college.

234
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,399
People forget stuff, you know.

235
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:38,639
I thought I got everything correct.

236
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,570
We have to deal
with the embarrassment.

237
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,940
Maybe he's trying to be funny.

238
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,210
If he was, that was successful.

239
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:52,649
You're so shameless.

240
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,389
The truth is revealed already.

241
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,320
What truth is revealed?

242
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,419
I'm just who I am.

243
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,730
You better confess soon.

244
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,029
That's the only way you'll survive.

245
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,529
Sure, look into it.

246
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,070
My hands and feet are shaking.
That was close.

247
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,139
Why...

248
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,450
How do you not know
what "Buddhist Dance" is?

249
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,690
"A sheer white silken hood,
folded fairly..."

250
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:33,789
Never mind.

251
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,129
13 children of "Crow's eye view",

252
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,029
even I know that.

253
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,000
Did you really work for the NIS?

254
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,240
- No wonder your eyes are...
- Stop it.

255
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,840
Let's go back.
I'm tired and stressed.

256
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,139
I'm so stressed.

257
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,039
He seems more like a loser today.

258
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,379
The NIS was hacked in 2017.

259
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,220
Some information that was leaked
are still accessible.

260
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,919
The hacker in Mullae-dong
had this file.

261
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,360
Interrupt us as much as you can.

262
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,159
We'll just have to meet at the end.

263
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,700
(Work experience)

264
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,759
But...

265
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,759
(National intelligence service)

266
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,570
holding it in for a while...

267
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,570
makes me feel angry.

268
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,870
(Personal details report)

269
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,210
Gosh.

270
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,850
He's so ungrateful.

271
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,120
How can a priest not know
about kindness?

272
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,019
Wait...

273
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,850
Do you even have proof that it's me?

274
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,799
Please calm down.

275
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,700
Gosh.

276
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,779
I'm so annoyed.

277
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,419
You told me this last time.

278
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,919
If I share a secret, I'll be able to
share everything else.

279
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,230
But does that work for secrets...

280
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,000
that were revealed
without my control?

281
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,440
I just...

282
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,240
wanted to know how much...

283
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,149
I'm allowed to share.

284
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,720
Things are messed up
because of him.

285
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,620
What on earth...

286
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,289
Did you get rid of Father Lee...

287
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,730
like how you're getting rid
of Congressman Park.

288
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,200
Pressured by the police
and choosing to suicide instead.

289
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:54,529
This frame.

290
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,929
It's the most natural frame.
What about it?

291
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,870
Do you have something against it?

292
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
No.

293
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:05,009
The inspection on me and the Chief
of Borough will be called off.

294
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,840
I've already taken care of it.

295
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,580
Next time,
investigate the superintendent.

296
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,450
Yes, sir.

297
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,559
Father Kim, it's here.

298
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,269
(Gene testing results)

299
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:35,870
(Genes from the two evidence are
detected. DNA testing is possible.)

300
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,980
(Both DNA match as Lee Young Jun
with 99.9 percent chance.)

301
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,480
"Both DNA match as Lee Young Jun
with 99.9 percent chance."

302
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,190
It is the blood of Father Lee.

303
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,200
Do you have any details about
the superintendent?

304
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,509
There are endless details.

305
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,570
But there's something
enormous as well.

306
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,250
- How enormous?
- It's this big.

307
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,679
At Gudam's junction, there is
a social club called "Rising Moon".

308
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,750
A social club is
for the rich people...

309
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,250
of that area.

310
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,919
Yes, but...

311
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,559
a huge amount of cash from there
is going under the superintendent.

312
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,159
There a large amount going to
the borough office too.

313
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,129
Is it the head of a family?
It's literally feeding everyone.

314
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,500
Who's the owner of that place?

315
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,070
A 30-year-old man
called Park Shin Woo.

316
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,710
He's the son of Congressman Park.

317
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,610
What a perfect set.

318
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,909
There are other
joint representatives too,

319
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,350
but they're under borrowed names.

320
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,320
Should I or should I not
look into this?

321
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,120
Let's look into this a little more.

322
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,429
Let's see who this is.

323
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,000
(Gene testing results)

324
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,400
"Both DNA match as Lee Young Jun...

325
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,200
with 99.9 percent chance."

326
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,339
Unbelievable.

327
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,910
The results did come out.

328
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,470
I was worried that it won't
like the movie "Memories of Murder".

329
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,109
We can take action now, right?

330
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,480
No, we can't.

331
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,079
Then they'll find out that
we went into the villa.

332
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,680
We might get backlashed instead.

333
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,319
The blood is Father Lee's.
What more is needed?

334
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,720
Detective Koo is right.

335
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,890
They can say that we fabricated it.

336
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,690
Of course.
They can do worse than that.

337
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,160
What do we do now then?

338
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,930
Firstly,

339
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,900
let them know that the villa
is the crime scene.

340
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,440
How?

341
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,579
What? A murder?

342
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,349
What did you say? A murder?

343
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,549
Yes.

344
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,019
My goodness.

345
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,890
Yes, I understand.

346
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
What's the problem?

347
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,589
It's the informant from yesterday
about the congressman's terror.

348
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,190
What?

349
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,829
You should've dragged time
so that we could locate him.

350
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,160
That's not what's important.

351
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:14,059
He said there was a murder
at Mr. Hwang's villa.

352
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,829
What?

353
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,170
- Who was murdered?
- I'm not sure about that,

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,039
but someone was
murdered in the room...

355
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,869
on the first floor of the house.

356
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,039
The informant heard it from someone
under Hwang Cheol Bum.

357
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,480
Why his villa all of a sudden?

358
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,210
Is it the information worth it?

359
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:32,380
We should send the forensics.
We can just leave if it's nothing.

360
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,019
It's Mr. Hwang's villa.
It's not as easy as it sounds.

361
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,319
Just ignore it for now.

362
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,390
We can't.

363
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,430
If we don't investigate it,
he will report it somewhere else.

364
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,160
My blood pressure.

365
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,170
Call the forensics right away.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,069
Yes, sir.

367
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,099
- Hurry.
- Call them.

368
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,650
Why are you being like this?
This is troublesome.

369
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,920
This is an execution of
official duties. Please excuse us.

370
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,690
Official duties, my foot.

371
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,019
(Search warrant extension)

372
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:18,000
Just don't dirty the house.
I'm germophobic.

373
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
Ryong, do you think we're here
for a getaway?

374
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,900
We're here for identification.

375
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,069
"Ryong"?

376
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,500
Don't address me like that
and just shut your mouth.

377
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,410
If you want to address me
in English,

378
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,109
call me "Mr. Ryong". Okay?

379
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,380
Try it. "Mr. Ryong".

380
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,950
Mister?

381
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,049
You're not a pizza store.

382
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,890
How are so lively all the time?

383
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,619
Did you stick a protection film
for your mind?

384
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,519
Yes, I did.

385
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,690
I stuck it on with superglue.

386
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:51,700
Are you going to take it off?

387
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:54,869
We need to hurry.

388
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,869
"Mr. Ryong", happy?

389
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,839
Dust off before you enter.
It's so dusty outside.

390
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,569
How many of you are coming in?

391
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,339
What's wrong?

392
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:49,789
What do you mean it changed?

393
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,859
The flooring and the wallpaper
are completely changed.

394
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,960
Nothing was detected
since they were new.

395
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,759
I think our plans have been exposed.

396
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,960
I see. Let's talk later.

397
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:11,940
Yes.

398
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,809
- Father Kim.
- What?

399
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,710
A devotee wants to make
a confession to you.

400
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,319
Tell them to come back on Sunday.

401
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,750
That's what I told him,

402
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,619
but he said he can't if not today.

403
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,859
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

404
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,099
and of the Holy Spirit.

405
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,670
Amen.

406
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,299
Amen.

407
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,839
Should I say Amen?

408
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:42,769
Yes.

409
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Go ahead and confess your sins.

410
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,880
I should tell you about
the sins I've committed, right?

411
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,880
Yes, go ahead.

412
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:57,190
I used to do an important work
for my country.

413
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,619
So I worked...

414
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,890
in a faraway country.

415
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,799
And I committed a big sin there.

416
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,130
What was that sin?

417
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,170
How shall I put it?

418
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,970
Do you know what a grenade is?

419
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,740
I threw that,

420
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,210
and I killed...

421
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,859
11 kids.

422
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:43,670
Can someone who killed 11 kids...

423
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,000
become a priest too?

424
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,720
Hae Il. Salute.

425
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,619
You...

426
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,259
How have you been?
You should say hello.

427
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:37,119
I wondered what you were up to...

428
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,289
after you quit the job.

429
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,160
I wondered if you
were making enough money,

430
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,099
but you somehow became a priest.

431
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,559
Amazing.

432
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,970
You know those things
can happen while working.

433
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:53,140
Don't get hurt by them.

434
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,869
- Just leave.
- To where?

435
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:00,640
Shouldn't you at least ask
why I came here?

436
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,910
Don't you think so? Why are you
up to trivial stuff these days?

437
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:08,190
All you do is interfere with
the leaders of this town...

438
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,089
and investigate
on the death of a priest.

439
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,190
What is that?

440
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,259
What is it that you want to say?

441
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,289
I just want you to do nothing
and live quietly.

442
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,759
Then I'll not come and see you.
I'll just leave you alone.

443
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,269
What if I can't do that?

444
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,170
I just want to deal with everything
without going through a war.

445
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,240
Listen. If you and I
have a go at each other,

446
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,049
then innocent people, like
the 11 kids you killed, might die.

447
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,250
What will you do then?

448
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
You jerk.

449
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:43,390
Hey, you're the one
who threw the grenade.

450
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,789
Why are you blaming me?

451
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
Hae Il.

452
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,130
Just bury the dead priest
in your heart.

453
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,730
No matter how hard you try,

454
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,940
nothing will change.

455
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,440
I'll give you a few days
to consider.

456
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,609
Think wisely, Father Kim.

457
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,599
(Father Lee Young Jun's
suicide case)

458
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,210
I can't understand it at all.

459
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:16,309
How did they find out
and clean that room?

460
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,519
Can it be a coincidence?

461
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,789
Of course not.
They only cleaned that room.

462
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,990
Father.

463
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:31,960
Father?

464
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Yes?

465
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,569
Did something happen?
You've been zoned out for a while.

466
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:38,170
No, nothing happened.

467
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,839
Oh, right. There's something
I forgot to tell you that day.

468
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,579
The man who moved Father Lee's body.

469
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,079
The man who was ordered to do so
or who was involved in it.

470
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,549
Who is it?

471
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,779
Jang Ryong.

472
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,390
He said this
before I went up to the rooftop.

473
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,460
Don't press down
on his armpits too hard.

474
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,259
- They'll bruise.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,299
That means he knows how to
kill a man without a trace.

476
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,470
He only found out how
because of Father Lee.

477
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,569
Whether he moved Father Lee himself
or ordered his man to do so,

478
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:14,440
Jang Ryong is the one who did it.

479
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,140
Shall I go get him right now?

480
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,579
Let's go beat him
and make him confess.

481
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,509
We can let that slip.

482
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:23,410
No, it won't work that way.

483
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,549
No?

484
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:27,549
Then let's convince him
and make him confess.

485
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,150
That wouldn't help at all.

486
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,819
We need concrete evidence.

487
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,619
I feel so frustrated.

488
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,759
Wait a bit longer.

489
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:42,200
I will soon get them all
and relieve your frustration.

490
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,369
- Welcome.
- Come sit down.

491
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Sit down.

492
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,140
Say hello.

493
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,369
He's the informant of NIS,
Mr. Lee Joong Kwon.

494
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,609
He's going to be a free agent soon.

495
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,539
You don't have to talk about that.

496
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,579
Hello, I'm Park Kyeong Seon.

497
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,779
Nice to meet you.

498
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,250
But you don't look
like a prosecutor.

499
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,690
If you need to get any information,
get his help.

500
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,190
Yes, sir.

501
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,529
Oh, right.
Tell us about that priest.

502
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,660
- You said you finished analyzing.
- Right.

503
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,900
He was my subordinate
when I was a team manager...

504
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,569
of the Counter-terrorism Unit
at NIS.

505
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:22,039
He's like a cartoon character.

506
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:24,009
It might sound like a cartoon,

507
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:27,579
but no matter how long he starves,
gets shot by a gun,

508
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,480
or gets his bones crashed,

509
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,349
once he's in the enemy's territory,

510
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,720
he never backs off.

511
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,190
No matter how deeply
the terrorist group is hidden,

512
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,019
he busts all of them...

513
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,130
if he finds a single clue.

514
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,599
If he spots an enemy,

515
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,240
he becomes a monster.

516
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,009
That man was the top agent of
the Counter-terrorism Unit at NIS.

517
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,910
It's Kim Hae Il.
