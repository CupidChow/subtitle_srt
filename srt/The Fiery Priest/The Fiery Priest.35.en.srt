1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,840
Hey, take care of them.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,910
(Episode 35)

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,910
Hey, Lee Joong Kwon.

4
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,040
Your life will become much better
without me.

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,480
Nobody will try to kill you either.

6
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,419
I said that I'll go in.
Can't you let me do that?

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
- Father Kim.
- No, Father Kim.

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,160
Think wisely.
Stop bullying kids and women.

9
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,329
You used to be with
the special forces.

10
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,629
Aren't you embarrassed
about yourself?

11
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:28,570
You should think wisely as a man
and don't miss this opportunity.

12
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:32,969
Okay.

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,679
That guy is really cheap and cruel.

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,810
He's such a real jerk.

15
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,880
So why did you have to taunt him?

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,950
I know, right?
We could've solved it well.

17
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,750
Gosh, I'm at a loss for words.

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,189
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

19
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,530
But it isn't
that difficult to breathe.

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,409
What's that?

21
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,180
The loud noise...

22
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,680
Isn't that the thing?

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,180
The thing that gets rid of air.

24
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,849
What is that, Mr. Hwang?

25
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,219
Gosh, I found 50 dollars.

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,159
Now, our lives...

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,829
have 15 minutes left. Darn it.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,129
It's 15 minutes for a person.
We're...

29
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,430
2, 4, 6.

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,769
My gosh. We only have
2 to 3 minutes?

31
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,379
Hey, then we can't
get this vault open?

32
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,409
There's a way, but...

33
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,379
it will be open after we're dead.

34
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,689
About the air thing,
it's exaggerated, right?

35
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:56,019
No one would die, right?

36
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,689
I don't want to talk to you
anymore, Ms. Park.

37
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,829
Goodness. Are you sulky?
Just because I lied?

38
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,629
Gosh, he's sulky.

39
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,539
Are we all going to die?

40
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,939
Just keep quiet. You are
spreading the smell.

41
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:14,240
Don't ever move.

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,110
Goodness.

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,310
Gosh.

44
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,979
Gosh, I shouldn't have come inside.

45
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,659
There's a truck approaching.

46
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,460
(Gudam Express)

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,199
Follow that car.

48
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,210
- Gosh.
- Stop. Stop.

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,379
What's with those punks?

50
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,280
They're coming to us.

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,150
It's him. It's that punk, isn't he?

52
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,719
- He's the one who attacked us.
- I think you're right.

53
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,449
They're coming to us right there.
Mr. Lee!

54
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,090
- Backward!
- Go!

55
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,090
Quickly!

56
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,240
I feel breathless...

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,270
more than I thought.

58
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,180
Are we really going to die here?

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,409
Don't talk too much.

60
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,819
You're using up the oxygen.

61
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,449
Even if we die here,

62
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,319
let's all pray first.

63
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,360
Do you think
it is the time to pray now?

64
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,120
This is insane. Gosh, really.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,129
This is the right moment to pray.
Or when else would it be?

66
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,530
Mr. Hwang, let us pray.

67
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,830
We will go to...

68
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,129
the underworld.

69
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,639
You shut it.

70
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,840
I told you not to speak too much.
You're using up the oxygen...

71
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,139
- What's wrong with me?
- Hey.

72
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,780
Old Man.

73
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,550
Wake up. Wake up, old man.

74
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,750
It hurts.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,419
It hurts.

76
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm fine.

77
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,360
I'm fine.

78
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,500
We need the Lord.

79
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,870
We need the Lord to save us!

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,000
Even if he hears us,
it won't be of any use.

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,970
This vault won't open anytime soon.

82
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,779
I feel really strange.

83
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,949
My head... My head...

84
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,779
Gosh, I feel weird too.

85
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,790
My gosh, I can't...

86
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,060
- Darn it!
- Seriously?

87
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,600
I know we're in a serious situation.
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,439
You jerk.

90
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,480
Just die.

91
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,779
You useless punk!
And now you've even pooped here!

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,079
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

93
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,589
This is the worst place
anybody could be trapped in.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,389
I feel weird.

95
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:19,889
I don't think I'm going to die.

96
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,699
Me too.

97
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:29,300
For some strange reason,
I'm starting to feel really happy.

98
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,910
You're hallucinating
due to lack of oxygen.

99
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,740
We're dying right now.

100
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,350
Lord.

101
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,490
Your children...

102
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,660
are on the brink of death right now.

103
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,589
Good people...

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,230
and evil people are nothing more
than your children...

105
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:59,430
when they're facing death.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,399
Please help us avoid this hardship.

107
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,699
My goodness.

108
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,839
Due to my hallucination, I'm even
starting to feel vibrations.

109
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,680
Please have pity on our sins.

110
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,350
I think a subway is passing by.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,230
Please hear our desperate wishes.

112
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:43,209
And please help us escape
from this pit of death!

113
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,199
Fresh air!

114
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,149
Vladimir Godzhayev!

115
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,660
Godzhayev!

116
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,480
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

117
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,819
Great. Where's Godzhayev?

118
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,250
You jerk.

119
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,759
You said you failed to dig through.
How dare you lie to me?

120
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,560
That... That's not the problem
right now. There's...

121
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,829
You were planning to take
all that money, weren't you?

122
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,600
Hey, cult leader.

123
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,870
What's up, cult leader?

124
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,740
Enlightenment!

125
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,740
I hate the color of your jacket.

126
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,180
- What's going on?
- What's this?

127
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,879
You little punk.

128
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,289
Mr. Hwang, why were you in there?

129
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,149
Were you two trying to rob
the money from the vault?

130
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:38,919
No, you're mistaken.
He's the one who convinced me.

131
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,159
You... You're the one
who convinced me!

132
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,429
Shut your mouths!

133
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,059
You'd both better be
where I can find you tomorrow.

134
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,899
If you run away,
you'll really end up dead.

135
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,039
Let's go!

136
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
We can't just leave.

137
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,580
- Why not?
- Over there.

138
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,019
There's one more guy,
and there's poop...

139
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:10,450
- Poop? What are you talking about?
- Poop...

140
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,320
What are you saying?

141
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,590
- He's coming! The poop's coming!
- The poop?

142
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,360
- Darn it.
- He's coming out!

143
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,000
- He's coming!
- My gosh.

144
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,669
Poop!

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,340
- My gosh!
- Goodness!

146
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,220
Gosh.

147
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,159
- My gosh.
- That was not pleasant.

148
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,460
- My goodness, look.
- What?

149
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,269
- What are you doing here?
- Why are they coming from there?

150
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:01,970
They knew we'd follow them.

151
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,169
We lost them.

152
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,080
Are you saying you don't know
where they went.

153
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,179
- No.
- My gosh, this is bad.

154
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,919
You guys must've been very eager
to take that money.

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,889
Do you think this is funny?
We lost everything.

156
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,850
What do you want me to do?
Should I cry my eyes out?

157
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,289
That little punk.

158
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,090
- Prosecutor Park.
- What?

159
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,590
My guys just told me...

160
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,000
that Chief Prosecutor Kang
got betrayed as well.

161
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:26,960
What?

162
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,470
Lee Joong Kwon betrayed
Chief Prosecutor Kang...

163
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,139
and took the entire
150 million dollars.

164
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,470
My gosh.

165
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,340
What? Does that mean Lee Joong Kwon
is the final winner?

166
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,139
Gosh, he used his talent this time.

167
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,509
Lee Joong Kwon, that scumbag.

168
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:52,190
(Gudam Express)

169
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,269
Give them what they need.

170
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,480
Are you happy now that you
have taken all that money?

171
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,419
Yes, I'm really happy.

172
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,220
How long do you think
you'll be able to keep that money?

173
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,919
It's in my hands right now,
so it'll be mine forever.

174
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:25,059
It won't be easy for you to keep
that much money in Korea.

175
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,029
Or you can spend 2,000 dollars
a month for 6,250 years.

176
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,730
That's none of your business.

177
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,730
I will...

178
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,399
take that money from you.

179
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,610
How did they get out?

180
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,820
Gosh.

181
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,090
Are we still not getting a signal
from the GPS tracker?

182
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,559
(Unable to track location)

183
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,960
No, not yet.

184
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,659
I think they have a GPS jammer.

185
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,669
I'm going to kill Lee Joong Kwon,
that little jerk.

186
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:10,200
Sir.

187
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,470
I'm sorry...

188
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,440
for being so pathetic.

189
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,210
You never do anything properly.

190
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
You always get beaten up.

191
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,779
And you pooped on an important day.

192
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,789
You're completely useless!

193
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,450
Get out of here.

194
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:34,629
Just get out of here.

196
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,830
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,700
Gosh, you embarrassed me
in front of all those people.

198
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,009
That jerk.

199
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,309
If he hadn't saved my life
in Buyeo...

200
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,679
Darn it.

201
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,190
Wait a minute.

202
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,889
What do you mean
we should give up on Gudam-gu?

203
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,029
There's nothing else
we can do there.

204
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,899
Rising Moon has already caused
enough trouble...

205
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:17,330
Then what am I going to say
to my superiors?

206
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,470
I told them that they won't have
to worry about the campaign fund...

207
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,070
for the next election.

208
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,580
I'm sorry, sir.

209
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:30,379
Also, Superintendent Nam and
Chief Jeong seem a little unusual.

210
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,019
I think we need to take action.

211
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,389
Yes, I already heard.

212
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,220
Apparently, Superintendent Nam
called the reporters...

213
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,559
and told them
that he'll reveal everything.

214
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,659
I already stopped that
from happening, sir.

215
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,399
But we'll have to take
stronger countermeasures.

216
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,070
(No parking)

217
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,330
Let me go!

218
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,399
I'll put Superintendent Nam
in a mental hospital...

219
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,970
to prevent him from saying anything.

220
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,610
He'll scream and throw a fit.

221
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,580
But that will be it.

222
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:01,279
I know him very well.

223
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,120
And as for Chief Jeong,
she adores her son very much.

224
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,860
So we'll be able to keep her quiet
if we threaten her with her son.

225
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,639
Let's drink this.

226
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,009
- What's this?
- Go ahead.

227
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,769
Ms. Park, your clothes
look so beautiful.

228
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,110
Really? I'll get you one later.

229
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,879
I'm fine.

230
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,820
It looks beautiful on you.

231
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,279
It would look more beautiful on you.

232
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,549
- Gosh.
- Gosh. What's wrong with you?

233
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,559
The money must be still
in the truck,

234
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,730
but I don't get the signal.

235
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,190
When did you attach the tracker?

236
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,259
A while ago.

237
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,690
You're the best, Father.

238
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,730
By the way, about the vault.

239
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:30,870
The walls and the floor
were made of steel.

240
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,000
How did Godzhayev break it?

241
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,470
I can answer that question.

242
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,210
What's the answer?
I heard it from Cheol Bum.

243
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,509
Joong Kwon brought a craftsman
who made the vault.

244
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,350
Gosh, seriously.

245
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,750
Why?

246
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,519
It's kind of a delivery failure.

247
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,019
He pocketed the construction payment
in-between.

248
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,789
It's a vault only on the outside,
but they didn't put the steel on it.

249
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,889
He was reprimanded once
for purchasing equipment.

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,799
So he's an idiot who
makes the same mistakes.

251
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,129
Still, we survived thanks to him.

252
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,169
Come on.

253
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,799
Gosh, really.

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,470
Then do we have to stay here
and wait...

255
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,669
until the signal rings
from the tracker?

256
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,740
No, we should not just keep waiting.

257
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,610
We need to find the money
before they take care of it.

258
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,279
Yes, Sister.

259
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,950
What?

260
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,759
Who came?

261
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,269
Yamaguchi Toshio, a Japanese mater
made it.

262
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,169
It costs 80,000 dollars as a set.

263
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,710
Excuse me, Sister.

264
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,279
Where did you get this?

265
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,679
This one? Father Kim bought it.

266
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,850
Father Kim has good taste.

267
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,059
Be careful not to break it.

268
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,889
Use it with care.

269
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,559
I'll take care of that.

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,470
Where do you think you are?

271
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,180
Get out.

272
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,950
How can you do this to a guest?

273
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,819
A guest? My foot.

274
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,119
Get out of here now!

275
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,480
Father, please calm down.

276
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,519
Father Lee once told us...

277
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:33,519
to welcome everyone who visits us,
be it a believer or a sinner.

278
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,500
We'll leave here...

279
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,029
so that you two can have a talk.

280
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,799
Thank you, Sister.

281
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,210
Have a seat.

282
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,509
Say what you want to say
and get out quickly.

283
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,450
Let's catch Lee Joong Kwon together.

284
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:06,960
What?

285
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,660
I can't ask this to the police.

286
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,630
If I don't ask the police,

287
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,339
I won't be able to find anyone
as talented as you, Father.

288
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:24,369
Why do I have to find
Joong Kwon with you?

289
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,079
We have a common goal,
finding the money...

290
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,480
and smashing Lee Joong Kwon.

291
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,549
So? Are we going to find the money
and split it?

292
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:34,250
Money is one thing.

293
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:38,289
And if you want to beat
that mercenary or what,

294
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,559
my fists would be a help.

295
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,930
I can take care of it alone.

296
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,029
If you finish the business well
with me,

297
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,200
you'll reach the truth...

298
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,630
about Father Lee's death.

299
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,039
You jerk.

300
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,539
Stop talking nonsense.

301
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,880
You killed Father Lee, and now
you're talking about the truth?

302
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,450
I didn't kill him.

303
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,680
What?

304
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,890
I said I didn't kill him.

305
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,259
If you spew nonsense one more time,
you're a dead body.

306
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,890
I'm serious now.

307
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,130
You need to understand one thing.

308
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:21,700
If you kill me,
you'll lose one important witness.

309
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,269
A witness to the murder
of Father Lee.

310
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,339
Father.

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,369
What on earth happened that day?

312
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,039
So we need to cooperate.

313
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,410
If you settle the matter with me,

314
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,650
I'll reveal everything.

315
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,759
What are you going to do?

316
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:50,359
No!

317
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:51,900
We can never do that.

318
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,829
You know how Hwang Cheol Bum is.

319
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,170
The truth about Father Lee...

320
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,470
seems to be a lie he made up
to convince you, Father.

321
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,009
Of course. He's such a scum.

322
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:05,839
What do you think, Father Han?

323
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,480
I'll think about it some more.

324
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,250
You don't need to think about it.

325
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,750
We can do it enough.

326
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,950
He's right.

327
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,220
Once the money is
taken out from the truck,

328
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,720
the signal from the tracker
will ring.

329
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:20,220
Then we can go and catch him.

330
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,630
Yes. I know that.

331
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,779
You never do anything properly.

332
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,289
You always get beaten up.

333
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,049
And you pooped on an important day.

334
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,559
You're completely useless!

335
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,630
Ram kkira miro shel lik.

336
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:37,000
Ram... Ram kkira miro...

337
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,269
Ram kkira mi...

338
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,170
Enough. You can stop it.

339
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,519
Did something happen?

340
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,430
No, nothing happened.

341
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,559
You look like you cried.

342
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,259
I didn't cry. I didn't.

343
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,130
You're a bad guy,

344
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:11,170
so sad things happen to you.

345
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,200
Really, you punk.

346
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,039
As you beat me up,

347
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,680
do you think I'm that easy too?

348
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,180
You're a bad guy,

349
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,710
so sad things happen to you.

350
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,779
And you're drinking alone like this.

351
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:37,029
I'm drinking alone
as I want to do so today.

352
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,859
If you keep being a bad guy,

353
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,730
you'll live alone
for the rest of your life...

354
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,269
as a bad guy.

355
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,140
Stop it.

356
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,009
I know that!

357
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,420
Why do I keep smelling poop?

358
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,829
You crazy punk.

359
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,369
You dirty Long Dragon punk.

360
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,109
Gosh. Sir, he pooped!

361
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,980
I paid a lot of money on it.

362
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,910
I should throw it away.

363
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,619
All right. It's what Father wants.

364
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,930
You're awesome, Dae Young.

365
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,000
You respect Father Kim.
You're the best.

366
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,130
Thank you.

367
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:51,099
However, if Cheol Bum does
anything suspicious,

368
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,440
I'll teach him a lesson.

369
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
All right. Then you can do
whatever you want.

370
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,140
Then you can give him
a good beating.

371
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,920
Hello, Father.

372
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,950
I get it.

373
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,900
Let me see.

374
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:53,900
Don't try to look cool, Mr. Hwang.

375
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,970
You look messy with the wind.

376
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,170
What information do they have?

377
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,839
My men are doing research all over.

378
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,240
Let's move separately.

379
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,880
Contact me when you get information.

380
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,880
You shouldn't go alone
after getting the information.

381
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,119
Look who's talking.

382
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,089
It's so nice to see my district
with good-looking people.

383
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,619
You don't need to pay attention
to our look.

384
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,089
Goodness, you scare me.

385
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,890
You're a tiger now. A tiger.

386
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,400
I've been to a sauna this morning.
Can you tell?

387
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,940
It's so oily on your forehead
and cheeks.

388
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,619
Are you not going to say hello
to me now?

389
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,390
We're not friendly enough
to greet each other with a smile.

390
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,289
I didn't imagine this
and trusted that viper.

391
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,359
Gosh.

392
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,829
Yesterday, you made such a mess...

393
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,759
to get the money in the vault.

394
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,829
Today, you're standing
on the hallway...

395
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,000
of Seocho-dong, the legal center
in Korea, with such dignity.

396
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,769
Well, this is how
The Republic of Korea is, isn't it?

397
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,470
I'll make sure you don't step
on this hallway anymore.

398
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,109
Let's bet on which of us doesn't get
to step on this hallway first.

399
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,380
Listen.

400
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,490
If I'm out of here,
then you're out of here too.

401
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,119
I'm not scared of
getting out of here.

402
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,619
I'm not scared of getting punished
either.

403
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,490
Goodness. You've become a prosecutor
filled with a sense of justice.

404
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,059
Go ahead.

405
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,960
Things don't change.
You can never change it.

406
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,099
Before both of us get out of here,
there's one thing I should do.

407
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,470
You and I...

408
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,880
should settle the matter about
Father Lee's death, you know.

409
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,750
That's the finish line
for this race...

410
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,720
even if...

411
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,750
things don't change.

412
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,460
(Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon)

413
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,769
Really?

414
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,000
They're caught faster
than I thought. Thank you so much.

415
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,839
By plane in the evening?

416
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,740
All right. I'll call the detective
in charge.

417
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,039
All right. Thank you.

418
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,009
It's all right now.
If only they arrive,

419
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,279
we'll be able
to recover Father Lee's honor.

420
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,480
When are they coming?

421
00:27:28,589 --> 00:27:29,819
You mean tonight?

422
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,890
Yes. Yes, I'll get ready.

423
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,490
Yes.

424
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,259
Yes. Yes, yes!

425
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,559
What? There's no lawyer?

426
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,269
Strictly speaking,
the chief of borough...

427
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:44,930
is refusing to hire a lawyer.

428
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,470
But why?

429
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:51,069
Is she trying to take
every responsibility alone?

430
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,809
I think that's how it's going.

431
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,509
Chief Jeong Dong Ja
is not that kind of person.

432
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,579
About the Rising Moon case,

433
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:01,380
they're trying to put the blame
on Superintendent Nam...

434
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,319
and Chief of Borough Jeong.
Everyone knows that.

435
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,660
Yesterday, Superintendent Nam...

436
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,390
was forcefully confined
in a mental hospital.

437
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm sure those higher up
took an action on him.

438
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,000
- So they gave her an order.
- Yes.

439
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,799
How many children does
the chief of borough have?

440
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,470
She has a son who is a freshman
at a college now.

441
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,109
I guess he must be very precious
to her, a darling baby boy.

442
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,109
What's the meanest threatening
in the world?

443
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,049
A threatening toward
family and close ones.

444
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,319
Exactly.

445
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,549
Mr. Park.

446
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,250
Yes?

447
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,890
I got it. I solved the mystery.

448
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,390
- Cross.
- Cross?

449
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Cross!

450
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,160
- Cross!
- Cross!

451
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,970
(No signal)

452
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,299
To get a signal from the tracker,

453
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:54,170
we need to be in the radius
of 10km at least.

454
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
That's right.

455
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,579
We're helpless
if it gets out of Seoul.

456
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,880
Gosh, how frustrating.

457
00:29:02,009 --> 00:29:03,049
Yes, Detective Seo.

458
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,809
I'm watching the truck's path,

459
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,250
and the last destination seems to be
Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.

460
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,650
I'm watching the path in detail now.

461
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,019
All right, Detective Seo.

462
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,359
We'll go to Yangju. Thank you.

463
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,789
Yes. All right.

464
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,359
(Hwang Cheol Bum)

465
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,500
It went to Yangju,
Gyeonggi Province.

466
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,299
I just heard it from my men.

467
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:24,529
Then why didn't you tell me?

468
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:28,539
I was going to call you,
but you called me first.

469
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:29,869
You're so distrustful.

470
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,279
All right.

471
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,380
(Hwang Cheol Bum)

472
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,910
Aren't you telling him
too much in detail?

473
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,849
If I don't tell him,
we become the same bully.

474
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,720
You're sometimes
so generous, Father.

475
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,549
I'm generous.

476
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,920
Can't you just stop it?

477
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,559
I'm generous. Sparta!

478
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,559
Gosh.

479
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:02,509
(Consideration leads to virtue,
and dispute leads to regret.)

480
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Hello.

481
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,079
Hello. I'm from law firm Means and
Ways. My name is Han Pan Seung.

482
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,779
(Means and Ways)
