1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,379
Hey, you scumbag! How could you...

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,910
Hold on!

3
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,170
Song Sac.

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,469
There you go. Hit him!

5
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,799
I'm a tiger...

6
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:57,829
protecting...

7
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:58,829
my own king.

8
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,229
(I'm a tiger
protecting my own king.)

9
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,329
Song Sac!

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,950
(Episode 27)

11
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,790
Dae Young.

12
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,629
Myeong Su.

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,269
Mr. Lee.

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,769
I'm sorry I'm late.

15
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,540
Arrest them all!

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,769
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

17
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,620
Don't you know who I am?

18
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,879
Just stay still!

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,420
Good job.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,019
Goodness.

21
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,519
Come here!

22
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,090
My dad is a congressman.

23
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,859
Song Sac, you're a great fighter.

24
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,260
Were you a Muay Thai boxer?

25
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,229
Yes, I was. And I used to work as
a bodyguard for the royal family.

26
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,500
The royal family?

27
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,210
Then why are you delivering
jjajangmyeon in Korea?

28
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,710
My fellow bodyguard...

29
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,610
was in trouble because
he didn't keep his position,

30
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,250
but he blamed it on me.

31
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,650
I was framed,

32
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,789
and I got fired.
So I couldn't do anything else.

33
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,159
I wasn't hired...

34
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
by any security companies.

35
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,159
You didn't do anything
when he blamed it on you?

36
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,629
You fool. You let them
push you around there also?

37
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:40,629
Go away.

38
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,330
Don't be intimidated from now on
and live like how you did today.

39
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,199
Yes, Father.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,509
I'll help you too, Father.

41
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,879
- I'm off. Bye.
- Bye.

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,009
The move where you flew and kicked
the other guy with your knee.

43
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,550
Please teach me that, Song Sac.

44
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,150
"Song Sac"?

45
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,990
She called me by my name.

46
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:06,289
I'll teach you everything.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,530
I'll teach you all the lethal moves
of Muay Thai.

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,360
- Teach me too, Song Sac.
- Teach me too, Song Sac.

49
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,969
You should just look at the stars,
you pig.

50
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,439
And as for Dae Young...
No, I mean Detective Koo.

51
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,509
Just keep doing
what you've been doing.

52
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,780
That's cheap of you.

53
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,680
Yo Han, you go and
look at the stars.

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,210
I'll go and live just like
how I've been living.

55
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,280
I'll never give you the sandwich...

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
that passed its expiration date.

57
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,150
You're so cheap, you pig.

58
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,860
"Song Sac"?

59
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,699
"Song Sac".

60
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:46,229
Have you gone mad?

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,370
If anything goes wrong,
the whole country will be on fire.

62
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,069
I'm just trying to catch
the criminal who tried to kill me.

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,909
That's not the problem.

64
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,909
You and I both can be done!
Don't you know?

65
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,539
I'll catch the criminal nonetheless.

66
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,509
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding.

67
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm not interested in anything else
than catching the criminal.

68
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I have to go.

69
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,120
Why did he yell at me? How dare he?

70
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,129
The druggies are all sent
to a narcotics team, right?

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,069
Yes, sir. It's total chaos there.

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,300
All the reporters are there too.

73
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,639
Everyone's trying to avoid
the urine test.

74
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:31,839
One even wet his pants.

75
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,449
Those guys in a narcotics team
should work overnight.

76
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,750
Our team's work is done for today.

77
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
Let go of me, you jerk!

78
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,490
It seems like
we have one more to deal with.

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,759
Why did you drag me here?

80
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,389
We have a solid reason.

81
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,930
How dare you touch me?
Let go, you scumbag.

82
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,899
How dare you say that?

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,759
Sit down.

84
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:56,000
Sit down, my foot.
Let me see the superintendent!

85
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,439
Hey! Where's our superintendent?

86
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,240
Does he live in Namcheon-dong?

87
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,810
You punk.

88
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,379
You had meals...

89
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,980
with our superintendent,

90
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,649
and you also went to
a sauna with him.

91
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,819
Did you do all that?

92
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:20,529
You rude punk.

93
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,290
If I were my old self,

94
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,300
I'd have buried you already!

95
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,970
You rude punk.

96
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,930
How dare you act up?

97
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,670
I dare you to hit me again.

98
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,670
There's no government official
who can hit me.

99
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,810
Gosh.

100
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,939
He makes me want to hit him
even from far away.

101
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,709
Who are you?

102
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,149
You said there's no government
official who can hit you.

103
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,079
But there's a clergyman
who can do that.

104
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,589
That's me, you jerk.

105
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,860
Are you taking private lessons
or something?

106
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,730
How come you always act up...

107
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,990
regardless of time or location?

108
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,029
Stop.

109
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,470
Don't use violence
in the police station.

110
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,439
Don't hit him so hard.

111
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,740
Detective Koo,
please bring him inside.

112
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,740
Come here.

113
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,850
You better be prepared.

114
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,949
I'll completely destroy this place,
got that?

115
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,579
Come here.
I'll destroy your face first.

116
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,430
Good to see you, Attorney Byun.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Please don't call me like that.

118
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,629
Call me as Attorney Byun Dong Sik.

119
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay, Attorney Byun.

120
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:39,540
- Go ahead, Detective Koo.
- Okay.

121
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,569
I'll begin since
Attorney Byun is here.

122
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,670
Kim Keon Yong.

123
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,009
You have the right to remain silent.

124
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:48,350
Anything you say can and may be
used against you in a court of law.

125
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,350
You have the right...

126
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,620
Oh, he's here already.

127
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,490
And this is the arrest warrant.

128
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,389
Why are you suddenly...

129
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,720
If it's regarding drug usage,
just do what you've been doing.

130
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,089
It's not related to drugs.

131
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,800
He's under arrest for
instigating murder of Ms. Park.

132
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,529
- Got that?
- Pardon?

133
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,470
- Do you have proof?
- I will have it soon.

134
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,139
In the meantime, you can
suffer inside the holding cell.

135
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,470
The floor of our holding cell...

136
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,810
is in the Baroque style,
so it'd be fun to be in there.

137
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,139
Okay, bring it on.

138
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,279
I won't ever show you mercy
even if you kneel in front of me.

139
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,720
Don't you dare to.
I'll make your father...

140
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,920
erase your name for good
in your family register.

141
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,290
For good.

142
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,759
And you!

143
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,829
Don't you dare talk rudely to
a prosecutor, you scumbag.

144
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,930
The warrant is valid for
48 hours only.

145
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,860
If you don't find any proof
within 48 hours,

146
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,930
you better be prepared for
whatever comes next.

147
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,339
You can be quite rude,
Attorney Byun.

148
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:49,370
I knew you'd say that.
It's not funny at all.

149
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,120
(Seoul Detention Center)

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
(Subject to repatriate)

151
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,589
"The date of repatriating subject
to Russia..."

152
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,660
It's the day after tomorrow at 4pm.

153
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,199
We have less than two days.

154
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,829
Are you planning to
bring them back?

155
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,439
Yes. That way,
we can arrest the people...

156
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,439
who instigated murder.

157
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,910
But even if we
do bring them back...

158
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,040
It's going to be 1 of the 2.

159
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,810
They will either remain silent
or be ordered to remain silent.

160
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Mr. Lee!

161
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,519
- Yes, sir?
- Who told you to dispatch your men?

162
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,480
Who told you to dispatch your men?

163
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,429
If we didn't go,

164
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,429
Dae Young and Seung Ah...

165
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,429
could've died at the site.

166
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,740
That's up to how competent
the police officer is.

167
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,740
What about Young Cheon?

168
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,269
Did he die because...

169
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,639
- he was incompetent?
- What?

170
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,840
We can't have any of our men
killed by those thugs anymore.

171
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,549
It should be ended with Young Cheon.

172
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,080
You crazy punk,
what kind of nonsense is that?

173
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,620
Is that what's important here?

174
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,389
Why isn't it important?

175
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,789
What?

176
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,990
Do you know how
Young Cheon's family is getting by?

177
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,259
Do you even remember
who Young Cheon is?

178
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,059
You little punks. How dare you
disrespect me this way?

179
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:23,169
- Mr. Nam.

you could've

Why did you also attack Rising Moon?

211
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,909

was involved...

The drug abuse that occurred
at Gudam-gu's R club yesterday...

242

turned out to be a one-time
aberrant behavior...

243

caused by the children
of some upper-class people.

244
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,769

involved in selling...

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,220
Detective Seo can plan something
to provoke the suspects.

353
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,529
Something very strong.

354
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,329
(Habitually administered drug
in Korea)

355
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,799
(Two homicides in Korea)

356
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,670
By the way, for an operation...

357
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,210
we need someone to act
as a criminal.

358
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,579
We have our secret weapon, Song Sac.

359
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I object.

360
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:48,190
Important missions like this one
needs acting as well.

361
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,890
- I'll try it.
- Father Han?

362
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,490
Father Han's face suits for acting.

363
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,799
But you need to act well
in a calm manner for this one.

364
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:02,500
It's a drama aired a long time ago.

365
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:06,569
Do you remember the drama called
"Mom Is Leaving Home Again"?

366
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,339
It was a nationally popular drama
with ratings over 60 percent.

367
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,680
It's coming to me.

368
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,210
I have a dim memory of it.

369
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,150
In the final episode,
a boy says this line to his mom.

370
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,950
Mom.

371
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:27,619
Even if you leave me,
I won't be sad.

372
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,259
Because...

373
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,559
if you're happy,
I would be happy too.

374
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,670
And Mom, I won't be lonely.

375
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,710
The memory of playing with you,
your voice, and your smell...

376
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,339
are all with me.

377
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,579
Goodbye, Mom.

378
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,720
In the next world...

379
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,529
I'll be born as your son again.

380
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,900
I love you, Mom.

381
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:25,619
And...

382
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,390
the mom left.

383
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,759
She went to France with another man.

384
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,930
She was such a bad mom.

385
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,559
Goodness, what's wrong with me?

386
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,670
It was such a harsh punishment
for that young boy.

387
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,240
That kid cried so much
calling his mom not to leave him,

388
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
but she was such a bad mom.

389
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,369
That was too much.

390
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,839
I'm so glad I don't know the story.

391
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:58,619
Then, was that little boy you,
Father Han?

392
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,319
That genius child actor
Han Woo Ram...

393
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,289
was you, Father Han?

394
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:09,029
Right. That's the stage name
I used back then.

395
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,230
That's unbelievable.

396
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,000
I made such a fuss saying
I'd make you be my brother.

397
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,599
My goodness.

398
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,869
You looked so cute at that time.

399
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,700
Gosh, really.
You were so fair and shining...

400
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,309
like that plump worm in a chestnut.

401
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,569
You just looked like it.

402
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,339
My eyes are still tearing.

403
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,150
Dae Young, your snot
is getting into your mouth.

404
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:33,420
Am I qualified enough then?

405
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,289
Instead, you need to give me
the lines.

406
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,160
Don't worry about it.
I'll provide it real-time.

407
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
All right.

408
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,259
Okay. Good. It's already a success.

409
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:45,660
This is the best.
You're the best, Father Han.

410
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,930
- This is great.
- She's happy.

411
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,130
She dumped all the work to us.

412
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:54,240
I'm tearing up.

413
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,240
Father Han, I'm really a fan of you.

414
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
Thank you.

415
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,779
All right. Just do the same
as we simulated this morning.

416
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,009
It was nothing, wasn't it?

417
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,420
- What?
- Well, yes.

418
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,789
I have a bad feeling about this.

419
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,190
Are your receivers all working well?

420
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,019
Receiver?

421
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,099
- Yes.
- Yes.

422
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,529
Father Han,
you can say just as I tell you.

423
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,970
You're not nervous, are you?

424
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,569
It's nothing.
Why do I have to be nervous?

425
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,769
Father Han, you got this.

426
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,839
Can you do it all right?

427
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,839
Come on. I've been
a homicide detective for so long.

428
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,809
You should do it all right.
Don't make a mistake.

429
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,509
All right. Wishing for a success,

430
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,750
let's all cheer for ourselves.

431
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,279
Let's move.

432
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,690
We can do it!

433
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,829
Come quickly. Get in this car.

434
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,809
Our target is Anton.

435
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,450
That guy
with such a dark impression.

436
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Do you know why?

437
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,319
It's because we suspect Anton...

438
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,049
to be the one who
ordered the killers.

439
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,750
You got it.

440
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,549
He got negative for the drug test,

441
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,960
and we can't find any serious crime
on his record.

442
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,089
That means...

443
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,759
It's okay if we release him.

444
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,190
Correct.

445
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,059
How does he look to you?

446
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,529
He looks mean,

447
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,900
but he also looks somewhat stupid.

448
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,069
You kind of have a good hunch.

449
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,140
I can see that he's stupid
and easily influenced.

450
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,779
We can take advantage of it.

451
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,450
We'll first release him.
And my next plan is...

452
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:17,809
Let me finish this first.

453
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,180
All right.

454
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,319
When you came to my office,
you got so mad, didn't you?

455
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,029
Was it because I ordered mapo tofu
just for me?

456
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,329
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

457
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,500
I saw that your eyes were glaring.

458
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,200
"She orders food only for herself.
Why doesn't she order one for me?"

459
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,700
"I'm hungry too."

460
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:41,569
I guess that's true.

461
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,970
You can't hide your feelings,
can you?

462
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:47,309
Anyone can read your mind.
You're transparent like glass.

463
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,190
Yes, fill your stomach.
You need to eat when you can.

464
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,250
At your age, you won't get fat
no matter how much you eat.

465
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,190
Hoon Seok, are the keys for the safe
arriving today?

466
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,599
Yes, the keys will arrive
after two hours.

467
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,130
I see.

468
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,329
- Jang Ryong.
- Yes, Mr. Hwang.

469
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,440
The Russians
will be repatriated today.

470
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,640
Follow them from
the detention center to the airport.

471
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:16,369
Make sure if they leave all right.

472
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,009
Yes.

473
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,950
Strangely enough,
sad forebodings are never wrong.

474
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,380
Aren't you being too sensitive
these days, Mr. Hwang?

475
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,789
It's the same for me too.

476
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,150
The operation really starts now.

477
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,549
Don't lose your tension.

478
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:03,289
Yes.
