1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,409
10 minutes?

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,940
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,279
What took you so long?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,220
Oh, I was...

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,990
I prayed for the dead one.

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:17,489
You guys do that too?

7
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,059
Yes. It's because
my hobby is praying.

8
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:24,699
Then why did you take this
corpse out again?

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,899
It's a different one.

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,399
This one needs to go
to a different city.

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,239
Have a good night.

12
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,310
(Chapel of Rest)

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,280
What kind of a corpse
is wearing shoes?

14
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,780
I'm going to a convenience store.
Do you need anything?

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,079
I'll go.

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,950
I want to get some fresh air.
What do you want?

17
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,289
I want a fish cake bar and a Coke.

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,990
Okay, I'll get a hot dog for you.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,520
Dae Young, I said one fish cake bar
and a Coke.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,329
I knew something was up.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,269
Why is that priest so persistent?

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,209
What should I do?

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,439
What else can I do?
I have to report.

24
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,280
You're not going to use
your taser, right?

25
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,150
Yes, because I have
only one cartridge left.

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,989
If you were to speak to yourself,
you should've been quiet.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,989
Your voice echoed in the hallway.

28
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,260
Father, you've done
something really bad.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,200
Who's the guy you came with?

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,599
He's the examiner of NISI.

31
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,000
NISI?

32
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,969
Then you've done
illegal autopsy as well?

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,099
I didn't go that far. I just checked
the corpse's outer parts.

34
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,769
Still, that's not right.

35
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,769
Then report it. Report it,
and let's go to hell together.

36
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,609
I'm a priest,

37
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,609
so it's nothing to take you
to hell with me.

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,680
You don't know what kind
of a place hell is, do you?

39
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,319
The fiery hell?

40
00:01:57,019 --> 00:01:58,260
It's not where...

41
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,290
your body is twisted.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,359
You'll be born exactly the same
as yourself in your next life.

43
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,930
And you'll live exactly
the same life as you're living.

44
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,509
It'll be repeated infinitely.

45
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,250
You know I don't bluff, right?

46
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm off now.

47
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,389
Think wisely.

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,659
Gosh, why do they make me
live the same exact life?

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,340
I'd hate that.

50
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,539
He must've made it up.

51
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,939
There's no such harsh hell!

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,719
It can't be true.

53
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,229
Your nose is really swollen.

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Go away.

55
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,729
Okay.

56
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,270
- Hey, part-timer.
- Yes, Detective?

57
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,639
You go to
the Catholic church, right?

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes, both my baptismal
and actual name is Yo Han.

59
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,240
I didn't ask you that.

60
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,650
Do you know what kind of place
hell is?

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,750
Hell isn't where you are
burned or your limbs...

62
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,949
are cut off.

63
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,520
It's living the same life
you're living infinitely.

64
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:40,729
Darn it!

65
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,360
In layman's terms,

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,629
you live a painful life
over and over...

67
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:49,270
I got it! Get lost already!

68
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,699
Go!

69
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,340
I tried to explain it
as easy as I could.

70
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,180
- Go!
- Okay, I'm going.

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,439
- Go!
- Why are you yelling at me?

72
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,080
Go!

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,019
There are kids in there!

74
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,990
There are no kids in there!
I checked already!

75
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,689
Do you want to die?
Throw the grenade!

76
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,430
I said, throw it!

77
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,040
(Intelligence makes
a strong nation.)

78
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,430
All records of Agent Kim Hae Il
of National Intelligence Service...

79
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,769
will be erased.

80
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:01,970
(NIS works for national security and
to promote the national interest.)

81
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,370
You'll become a normal man
who's lived a normal life.

82
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,839
That's all the help I can give.

83
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,120
Sit down.

84
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,259
Are you here to pray?

85
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,870
No.

86
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:12,170
I came because I missed Father Lee.

87
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:16,870
Was he good to you?

88
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,910
He was...

89
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,019
like an angel to me.

90
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,050
I came to this neighborhood
with only five dollars on me.

91
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,459
I had no food to eat
or a place to stay.

92
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,000
Father Lee fed me
and gave me a place to stay.

93
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,699
He even helped me get a... A jab?

94
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,100
A job.

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,769
Yes, he helped me get a job.

96
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,709
I see. Which country are you from?

97
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,850
I'm from Thailand.

98
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,579
Why did you come here?

99
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,319
I have to make a lot of money.

100
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,089
My mom and my younger siblings
are in Thailand.

101
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,029
There is a total of eight.

102
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,800
I see.

103
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,110
What's your name?

104
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,240
It's Somssatekalaktanaprasser.

105
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,540
Somssate...

106
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,449
Somssa...

107
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,250
Somssa...

108
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,580
Do you have friends here?

109
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,820
Yes, Oh Yo Han.

110
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,620
You cursed at him for eating bread
during the Mass.

111
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,529
Gosh.

112
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,929
- Okay, then. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

113
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,600
Also, do tell me if those punks
bother you again.

114
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Okay.

115
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,240
Thank you.

116
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:56,909
All right.

117
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:03,950
Please punish the person who lied.

118
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,679
Please also punish...

119
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,860
the person who harmed Father Lee.

120
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:16,090
I will.

121
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,710
There are people...

122
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,720
who change the world
by facing anger head-to-head.

123
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,419
We have to change the world
from where we stand.

124
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,179
Who's calling me at this hour?

125
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:13,649
Park Kyeong Seon speaking.

126
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,220
Who?

127
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,000
Why did he have to
call me out at this time?

128
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,440
Why is he standing like that?

129
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,340
He's disgustingly good-looking.

130
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,620
What did you have to tell me?

131
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,519
This is your last chance
to redeem yourself before sunrise.

132
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,259
Before sunrise? What is this?
A vampire movie?

133
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,659
You bother me
in such creative ways.

134
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,100
I admire that.

135
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,460
"Love and truth will meet."

136
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,870
"Justice and peace will kiss."

137
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,769
Psalm 85:11.

138
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:07,440
For your love,
for justice and peace,

139
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,840
please reinvestigate his case.

140
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,509
The Lord is all-knowing.

141
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,509
What?

142
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,009
What do you mean?

143
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,649
I mean that the truth is
not far away but rather close.

144
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,789
I'm giving you the chance
to reveal the truth...

145
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,620
for your future's sake.

146
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,889
Don't you worry about me, Father.

147
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,590
Also, don't try to win me over
by being emotional.

148
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,230
That won't work.

149
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:36,330
I'm not being sly. I'm doing this
as a follower of the Lord.

150
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,769
Gosh, fine.

151
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,299
This wasn't anything
important at all.

152
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,470
Why did you come
all the way here at this hour?

153
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,210
When will you be leaving?
I'm so sleepy right now.

154
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,409
- I was about to leave.
- Then do so.

155
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,620
I got three trials today.
My goodness.

156
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,990
I should live like how I used to.

157
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:00,720
This doesn't suit me at all.

158
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,440
Once again,
I've come to work the earliest

159
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,070
No one's here

160
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,179
Seo Seung Ah is hardworking

161
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,320
Who are you?

162
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,590
I'm Father Kim Hae Il.

163
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,690
Since you've already helped me once,
I ask for one more favor.

164
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,629
Why is there a mosquito
during the winter?

165
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,000
I got you.

166
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,070
As time goes by,
my longing feelings for you

167
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
May disappear

168
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,279
Sir.

169
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,519
What is it?

170
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,389
I have a question.

171
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,820
Did Father Lee really
embezzle the offertory?

172
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,629
That was already confirmed
by the police.

173
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,330
Please look into my eyes,
and tell me the truth.

174
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,029
Is it true?

175
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,370
Of course it is.

176
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,299
It doesn't make sense.

177
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,870
The only thing he owned
was a pair of shoes.

178
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,440
I don't know anything else.

179
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,879
All I did was give
an honest testimony.

180
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:02,409
Then...

181
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,620
please tell me in detail about
how he embezzled the offertory...

182
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,019
and where he used that money.

183
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:10,789
So...

184
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,019
Every weekend... Every Sunday,

185
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,690
he requested that I put aside
some of the offertory.

186
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm not sure where he spent it.

187
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,830
Will you keep stuttering?

188
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,100
If you're going to lie,
do it properly.

189
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Who told you to do this?

190
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:32,379
Who told you to make
such a ridiculous testimony?

191
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,679
No one. I just did it
for a clear conscience.

192
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:40,419
Conscience?

193
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,519
Is that what you just said?

194
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,120
Why are you doing this?

195
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,120
How much did you receive?

196
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,460
I did it for a clear conscience.

197
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,929
I didn't receive anything.

198
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm also a believer, you know?

199
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:06,340
If you come again, I'll report you.

200
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,440
Don't ever come back.

Investigation Record)

(Gudam Police Station)

203
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,200
Why is that priest
not doing anything today?

204
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,929
Did he contact you?

205
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,100
No, he didn't.

206
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,340
If something happens to him
or if he calls you,

207
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,740
report to me.

208
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,009
Of course.

209
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:39,740
All right, then.

210
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,610
Shall we have some jajangmyeon?

211
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,250
- What?
- Jajangmyeon.

212
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,419
Sure.

213
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,289
Where are you from?

214
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,759
The Archdiocese
Investigation Department.

215
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,159
We investigate any crimes
or corruptions within the church.

216
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,299
That's intense.

217
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,070
You must've been
shocked and baffled.

218
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,500
Of course.

219
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,000
Who'd be happy to
go through something like that?

220
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,509
I know it's hard,

221
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,580
but could you explain
what happened in detail?

222
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,779
He grabbed my hands,
asking to pray together.

223
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,419
And while praying,
he suddenly groped my thighs.

224
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,450
I was so shocked.

225
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,820
I ran away without looking back.

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
It says...

227
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,629
It says that it happened
in the parish church's prayer room.

228
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,799
There's a big window,
so anyone could see through it.

229
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,840
Of course, he closed the curtains.

230
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,509
He had it all planned out.

231
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,309
There's a window in the prayer room?

232
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,820
All right, then.

233
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,960
Father Lee was old,

234
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,919
but he was over 90kg.

235
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,360
I'm sure it was difficult
to stop him.

236
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,990
Well...

237
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,759
During emergency situations,

238
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,500
it's common to
suddenly become strong.

239
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,829
Father Lee? 90kg?

240
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,069
She's never met him.

241
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:15,940
All right.
Thank you for cooperating.

242
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,809
He met them?

243
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,210
Yes, sir.

244
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,920
Darn it, that priest.

245
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,890
He's really crossing the line.

246
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,750
If we let him be,

247
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,319
he'll keep visiting them.

248
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,730
Hey, Godzhayev.

249
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,960
Stop eating and listen to me.

250
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,700
Do me one favor.

251
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,039
He grabbed my hands,
asking to pray together.

252
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,549
And while praying,
he suddenly groped my thighs.

253
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,309
I was so shocked.

254
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,220
I ran away without looking back.

255
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,690
So what?

256
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,190
You know that's a total lie, right?

257
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,460
Do you think Priest Lee
was over 90kg?

258
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,730
Many people make mistakes
about people's weight.

259
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,200
Then her claims about
the prayer room having a window?

260
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
She could've been mistaken
during that chaotic incident.

261
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,839
That's nonsense.
This woman doesn't even know him.

262
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,240
Gosh, you're so persistent.

263
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,309
Then please reinvestigate
the general affairs manager.

264
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,309
Isn't it odd that
he quit during all this?

265
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,509
It's his choice to quit.

266
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,549
Your head is really
full of creative ideas.

267
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:33,950
Creative ideas?

268
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,190
How could you say that
when I have proof here?

269
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,190
Father Kim, this means...

270
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,730
This means nothing.

271
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,099
What if you blackmailed them
into saying this?

272
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,829
Would a priest do that?

273
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:53,839
Violence against a cop
and attempt to extort a body...

274
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,839
is more than enough for me
to doubt your claim.

275
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,440
Who would believe you?

276
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,349
Look, Prosecutor Park.

277
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,380
Goodness.

278
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,150
You didn't call me
an old man for once.

279
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,849
You must be very angry.

280
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,220
If this isn't proof, then what is?

281
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,289
Father Kim.

282
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:14,390
Trying hard won't suddenly
create a new proof.

283
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,390
I told you before...

284
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,630
that nothing will change.

285
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,930
Could you please
not make me repeat myself?

286
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,430
It's not game over,

287
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,299
so please reinvestigate
these fake witnesses.

288
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,269
Ma'am, check this out.

289
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,970
Did something happen?

290
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,680
We are deeply regretful...

291
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:36,450
for the recent incidents.

292
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,779
In order for such incidents
to not repeat themselves,

293
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,650
we will make sure to correct
our priests' behaviors.

294
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:44,660
The church would like to...

295
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,289
I think you guys already
ended this game.

296
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,859
We will do our best
to investigate...

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,799
the sexual molestation reports
regarding the priests.

What? How...

300
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:26,329
How could this be?

301
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,200
They didn't reveal the truth.

302
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,470
I will go around the diocese
and ask for their signatures...

303
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,640
regarding a reinvestigation.

304
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:38,180
Could you please say something?

305
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,380
You should at least get angry.

306
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:44,880
Let's lay Father Lee in state first.

307
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,480
And then?

308
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,589
Father Kim.

309
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,220
Also,

310
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,759
we cannot give him
a proper funeral.

311
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,569
We cannot bury him
at the Catholic grave.

312
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,240
What? But... But still!

313
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,269
These were the orders
from the diocese.

314
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,710
Father Lee...

315
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,150
How could they do this
to our Father Lee?

316
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:21,519
How could they? Goodness.

317

finally awake?

334
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,009
Could you allow me...

335
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,609
to share your pain?

336

That's my hobby, you see.

337
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,230
I'm sorry it took so long.

338
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:07,769
I tried my best,
but I'm not a good cook.

339

next to God.

Please give us guidance, Father Lee.

345

Please wait a little longer.

I promise you.

348
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,890
Do we have to keep
an eye on him even today?

349
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,759
They told us to watch him
until he leaves the graveyard.

350
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,329
The least we could do
was to pray for his eternal repose.

The well-being center of Gudam...

352
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,539
opened last month.

353
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,769
Its purpose is to give a chance
to the low-income class...

354
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:51,339
Let's go since it's over. We have to
go to Mr. Hwang's awards ceremony.

355
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,609
- It's being well-received.
- Why do we have to go there?

356
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,049
We're going to have a meal there
and congratulate him.

357

- Award ceremony for...
- Gosh.

358
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:02,289
Did they tell us to go?
Are we some kind of...

359
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,490
It must be a buffet
since it's held in a hotel, right?

360
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,490
The awardee is...

361
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,289
- Let's go.
- Daebum Trading's...

362
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,230
president, Hwang Cheol Bum.

363
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,059
President Hwang of Daebum Trading...

364
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,230
has been paying much effort
for the development...

365
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,799
- of Gudam...
- Please pull over.

366
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,900
- Pardon?
- His effort is acknowledged,

367
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,740
- Over there.
- and that is why...

368
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,269
he's chosen as the winner.

369
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,220
Where are you going?

370
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,019
You can go back first.
I have to drop by somewhere.

371
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:39,420
Are you trying to do something
behind our back?

372
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,660
No. I'll go back to the church soon.

373
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,980
(The winner, Hwang Cheol Bum)

374
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,779
(Award Ceremony for Businessmen
Who Contributed to Gudam)

375
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,400
Give me your hand. It's pretty.

376
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
My goodness.

377
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,339
What are you doing here?

378
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,109
- I'm here to congratulate...
- We don't want that. Get lost.

379
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,890
My goodness.
You're such an annoying priest.

380
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,789
- Brother.
- What?

381
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,529
If you hit a priest,
you'll go to hell.

382
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,630
Is that so?
Then shall I take a trip to hell?

383
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,930
How shall I hit you?

384
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,470
Do you prefer hapkido or taekwondo?

385
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,700
Karate? Let's go with that.
That'd make me look cool.

386
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,640
Have you ever heard of it?

387
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,140
Do you know capoeira?

388
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:05,980
You can't attack me
when I'm changing, okay?

389
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,980
Watch carefully.

390
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,289
My body movements
will be very graceful.

391
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,339
What was that?

392
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,589
(The Fiery Priest)

393
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,789
I feel a strong presence of Satan.

394
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:56,859
(After the funeral,)

395
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,059
All Satans must listen.

396
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,059
(the villains go on a feast.)

397
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,970
You killed Father Lee
and threw him off the cliff.

398
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,640
Anyway, if you want to capture me,
you better be well-prepared.

399
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
(The church becomes desolate.)

400
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,869
Our church won't be indicted, right?

401
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,339
I told you not to
come to our church, old man.

402
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,009
Go to a sauna or a good restaurant
if you want to relax.

403
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,009
(The evil gets bigger.)

404
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,720
You must be aware of a horrible sin
that the Catholic priest committed.

405
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,250
(You must cooperate.)

406
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,420
You want me to cooperate
with that priest?
