(Episode 8)

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,049
Dear leader.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:11,119
I've never done meridian massage
prayer, so it's all new.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,019
Why would someone seeking for
enlightenment get scared?

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,530
Your face will become smaller
with your enlightenment.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,030
There you go.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,969
There you go.

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,239
Let's pray.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,000
- There you go!
- There you go!

10
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,310
- There you go!
- There you go!

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,340
I'm sorry!

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:37,609
What's this?

13
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:43,049
Who are you?
I was in the middle of...

14
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,149
Hello, Mr. Ki.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,689
Can you make my face smaller too?

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,490
(Leader of Daegakgyo, Ki Yong Moon)

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,229
What brings you here, Mr. Hwang?

18
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,929
Don't be pompous.

19
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,709
What brings you here, Mr. Hwang?

20
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,650
Mr. Ki.

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,650
Do me a favor.

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,129
Why aren't you saying anything?

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,099
Let me hear it out before deciding.

24
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:32,329
You'll decide after hearing from me?

25
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:40,469
Mr. Ki,

26
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,540
do you want to die as soon as
you find your enlightenment?

27
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,340
You were a low-class fraud...

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,010
who mooched off old ladies
in a small town of Suncheon.

29
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,010
I gave you a job,
and you're repaying me like this?

30
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,120
What? You'll hear me out
before you decide?

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,019
I didn't mean it like that.

32
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,819
- Don't get mad, Mr. Hwang.
- Hey.

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,430
Why don't you take charge of
welfare facilities in Gudam?

34
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,260
I'll arrange everything for you.

35
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,230
Welfare facilities?

36
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,830
About the kid from
Gudam Orphanage...

37
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:11,870
who's hospitalized because of
the spoiled school lunch.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,710
I heard the kid is
in a critical condition.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,439
Is he dead?

40
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,610
No.

41
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,509
The mother superior
of the orphanage...

42
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,280
submitted a petition to my office.

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,979
She requested for
a reinvestigation...

44
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,120
on the food distributor's
illegality.

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,150
She ended up submitting
a petition to your office...

46
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,389
because no one helped her.

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,020
I can just ignore it,

48
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,560
but I'm worried that it might
lead to another trouble.

49
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,800
She might report it to press,

50
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,800
so please take care of it.

51
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,300
Why would you make me take care
of such a petite matter?

52
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,039
Anyway, has Mr. Hwang...

53
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,139
finished talking with the
constructor of the history museum?

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,580
He's almost done with it.

55
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,909
He'll...

56
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,020
distribute it to you soon.

57
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,250
Darn it, I wish he can speed up.
He's so slow.

58
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:01,750

00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:16,169
He majored in Korean Literature.

61
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:19,439
He majored in Korean Literature in
graduate school and became a priest.

62
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,439
Is this all?

63
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,280
Yes. I was also surprised because
he doesn't have much background.

64
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,280
Judging from his eyes and tenacity,

65
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,849
it seems like he's gone through
a lot in life.

66
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,550
Was he just born like that?

67
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,659
I'm done making them, sir.

68
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,789
Deliver them.

69
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,629
Hey, bring a wrapping cloth
for dried yellow corvina.

70
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,639
How come he looks good even
in his identification photo?

(Graduated from Hanju University)

73
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,479
His life seems pretty normal.
It's so unexpected.

74
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,879
I feel like he has a secret.

75
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,670
Are you going to
arrange all of them today?

76
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,670
Yes, I'll finish it today.

77
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,670
Let me help you.

78
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,180
It's okay. Go get some rest.
I can do it alone.

79
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,949
Okay.

92

There's so much
I must fight against, God.

93
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:19,850
Just a few...

94
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,860
are causing so much pain
for the masses.

95
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:26,689
How many times must I tell you?

96
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,430
A child is suffering...

97
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,259
because of tainted food.

98
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,730
She's dying.

99
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,199
The adults' greed...

100
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:36,930
might take the life of a child.

101
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,470
It's up to the council.

102
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,069
It's not our jurisdiction.

103
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,040
Still, I'll come back.

104
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,839
They won't admit to their faults.

105
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,379
A child's life hangs in the balance.

106
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,050
They won't listen to the weak.

107
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,579
They use their power
to lord over the weak.

108
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,050
- A child...
- I'll take a look.

109
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,220
It's about the food.

110
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,620
Will you just go home?

111
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,990
- Stop. Stop the car.
- My gosh.

112
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,360
They turned their eyes away
from justice and truth.

113
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,829
They make the wrong decisions.

114
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,000
For the first time in my life,
I will go against you, Lord.

115
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,509
Instead of choosing forgiveness,

116
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,310
I will reveal their crimes
to the world.

117
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,750
Only you know how much longer...

118
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,180
I have to live.

119
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,990
For as long as I have the energy to,
I will go on fighting.

120
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,430
Not just for those
who believe in God,

121
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,560
but for everyone on earth.

122
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,139
It must've been so hard,
taking this on all on his own.

123
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,649
Even so, he loved the people...

124
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,149
so much that he was
willing to go against God.

125
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,689
For everyone in the world,
not just the believers.

126
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:11,829
And I complained that I got stopped
and things didn't go my way.

127
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,160
I cursed others.

128
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,269
He must've been
so disappointed with me.

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,980
I bet Father Lee
was very upset and dismayed.

130
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,449
Sorry. That just came out.

131
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,579
It's okay. It happens.

132
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,889
Father Lee fought on his own.

133
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,789
I will take over from him.

134
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,690
You should. I will help in earnest.

135
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,490
Thank you.

136
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,330
What will you do?

137
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,429
All our options are blocked.

138
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,870
Sorry, I blurted that out.

139
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,179
What should we do?

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,980
You can go to National Assembly
or the Blue House.

141
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,179
If things don't work out,
you can tattle to the pope.

142
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,120
Tattle it. Tattle.

143
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm scared.

144
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,029
Pope! Pope, pope, pope!

145
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,500
Help me, pope!

146
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,340
No, the Pope...

147
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,269
What do you mean?

148
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,779
It's nothing.

149
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,149
Why did you mention the Pope?

150
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,480
Because...

151
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,519
Never mind. Forget about it.

You'll really write to the Pope?

157

Father.

158
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,409
There's a Vatican Embassy
in Seoul...

159
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,210
and we have an archdiocese too.

160
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
If you ignore all the proceedings...

161
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,220
and send a letter to the very top...

162
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,490
Father!

163
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:19,820
Seriously?

164
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,590
Get out. Out.

165
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,259
- Do you need my help?
- I don't.

166
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,830
- Get out! Leave my room.
- My goodness.

167
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,230
Do you remember
Father Gabriel to whom...

168
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,000
you gave the title monsignor?

169
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,639
With the love of God,
he loved all on earth,

170
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,409
helped, and shared with others.

171
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,419
Not long ago, he died
an unjust death and was framed...

172
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,159
with all sorts of crimes.

173
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,909
In the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit.

174
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,350
Amen.

175
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,289
I very rarely ask for you to
grant my prayer.

176
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,789
Please do this time.

177
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,990
If you do,

178
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,529
I'll do my duty
as a priest forever.

179
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,740
For the rest of my life,
I won't get angry.

180
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,909
I'll live a peaceful life of mercy.

181
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,580

Son, and Holy Spirit.

182
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,850
Amen.

183
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,230
Darn it.

184
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,700
Why do mosquitoes
still live in the dead winter?

185
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Darn it.

186
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,600
I expected this,

187
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,169
so I bought myself a weapon.

188
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,230
This is the feeling.

189
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,210
Wait here for five minutes.

190
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,409
I just need to say hi to a friend.

191
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,909
Are you collecting a bribe?

192
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,210
You have no idea.

193
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,549
I'm the only one
who doesn't take bribes.

194
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,149
I'm picking up an invitation
to his daughter's wedding.

195
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,090
See you later.

196
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,490
(Dorado Karaoke bar)

197
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,690
(Dorado Karaoke bar)

198
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,690
Pickpocket!

199
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:12,360
Catch that pickpocket!

200
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,110
You can't go in there alone.

201
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,139
It's a really scary place.

202
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,679
They don't acknowledge cops.

203
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,720
Where'd she go?

204
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,590
Seo Seung Ah. Detective Seo.

205
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,190
- Looking for your female partner?
- Yes.

206
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,059
She chased a pickpocket
into the Russian district.

207
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,500
- Really?
- Yes.

208
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,159
Darn her.

209
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,340
My goodness.

210
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:52,940
This stinks.

211
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,110
Why does this taste so bad?

212
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,809
Get me some coke.

213
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,779
- It's good.
- What is this?

214
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,009
It's a Russian fish soup.

215
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:04,350
But Russians don't eat it much.

216
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,019
Hey, you.

217
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,049
You've been wiring me less and less.

218
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,289
Oh, sorry, right.

219
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,159
Business here these days is so bad.

220
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,730
Recession.

221
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,559
Darn recession.

222
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,659
I don't care about that.
You should pay me the same.

223
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,429
You Russians.

224
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:25,340
You know why you people
can do business here so freely.

225
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,669
- Yes.
- Why the cops don't arrest you.

226
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,210
Do your part.

227
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,379
- Okay.
- And if...

228
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,980
you pilfer from me,

229
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,379
I'll go directly to your boss, okay?

230
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,720
No pilfering. Never.

231
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,720
Are you playing word games with me?

232
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,389
How'd you know the word "pilfer"?

233
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,519
I guessed.

234
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,629
- Move while I'm being nice!
- What...

235
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,500
- What's going on now?
- Step aside!

236
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
My gosh.

237
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,899
I told you to move.

238
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,740
- Move!
- What is it?

239
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,899
Those folks...

240
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
don't understand what you're saying.

241
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,309
Put down the bottle.

242
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:08,980
I'm off.

243
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,679
See you.

244
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,120
Who...

245
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,450
are you?

246
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,389
I'm a detective
with Gudam's Violent Crimes.

247
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:21,259
He picked a pocket
and entered this district.

248
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,629
I'm trying to take him,

249
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,529
and those fools
are getting in the way.

250
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:32,870
What did you say?

251
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

252
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,379
Stop me if you can.
I'll break all your jaws.

253
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,379
Stop!

254
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,210
Stop, stop.

255
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,350
Give me that.

256
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,850
It's been a while, Godzhayev.

257
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,889
Do you know her?

258
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,919
Yes, she's a rookie.

259
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,990
It's her first time here
and she messed up.

260
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,090
I'll talk to her.

261
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,159
You talk to the guy on the ground.

262
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,460
Talk to whom?
I caught him red-handed.

263
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,769
Go on your way
before my mercy wears off.

264
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,600
Mercy, my foot.

265
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,840
Let's go.

266
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,970
We can't just walk off.

267
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,669
- We're leaving.
- Hey!

268
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,509
You'd better be good.

269
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,909
Be good!

270
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,250
Let go of me.

271
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,350
Let them deal with it.

272
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,250
They have their own rules.

273
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,850
Is that another country?

274
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,190
Do they have extraterritoriality?

275
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,690
Bringing them all in
will just cause trouble.

276
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,159
Forgive some and ask for help
with others.

277
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,200
I said it's best we keep
the symbiotic relationship alive.

278
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,159
That Godzhayev fool.

279
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,269
Does he have something on you?

280
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:38,269
How dare you?

281
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:41,000
Will you watch yourself?

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,210
You need to stay alive to be a cop!

283
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,179
Who cares about staying alive?

284
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,639
Is that place a battlefield?

285
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,350
You don't know what they're like.

286
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,980
Why does that matter?
I just want to arrest criminals.

287
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,120
My goodness.

288
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Darn it!

289
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,960
You said you're
the only one they fear.

290
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,330
That if they want to fight you,

291
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,529
they have to register
with a funeral service first.

292
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,400
Say that to me just once more and...

293
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,940
I might beat you up first.

294
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,789
That brat Seo Seung Ah.

295
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,420
She doesn't know anything.

296
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,210
- Leave.
- Okay.

297
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,140
- You, part-timer.
- Yes, detective?

298
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,180
Why do you always want to
join me when I drink?

299
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,220
Because you're cool,
and I'm curious.

300
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:04,819
What?

301
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,130
You're really cool...

302
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,230
and there's a lot...

303
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,059
I want to ask you.

304
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:21,539
The fool.

305
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,309
Is he teasing me?

306
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,089
Hello, Father.

307
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,529
- Here.
- Thanks.

308
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:45,859
- Bye.
- Bye.

309
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,700
Father. Do you have a reply?

310
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,579
I guess the Pope
didn't get your letter.

311
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,150
I used the application properly.

312
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,190
I think you should find another way.

313
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,890
I used the application properly.

314
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:19,200
(Vatican City)

315
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,150
Your Eminence, it's a letter from
Father Michael from Korea.

316
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,289
Dear Mr. President.

317
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:53,529
I received a letter from
Father Michael from Korea.

318
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,140
He wrote about
the death of Father Gabriel...

319
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,970
who was in charge of
Seoul's Gudam Church.

320
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,210
Please help reopen the case
and investigate...

321
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,380
the death of my friend Gabriel.

322
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,950
This isn't just about
Gabriel's honor.

323
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,420
It pertains to the honor
of the Catholic church as a whole.

324
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,920
Please help.

325
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,589
From Pope Francis.

326
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,829
- Secretary.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,299
Tell them to do what they can
to reopen the case.

328
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,670
Yes, sir.

329
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,019
(Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae)

330
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,349
Yes, sir.

331
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,990
Yes.

332
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,759
What?

333
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,299
Wow.

334
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,630
Wow, this is incredible.

335
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,500
Did he really do as I said? Really?

336
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,970
What kind of
a global situation is this?

337
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,269
He went directly to the Pope...

338
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,509
This is the Pope I know, isn't it?

339
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,779
Yes, it is that Pope.

340
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:25,920
The tarot reading was right.
One mistake, and I might go down.

341
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,190
If things go wrong,

342
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,400
I could become a global witch.

343
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:34,700
- Papa!
- Papa!

344
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,970
- Papa!
- Papa!

345
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:40,599
Papa.

346
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,450
Let's really get to it.

347
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,980
Okay. We'll never have
a stauncher backer.

348
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,980
- Papa!
- Papa!

349
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,519
My goodness.

350
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,920
It's all good, but...

351
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,690
how will you revive our church?

352
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,400
Getting our church back on track...

353
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,599
is another of our important tasks.

354
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,109
Father Han,
if you're like this too...

355
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:20,079
Sorry for getting angry, Lord.

356
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,450
We forgot something important.

357
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,089
Only seven came to mass yesterday.

358
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:30,019
Even so,

359
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:31,890
at such a joyful moment,

360
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,390
she threw a wet blanket.
We don't get along.

361
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,099
Still, we have...

362
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,170
- Papa!
- Papa!

363
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,039
It's an order from the President.

364
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,970
We have no choice.

365
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,809
The case was closed
according to Korean law.

366
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:55,150
The Vatican must be aware of it.

367
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,380
They are.

368
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,450
But they're still demanding
another investigation.

369
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,289
How could things
end up like this? Darn it.

370
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,490
There's...

371
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,160
one more troublesome detail.

372
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,029
We have to let the priest join in...

373
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,700
as part of the investigation.

374
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,430
As an observer.

375
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,400
This is insane.

376
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,140
What kind of nonsense is that?

377
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,269
You just watch.
He'll cause trouble at every corner.

378
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,410
Which is why...

379
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,079
I came up with a great idea.

380
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:33,049
As head of the investigation,

381
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,190
I'll appoint
the best man for the job.

382
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,089
The best man?

383
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:40,460
Who do you mean?

384
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,359
The most incapable,

385
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,460
most useless,

386
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:51,769
and the biggest
troublemaker of them all.

387
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,339
Not bad.

388
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,710
Above average.

389
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,480
- Detective Koo.
- Gosh.

390
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:04,279
- Go see the superintendent.
- What for?

391
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,950
Just go.

392
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,619
Pardon?

393
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,890
Work alongside that priest?

394
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,789
Yes. Until the case is closed.

395
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,329
Why me?

396
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:23,599
You're our station's ace.
It has to be you.

397
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,000
- I'm not the ace.
- What?

398
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,440
It's nothing.

399
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:29,609
However,

400
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,180
work with another objective...

401
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,740
while you work with him.

402
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,079
What's that?

403
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,549
You're to pretend to
investigate the case,

404
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,920
but actually disrupt it.

405
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,160
- Make a mess of it.
- What?

406
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,059
You know nothing good will
come from another investigation.

407
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,130
If things go wrong,

408
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,430
me, your team, and you...

409
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,099
will all lose our jobs.

410
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,240
Don't let the priest find out.

411
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,970
Charge him
for obstruction of justice.

412
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,140
And report his every move.

413
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,910
Got it?

414
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,910
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

415
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,309
I'll especially promote you...

416
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,950
if you deal with it well.

417
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,319
I'll promote you to captain.

418
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,019
Got it?

419
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,490
Someone...

420
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:24,789
from high above is involved
in this case.

421
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,700
The Blue House.

422
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,599
This is a huge opportunity
that might never come again.

423
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,910
Got it?

424
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,339
Yes, sir.

425
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,910
(Superintendent's office)

426
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,059
I should've gone to pay respect to
Grandpa last Chuseok.

427
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:00,130
Bad luck seems to be following me.

428
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,339
Is the Pope that influential?

429
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,279
My Pope is super strong.

430
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:18,619
- He influences the world leaders.
- I don't care.

431
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,849
How about the woman and the manager
from the church?

432
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,589
I took care of them neatly.

433
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,630
No one will be able to find them.

434
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,000
Tell them to stay low
and don't ruin things.

435
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,930
And get me a shrewd and tough guy.

436
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,700
I might have to use him.

437
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,410
Okay, got it.

438
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,079
Why aren't things going as planned?

439
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,420
Hey, where are we headed to?

440
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,660
We're going to
Paris in France, right?

441
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,430
Could you get us
business class seats?

442
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,029
I can't handle the economy class.

443
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,799
It's my first time to be on a plane.

444
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,829
Are you dumb?

445
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,000
- Maybe he can't speak Korean.
- He's Russian.

446
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,140
Really?

447
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,779
Who's the detective in charge again?

448
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,210
It's Detective Koo Dae Young.

449
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,589
That means you're not willing
to reinvestigate the case.

450
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,190
Yes. Sorry?

451
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,329
Didn't they tell you to assign
the best detective you got?

452
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,690
Yes, Detective Koo is the best one.

453
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
What am I going to do with his face?

454
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,000
What should I do?
I might end up killing him.

455
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,710
I'll assist him also.

456
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,569
No, you two should go out
for investigation,

457
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,140
and Detective Seo should help them
in the police station.

458
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,750
- But I'm a field detective.
- Be quiet.

459
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:58,980
Please change to other detective.

460
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,650
I can't work with him.

461
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,349
What?

462
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,819
You're being too harsh on me.

463
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,990
I'm the hidden gem
of Violent Crimes Team.

464
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,589
Please watch what you say.

465
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,859
Gem, my foot.

466
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,299
You should stay here
and keep pigging out on snacks.

467
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,369
You're making me competitive.

468
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,990
What if I solve the case?

469
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,430
Solve the case? Then I'll treat you
to lamb skewers.

470
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,930
That won't do.

471
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,069
How about beef special cuts?

472
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,039
Okay. I accept it.

473
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:58,440
Okay.

474
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,809
The cooperative investigation
officially starts now.

475
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,140
(The Fiery Priest)

476
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,009
You can't get mad or break things
while investigating, okay?

477
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,049
Okay.

478
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,480
Report it if you're innocent!

479
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,019
If you keep causing trouble,
I can't cooperate with you.

480
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,150
(Is this a mutual assistance
or a disturbance?)

481
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,019
Even a small convenience store does
not operate their CCTVs like this.

482
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:21,019
I'll send the bill to the church.

483
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,200
Come up with a way to deal with
that priest at one go, okay?

484
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,730
I can't charge him with anything
minor since the Pope has his back.

485
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,769
(Stop the priest.)

486
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,740
How can a priest get drunk?
Is this even allowed?
