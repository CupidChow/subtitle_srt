1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,470
It said "the following day".

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:04,940
It means I have to
be there tomorrow.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,610
That sounds great.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,849
I get to go to my hometown
in 20 years.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,820
Chief. Where should I go first
in Yeongwol County?

6
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,689
Is there a place where I could
release this anger?

7
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,550
Cheongnyeongpo.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,390
How about Danjong's place of exile?

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,559
That's unbelievable.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,660
Are you telling me to go to
a place of exile since I'm exiled?

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,329
I apologize.

12
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,929
Just get me a box since I'm busy.

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,869
You could just stay at the church.

14
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,340
Did you really have to
get coffee outside?

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,009
The church only has instant coffee.

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,909
My money, my blood.

17
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,509
You seem like you pay with points.

18
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,320
I don't get points for free.

19
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,619
I've already spent a lot.

20
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,460
Here are the two americanos
you ordered.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,890
Where are we going today?

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,429
The aroma of this coffee is nice.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,630
Tell me honestly.

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,369
What?

25
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,899
Are you feeling lost?

26
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,769
You don't know what to do, right?

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,409
I know everything.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,810
"I did everything I could".

29
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,340
"No one is going to say anything
if I give up now".

30
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,180
What are you talking about?
We're just starting.

31
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:15,879
What?

32
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,450
You have to do something for me.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,980
Let's go in together.

34
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,519
Just tell me.

35
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:24,890
I'll do it.

36
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,870
Darn it.

37
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,010
Stop.

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,890
A beast or
a well-trained assassin...

39
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,159
are the only things...

40
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,030
that can attack you.

41
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,299
Perhaps...

42
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,669
It can't be.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,370
Jang Ryong.

44
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,639
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,810
Contact the investigator
from Mullae-dong...

46
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,250
and ask him to do an investigation
on Father Kim.

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,379
That rude Father?

48
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,919
Yes, not like a background check...

49
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,590
but a detailed investigation.

50
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,389
If he tries to increase the price,

51
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,090
tell him I'll kill him.

52
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,689
I'll get a reasonable price
and complete it properly.

53
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,659
Is everything ready
for Savings Day?

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,060
Yes, they're ready.

55
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,939
There are people
who catch the cows...

56
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,310
and people who eat the steak.

57
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
What?

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,250
A briefing?

59
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,219
Chief Jeong Dong Ja,
Chief Nam Seok Gu...

60
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,659
Congressman Park Won Mu...
It's hot.

61
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,629
And Hwang Cheol Bum.
Everything about them.

62
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,000
Why do you need a briefing
about them when...

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,729
this investigation is
about Father Lee?

64
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,599
Because they're all related to it.

65
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,139
And you know that they need to be
beaten up to give us evidence.

66
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,139
Watch what you say.
What do you mean by "beaten up"?

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,270
Why are using vulgarism?

68
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,039
That word is in the dictionary.

69
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,479
And you said you'd do anything
for me just now.

70
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,810
But these are personal details
of the superiors.

71
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,979
That's not right.

72
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,780
(If you're appointed with a lawyer,
you can participate...)

73
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,289
(in the investigation
with the appointed lawyer.)

74
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:36,319
I'll give you meals.

75
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,460
What?

76
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,189
I'll let you have a meal per day
at the church for a month.

77
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm dumbfounded.

78
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,169
Do I look like a beggar to you?

79
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,400
Chief Jeong Dong Ja.

80
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,710
She's a very outstanding person.

81
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,870
She entered the borough office
as a grade nine civil servant.

82
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,409
She reached a position
as a secretary...

83
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,479
of three chiefs in total.

84
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,580
Her political ability and charisma
is overflowing.

85
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,719
She must know everything
about Gudam.

86
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Of course.

87
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,219
She knows literally
everything about Gudam.

88
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,689
She knows who owns what business...

89
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,389
and what goes on in every alleyway.

90
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,759
Come in and listen to this.

91
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,790
What? Who?

92
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
Were you eavesdropping?

93
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,629
Yes.

94
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:26,370
I was eavesdropping
and was also recording.

95
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,310
What's the relationship between
Jeong Dong Ja and Hwang Cheol Bum?

96
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,579
Just a relationship between
a chief and a local worthy.

97
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,649
They're close like siblings.

98
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,879
They address each other
as siblings in unofficial settings.

99
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,180
They publicly revealed that
they're step-siblings.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,649
How do you know that?

101
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,420
I also looked into it.

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,959
Your meal at
the church is canceled.

103
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,959
I was about to tell you that.

104
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,730
It's rather like an alliance between
a chief and a gangster instead.

105
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,699
Yes, I know of that. An alliance.

106
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:52,860
How about Hwang Cheol Bum's details?

107
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,540
He's an orphan.

108
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,240
He's been a gangster in Yeosu
since he was 20.

109
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,310
He was ranked second in Yeosu...

110
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,209
and came to Gudam seven years ago.

111
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:05,509
I'll kill you.

112
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,910
He first earned a lot from...

113
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,209
adult entertainment establishment
and construction business.

114
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,980
He established Daebum Trading
company three years ago.

115
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,420
He must've smuggled things
if he runs a trading company.

116
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,959
He steals from enterprises in Gudam,

117
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,459
he manages the Russian district...

118
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,689
and uses them as his men.

119
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,500
Yes, you're correct.

120
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,329
How did you know all that?

121
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:27,329
Next.

123

Our superintendent is
from a well-supported family.

124
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,939
Since the Japanese colonial era,
they've been a police...

125
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,279
Cut that nonsense.

126
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,139
That means
his family is pro-Japanese.

127
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,250
Like Japanese raiders.

128
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:44,019

He's a congressman
of the opposing party...

131

who has been elected
for the third term.

132
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,850
He served in the army.

133
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,220
He usually leads strikes.

134
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:55,589
His hobby is doing
intermittent fasting.

135
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,329
If he's a congressman,
he should use his head,

136
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:59,529
not his body.

137
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,769
Anything significant about him?

138
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,829
He has nine records
of receiving bribes,

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
4 records of sexual harassment,
3 records of fraud,

140

were dropped.

183
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,179
Suddenly, a few of them
started throwing up.

184
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,279
- My stomach hurts.
- Ye Bin.

185
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,009
The food was rotten.

186
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,179
But the worst happened to Eun Ji.

187
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:10,320
The other kids recovered
after a few days,

188
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
but Eun Ji had a weak immune system
to begin with...

189
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,789
and couldn't fight off the virus.

190
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,460
She suffered from complications
and is in a comatose state.

191
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,169
She needs good treatment,

192
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,500
but since we don't have any money,

193
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,870
the hospital said
they would discharge her.

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,379
We can't do that.

195
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,950
She needs to be hospitalized.

200
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,129
I'm sure
that food service company...

201
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,769
refused to take responsibility.

202
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,429
We sued them...

203
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,269
and told the media about it,

204
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,440
but it was to no avail.

205
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,909
What was the name
of that food service company?

206
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,250
Wangmat Foods.

207
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,080
Do you know that company?

208
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,419
Yes, it's around my neighborhood.

209
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,889
Be honest. How are they?

210
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,490
They make tasty foods...

211
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,429
and do meal services, right?

212
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:29,399
Fine, fine.

213
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,500
Their president...

214
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,970
is the nephew of Ki Yong Moon,
the leader of Maegakgyo.

215
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,139
Whose nephew?

216
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
Oh, my. I apologize.

217
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,539
Cult! It's a cult!

218
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,919
Is she unconscious?

219
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,820
Sometimes she wakes up
and looks at me.

220
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,659
But it's only for a brief moment.

221
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:03,870
In her current state,
a flu virus could cause...

222
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,299
blood poisoning and give her
a lethal shock.

223
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,210
Then how could we bring her home
in that critical condition of hers?

224
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,210
Please keep
administering antibiotics...

225
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,480
and make it painless.

226
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,580
In order to do so, she needs
a more effective antibiotic.

227
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,919
But the cost is...

228
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,419
I'll pay.

229
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,590
I'll pay,

230
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,090
so please don't let her
feel any pain.

231
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,159
No one is stepping up when
she's in a life-or-death situation!

232
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,940
I don't care about anything else,

233
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,840
but I won't allow something
like that to happen to a kid.

234
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,440
I'll destroy them.

235
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,710
This means he'd been doing
everything that he could...

236
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,210
just to save her.

237
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,250
Are you talking
about Father Lee Young Jun?

238
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,889

Where are you going?

240

Why didn't you accept
Father Lee's petition?

241
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,029
The company apologized,

242
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,029
and a correction order
was sent out to them.

243
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,769
The girl is in critical condition
because of their food.

244
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,000
They must take responsibility
for it.

245
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,570
We can't tell them to do that
just because of one girl.

246
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,210
Just because the rest of them
recovered doesn't mean it's okay.

247
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,269
The company needs
to be responsible for this.

248
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,710
What responsibility?

249
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,779

00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,480
They make rotten foods.

364
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,119
No wonder.

365
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,589
How dare they mess with food.
Do they want someone to die?

366
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,630
How long have you been working here?

367
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,200
Since yesterday.

368
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,960
Then you must not know much.

369
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:21,869
How many hours do you work?

370
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,200
I work from 9am to 6pm.

371
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:25,700
That's not part-timing.

372
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,500
You should be a full-time employee.
Those jerks are trying...

373
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,640
to save money.

374
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,910
Go work then.

375
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,579
Tell me if they pay you less.

376
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,349
You're so amazing. I mean it.

377
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:36,349
Stop it.

378
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,690
(Daebum Trading)

379
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:48,190
(Daebum Trading)

380
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,559
Hello, sir.

381
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,970
- Hey.
- That way, sir.

382
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:56,869
Let's go.

383
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,569
That way, sir.

384
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:00,869
Hello.

385
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,109
Goodness.

386
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,819
Savings Day comes around
so quickly every month...

387
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,549
that I always forget.

388
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,849
For me, it's so slow.

389
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,019
A month seems to feel like
2 to 3 months.

390
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,660
The day before I come here,

391
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,160
it feels like the day before
going on a picnic.

392
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,829
"Savings Day".

393
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,599
You should give me credit
for naming it like so.

394
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,869
I named it like that
so you'll anticipate the day.

395
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,069
All right, let's go in.

396
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,970
All right.

397
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,609
One.

398
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,980
2, 3.

399
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:45,380
The fingerprints match.

400
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,990
Yes!

401
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,759
Every time I come here,
I feel totally rejuvenated!

402
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,799
I don't need any tonics.

403
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,630
For me to be completely rejuvenated,

404
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,440
I'll need to see this much
more money.

405
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,170
Even if gold was
showering down on you,

406
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,980
I doubt that you'd be content.

407
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,180
Goodness, you.

408
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,390
Well done this month as well.

409
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,460
Don't mention it, ma'am.

410
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,359
We are witnessing
the rise of our future.

411
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,529
(There is approximately
150 million dollars here.)

412
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,170
Pack them.

413
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,910
- You punk.
- How dare you?

414
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,210
I'm sorry, sir.

415
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,309
Be careful!

416
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:46,539
I'm sorry, sir.

417
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
Yes?

418
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,349
What?

419
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,319
So you couldn't say anything
and just took it?

420
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,890
I'm sorry, sir.

421
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,890
They even defeated Choco.

422
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,460
How strong could he be?

423
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:07,859
Darn it.

424
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,670
I sense that the priest has...

425
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,369
an unspeakable past.

426
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,069
Like me.

427
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:17,839
Hey.

428
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,140
You're a cult leader.

429
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,009
What great past do you have?

430
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,180
You can bet that I have
an unspeakable past...

431
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,250
when I was back in...

432
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,690
Ignore him and listen up.

433
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,660
If something happens
to Wangmat Foods,

434
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,160
it won't end there.

435
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,359
You guys, me, the borough office,

436
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,759
and the Chief of Borough
will all be destroyed.

437
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,900
Is it my time to step up?

438
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,500
Leave that priest up to me.

439
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:51,240
I will send him to his God.

440
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Drop that fork, and stop it.

441
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,950
Gosh, there he goes again.

442
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Anyway, if you let that priest be,

443
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,390
it'll cause even more trouble.

444
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,720
The Vatican is supporting him.

445
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,089
Okay, okay, okay.

446
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,960
How about I take care...

447
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,329
of him?

448
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,170
What's your plan?

449
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,710
Issues caused by a believer...

450
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,109
should be solved by other believers.

451
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,009
We'll solve it together.

452
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,490
What is all this?

453
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,089
I saw you fighting...

454
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,059
with Detective Koo yesterday
over the eggs.

455
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:44,900
I prepared a lot because
it seemed like you liked them.

456
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,900
Do you want me to stuff myself
to death?

457
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,029
Not at all.

458
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,039
Father, you can't make such jokes.

459
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,470
Where is he?

460
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,609
We're eating lunch late
because of him.

461
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:01,140
He texted me, saying he had
some matters to take care of.

462
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,920
Anyway,

463
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,619
don't you hate Detective Koo?

464
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,619
Let's be honest.
He's not on our side.

465
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,359
He's interrupting us from getting
to the bottom of Father Lee's case.

466
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,529
We are aware of that.

467
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,960
And yet, you want to be nice
and prepare food...

468
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,299
for someone like him?

469
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,500
We must.

470
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,369
If Father Lee was still alive,

471
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,809
I know what he would've done.

472
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,750
Even though we hate him
for what he's done,

473
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,250
he would've offered him...

474
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,059
a nice, warm meal.

475
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,759
I know.

476
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,500
Isn't that why...

477
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,829
you allowed him into our church?

478
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,640
No, not really.

479
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,309
Goodness.

480
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,740
Who is this?

481
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,680
Goodness, again?

482
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,180
Yes, Sister.

483
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,180
What? Those Maegakgyo people
are there again?

484
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:15,789
Do excuse me.

485
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,819
Why do they keep coming?

486
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,529
Goodness.

487
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,500
- The big one, please.
- Okay.

488
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,339
(Yeongwol)

489
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,839
(Yeongwol County Bus Terminal)

490
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,380
(Welcome, the daughter of Yeongwol,
Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon)

491
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,019
How simple.

492
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,589
(District public prosecutor's office
in Yeongwol County)

493
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,930
I came to eat.

494
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,000
Did Father Kim go somewhere?

495
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,200
To Gudam Orphanage.

496
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,869
Why so suddenly?

497
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,009
I have a bad feeling about this.

498
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,119
A really bad feeling.

499
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:25,960
- We hate going together
- We hate going together

500
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:30,329
- Enlightenment is the best
- Enlightenment is the best

501
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:33,660
- Smile, smile, smile
- Smile, smile, smile

502
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,529
- We will follow him
- We will follow him

503
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:38,029
Ukha.

504
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,440
We will follow him

505
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Hey.

506
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,490
You're here, Mother...
I mean Father Kim.

507
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,160
For our children's joy.

508
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,859
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

509
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,359
That lady flicked my head
because I didn't say "Ukha".

510
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,470
Me too.

511
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,230
When did I do that?

512
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,039
I was just patting your head
because you're so lovely.

513
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:13,670
- I guess my pat was too strong.
- How dare you...

514
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:17,140
Why are you doing this? Calm down.

515
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,980
I told you not to come here.

516
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,849
There was an official announcement
from the Borough's Office.

517
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,410
- Didn't you know?
- That's not my business.

518
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,720
I see. That's not your business.

519
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,650
We have to keep our laws.

520
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,289
A law is a law,
however undesirable it may be.

521
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:35,630
Socrates left that famous saying.

522
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,890
Do you know the spelling?

523
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,829
S, z, r, a, t...

524
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,730
My goodness.

525
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,299
I told you last time not to
talk about Ukha to the kids.

526
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,309
What's so wrong about teaching
them about enlightenment?

527
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,240
And is your God the only God?

528
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,339
What did you just say, cult?

529
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,549
Cult?

530
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,450
You're the cult to us.

531
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,119
Your God doesn't even exist.

532
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,519
Please come down for a while, God.

533
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,319
Are you there? He's not there.

534
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,519
It's proven that he isn't.

535
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,819
He's not there. He's gone.

536
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,660
How dare you talk about...

537
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,890
Come here.

538
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,990
No matter how you interrupt us,

539
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:13,630
I'll make sure that
these lovely kids...

540
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,069
become part of Maegakgyo.

541
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,539
Ukha.

542
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:19,940
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

543
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,500
Say it louder.

544
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,769
Ukha.

545
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,509
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

546
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,839
You...

547
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,089
- No, Father Kim.
- I won't leave you alone.

548
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,150
Not only that.

549
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,890
I'll make this place...

550
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,559
the chapel of Maegakgyo.

551
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,470
A Father hit someone.

552
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,539
It's Satan.

553
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,910
He hit someone.

554
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,910
Stay away, Satan.

555
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:05,150
Father Kim.

556
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,970
How could you cause a mess again?

557
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,670
- Are you okay?
- Of course I am.

558
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,539
But who's that man with the hat?

559
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,349
A man with the hat?
What are you talking about?

560
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,519
(The Fiery Priest)

561
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,589
It's old but at least it's quiet.

562
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,190
How disgusting.

563
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,190
(A prosecutor who lost her power.)

564
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,759
On the verge of death, wisdom
and agility will give you strength.

565
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,559
I think he should go
to the hospital once again.

566
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:27,859
(A supportive police?)

567
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,170
Let's work together.

568
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,930
You're like Lee Jung Jae
from "New World".

569
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,940
You start tomorrow.

570
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
(Finally, they become one.)

571
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,369
Are you sure Father Kim
asked us to do this?

572
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,440
Yes, I'm sure.

573
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:36,769
(Wangmat Foods)
