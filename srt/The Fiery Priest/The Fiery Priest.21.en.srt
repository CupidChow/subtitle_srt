1
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,009
Why is the toilet paper here?

2
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,260
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

3
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,589
This is driving me crazy. Oh, no!

4
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,140
Oh, no. My gosh.

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,109
I lost the timing
while looking for toilet paper.

6
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,739
How could you hit
a prosecutor's neck?

7
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,870
I had no choice.

8
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,909
She fainted.
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

9
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,040
- What would?
- She wanted to take a dump.

10
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,980
What if her intestine loses control?
She might wet her pants.

11
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,510
After all, she's a prosecutor.

12
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,819
No. Let's get out of here first.

13
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,359
(Episode 21)

14
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:48,849
Darn it, you.

15
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:50,750
My legs are weak.
I should do some squats.

16
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,780
Darn it.

17
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,319
Who are you?

18
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:21,409
What's going on?

19
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,080
I think he jumped down
from the second floor.

20
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,389
- Mr. Hwang.
- What's going on?

21
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,759
2 unidentified men
escaped from the 2nd floor.

22
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,030
What?

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,430
Ms. Park.

24
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,800
Ms. Park?

25
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,229
Ms. Park.

26
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,669
Ms. Park.

27
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,500
Ms. Park.

28
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,509
Ms. Park, Ms. Park.

29
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,639
Are you okay?

30
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,250
Are you okay, Ms. Park?

31
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,520
Yes.

32
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,879
We ran away like thieves,

33
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,780
and the thugs came after us.
This is ridiculous.

34
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,349
Anyone would think
we're the bad guys.

35
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,590
Why are you even wearing
this black plastic bag?

36
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,219
I had to cover my face up, too.

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,159
By the way, what was in this bag?

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,030
My dirty underwear.

39
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,169
You can throw up later.

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,939
Get ready to go
as we don't have much time.

41
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,210
Theft case occurred. Everyone from
Violent Crimes Team 2 should gather.

42
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,009
Every team member has to
gather at Mr. Hwang's villa.

43
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,379
Why would they call Violent
Crimes Team for a theft case?

44
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,650
Theft case?

45
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,379
What does that mean?

46
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,990
What's this?

47
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,020
It'd have been weird if we
left without stealing anything.

48
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,860
I had to take something
to make them think we were thieves.

49
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,689
But that is too trivial.

50
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,660
If you were to steal anything, why
wouldn't you steal an expensive one?

51
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,730
What is it?

52
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,029
It looked expensive to me.

53
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,199
Anyway, I'll go to church first.

54
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,839
- Hold on.
- What is it again?

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,139
Take this with you.

56
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,009
- Why should I take this?
- I can't take it back.

57
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,040
It'd be weird.

58
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,279
Darn it.

59
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,579
Get in the car quickly.

60
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,649
Do I have to go up again?

61
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,990
I have to go up again.

62
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,089
I have to climb up there again.

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,100
I'll take a photo of this.

64
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,529
Those eyes were fatally attractive.

65
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,980
So you didn't see
the thief's face, right?

66
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,779
I said I couldn't see it
because he was wearing a mask.

67
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,579
How many times
do I need to repeat myself?

68
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,879
I thought maybe you might
remember something new.

69
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,189
Oh, right.

70
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:49,790
He was wearing feet wraps so that
there'd be no footprint left behind.

71
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,160
- And there was an orangutan.
- An orangutan?

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,569
- Was it Bigfoot?
- Bigfoot?

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,269
- Or Caesar?
- Caesar?

74
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,470
Never mind.

75
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:07,310
I guess he was in disguise.

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,610
It sounds like
they're professionals.

77
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:14,480
Where were you guys all day?
What took you so long to show up?

78
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:16,649
We got a tip saying
the bandwagoner's in town,

79
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,449
so we spent the entire day
trying to catch him.

80
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,350
Then you should've
reported that to me.

81
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,490
Haven't you figured out
why they broke into this place yet?

82
00:06:23,019 --> 00:06:24,089
No, not yet.

83
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,060
Maybe it was a theft.

84
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,730
Did anything get stolen?

85
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,199
Something got stolen from upstairs.

86
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,399
- Yes, there you go.
- What got stolen?

87
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:36,029
A gourd-shaped bottle.

88
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,610
That wouldn't be expensive, right?
Aren't they cheap?

89
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:44,339
It was made by Japanese master
named Yamaguchi Toshio.

90
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,540
The entire set costs 80,000 dollars.

91
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,319
80... 80,000 dollars?

92
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,490
Yes, of course. Do you think
it would only cost eight dollars?

93
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,620
Judging by the fact that they took
something so expensive,

94
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,990
I'd like to carefully point out
that they must be professionals.

95
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,129
Don't you have any CCTV footages
or testimonies from witnesses?

96
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,660
The CCTV is a wreck.

97
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,170
It's hard to figure out the footage
because of the screen noise.

98
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,970
And according to the guy who chased
them, there was one more person.

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,600
Does he remember
what that person looked like?

100
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,009
The person showed up out of nowhere,

101
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,069
so he only saw that person
for a really short time.

102
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,480
The person was really skinny
and had his or her face...

103
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,449
covered with a plastic bag
from a jokbal restaurant.

104
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,350
And the person was wearing
a black jacket and black pants.

105
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,660
And here's the interesting part.
That person was wearing white socks.

106
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,139
Detective Seo.

107
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,939
Yes, sir.

108
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,579
What is it, sir?

109
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,209
I told you not to wear like that.

110
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,319
It's the color
that criminals enjoy wearing.

111
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,220
You're wearing exactly
what the criminal was wearing.

112
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,490
Maybe this is
the only clothes she has.

113
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:02,850
Should we swap clothes?

114
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,160
Someone might think
she's the culprit.

115
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,430
You're the culprit.

116
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,430
- I told you, didn't I?
- She's like a culprit.

117
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,899
- That's enough!
- Silence.

118
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't care who they are.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,970
I want you to catch them
and bring them to me in three days.

120
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,339
How dare they
knock out a prosecutor?

121
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,810
That little scumbag.

122
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,009
- Director Kim.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,910
You should escort the prosecutor
back home.

124
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,050
- Yes, sir.
- That's not necessary.

125
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,250
Detective Seo.

126
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,250
I want you to drive me home.

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,289
What? Me?

128
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,190
Hurry up.

129
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,539
We arrived.

130
00:08:54,169 --> 00:08:55,940
- You...
- Yes?

131
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:00,779
You like Father Kim, don't you?

132
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,279
What?

133
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,580
Yes, I like him.

134
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,450
He can be a little peculiar,
but he's very straightforward.

135
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,289
No, that's not what I'm asking.
I'm asking if you like him as a man.

136
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,620
What?

137
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,720
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,929
No, I really don't like him.

139
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,500
Your colleagues might not know since
they're men who are slow-witted.

140
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,929
But I can tell right away.

141
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,799
It's true that I'm close
with Father Kim,

142
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,299
but you're jumping to conclusions.

143
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:25,539
It won't cause a problem for you
since you can always move on,

144
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,340
but if that causes any trouble
to a priest,

145
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,539
his life could get destroyed.

146
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,379
What kind of other jobs
would a priest be able to get?

147
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
Prosecutor Park, I think you have
a misunderstanding. You see...

148
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,549
You should be careful from now on.

149
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,250
If you can't control your feelings,
you should go to a Buddhist temple.

150
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,789
The food is delicious there.
I'll see you, then.

151
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,490
Go on.

152
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:56,830
She's so annoying.

153
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:58,970
I can't believe she knows.

154
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,370
This is so embarrassing.

155
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,179
I think they were just thieves.

156
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:08,909
You should secure your security.

157
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,850
How did they even manage
to break into the house?

158
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,779
Did you find any buggings
or hidden cameras?

159
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,419
We looked for them,
but nothing came out.

160
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,019
Isn't it weird?

161
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,389
I hope they were just thieves.

162
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:23,129
Do you think Superintendent Nam and
Congressman Park were behind this?

163
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,399
Judging by the circumstances,
I don't think it was them.

164
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,299
Anyway, we should still hurry up...

165
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,940
and deal with the two of them.

166
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes, we should.

167
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,139
My friend whom we met
at the hospital last time...

168
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,049
will be conducting
the DNA test for us.

169
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,450
Gosh, that's great.

170
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,990
Can you be more enthusiastic?

171
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,990
Father Kim, we'll keep coming here.

172
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,419
You should take some rest
for a while.

173
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,190
It's okay.

174
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,529
Will you please listen to me?

175
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,330
Why are you so angry?

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,070
She's right.
You should listen to her.

177
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,370
Wait a minute.
Then what am I to you?

178
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,210
Am I your slave or what?

179
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,779
Give me back my plastic bag.

180
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,080
Will you stop it now?

181
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,549
By the way, about the guy
who was wearing glasses earlier...

182
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,190
Do you guys know who he is?

183
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,590
No, but I could tell
that he's Prosecutor Park's boss.

184
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,860
It felt like he was the boss
because his voice was greasy.

185
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't know there was someone
we didn't know in the group.

186
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,570
I'll dig into Prosecutor Park's
department tomorrow.

187
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,240
I could obviously tell
that their group is falling apart.

188
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,610
Chief Jeong, Prosecutor Park's boss,
and Hwang Cheol Bum are on one side.

189
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,980
And Superintendent Nam and
Congressman Park are on the other.

190
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,309
Is that why the prosecution seized
and searched Chief Jeong?

191
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,110
According to what I heard
at the villa,

192
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,350
Superintendent Nam
and Prosecutor Park...

193
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:52,850
were the ones who schemed
the seize and search.

194
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,019
Anyway, it was such a hassle to
return to the villa and deal with...

195
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,159
- Oh, right. Right.
- What?

196
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:06,059
Father Kim, where did you put
the gourd-shaped bottle?

197
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,429
The gourd-shaped bottle?
I put it over there.

198
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,299
Where did it go?

199
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,970
You should have some warm tea.

200
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,049
You guys worked so hard.

201
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,720
Why don't you have a cup of tea?

202
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,690
Where did you get this?

203
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,190
What? This?

204
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,799
Father Kim put it over there
a while ago.

205
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,700
You brought it
so I could use it, right?

206
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,169
No, this is what we stole...

207
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,399
What?

208
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,769
I bought one at Insa-dong because
the design was nice and simple.

209
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,110
How much did it cost?

210
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,710
80,000 dollars.

211
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,179
Eight dollars.

212
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,080
Eight dollars?

213
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,350
- 80,000.
- What?

214
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:00,720
Oh, 18 dollars?

215
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,490
Father Kim really does
have a great eye for...

216
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,090
- Gosh, this is so hot.
- Oh, my gosh!

217
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,899
Goodness, I'm sorry.
It's hot a little bit.

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,799
You guys keep continuing
with your meeting.

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,870
I'll excuse myself now.
Enjoy your tea.

220
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,570
- Rest up.
- Okay.

221
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,389
He seemed somewhat familiar.

222
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:47,159
He seems to be familiar as the candy
I used to eat back in the days.

223
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,139
Gosh, no way. That's impossible.

224
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,340
Goodness, I'm imagining stuff.
It can't be him.

225
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,480
Gosh, no way.

226
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,350
No way.

227
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,690
Gosh, that's nonsense.

228
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,059
My Lord.

229
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,759
I accidentally ended up stealing
from someone's house.

230
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,700
I never planned to steal it,
but that stupid cop...

231
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,000
Gosh, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,440
I must be crazy. I can't believe
I tried to blame it on him.

233
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,879
Today, I did it to achieve justice,

234
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:34,980
so please forgive me just once.

235
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,320
In the name of the Father,
and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

236
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,049
Amen.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,169
This smile means
it is not a big deal, right?

238
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,090
Goodness, look who's here.

239
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,590
(Daebum Trading)

240
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,000
What brings you to this shabby place
so early in the morning?

241
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,970
You're right.
This place really is shabby.

242
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,740
I thought about it, and there's no
occasion for me to drive this car.

243
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,309
I can't be bothered
to drive it either.

244
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,879
Why didn't you tell me? Then
I would've hired a driver for you.

245
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,409
What kind of prosecutor
rides a car...

246
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,779
with a driver that was sent to her
by a gangster?

247
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,379
I told you that
if you don't receive it,

248
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,820
I'll visit you every day.

249
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,289
If I ever see you
roaming my place around again,

250
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,159
I'll get a restraining order
against you.

251
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,629
Hey, you minions in the back.

252
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,340
Won't you iron your foreheads out?

253
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,899
Do you want to die?

254
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,210
Iron your foreheads out and smile.

255
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,649
She is a prosecutor.

256
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,919
You're wrinkly even when you smile.

257
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,889
I'm off.

258
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,590
Ms. Park.

259
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,629
Would you like to
have some calamansi tea?

260
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:29,789
You drink all you want.

261
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,299
Act cheeky all you want
when you can.

262
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,210
I can get this DNA
analyzed right away.

263
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,570
But there's a problem.

264
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,279
Are you worried about sharing
all the information with the NIS?

265
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,210
We're cooperative agencies.

266
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,309
If things go wrong, you could
be exposed to the opponent.

267
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,549
How about going somewhere else?

268
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,190
A close junior of mine
works at D-Lab Corporation.

269
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,350
Go there instead then.

270
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,820
I'll lie that
it's of national importance.

271
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,289
You do that.

272
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,330
Doctor.

273
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,200
Since you don't drink coffee,

274
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,099
I brought you some tea instead.

275
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,500
Thank you.

276
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,569
Could you stop using that bottle?

277
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,440
You must know Father Kim very well.

278
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,940
Yes, kind of.

279
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,349
How long have you known him?

280
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,849
For many years now.

281
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,890
Many years means
you've known him a long time.

282
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,650
- Sister?
- Oh, right.

283
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,089
You know how curious I get.

284
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:35,190
I'll stop.

285
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,730
You look very familiar, Sister.

286
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:41,829
This is hot.

287
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,730
- Me?
- Yes.

288
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,839
I definitely saw you somewhere.

289
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,740
I have a very ordinary face.
You must be confused.

290
00:17:52,009 --> 00:17:55,380
It's too hot for me to handle.
You can pour the tea yourselves.

291
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,710
Get back to your meeting.
I have something to do.

292
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Excuse me.

293
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,890
She looks really familiar.

294
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,319
Ms. Park. What happened to you?

295
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,130
I'll tell when I want to,
so don't ask before I do.

296
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,559
Very well.

297
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,660
Oh, right.

298
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:18,640
I looked into Superintendent Nam
and Congressman Park.

299
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,970
Meaty, aren't they?

300
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,569
If you ignore the fact that they're
superintendent and congressman,

301
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:24,339
they're the worst kind of
dirty scum...

302
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,779
They're bad sirs.

303
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,579
Focus on Congressman Park first.

304
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,180
- To expose him.
- Sure.

305
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,619
What trash.

306
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,019
Ms. Seo, look at what I found
on Congressman Park.

307
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,390
He doesn't feel guilty at all.

308
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,700
He's a total sociopath.

309
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,400
- Is he?
- My gosh.

310
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:51,470
Wow, he really is trash.

311
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,170
Do you know that
you go with a sociopath?

312
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:57,539
There are
many sociopath tests online.

313
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,940
Look one up.

314
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,859
(Sociopath test)

315
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:24,329
"You feel no sense of guilt when..."

316
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,500
it comes to causing harm to others.

317
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,009
I never caused harm.

318
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,440
Let's say yes.

319
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,240
Mr. Hwang's two-story villa
near Mount Youngyu...

320
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,279
got broken into
by two masked thieves.

321
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,950
They stole a gourd-shaped bottle
worth 80,000 dollars.

322
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,519
Did we get any prints?

323
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:43,450
No. They all belonged to
people who work there.

324
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,789
- What about the security cameras?
- No luck on them either.

325
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,190
If I may ask,

326
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,299
why are we investigating a theft?

327
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,099
It happened at Mr. Hwang's villa.

328
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,569
And it's a special larceny.

329
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,269
It's just a theft,
not special larceny.

330
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,140
Was any property damaged?

331
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,599
The second-floor window frame...

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,009
was scrapped this much.

333
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,880
How does that make this
a special larceny?

334
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,380
Wait. Why are you so furious?

335
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,410
You aren't the thief.

336
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,920
- That's right.
- Right.

337
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,710
You'd think I'm the thief.

338
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,980
"You want to hide your ugly side."

339
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,549
Doesn't everyone want to?

340
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,019
(16 out of 16.
You're a complete sociopath!)

341
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,559
Wow, wow. Perfect.

342
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,599
What's going on?

343
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,400
I just did something.

344
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,799
Guess what I scored?

345
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,930
Full marks?

346
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,769
You get nothing but full marks.

347
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,869
Right. I always get full marks.

348
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:12,779
- Bravo!
- Bravo. Bravo.

349
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,779
Well done.

350
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,549
Forget about that.
Go visit Congressman Park's victims.

351
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,019
As you see, Mr. Hwang's villa
and Mount Youngyu's cliff...

352
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,450
are 1.2km apart.

353
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,390
But this route is a hiking trail.

354
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,690
It's full of hikers
from evening to morning,

355
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,759
so they wouldn't have
moved the body this way.

356
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,630
Is there only one trail?

357
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,529
There are others
in the middle of the mountain,

358
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:37,970
but no one is allowed
into this area.

359
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:40,339
It's a wildlife preserve.

360
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Then they went through that area.

361
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,680
Who owns the land?

362
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,039
Gudam-gu owns it.

363
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,779
Then there must be security cameras.

364
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,809
There are, but this area...

365
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,650
is managed by Mr. Hwang's
Daebum Development.

366
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,019
Darn it. Then we'll get nothing.

367
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,359
Then we must go in.

368
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,390
Trespassing is prohibited.

369
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,390
Am I the person who doesn't go in
because it's not allowed?

370
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,160
If they catch you in there,

371
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:06,130
they might notice something's up.

372
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,130
Because it's right after
you robbed the villa yesterday.

373
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,069
In that case,

374
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,569
we'll disguise so they won't
notice even if they catch us.

375
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,210
How?

376
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:50,869
Why do you look like a fraud?

377
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,210
What?

378
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,109
I'm dressed as
a Middle-eastern billionaire.

379
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,049
I should've dressed you up
like a beggar.

380
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,920
They took down all the cameras.

381
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,930
Did they bury corpses here, too?

382
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,099
No way.
What's that movie called? Right.

383
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,369
"The Memoir of a Murderer".
You watched too many of them.

384
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,109
That was a bamboo grove.
Look around.

385
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,369
No cameras. Almost always deserted.

386
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,579
It's a perfect place
for a perfect murder.

387
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,980
I have no clear evidence,

388
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,250
but I'm sure they used
the trails in this area.

389
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,750
Find some sort of clue.

390
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,799
I just saw a white sable.

391
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,700
- What?
- A white sable.

392
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,269
What do you mean? Where?

393
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:52,940
It was definitely a white sable.

394
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,000
Who are you?

395
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,039
Who are you, people?

396
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,279
I came to see the land.
The land full of oil.

397
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:05,880
You're full of charm.

398
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:10,589
Don't you know
you can't trespass or reside here?

399
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:11,819
What?

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Get out of here.

401
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,160
(Daebum Development)

402
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Daebum Development. Let's go.

403
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,329
And you, lady. This is a mountain.

404
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,599
Why are you wearing a short skirt?

405
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,980
None of your business.

406
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,450
You're back.

407
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:44,519
I brought all the depositions
of Congressman Park's victims.

408
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,990
As you said, when I said
we'd be going after him,

409
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,230
they couldn't wait to talk.

410
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,930
See? If you pretend to
risk your life for them,

411
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,359
they'll hand over anything.

412
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,569
That's because no one was
on their side the meantime.

413
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,170
I listened to the tapes short.

414
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,309
The congressman is
radioactive waste of the worst kind.

415
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:06,079
He committed all sorts of crimes,

416
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,849
but he was so shameless.
He's a typical sociopath.

417
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:12,279
Why do you keep saying
"trash" and "sociopath" today?

418
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,480
Why? Why?

419
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,650
Because they are the most
appropriate words to describe him.

420
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,119
How are they appropriate?

421
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,160
You could say twit, jerk, scumbag,
son of a witch, and a nitwit.

422
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,000
I apologize.

423
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,849
So are you going to investigate on
Congressman Park from today?

424
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,920
Yes, he's too corrupt that
it'd be easiest to attack him.

425
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,349
If I find a fault or two,
I think it'd be easier...

426
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:49,619
to take him down than
Ms. Jeong or Wangmat Foods.

427
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,690
I know. He's total trash.

428
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:53,589
It's just that no one touches him.

429
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:04,569
By the way, how long are you
going to stay ambiguously like that?

430
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:06,900
You're on neither side.

431
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:11,880
Don't you want to
go back to the beginning?

432
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,410
How did you know that?

433
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,549
I've never mentioned it to you.

434
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:19,250
Stop thinking anymore,
and let's move on.

435
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,849
I can't wait for long.

436
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,750
Please leave me alone for a while.
I need more time to think.

437
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,059
Is there any reason
you can't go back?

438
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:29,960
Do they have something on you?

439
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,700
It's nothing like that.
I'll tell you later.

440
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,690
Detective Seo found out
who Ms. Park's boss is.

441
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,490
(Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae)

442
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,990
(From Detective Seo)

443
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:07,400
It's Congressman Park and Mr. Nam...

444
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,299
who messed with
Supreme Prosecutors' Office, right?

445
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,200
Yes, they got help
from two other people.

446
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,170
Prosecutor Park Sun Hyuk
from Supreme Prosecutors' Office...

447
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,470
and the head of
Taehan Party, Mr. Lee...

448
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,940
went to the same college.

449
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,539
Mr. Lee of Taehan Party
and Congressman Park...

450
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,839
are from the same hometown.

451
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,380
I knew it.

452
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,710
They messed up with me
with their stupid brains?

453
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,549
There's a photo of them
doing some dirty stuff.

454
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,690
I think this can make...

455
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,690
Mr. Park and Mr. Lee
surrender themselves to you.

456
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,289
Those pathetic men.

457
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:41,529
Oh, did you look into
the priest's identity?

458
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,940
I couldn't look into him...

459
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,769
because I was too busy with work.
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,869
I'll look into him soon.

461
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,809
You better hurry up.

462
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,809
There's one more thing
you need to do for me right away.

463
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:16,099
The offender just
ignored the victim.

464
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,769
Oh, my gosh.
Your nose looks perfectly fine.

465
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:25,180
- I should headbutt...
- It's not over yet.

466
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,180
I'll get a medical certificate
and sue you.

467
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,710
Sure. Anytime.

468
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:41,720
Father, glare at me
as if you want to kill me.

469
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,190
- What are you doing?
- Hurry up!

470
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,299
Just like how you usually do,
glare at me with much anger.

471
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,799
I asked what you were doing.

472
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,700
This is the face.
