1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,970
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:38,579
You made it.

3
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:56,390
I visited her
and brought her myself.

4
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,229
I think this is the best option
to make a deal with you.

5
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,540
Did you bring the passport?

6
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Here.

7
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:14,879
It's your passport to the abyss.

8
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,450
(Passport)

9
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,049
Take it if you can.

10
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,719
You must've
brought yours too, right?

11
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,950
Why are you doing this to me?

12
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,680
Why?

13
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:53,819
Because you're really annoying.

14
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,890
Hae Il.

15
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,159
You know who had the most kills
in our unit, right?

16
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,329
It was you.

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,659
You were already number one
even without those 11 kids.

18
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,870
Do you even know how many rewards
you got for having killed people?

19
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,939
You used to be a brutal jerk,

20
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,409
but you suddenly started
acting like a saint,

21
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,039
criticized me for doing what I do,
and beat me up into a pulp.

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,039
I mean, think about it.
It's really annoying.

23
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,750
The kids weren't our enemies.

24
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:29,389
Yes, you're right.

25
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,060
But you killed dozens of people
without even flinching.

26
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,060
So it just seemed really pretentious
when you started crying...

27
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,430
over having killed only 11 kids.

28
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,669
Gosh, you're really talkative.

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,840
Keep it short.

30
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:45,969
Hae Il.

31
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,909
Our ill-fated relationship
will end here.

32
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,110
Starting from this moment on,

33
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,580
don't even think about
asking me for mercy.

34
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,849
Because I'm no longer a priest.

35
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,759
Hey.

36
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,430
Go on.

37
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,370
Hae Il!

38
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,449
Joong Kwon...

39
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,120
Father Kim!

40
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,230
We'll never blame you...

41
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,629
even if they kill all of us!

42
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:28,800
So pull yourself together
and fight with confidence!

43
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,500
Just a second.

44
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,730
Hey.

45
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,329
I kind of expected this to happen,
but I am a little dumbfounded.

46
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:19,819
Our relationship
really isn't easy, is it?

47
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,420
So let's just put an end to it.

48
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,829
I came with just one bullet.

49
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,910
Hurry! Come on!

50
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,079
If there's only one bullet,

51
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,850
you'd better shoot me properly.

52
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,660
Father Michael, don't do that.

53
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,329
Don't.

54
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,569
- Father Kim!
- Father.

55
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,750
Father!

56
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,550
You... You shouldn't do this.

57
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,579
Sister Kim.

58
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,420
Father, you don't need to do this.

59
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,129
We already caught him.

60
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,360
Hurry up and shoot me.

61
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,500
It's what you do best.

62
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,699
Shut it, you jerk!

63
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,670
Even if you kill me,
it'll be considered self-defense.

64
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,240
So you won't go to jail.

65
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,670
You can kill me...

66
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,740
and become a killing machine again
just like the old days.

67
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,449
You'll be able to make good money.

68
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,850
Father Kim, look at me. Look at me.

69
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,889
I'm a prosecutor.
You have to trust me.

70
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,189
I'll do whatever I can to make
this jerk rot in jail forever.

71
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,290
Father Kim, I'll shoot him instead.

72
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm... I'm a detective.

73
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,269
Hey, Hae Il.

74
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,839
You and I are no different.

75
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,709
Why are you making it
so hard on yourself?

76
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,110
Just hurry up and shoot me.

77
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,149
Let's put an end to this.

78
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,960
Father Kim.

79
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,690
He's not worth it.

80
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,360
Why would you quit being a priest
for a guy like him?

81
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,769
She's right, Father Kim.
You belong in the church!

82
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,440
You can smack me around
all the time.

83
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,370
Let's keep working together
like we used to. Please?

84
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,039
They are all your people, Father.

85
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,679
They are on your side,

86
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,950
and they were saved through you.

87
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,590
You just have to save yourself.

88
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,299
There's no salvation.

89
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,870
Shoot. Kill me.

90
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,529
Kill me, you rat.

91
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:28,169
Kill me. Kill me, you rat!

92
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:53,159
"I..."

93
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,440
"tell you,"

94
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,639
"Not seven times,"

95
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,679
"but 77 times."

96
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,220
I must forgive you.

97
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:45,049
Thank you, Lord.

98
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,629
Call for backup and an ambulance,
and tie up the rats.

99
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,860
Yes, sir!

100
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,299
You did the right thing. You did.

101
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,710
That's right.

102
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,789
- BP.
- 109 over 71.

103
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,629
Give him NS for now,

104
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,590
and check his BP every two hours.

105
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,960
Yes, doctor.

106
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:49,210
Goodness. Look at you.
You're a total wreck.

107
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,120
Gosh.

108
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,649
I'm fine.

109
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,090
Father, why don't you just
change your name?

110
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,820
Rather than Kim Tsunami,

111
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:02,690
how about Kim Pond or Kim Reservoir?

112
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,159
Seriously.

113
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,470
Finally, I get to see you smile.

114
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,070
Did you mean it?

115
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,840
What?

116
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,240
That the evil in this world
has no eyes or ears.

117
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:17,070
You listened to my message.

118
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,809
Do you really think everything
happening around me is by chance?

119
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,080
Of course.

120
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,480
It doesn't come only to me,

121
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,019
it comes to me at times as well.

122
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,330
I thought the Lord was always
testing me.

123
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,230
But not today.
It didn't feel that way.

124
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,940
He wasn't testing me,

125
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,639
he was watching with bated breath
for me to overcome it by my will.

126
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,039
That's how I felt.

127
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:55,250
I don't think the Lord will
watch with bated breath anymore.

128
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:05,159
How's Sister Kim?

129
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,090
I put her in the car
so she can rest.

130
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,289
She's about to faint.

131
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sure.

132
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,529
It's only natural
after what she's been through.

133
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,610
Hey.

134
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,679
Why is that lowlife smiling
while he's being taken away?

135
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,049
Look at him glare at us
until the very end.

136
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,409
It's okay. It was self defense.

137
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,710
Darn it.

138
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,330
Lord.

139
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,000
Please shine Your light
on this soul.

140
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,669
Please do not look at his sins,
and show him mercy.

141
00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:09,450
Since You teach Your ways
to evildoers,

142
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,919
sinners shall return to You.

143
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:18,889
Amen.

144
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,100
How did it go?

145
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,570
There was an incident,

146
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,610
so all the passport brokers
are closed.

147
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,240
Gosh. Darn it.

148
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,279
What timing.

149
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,409
Should I look in China and Japan?

150
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,980
No, it's okay.

151
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,250
I'm not going to flee the country.
It'll be a disgrace.

152
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,330
Given what it is, let's settle
the score with Lee Joong Kwon.

153
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,659
Are you gathering the boys?

154
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:58,929
Yes.

155
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:01,669
If I can't go anywhere,

156
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,100
I should return the favor.

157
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,669
Seong Kyu.

158
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,809
You're okay, right?

159
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,779
You'll wake up, right?

160
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,549
I won't go anywhere until you do.

161
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,340
I'll leave once I hear you
say my name...

162
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,970
one more time,

163
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,649
so wake up.

164
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,990
Yo Han, what are you doing?

165
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,630
Hello. I'm feeling
the gravitational pull.

166
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,430
Feeling what?

167
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,539
I haven't told you this before,

168
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,869
but my body changed
strangely after that day.

169
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,740
"After that day"?

170
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:21,079
Baozi. Go with me.

171
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,650
The moment I was hit on the spine,
I felt like a shock.

172
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,789
And a few days later,

173
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,819
I had a dream about stars...

174
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,119
and sweat buckets.

175
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,490
Are you sure you're not sick?

176
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,759
I'm healthy.

177
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
And ever since I stopped sweating,
I was able to feel it.

178
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,400
Whenever the moon is out,
I feel a pulling sensation.

179
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:49,569
If an apple falls next to me,
I feel a tiny flow of the air.

180
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,940
I should keep listening,
shouldn't I?

181
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,009
Yes. That isn't all.

182
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,910
When I look at the sky,

183
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,150
I see the movement of the stars.

184
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,720
To be more precise,

185
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,519
I see the movement of the stars
resulting from the earth's rotation.

186
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
It's insane. It's like CGI.

187
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:11,829
I saw
a new movement last week, so...

188
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,829
I even emailed NASA.

189
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,000
NASA?

190
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,039
The National Aeronautics
and Space Administration?

191
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,069
Yes.

192
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:22,109
You're not asking for compensation
for getting hurt because of me...

193
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,680
and I'm totally not getting it,
right?

194
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,839
No. How could you say that?

195
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:30,380
It's because it's such
a mystical concept.

196
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,779
Sure, you always were
a mystical kid.

197
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,450
Okay. Keep feeling it.

198
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,089
I'll let you feel it some more. Bye.

199
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,259
Good night.

200
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,859
Look! It's moving again! Awesome.

201
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,670
He sure is weird.

202
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,809
I should report this to NASA. Okay!

203
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,240
Priest Lee at a church
in Gudam, Seoul was known...

204
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,079
to have killed himself...

205
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,509
due to the stress from
the police investigation into...

206
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,009
his involvement in the embezzlement
of funds and sexual harrassment.

207
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,579
However, it's now been revealed...

208
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,779
that those in corrupt power
and a chief prosecutor...

209
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:09,819
are responsible
for the death of Priest Lee.

210
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,289
- Also the police will question...
- Yes!

211
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,059
- the witnesses.
- Awesome!

212
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:17,160
According to the police,

213
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,900
those in corrupt power
and the chief prosecutor...

214
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,730
were going to establish
a foundation to launder money.

215
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,400
They committed a crime
as they were pressuring...

216
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,039
Priest Lee who was running
local welfare facilities.

217
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:31,910
The police are investigating
to find out...

218
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,079
the culprit who actually
committed the murder.

219
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,250
Father.

220
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,690
It's over now.

221
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,059
You can rest in peace now.

222
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,480
You can't.

223
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,190
How can you leave
when everything is over?

224
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,490
As I was reinvestigating
Father Lee's case,

225
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,759
I've violated many things
as a priest.

226
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,069
I don't deserve to be
a priest anymore.

227
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,369
That's...

228
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,210
You were just trying to defeat
the group of demons...

229
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,210
Sister.

230
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,809
I've become one of them...

231
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,049
on the excuse of defeating demons.

232
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,480
Father Kim.

233
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,490
I will fulfill my place as a priest
until Father Han wakes up.

234
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,059
And when Father Han returns,

235
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,690
I will resign from my post.

236
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:03,000
Please keep this secret
from other people.

237
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,420
(Prosecutor Choi Jin Chul)

238
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,130
There are not enough reasons
to apply for an arrest warrant.

239
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,829
And it's almost impossible
to destroy the evidence.

240
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,339
The court also questions...

241
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,869
your reliability.

242
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,910
Hey, Prosecutor Park.

243
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:45,279
Did you expect me to apologize
when you reported to the press...

244
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,539
without checking
the fact thoroughly?

245
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,680
Did you really think
I was going to be intimidated?

246
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,549
You idiot.

247
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,480
You use such swallow tricks.

248
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,349
Is it really everything
that you learned from me?

249
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,829
You'll need all the luck to win even
with the best lawyers in Korea.

250
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,799
You seem very confident now that
you're backed...

251
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,660
by a decent law firm
that Hanjoo Group provided you.

252
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,130
What a pity.

253
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,670
How long do you think you will
receive help from...

254
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:15,369
those trustworthy lawyers?

255
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,650
The chairman of Hanjoo Group
Kim Joong Chul's son...

256
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,920
Kim Keon Yong's audio recording
of contracting a murder...

257
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,589
at the Rising Moon
has been obtained.

258
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:33,059
What timing!

259
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,890
"I need you to murder
this female prosecutor".

260
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,259
"Her name is Park Kyeong Seon".

261
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,230
"She lives in Gudam".

262
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,569
"Make it look like she got robbed".

263
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,670
"How much do I have to pay you?"

264
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,970
Where did you get...

265
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,609
The following is an interview...

266
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:50,210
of Prosecutor Park who
escaped from a murder.

267
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,440
When I think about that time...

268
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,410
How can someone try to murder
Korea's prosecutor like that?

269
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,079
Am I a cockroach or what?

270
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,380
(An interview of Prosector Park
from Prosecutor's Office)

271
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,119
I'm still suffering
from that trauma.

272
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,589
I can't even sleep at night.

273
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,589
Oh, my.

274
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,559
My goodness.

275
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,130
It's coming, it's coming.

276
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,670
I'm shocked!

277
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,140
Do you want me to go on?

278
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,940
- Yes?
- Yes, it's me.

279
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,009
Lawyer Yeo!

280
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,210
- Lawyer Jang.
- Yes, I heard.

281
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,180
My goodness. What should we do?

282
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,450
I guess I have just broken
your last hope.

283
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,960
But what are you going to do?

284
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,190
The real game starts now.

285
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,799
I'll arrest you without a warrant
on the suspicion of...

286
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,259
murdering Father Lee Young Jun.

287
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,869
- What?
- Come on in.

288
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,109
How come a fugitive criminal
looks so well?

289
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,309
I will nicely put handcuffs on you.

290
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,349
You! Get out!

291
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,559
Now, tell me.

292
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,990
You pushed Father Lee Young Jun
and killed him, right?

293
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:18,660
Hey, go bring me a cup of coffee.

294
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,829
I will start to talk
when my lawyer gets here.

295
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,769
They all came and left
just a while ago.

296
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,799
I know that you don't have
any more lawyers to call.

297
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:30,410
You talk so impudently.

298
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,339
I have a lawyer.

299
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,480
You are going to be
in serious trouble.

300
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,349
You...

301
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:44,019
Don't you even dare to
lay a finger on me.

302
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,859
What did I tell you?
It's almost over.

303
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,099
It's not over just yet.

304
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,200
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

305
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,099
But I will keep this in mind
and double up your sin.

306
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,180
What a shame. I don't know anything.

307
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,549
You should try harder.

308
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,150
His attitude makes me speechless.

309
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,259
Even if we were to make him
go through a cross-examination...

310
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:20,589
with Hwang Cheol Bum,
that won't be of any help.

311
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:22,759
"Are you the culprit"?

312
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,529
"No, I'm not". I can totally
picture this in my mind.

313
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,230
Even if we find Hwang Cheol Bum,
nothing is going to change.

314
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,369
But we should still capture him...

315
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,339
and make them face each other.

316
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,309
Where in the world is
Hwang Cheol Bum?

317
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:40,210
The death of Lee Joong Kwon
hasn't been reported yet, is it?

318
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:43,410
No, we didn't make it official.

319
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,759
Are you sure about
Lee Joong Kwon's location?

320
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,930
Yes, I checked it with
Mullae-dong Night Mole.

321
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,559
Stay focused.

322
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,130
Are you sure
you are okay without me?

323
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,640
Yes, we will catch him on our own.

324
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,309
We've got to take our revenge.

325
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,240
All right.

326
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,140
Call me if anything bad happens.
I'll be right there.

327
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,710
Be careful.

328
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,549
Father, take a look at this.

329
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,789
The forensic investigators
found this under...

330
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,589
the passenger seat
in Lee Joong Kwon's car.

331
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,190
It looks like a hidden camera.

332
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,460
Yes, there were all types.

333
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,660
He had a micro-sized
button-like camera.

334
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:37,500
I think he used the memory stick
to back up files.

335
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,740
Lee Joong Kwon, this punk...

336
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,279
What is this?
How come there's no one here?

337
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,279
We are here.

338
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,890
My goodness.

339
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:04,690
This sense of foreboding
is never wrong.

340
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,660
I walked into a trap.

341
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,700
We figured that you regularly
contact Mullae-dong Night Mole.

342
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,500
Come with us, Mr. Hwang.

343
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:15,970
There is no Father Kim.

344
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,940
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

345
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,210
Can the five of you handle me?

346
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,549
We are going to get our revenge
for Young Cheon.

347
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,180
And for our old dark days.

348
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,750
Let's call up all debt.

349
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,190
My goodness. That's ridiculous.

350
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
All right.

351
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,430
Bring it on.

352
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:57,809
Take this!

353
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,779
You jerk!

354
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,269
I really didn't want to come today,

355
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,339
but I couldn't stay away.

356
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,450
I had to see what garbage
you people pulled.

357
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:07,150
Kang Seok Tae.
Watch with your eyes peeled.

358
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,759
This is...

359
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,630
How dare you...

360
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,470
Lee Joong Kwon suspects everyone,

361
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,140
so he always brings spy cameras
when meeting people like you.

362
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,140
In glasses, watch, button,
things like that.

363
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,369
It's the best insurance.

364
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,079
But that day, he had hidden
a spy camera in his button.

365
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,720
Don't laugh.

366
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:44,519
Your crime of moving the body
is huge too.

367
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,359
I'll accept my punishment gladly.

368
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:52,329
But you should admit to your
involvement in Father Lee's case.

369
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:55,170
Of course. Did you think
I'd save only myself?

370
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,700
Are you serious?

371
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,740
Yes. I calculated the total sentence
for my crimes...

372
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,509
and wrote it all down.

373
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,039
Once things are settled,
I'll take it myself...

374
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,309
to the investigators at
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

375
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,079
It's good to repent, but...

376
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,819
Will you really go to jail?

377
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,990
Yes.

378
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,119
I calculated my sentence,
and I'm pretty much done for.

379
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,960
I thought you'd retire and
become a lawyer or...

380
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,329
something like that.

381
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:29,069
No, no.

382
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:31,700
That isn't repentance.
That's a career change.

383
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,400
Well, I guess.

384
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,309
You're the one who yelled
at me before to pay for my sins.

385
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,410
You know I have super
reincarnation powers.

386
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,619
Phoenix Seon! Seon! Seon!

387
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,849
I'll go now.
