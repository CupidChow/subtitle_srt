00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,410
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,209
It's buy 2 get 1 free.

3
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:09,150
- Just check out.
- All right.

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,189
This is buy 1 get 1 free.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,920
I told you to just check out.

6
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:17,989
Okay.

7
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:25,160
Why don't you speak down
like you always have?

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,429
Never mind.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,329
You're 27. You're no longer a kid.

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,070
We're not even close.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:33,299
You live in this building,
and you're a regular.

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,740
You have the right to do that.

13
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,670
I won't speak down to you!

14
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,439
Okay, suit yourself.

15
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,329
She's so unpredictable.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,530
She has the charms of
making me nervous every day.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,239
Yo Han!

18
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,239
- Did you get off work?
- Yes.

19
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,709
Let's have this.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,540
- What's that?
- Follow me.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,609
The chef made...

22
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:15,750
tangsuyuk for me to have.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,150
Why did you pour the sauce?
It's not what I want.

24
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,120
Just pig out on it.
You complain so much.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,620
"Pig out"? Where did you
learn such language?

26
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,290
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,590
Pig out on it a lot.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
It's so good.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,799
That plushie...

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,379
It was on the street,
so I picked it up.

31
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,019
I told her how the witnesses
were taken away.

32
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,689
How could such a thing happen
in a constitutional country?

33
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,590
They take away
the welfare facilities...

34
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,629
and kidnap people in broad daylight.

35
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,560
As far as know,
Gudam is not constitutional.

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,329
It's governed by Satans.

37
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,800
If Father Lee were alive,

38
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,169
they wouldn't have gone this far.

39
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:16,009
He'd be extremely sad if he had
seen what's been going on.

40
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,800
Many are suspecting that the
investigation on Kim Keon Yong,

41
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,569
the son of Hanjoo Group's CEO
Kim Joong Chul,

42
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,969
has been lenient.

43
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,479
It seems setbacks
in the investigation is inevitable.

44
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,879
Especially the prosecutor
in charge of this case,

45
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,449
Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon
of Seoul Central District...

46
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:05,020
You're going through a lot
these days, right?

47
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,860
I saw you on TV, Sister.

48
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,400
Right, you must've seen me.

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,169
You should live like God,

50
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,969
not as a daughter of God.

51
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,099
- I should?
- Yes.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,009
It's because you're doing
something similar to what God does.

53
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:31,780
It's a lot different from
what God does, Father.

54
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,250
It's very different.

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,370
Can I have a cigarette?

56
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,469
Oh, no. That was the last one.

57
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,280
I was going to get one from you.

58
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,849
I thought you quit smoking.

59
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,180
I did,

60
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,990
but I wanted one so badly today.

61
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,659
I think Father Lee
stopped me from smoking.

62
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,759
During my prayer time,

63
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,500
I threw a fit to God for the first
time as a priest. It was rude of me.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,269
That's nothing.

65
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,339
I throw a fit every minute.

66
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,949
Staying with me is exhausting,
isn't it?

67
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,279
Not at all.

68
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,350
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't
have been able to do anything.

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,420
You must be exhausted.

70
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,290
I go here and there
and get angry at people.

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,589
That's who you are.

72
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,660
Father Lee told me this.

73
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
He said having love and mercy...

74
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,139
is accepting
the person as who he is.

75
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,639
But accepting doesn't
change anything.

76
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,439
But I'll follow...

77
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,649
Father Lee's path.

78
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,550
This is what I want to do.

79
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,410
Dae Young, let's wear one each.

80
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,050
I bought two at a very high price.

81
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,420
Hey, what are we, lovers?

82
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,620
I can't wear it.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,420
God must protect us,
so that we can be safe.

84
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,089
Here. Wear it.

85
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,100
Young Cheon, wake up!

86
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,470
Young Cheon, we're here.

87
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,209
Young Cheon, no.

88
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,220
Young Cheon.

89
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:23,689
You can't die, you fool.

90
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:55,089
Young Cheon.

91
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,759
Detective Lee. It's me.

92
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,060
Is it tough being on a lower shelf?

93
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,540
Hang in there.

94
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,740
Once I save up,

95
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,569
I'll move you to the royal floor.

96
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,339
(Lee Young Cheon)

97
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,110
I've been okay the past year.

98
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,480
Like you said,

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,949
I'm not dead,

100
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,519
and I'm healthy.

101
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,060
My body's fine and all,

102
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,500
but everything else blows.

103
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:52,480
But what can I do?

104
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,949
I must live as you wished.

105
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:05,490
Young Cheon.

106
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,430
Don't worry about
your wife or Seo Joon.

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,629
Rest in peace.

108
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,000
In peace.

109
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:04,149
How do I get to the back door
from the east gate?

110
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,990
(CEO Hwang Cheol Bum)

111
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,059
Shouldn't you have
better control on your minion?

112
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,659
It's not about control.

113
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,730
Each detective has their own style.

114
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,070
There's no way the priest knew.

115
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,240
Who's her informant?

116
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,240
Who sent her to the French village?

117
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,039
She won't tell me.

118
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,009
What kind of senior are you?
That's embarrassing.

119
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,210
It's not about ego or face.

120
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,110
There are rules between partners.

121
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,980
Rules are a joke.

122
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,149
Ask me. I'll make her confess...

123
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:42,149
Mr. Jang.

124
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,090
Mr. Hwang's talking.

125
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,490
No.

126
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:52,600
We're on the same page.

127
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,539
Shall I bring her in and ask?

128
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
Your partner, I mean.

129
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,240
No, no. I'll find out.

130
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,840
If you can't,

131
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,750
I will question her myself.

132
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,919
Okay, Dae Young?

133
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,389
Give me that.

134
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,759
Isn't it the anniversary of
your old partner's death?

135
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,559
Valentine's Day, right?

136
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,200
His kid is in school now, isn't he?

137
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,840
Give that to his mom.

138
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,309
No thanks. Goodbye.

139
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,279
Take it with you.

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,549
Dae Young.

141
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,789
He has some pride left?

142
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,269
Goodbye.

143
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,870
I don't remember...

144
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,909
you disappointing me
these many times in a row.

145
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,580
I apologize.

146
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,049
Drop the Nonhyeon-dong meth case.

147
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,679
It's going to Prosecutor Nam.

148
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:20,649
Prosecutor Nam?

149
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,120
Your senior whom we met for a drink.

150
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,860
Your senior in college
but junior from the institute.

151
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,330
Sir.

152
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,100
It was my case. Let me close it.

153
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,159
Come in.

154
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
- I'll come back later.
- No, no, it's fine.

155
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,539
- Come in and sit down.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,639
What were you saying?

157
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,820
I will keep the case and wrap it up.

158
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,879
Ms. Park.

159
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,789
Don't you know
the director's furious?

160
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,860
And you want to keep the case
and wrap it up?

161
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,129
- Mr. Nam.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,659
The Nonhyeon-dong
methamphetamine case.

163
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:06,299
You wrap it up.

164
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,500
I will do so and strategically.

165
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,870
Oh, and that priest.

166
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,210
What should we do with him?

167
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,080
That's why I told you to...

168
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,950
He's like a mosquito
on a fall night.

169
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,679
One that buzzes by your head
when you're trying to sleep.

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,850
Unlike summer mosquitoes,

171
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,389
they've been through harsh weathers
and are very hard to kill.

172
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,559
I'll take him out properly and soon.

173
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,129
That mosquito found
where the witnesses were.

174
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,070
You can't just let him be.

175
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,399
Yes, sir. I'll find out
how he got the information.

176
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,399
Yes. Find that out first,

177
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,570
and help me sooth my fury, okay?

178
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,379
- How about a drink?
- Sure.

179
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,750
Sounds good.

180
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,149
How far do you hit these days?

181
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,850
Not that far.

182
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,759
Why are you still there?

183
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,460
Ms. Park.

184
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,799
Be strategic, okay? Strategic.

(Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae)

186
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,879
Why you... You little... Tiny...

187
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,620
I'll just...

188
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:40,120
That's unbelievable.

189
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,870
- Hello?
- It's Detective Seo.

190
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
Why the sudden call?

191
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,840
I think you should come over here.

192
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,049
We have to find them.

193
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,220
They're both in debt.

194
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,889
They were definitely bought.

195
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,460
Is there a record of the transfer?

196
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:16,960
They must've been given cash.

197
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,629
Who would transfer that much?

198
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,500
Fine. Let's say there's a problem.

199
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,169
How can we find them?

200
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,340
We can ask Interpol.

201
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,370
Interpol?

202
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,840
Hello, sir.

203
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,840
Interpol, my foot.

204
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,840
Interpol and the Pope.

205
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,750
It sounds like you're after
a Colombian drug cartel.

206
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,679
Sir, the circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

207
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,019
Isn't it, Dae Young?

208
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,259
Circumstantial evidence
is about how you interpret it.

209
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,960
Why would you make...

210
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,029
such courageous witnesses
look so bad?

211
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
I'm not making it up. It's a fact.

212
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,370
A fact?

213
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,169
The fact is that...

214
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:58,370
the prosecution had them
in witness protection.

215
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,539
You clueless fool just got involved.

216
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,340
Witness protection?
We have that too?

217
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,610
Oh, we're testing the system out.

218
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,610
What about the Russian thugs
who attacked me?

219
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,980
That was clearly a terrorist attack.

220
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,850
I heard it was just
a misunderstanding which led to...

221
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,019
a skirmish while trying to
protect the witnesses.

222
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,419
You're the one
who should apologize to them.

223
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,590
Sir.

224
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,570
The tone of laughter changed.

225
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,299
What does that laugh mean?

226
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,240
I'm tearing up.

227
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,409
Witness protection?

228
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,179
What channel is that show on?

(Violent Crimes Team 2)

230
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,490
This means nothing
and isn't funny either.

231
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,389
Father, don't go out of line today.

232
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,629
He just left today.

233
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,200
Wait. He wouldn't just leave.

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,169
(Criminal Division)

235
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,740
Wait, wait, no, not that.

236
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:27,690
You smashed it again.

237
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,129
We got this yesterday.

238
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:31,929
Order another one.

239
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,070
How about I set up
a punching machine...

240
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,269
in the middle of the hallway?

241
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,700
For you to punch as you come and go?

242
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,909
Yes, that would be fine.

243
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:44,110
A coin-operated one.

244
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,320
He's so weird.

245
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,820
That priest...

246
00:16:56,789 --> 00:16:59,860
is not normal at all.

247
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
He broke it again.

248
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,190
Master.

249
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,230

255
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,680
You sing so well.

256
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,819
I promise you that when you grow up,

257
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,980
you'll be adults.

258
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,289
Listen up, kids.

259
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,500
A month from now,
I will look after you.

260
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,599
What are you talking about?

261
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,769
You'll get the official notice soon.

262
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:24,009
Then what will happen to
the head nun?

263
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,509
Your head nun will go
somewhere else,

264
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:31,009
and I will take care
of you afterwards.

265
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,720
No. You look mean.

266
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,420
Now, now, calm down, kids.

267
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,460
We have presents for you.
Hand them out.

268
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,460
- Okay.
- No.

269
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,230
Gudam Church is still in charge.

270
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,930
I can't accept this.

271
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,230
Kids, say no. You can't take those.

272
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,769
Let them keep them. They like them.

273
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,170
Don't you, kids?

274
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,069
Please leave.
Don't come here until...

275
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,039
everything's been made official.

276
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,880
You still have a lot to learn
seeing that...

277
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,450
you're so full of anger.

278
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,589
When you're so pretty.

279
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,960
Now, kids.

280
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,759
Will you sing after me?

281
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,160
Daddy bear says, "Ukha."

282

Mommy bear says, "Ukha."

283

Stop it!

284
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,099
Don't do that.

285
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,940
Why don't you have a go?

286
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,339
Get out. Get out of here.

287
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,779
Hey. My goodness.

288
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,380
- Leave.
- Ukha.

289
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,150
Ukha.

290
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,609
Why do you keep following me?

291
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,150
It's my duty to stay
with you until dusk.

292
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,119
Dusk?

293
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,619
The sun will set soon. Just go home.

294
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,359
Soon? I could get a tan in this sun.

295
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,559
Don't come in here.

296
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,029
How dare you step foot in here?
You have no right.

297
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,130
Don't come in.

298
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,230
Do you do exorcisms
on normal people now?

299
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,900
Father.

300
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,809
That's what
the Maegakgyo leader said.

301
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:10,910
Dear God.

302
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,279
- Did he really say that?
- Yes.

303
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,849
He said it would be
made official soon.

304
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:21,049
- Maegakgyo is...
- It's a religious cult.

305
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,289
What should we do?
They do Satan's work.

306
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,359
Maegakgyo is the one group
we can't lose to.

307
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:27,690
That cult can't do good.

308
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,130
We have religious freedom.

309
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,359
Being narrow-minded...

310
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,200
Even so, we can't
let them take over!

311
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,730
How dare you sit there
and talk nonsense?

312
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,500
You people are angry in general.

313
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,299
They say you can lose weight
or shrink your face with prayer,

314
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,569
or even win the lottery.

315
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,779
They're just
a nonsensical group of people.

316
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,009
That's not all.

317
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,710
They take their devotees' money...

318
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,180
and put on a show.

319
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,519
If anyone shows doubt,
they resort to violence.

320
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,180
Let's check first.

321
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,450
Check what? What will you check?

322
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:58,119
If they deserve to
run the orphanage.

323
00:21:58,119 --> 00:21:59,720
Why would you even check?

324
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,490
It's a famous religious cult.
Forgive me for blabbing, Father.

325
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,730
I'll see how famous they are.

326
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,000
- Stay here.
- Maegakgyo's a bit unique,

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,829
but they aren't weird.

328
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,400
Who said you could be here?

329
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,170
You exorcised me earlier.

330
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,210
While mumbling some weird words.

331
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,079
Hello, I'm Seo Seung Ah
from Gudam Police Station.

332
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,579
I quite like your style.

333
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,990
I wanted to ask you something.

334
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:31,690
Ask away.

335
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,660
The witnesses
who exposed Father Lee.

336
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,000
They were at
Gapyeong's French village.

337
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,500
How did you find that out?

338
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,099
I had a source.

339
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,539
I can tell when someone's lying.

340
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,410
I'm an expert.

341
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,809
Tell the truth.

342
00:22:57,579 --> 00:22:59,380
I found out from a source.

343
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,079
Detective Seo.

344
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,890
How dare you talk back at me?

345
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,190
Tell the truth.

346
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,059
(Republic of Umbaga makes
Maegakgyo their national religion.)

347
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,230
While I was at it,

348
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,140
I went around all the orphanages.

349
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,099
And bought the kids' affection.

350
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,339
Do you buy the affection of
adults and kids alike?

351
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:30,150
Enlightenment is more efficient
once people are open-minded.

352
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,150
I wonder...

353
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,019
when the announcement will be made.

354
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:36,819
Very soon.

355
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,519
Then you just say thank you...

356
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,359
and accept it.

357
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,859
And pick out
a few smart hard-workers.

358
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,500
To maintain the foundation...

359
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,700
we'll make soon.

360
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:50,400
Don't worry, don't worry.

361
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,299
I'll pick out a few.

362
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,140
How about some octopus soup?

363
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,309
Why now, when it's my prayer time?

364
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,380
How much must you take
from your flock on a weekday?

365
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,809
What will you do today?

366
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,150
Today, I'll do something
that looks a bit serious.

367
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:10,390
Without any techniques.

368
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,519
Shall I come and watch then?

369
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,990
Let's see how you
dupe your followers.

370
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:18,859
Ukha.

371
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,299
(Maegakgyo Main Church)

372
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:28,099
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

373
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,880
Everyone. Our master is here.

374
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,410
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

375
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,390
Many who are sick in body
and spirit are here today.

376
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,289
Why are you sick?

377
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:52,599
Why are you sick?

378
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,759
Ukha.

379
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,599
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

380
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,539
Our master's enlightenment...

381
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:02,240
will clean your blood.

382
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:12,180
- Where are you injured?
- My leg.

383
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,450
Your leg hurts?

384
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,950
We shall pray.

385
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,759
Ukha!

386
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,630
- "Ukha"?
- Drop the crutches and walk.

387
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,240
Walk!

388
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,279
My enlightenment will
flow into you...

389
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,190
Some kind of energy made
my shoulders feel much lighter.

390
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,519
My limbs feel much looser.

391
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,289
Ukha!

392
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,559
Ukha!

393
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,759
What a cult.

394
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,970
You can't say that
about another religion.

395
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:07,069
- My gosh.
- She has been healed!

396
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,740
- Ukha!
- Ukha!

397
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,410
There he is! The priest is here!

398
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,009
- The priest is here.
- The priest is here.

399
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,480
He neglected his own God...

400
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,180
and came to our savior.

401
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,289
- He's here!
- He's here!

402
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,190
- He's here!
- Welcome!

403
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,259
- Welcome, Father!
- Hello!

404
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:28,390
- Welcome, Father!
- He's not a priest.

405
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,890
He's not a priest!
He's just doing a costume play!

406
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,829
- He's not a priest!
- Father!

407
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,299
Calm down!

408
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,000
Father, please pay your offertory
and get your rice cake.

409
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,500
It's a rice cake of enlightenment.

410
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,470
Here, pay your offertory
and get your rice cake.

411
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,710
- I'll have it.
- You have to pay your offertory.

412
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,180
- I'll have it.
- Pay your... Ukha.

413
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,210
Share it with Father.

414
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:59,920
What's this?

415
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,460
You did it! He did it.

416
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,359
It's not right.
You shouldn't do this.

417
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:08,599
Have a rice cake
and find enlightenment.

418
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,670
I think I'm angry at
what just happened.

419
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,640
Why don't you let me
punch you in advance...

420
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,880
since you promised me last time?

421
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,950
This is driving me crazy.

422
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:27,220
It's the funniest thing I've heard
in the last 10 years.

423
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,819
But why do you keep
wanting to beat people?

424
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,450
Let me hear the reason.

425
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,259
Mr. Hwang, his temper...

426
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:39,000
Withdrawal of management on
welfare facilities and this cult.

427
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,500
And you.

428
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,640
Are you my obsessed fan?
Or are you a stalker?

429
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,940
Why do you keep digging up on me?

430
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,410
You two should calm down first.

431
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,349
Father, I beg you.

432
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,380
Mr. Hwang is a really scary man.

433
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,519
Do you want to go outside?

434
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:04,950
It'd be embarrassing for you to be
caught on camera being beaten by me.

435
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,730
We won't go outside,
and that won't happen either.

436
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,359
Mr. Hwang. Father Kim!

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,599
You can't behave like this!

438
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,769
Stay out of this.

439
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:22,710
No, no. Be the referee.

440
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,609
My gosh.

441
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,980
It wouldn't be right
to beat a priest.

442
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,180
You'll never get to feel that.

443
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:34,549
Let's talk this out.

444
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,220
You two shouldn't behave this way.

445
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,319
There's another one?

446
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,519
Removing that makes me
less guilty beating you.

447
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:46,900
Let's begin.

448
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,569
Fight!

449
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
You jerk.

450
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,730
(Guest star,
Anchorwoman Park Eun Kyoung)

451
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,650
(The Fiery Priest)

452
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,650
You're really making me
run out of patience.

453
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,359
It is my personal informant.

454
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
Hey!

455
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
(The table has turned!)

456
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,759
No one will dare
say anything to you.

457
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,660
What do you mean?
This is the real game.

458
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,430
(If you know your enemy
and yourself,)

459
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,529
Listen carefully. I won't repeat.

460
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:55,569
These are the bad guys.

461
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,130
They're all in the same team,
so they can't get caught, okay?

462
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,839
Those evil scumbags.

463
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,069
(you can win every battle.)

464
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,210
You made it seem like
you were going to punish them all.

465
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,670
You always ruin things
by showing your cards.

466
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,079
What did you say? Ruin things?

467
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,809
I didn't mess up that much.
