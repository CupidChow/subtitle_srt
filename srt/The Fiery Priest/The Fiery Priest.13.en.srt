00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,009
(Episode 13)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,980
I think I'm angry at
what just happened.

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,710
Why don't you let me
punch you in advance...

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,779
since you promised me last time?

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,650
This is driving me crazy.

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,789
It's the funniest thing I've heard
in the last 10 years.

7
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:18,190
Mr. Hwang. Father Kim!

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,530
You can't behave like this!

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,559
Stay out of this.

10
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,699
No, no. Be the referee.

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,199
My gosh.

12
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,300
It wouldn't be right
to beat a priest.

13
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:32,539
You'll never get to feel that.

14
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:36,670
You two shouldn't behave this way.

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,509
Removing that makes me
less guilty beating you.

16
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,280
Let's begin.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,950
Fight.

18
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,420
You jerk.

19
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:03,229
You seem like
you've punched before.

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,400
Am I a gangster like you?

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,939
Why would I punch anyone?

22
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,170
That punch made me feel more awake.

23
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,810
I'm starting again.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,879
- It's been so long.
- Goodness.

25
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,150
It's been fixed.

26
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,019
Game stop.

27
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,650
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,659
Father Kim.

29
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,859
Don't say something lame like...

30
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,560
how those people saved me out of it.

31
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,290
When is our rematch?

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,799
When you want to die.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Should we get it?

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,370
- Come here.
- Let's go.

35
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,709
Let's go.

36
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,879
Really?

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,780
It really is.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,079
Did you fight a lot
when you were in school?

39
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,650
The way you punch seems natural.

40
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,859
I can see that you're experienced.

41
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,420
I just did it randomly.

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,629
You can't just punch
Mr. Hwang randomly.

43
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:03,829
He used to be a boxer.

44
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,870
Apparently, he's never lost
a fight before.

45
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,800
Do the police believe whatever
the gangsters say?

46
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,539
Gosh.

47
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,849
It's this way...

48
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,580
Why are you going back in there?

49
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,219
Without enlightenment,

50
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:29,389
that ignorance has become
the cellulite on your abdomen.

51
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,789
- I see.
- The hands of the enlightened...

52
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,490
will make sure that the cellulite
will disappear one by one.

53
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,629
- It hurts.
- Enlightenment.

54
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,699
Ukha!

55
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,870
I'm sorry. Stop right there.

56
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,280
Father Kim, keep your manners...

57
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,280
I don't know anymore.

58
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,780
Why don't you step outside
for a moment?

59
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,620
The offering for the service
can be paid here.

60
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,250
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,259
You don't seem like you're here
for some enlightenment.

62
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,659
- What brings you...
- Hey, cult.

63
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,300
- What?
- How come...

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,830
cults don't ever develop?
The power you provide is insincere.

65
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,099
Cult? How could you say that to...

66
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,139
My gosh.

67
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,110
- Father Kim.
- That little...

68
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:29,280
Why are being so rude in front
of a religious group's leader?

69
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,949
I don't keep my manners
in front of cult members.

70
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,219
You're the same level
of Satan to me.

71
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,219
Satan?

72
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,330
How does my physiognomy
relate to Satan?

73
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:41,860
I only believe in impressions
not physiognomy.

74
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,229
But your impression...

75
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,930
represents a cult.

76
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,400
I'd like to complain about
whatever you just said to me...

77
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,069
officially in the name
of your religion.

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,280
Do whatever you want.

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,509
I'm warning you.

80
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,680
Don't think about managing
the welfare facility.

81
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,889
And don't talk about ukha
to the kids in the orphanage.

82
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,659
I won't handle it
with words next time.

83
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,490
I warned you.

84
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,259
What?

85
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,129
Snow White, have this apple.

86
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,410
I see.

87
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,310
"I see"?

88
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:32,379
I see.

89
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,910
She looks like the witch who gave
an apple to Snow White.

90
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,319
That's right.

91
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,220
Are you going to let them be?

92
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,720
Even so,

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,920
I can't just leave people
like them alone.

94
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,990
I'll make sure they change
with enlightenment.

95
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:50,300
Ukha.

96
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,199
Why do you look unhappy?

97
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,139
Try digging around
the whole of Gudam.

98
00:04:57,269 --> 00:04:58,769
Dig all you want.

99
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:00,439
Yes, I'll do that from now.

100
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,670
Wait.

101
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,540
Are you losing your temper
in front of me?

102
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,810
How could lose my temper
in front of a Father?

103
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,079
I won't interfere and just be
your guide from now on.

104
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,519
A guide?

105
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,589
- Are you sulking?
- No, I'm not.

106
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,319
Your eyes tell me that you are.

107
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,629
My eyes are naturally like this.

108
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:22,790
That's why my teachers always
punished me in school.

109
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,360
They thought I was staring
when I was just looking.

110
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,500
They always slapped me...

111
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,199
Darn it.

112
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,199
"Darn it"?

113
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,370
You may find whatever
I'm doing annoying but...

114
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,209
I was just making a fuss to
stop you from getting hurt.

115
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:35,509
What fuss?

116
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,980
And are you actually
doing it for me?

117
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,410
Yes.

118
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,480
But you never listen to me,

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,910
so what can I do?

120
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,149
Gosh.

121
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,220
Detective Koo.

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,949
That doesn't... Come here.

123
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:51,720
Hey.

124
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,899
Can you order
a mapo tofu rice for me?

125
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,430
I'm craving something oily.

126
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,470
- Okay.
- I want an oyster jjamppong.

127
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,769
What do you want?

128
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:06,839
Forget her.

129
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,209
She's testing my patience
for the whole day.

130
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,779
Tell me how you knew where
the witnesses were.

131
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,709
Or you can't leave this place.

132
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,550
From an informant I knew.

133
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:21,319
I knew the informant even before
I became a police officer.

134
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,220
Detective Seo.

135
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
People shouldn't just be faithful...

136
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,089
when they get their password
wrong for the fourth time.

137
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,560
They should always be faithful.
Especially times like now.

138
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,600
Or you'll be in big trouble.

139
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,329
My answer won't change.

140
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,339
And I can't reveal the identity
of my informant.

141
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,740
Hey.

142
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,689
This is driving me crazy.

143
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,089
I'm so stressed.

144
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,259
You can go.

145
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,600
(The policemen of Gudam
will never violate our duty.)

146
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,430
So what happened? Where did you
say you got the information?

147
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,240
I told her the truth and said
I got it from my informant.

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,310
And she bought that?

149
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,639
Of course. That's why I'm back here.

150
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,410
Are you sure you're not
hiding anything from me?

151
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,279
No.

152
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,189
It's not something informants
can easily find out.

153
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,250
My informant is very competent.

154
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,420
Detective Seo, you really
shouldn't hide anything from me.

155
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,959
Because if anything goes wrong,
I won't be able to help you.

156
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,670
Even if something does go wrong,
I won't ask you for help.

157
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,470
Hey, you're my partner.
I can't just stay still.

158
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,810
Yes, you can. You should stay still.

159
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,370
I'll take care of everything
on my own.

160
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,649
Hey, wait... That little punk.

161
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,149
So are you saying Father Kim...

162
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,360
was the one who sent her
the location?

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Yes.

164
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,360
You should've checked
Detective Seo's cell phone.

165
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,199
She probably deleted everything
before she came here.

166
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,529
You can tell that she's not
an easy girl to deal with.

167
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:16,230
But how did he manage
to track them down?

168
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,769
It's not like he works
for a government institution.

169
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,910
Maybe someone who goes
to his church is a hacker.

170
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,639
I wonder how a priest managed
to find this kind of route.

171
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,110
Should I summon Father Kim?

172
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,209
We can charge him for violating
National Security Law...

173
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,209
and the Information Security Law.

174
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,920
Let's just...

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,190
keep it quiet for now.

176
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,519
What? You're not even
going to tell the chief prosecutor?

177
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,519
No.

178
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,919
Think about it.

179
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:43,789
Let's say we catch both Father Kim
and the hacker.

180
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,299
But what if it turns out
the hacker has a lot of information?

181
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,100
I'm talking about stuff
that should never get disclosed.

182
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,870
- Like what?
- What kind of stuff?

183
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,299
You know, stuff like...

184
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,139
Embarrassing videos
of high-ranking public officials.

185
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,039
- You know what I mean.
- My goodness.

186
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,549
I got goosebumps
even with these arm warmers on.

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,750
If that actually happens,
all of us will be done for.

188
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,289
Everyone here will be doomed.

189
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:13,190
You really are incredible.

190
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,159
To be honest, I also felt quite
uncomfortable about it.

191
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,299
- Follow my orders on that.
- Okay.

192
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:22,700
Can I have some of your
oyster jjamppong soup?

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Sure.

194
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,879
Nice.

195
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,850
Why is that girl so stubborn?

196
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,620
I can't believe she just stood there
for four hours straight.

197
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,960
Father Kim.

198
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,889
Father Kim.

199
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,700
I was right, wasn't I?
It's a cult, isn't it?

200
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,970
He's even working
with Hwang Cheol Bum.

201
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,970
Hwang Cheol Bum?

202
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:00,240
He came to church every Sunday,

203
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,070
but I guess he was actually
a member of Maegakgyo.

204
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,240
Goodness, how evil.

205
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,740
So he's doing this just so he could
increase the number of believers?

206
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,080
How could he do that?

207
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,580
I can't believe he's doing this
just to get more believers.

208
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:11,279
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

209
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,350
You guys.

210
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,820
Do you think he's trying to
take over the welfare facility.

211
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,230
in order to increase the number
of his believers?

212
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,330
My gosh, I can't believe this.

213
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Gosh, be gentle.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,470
- Sir.
- Yes?

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,110
Did something happen?

216
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,139
No one's able to touch
Mr. Hwang's face.

217
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,750
So there's no way he could've
gotten beaten up by anyone.

218
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,009
Did you fall, sir?

219
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,950
What if I did get beaten up
by someone?

220
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,919
Why would you say
something like that?

221
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,049
A beast or
a well-trained assassin...

222
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:52,919
are the only things
that can attack you.

223
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:56,090
My gosh. A beast, my foot.
You dumb little punk.

224
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,289
Here.

225
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,600
- Let's drink.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,669
Let's clink glasses.

227
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,330
- Go!
- Go!

228
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,370
- Let's drink!
- Let's drink!

229
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,309
Your food is here.

230
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,710
Yes, please put it over there.

231
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,710
Honey, jjajangmyeon is here.
Let's eat.

232
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,320
- 22 dollars, please.
- 22 dollars?

233
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,789
- Hurry, hurry.
- Here you go.

234
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,259
Wait. You need to take this.

235
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,899
(Seongwongak)

236
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Gosh, I almost peed.

237
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,639
Thank you.

238
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,909
Hello. Did you think I didn't
recognize you?

239
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,149
You see, I also have eyes
on the back of my head.

240
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,419
Can you see my eyes or not?

241
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:55,649
I can see them.

242
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,350
- Really?
- Yes.

243
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:00,929
I can't see them.

244
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,129
- You can't?
- No.

245
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,860
- You can't see them?
- No, I can't.

246
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,629
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers. Say it.

247
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,169
- Say it!
- Peter Piper picked...

248
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,769
a peck of pickled peppers.

249
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,309
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

250
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,279
Bye.

251
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,620
What?

252
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,690
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

253
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,529
A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.

254
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,799
Gosh, let's be careful
and drive safely.

255
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,940
(Chief of Borough, Chief of Police,
Congressman)

256
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,210
Listen carefully.
I'm only going to say this once.

257
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,139
They're the bad jerks.

258
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,409
Father Kim.

259
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,179
You mean, "bad birds".

260
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,389
Okay, then.
I'll call them the bad birds.

261
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,419
This is our welfare facility.

262
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,919
And this is the foundation that
the bad birds are trying to build.

263
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:08,889
The bad birds have a lot of filthy
money. What's filthy money?

264
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,429
- Bribery.
- Hush money.

265
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,960
- Speculation.
- And so on.

266
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,529
Yes, good job.

267
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,029
You already know what it is,
so I won't write it down.

268
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,870
The bad birds need a way
to launder their filthy money,

269
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,940
and that's why they're trying
to build this foundation.

270
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,009
Then who's going to build
the foundation?

271
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,080
Good question.

272
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,379
(Hwang Cheol Bum, Maegakgyo)

273
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:29,379
On the outside,

274
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,250
Hwang Cheol Bum and Maekgakgyo
will be the ones building it.

275
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,649
In other words, they're the ones
taking physical action.

276
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,690
My goodness gracious.
They're a group of Satans.

277
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,960
So once the foundation launders
their money,

278
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,590
they'll be able to use that money
however they want.

279
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,529
That's right. Good job.

280
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,429
As you said, the foundation
will launder their money,

281
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,230
and that will enable them to use it
however they want.

282
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,299
They're not interested
in the welfare facility at all.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,100
My goodness.

284
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,009
It's so obvious that they're
doing something really bad.

285
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:59,440
So why aren't they getting caught?

286
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,149
That's a very textbook question.

287
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:03,250
Listen carefully.

288
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,750
This foundation that these
bad birds are trying to build...

289
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,649
is being supported
by the chief of borough,

290
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,389
the chief of police,
and a congressman.

291
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,190
So there's no way
they'll get caught.

292
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,960
Gosh, those mean little scumbags.

293
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,860
Goodness, what did I just say?

294
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:18,600
Those bad birds.

295
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,759
Goodness.

296
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,500
Along with the foundation
and the expansion of our business,

297
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,870
we must make sure things stay
under control from now on.

298
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,409
But so many weird things
have happened recently.

299
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,440
Especially that guy.
What's his name?

300
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,149
That weird priest. He's the worst.

301
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,649
On top of that,
we need to deal with the kid...

302
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,620
that got hospitalized
after eating at the orphanage.

303
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,460
So I've been thinking.
You should find a new member...

304
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,059
that we can put in charge of...

305
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,559
dealing with all the problems
that occur in Gudam.

306
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,559
I'm not talking about
someone like Mr. Hwang.

307
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:54,899
I want someone who's smart
and can take care of things legally.

308
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,100
You're right.

309
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,570
Mr. Hwang's way of doing things...

310
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,009
can put things at risk.

311
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:05,210
Come in.

312
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,009
Hello.

313
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:11,279
You know who she is, right?

314
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,419
She's Jeong Dong Ja,
the chief of borough.

315
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,889
I'm honored to meet you, ma'am.
I'm Park Kyeong Seon.

316
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,019
I'm Jeong Dong Ja.

317
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:18,789
Have a seat.

318
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,629
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

319
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,600
I've heard a lot about you.

320
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,340
You're very beautiful.

321
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,509
Thank you.

322
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,779
Did you find out
who the informant was?

323
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,340
She was right.

324
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,149
What?

325
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,480
Are you saying she really had
an informant?

326
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,950
It's a hacker she caught
when she became a cop.

327
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,019
I already checked who he is.

328
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,590
Gosh, this darn country
is filled with techies.

329
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,490
Why do they have to know
every single thing?

330
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,190
I'll arrest him...

331
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,230
and charge him for violating
the Information Security Law...

332
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,899
and National Security Law.

333
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,269
Okay, you can take care of it.

334
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,470
Yes, sir.

335
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,840
You can meet Ms. Jeong another time.

336
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:14,379
Yes, sir.

337
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,679
Enjoy your meals.

338
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,879
- See you next time.
- Yes, ma'am.

339
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,289
Goodbye.

340
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,120
He called me over during dinnertime,

341
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,889
and he's not even going to
offer me any food?

342
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,529
The sashimi looked really delicious.

343
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,769
Is she the one that
sometimes has our back?

344
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,870
I like her better now that
I've actually seen her in person.

345
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,340
She's smart,
and she's good with her work.

346
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,549
What do you say we bring her in
as a new member?

347
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,009
It's not a bad idea,

348
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,950
Let me tame her a bit beforehand.

349
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,049
I'll let you know once again.

350
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,289
"Tame her"?

351
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,069
Do you read such books?

352
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,230
I'm telling you this now,

353
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,470
but I majored in astrophysics.

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You study celestial bodies?

355
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,809
Oh, really?

356
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,410
Then you should be staring at stars,
not checking out items here.

357
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,809
This is pure science,
so it's hard to get a job.

358
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,509
You should get a job
even though it may be different...

359
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,980
to your major.

360
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:27,220
I'm working a job that is
related to my major.

361
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
What?

362
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,789
If a celestial body is
the great universe,

363
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,789
then this world we live in
is a microcosm.

364
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,529
And we're just stars.

365
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,730
And every day, I study these stars.

366
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:42,829
While checking out.

367
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,970
It's a dollar and 80 cents.

368
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,339
What kind of a star am I?

369
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,809
Tell me.

370
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,410
Antares.

371
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:58,279
"Antares"?

372
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:00,779
It's in the constellation
of Scorpius.

373
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:02,789
It's 700 times bigger than the Sun.

374
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,950
Its mass is 15 times bigger.

375
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,789
It's 10,000 times brighter.

376
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,619
In China, they call it,

377
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:10,160
"a big fire".

378
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,299
"A big fire".

379
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,500
So you're saying that
I have a fiery temper.

380
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,269
That I'm ill-tempered.

381
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,839
No.

382
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:23,410
It means that you're passionate,

383
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,940
and there's something in your heart.

384
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,880
Like this.

385
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,609
Exactly.

386
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,690
Fine. So this is how
you've been perceiving me.

387
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,390
You checked this out, right?

388
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,519
The big star is now leaving.

389
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,559
I should've just simply said
the moon.

390
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,769
Hello.

391
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:04,250
I heard you shot an action movie
in Gapyeong with Ms. Seo.

392
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:05,819
Words spread so quickly.

393
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,420
Then you should know that
our witnesses were taken away.

394
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,819
Maybe they were just trying
to protect them.

395
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,990
What? Protect them?

396
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,460
You're ashamed about
what has happened, aren't you?

397
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:17,829
Me?

398
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,460
You are.

399
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,430
Come on. You should be.

400
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,799
Think about it.
You should be ashamed about it.

401
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,000
Forget it.

402
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,710
If you're going to investigate,
do it properly.

403
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,980
You made it sound like...

404
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,309
you were going to get rid
of all the bad men out there.

405
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,109
But people can always
see through you,

406
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,150
and you're done for.

407
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,579
You really seem worthless, Father.

408
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,450
I'm done for? I'm done for?

409
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,890
What was I done for?

410
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,920
It happened today as well.

411
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,259
What will you do if the pope decides
to check up on you later?

412
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,630
What if he asks what you've been
doing thus far?

413
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,869
How dare you talk sarcastically
about the pope?

414
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,609
I'm not being sarcastic.

415
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,009
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

416
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,009
What an SL.

417
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,450
What?

418
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:15,890
Hey.

419
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,019
What does SL stand for?

420
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,589
Suffocating Loser.

421
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:27,059
If someone's talking some sense
into you, you should listen.

422
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,470
He just won't listen.

423
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,900
He's completely lost right now,
isn't he?

424
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,240
Also,

425
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:37,670
why was he wearing sandals
in this cold?

426
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,680
Does he think he's that macho?

427
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,349
This is the last time I'm going
to be easy on him, Father.

428
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,890
It's really the last time.

429
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,720
No matter how much you smile,
I won't let him go next time.

430
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:56,630

of a vacation spot...

512
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,519
that you visit once a year?

513
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,920

514
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,829

00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:02,289
- Look at that.
- You should always do well.

536
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,259
(Personnel appointments
announcement)

537
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,430
(Special prosecution unit,
Park Kyeong Seon)

538
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:14,759
(District public prosecutor's
office in Chuncheon)

539
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,529
(As of the following day)

540
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,440
I couldn't do anything about it.

541
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,509
It was a direct order
from the director.

542
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,819
I do admit that
I made a mistake once.

543
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,250
- But how could you...
- I know right.

544
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,549
That's how his temper is like.

545
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,789
He's not naturally generous.

546
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,029
But didn't you say you could
do something with a small matter?

547
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,059
Prosecutor Park.

548
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:48,000
This meth case is not a small matter
but a big one.

549
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,470
Didn't you know?

550
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,509
Just head there first.

551
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:01,140
Think of it as a break
since it ended up like this.

552
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,660
(Today's schedule,
Savings Day, 10pm)
