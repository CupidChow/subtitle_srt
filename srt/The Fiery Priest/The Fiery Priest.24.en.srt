1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,240
So when I first asked you
for his background check...

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,540
I also couldn't believe it
when I first saw his name.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,279
I realized it really was him
when I checked the document.

4
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,380
Then why didn't you
tell this earlier?

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,849
Because I couldn't believe
he's become a priest.

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,519
So I needed to double check.

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:18,820
What's the conclusion?

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,730
He's just a priest.

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,199
My gosh. That's a relief then.

10
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:28,300
No, you can't be relieved.

11
00:00:29,469 --> 00:00:32,039
You know when Hae Il loses it,

12
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:34,740
he becomes a monster.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,780
The scene of the crime,
the corpse transporter,

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,890
the route and location of
body dump, all checked.

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,259
Through Ms. Jeong...

16
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,460
and Wangmat Foods,
I got to the scene and route.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,829
Through Congressman Park
I found out who moved the body.

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,859
Then next.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,869
(Superintendent Nam Seok Gu)

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,899
Superintendent Nam Seok Gu.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,150
What is it now?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,099
Agent Kim Hae Il.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,840
You must feel much better
now you know my past.

24
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,069
I put on a show
so you could get away.

25
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,950
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

26
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,950
And more.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,579
Why did I do that?

28
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,390
Out of guilt, I suppose?

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,120
You felt bad for Father Lee.

30
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:00,689
It was...

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,560
because I felt inconvenienced.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,629
I felt inconvenienced that
not just one but two priests...

33
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:13,370
from my church could end up dead.

34
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,569
You know what that means, right?

35
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,979
Small, damp, prickly,

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,710
disconcerting, something like that.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,319
My goodness.

38
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,650
Let's say you
feel that way about me.

39
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,460
Was Father Lee just
an inconvenience to you?

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,099
Something like a fishbone
or humidity?

41
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,840
You know, I tried to not
feel inconvenienced,

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,780
but it's getting in
the way of my life.

43
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,050
Then you can stop caring about me.

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,620
Don't mind me anymore.

45
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,659
Let me be and
feel inconvenienced, okay?

46
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,460
Must I not get in your way
for your future?

47
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:10,060
You're always like this.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,770
When I try to talk,
you get annoyed and angry.

49
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Old man.

50
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,740
I think you do this for
emotional amusement.

51
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,169
For enjoyment.

52
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,939
Who would enjoy this?

53
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,680
Am I a psycho?

54
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,150
You are not normal, okay?

55
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,490
Why don't you see that?

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,759
An abnormal man calling
a normal woman abnormal?

57
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,490
The normal woman feels
abnormally ticked off.

58
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,560
Swag.

59
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,930
That doesn't even rhyme.

60
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:48,830
Don't let me off anymore.

61
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,939
I told you last time that
I'll go all the way.

62
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,810
As of today,

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,139
there's no more letting you off.

64
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,379
Then as of today,
I'll stop praying for you.

65
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,290
Wait. You did what for me?

66
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,959
Pray? No, right?

67
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,699
It can't be.

68
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,370
He ran out of things to say.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,339
Darn him.

70
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,949
Would a priest lie about praying
when he didn't?

71
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,420
She put on a show
to help me get away.

72
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,550
"Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera"?
What else did she do?

73
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,009
Yo Han.

74
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,120
- Yo Han.
- Welcome.

75
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,790
Will you get some sleep too?

76
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,759
I have no time to.

77
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,420
I must save up for graduate school.

78
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,389
Oh right.
You're free after 10pm, right?

79
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,759
I am.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
- Did you eat onions?
- No, this.

81
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,139
Do you want to work with me?

82
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,769
There's a well-paying part-time job.

83
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,980
- What job?
- Gosh.

84
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,310
There's a club called Rising Moon.

85
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,680
A club?

86
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:47,449
Dance.

87
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,889
A club. Well? Aren't I smooth?

88
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,389
You're awesome.
You can really dance.

89
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,189
But you don't have to dance.

90
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,199
You just move things and clean up.

91
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,129
And don't talk. You'll get fired.

92
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,930
- Why?
- Just say this.

93
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,300
"Welcome." Say it.

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,069
- Wewcome.
- Welcome.

95
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,110
Wewcome.

96
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
Nevermind. It won't work.

97
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,779
I like well-paying jobs.
Let's do it.

98
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,810
Okay. You start next week.
Don't change your mind.

99
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,689
I don't say two things
with one mouth, you pig.

100
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,350
I get why Jang Ryong beats you.

101
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,589
Come here, Song Sac.

102
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:26,490
- Come at me, pig.
- Come here.

103
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,829
- Come on.
- I'll kill you.

104
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,029
What's this?

105
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,269
I put some effort
into this briefing.

106
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,439
(Rising Moon)

107
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,170
I dug a bit and ended up in
a maze of tunnels.

108
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,639
Tell me the actual owner first.

109
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,040
On the surface,

110
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,139
Congressman Park's son
Park Shin Woo owns the club.

111
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,649
I looked into the borrowed names
of the other business owners.

112
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,019
Nam Seok Gu, Kang Seok Tae,

113
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:54,649
Jeong Dong Ja, and Hwang Cheol Bum.

114
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,920
This really is some tunnel.

115
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,490
Superintendent Nam is
practically the CEO.

116
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,629
He's not just the CEO.
He owns the most shares.

117
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,370
The red line's the cash flow to
the Gudam-gu office and police?

118
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,370
Yes. But the main point is...

119
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:14,170
It is...

120
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,139
this.

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,009
Tell me. Be quick.

122
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,449
It is...

123
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,449
It is...

124
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:28,790
You'll find out after
the commercial break.

125
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,560
Can you not do things like that?

126
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,589
Okay then.

127
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,930
It is...

128
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,870
You did well by lying low.

129
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,870
That was nothing.

130
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,839
I regret doing what I did.

131
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,579
I returned to my office today.

132
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,449
Congressman Park went to
some trouble for nothing.

133
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,519
But Superintendent, you should
help us quell our undying fury.

134
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,120
How should I help you quell that?

135
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,829
Your shares in Rising Moon?

136
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,230
How about...

137
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,800
we divide your shares
equally among us?

138
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,639
(Meth!)

139
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,670
Methamphetamine.

140
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:24,540
It's bought and sold in the club.

141
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,579
The suppliers are from Russia.

142
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,779
Methamphetamine at a club
on the edge of Gudam-gu?

143
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,549
Because of this meth,

144
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,659
many celebrities and
rich company heirs...

145
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,159
come here in secret.

146
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,429
Instead of all the Gangnam hotspots.

147
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,600
Hanjoo Group's Kim Keon Yong
is one of them.

148
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,629
He doesn't get high at home.

149
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:48,929
Even though he said he did.

150
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
You can get this much
with the little digging you did.

151
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,840
Didn't the drug squad
investigate them?

152
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,580
They raid the place sometimes,

153
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,710
but it's spotless
whenever they get there.

154
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,309
Also...

155
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,120
Also what?

156
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,080
Last year, there was...

157
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,289
a Gudam-gu detective
who wouldn't stop looking.

158
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,590
He died in a car accident.

159
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,159
Is this some movie?

160
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,399
Why is this so typical?

161
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,929
I think it's best if you...

162
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,100
stop digging now that
we know this much.

163
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,269
That's right.

164
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,639
We've only looked into
the superintendent,

165
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:31,610
but we also got drug dealers,
buyers, and bribery. Unbelievable.

166
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Hello, sir.

167
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,049
Lunch today? I'm free.

168
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,419
Hanjoo Group's Kim Keon Yong
wants to treat us.

169
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,860
I see.

170
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
Okay.

171
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,529
What incredible timing.

172
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,370
What do you mean?

173
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,639
My friend who ran Father Lee's DNA.

174
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,009
He got fired for running...

175
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,980
an unauthorized test.

176
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,980
Because of mine?

177
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,149
He wouldn't say,
but I think that's it.

178
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,179
We did that in secret.
How did the company find out?

179
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,250
They must've got a tip
from the outside.

180
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,019
I think your enemies are
investigating on all sides.

181
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,159
That's not all.

182
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,129
Everything we had
on Father Lee was wiped.

183
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,629
Okay, I'll call you back.

184
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:39,110
Try as you might on your own,

185
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,409
nothing here will change.

186
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,379
Lee Joong Kwon.

187
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,289
This won't do.

188
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,460
We lack intel.

189
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,860
We need a plan.

190
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,600
It's not that easy.

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,299
I'll do all the research I can.

192
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,299
No.

193
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:08,210
- Detective Koo.
- Yes?

194
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,039
I need you to become our Tr...

195
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,639
Tr-what?

196
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,679
Trope?

197
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,720
Trump?

198
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,679
Twice?

199
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,919
Trojan horse.

200
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,090
No. It's too dangerous.

201
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,889
- Trojan horse.
- You heard me?

202
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,899
Forget about it.

203
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,870
You won't be able to do it.

204
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,730
No, wait.

205
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,039
You want me to be a double agent.

206
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,840
I considered it, but it's a no.

207
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,870
You can't pull it off.

208
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,179
I'm with you on that.

209
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,379
It's too big a deal...

210
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,720
for him to handle.

211
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,490
What are you two saying?

212
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,990
I can't do it?

213
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,529
I'm a veteran. I'm Koo Dae Young.

214
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,759
Don't. You can't.

215
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I can't...

216
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,330
send you into your death.

217
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:15,539
I will find someone else to help us.

218
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:17,070
Don't look. I'll do it.

219
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,879
Why would we ask for help?

220
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,350
Can you do it?

221
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,889
I found someone else.

222
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't look. I'll do it.

223
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,820
I'm the only one
who can do something...

224
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,460
this elaborate.

225
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,259
I feel uneasy,
but I'll try to trust you.

226
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,700
Me too, Dae Young.

227
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,039
I need to drink some water.

228
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,370
My gosh.

229
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,830
That was refreshing.

230
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:22,440
You're the expert.
How should we go about it?

231
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,549
If it's to look authentic,

232
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,250
we must give up a secret.

233
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,049
We have nothing on that villa.

234
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,620
Let's give them that.

235
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,860
No, Detective Seo.
That's not how it works.

236
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,419
What else must we give them?

237
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,629
Nothing.

238
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,000
Hit me on the face a few times.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,370
Make it look like I got beaten up
while looking into you.

240
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,669
How can I hit an innocent man?

241
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,169
I'm a priest.

242
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,610
You must do it, Father.

243
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,909
Thugs love a show like that.

244
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,980
Dae Young.

245
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:07,720
If that's the case,

246
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,690
I'll do it.

247
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,879
Oh, dear.

248
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:37,620
The priest found out
and beat you up?

249
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,320
He caught me trying to
break into his phone.

250
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,929
The lock pattern
was too complicated.

251
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,529
It wasn't a Z.

252
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,830
Oh, dear. Poor you.

253
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,669
So, how much did you find out
before he kicked you out?

254
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:00,340
It was Father Kim
who broke into the villa.

255
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,710
His accomplice was the other priest.

256
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,009
They're more like thieves
than priests.

257
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,250
Who called the cops? Father Kim?

258
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,980
He called in about the villa.

259
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,950
Not about the congressman.

260
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,490
I see.

261
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,090
Then who told him about
the possible assassination?

262
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,590
I don't know.

263
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:25,259
But the caller said
he has a source...

264
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,399
inside Daebum Trading.

265
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,169
Who could that be?

266
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,970
Who is that fool?
Look into everyone and find out.

267
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,100
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,710
Then...

269
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,639
do you not know
who the masked guy in...

270
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,139
Congressman Park's building was?

271
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,250
Was that the priest?

272
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,919
No. He was at the church then.

273
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,549
Okay then.

274
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:50,620
You've been through a lot.

275
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,559
You did well.

276
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,429
Get a drink.

277
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:56,629
Cheer up.

278
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:58,200
- Thank you.
- Sure.

279
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,629
- Thank you.
- Go.

280
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,940
Does he take me for a fool?

281
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,710
That didn't go too bad.

282
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,710
(CEO's Office)

283
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,009
I heard.

284
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,720
The priest beat you up.

285
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:20,820
If you're going to be a spy,
spy properly.

286
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,690
What's that up your nose?

287
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,990
Mr. Jang. I'm in a foul mood.

288
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,990
Shall we get drunk?

289
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,629
- Us?
- I meant to...

290
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,230
buy you a drink
but I kept forgetting.

291
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,500
Mr. Hwang gave me a check
and I can't drink alone.

292
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,940
I get drunk really quick...

293
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,679
if I drink during the day.

294
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,409
That's why we drink during the day.

295
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,049
Let's go.

296
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,950
I'm going because you asked.

297
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,250
I think that I once...

298
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,490
got drunk and said too much,
but I don't remember.

299
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,960
- Song Sac.
- Song Sac.

300
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,000
- Song Sac!
- Song Sac!

301
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,329
Bring another one.

302
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,269
Okay, it's coming.

303
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,210
- Okay then.
- What?

304
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,980
Who packs a better punch?

305
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,579
Is it Mr. Hwang or the priest?
You got punched by both.

306
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,720
- That's a tough one.
- Is it?

307
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,450
It's like asking
if I prefer Mom or Dad.

308
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,519
Detective Seo?

309
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,420
She's not bad too.

310
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,859
Enjoy your drinks.

311
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,319
Enjoy yourself too.

312
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,990
To our...

313
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,230
- friendship.
- Friendship.

314
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,900
- Mr. Jang.
- What?

315
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,440
How much longer will you
work beneath Director Kim?

316
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,779
If you fight each other,
would you lose?

317
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:55,880
Lose? Why would I lose?

318
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,049
You know,

319
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,220
I was the best fighter
in South Chungcheong Province.

320
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
Buyeo's three-story rockhead tower.

321
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,289
Then just turn the tables.

322
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,890
You went after Congressman Park
and got him in one go.

323
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,700
You got that right.

324
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,869
He showed off so much around me.

325
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,900
I knew this would happen.

326
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,009
What happens to
Congressman Park now?

327
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,640
He'll talk once he wakes up.

328
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,450
Blah, blah, blah.

329
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,180
He won't get up. We'll see to that.

330
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,190
How?

331
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,589
Will you kill him?

332
00:18:38,589 --> 00:18:39,589
You bet.

333
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,960
He's in intensive care now.

334
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,430
The day he's
transferred from there...

335
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,009
Who are you?

336
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,480
You idiot.

337
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,819
I'm Big Zero.

338
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,589
Nine Big Zero. Koo Dae Young.

339
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,259
Is your father well?

340
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,700
I owe you and only now
got to treat you.

341
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:25,400
It's fine. Your father
gave us gifts.

342
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,799
Were you behind that one?

343
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,039
It wasn't worth it.

344
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,609
Did you get some?

345
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,910
Yes. She got a bit of my pie.

346
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,049
I asked to see you today because...

347
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,190
Are you up to something?

348
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,029
Pardon? What do you mean?

349
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:52,259
Someone looked into the files on...

350
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,329
Rising Moon and Director Kim.

351
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,369
Who?

352
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,000
A Mr. Park Young Soo
from your department.

353
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,869
Isn't he your subordinate?

354
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,509
I'm not after the club
or Director Kim.

355
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,779
A suspect I'm looking into
is a regular there.

356
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,009
I think that's the investigation
you're referring to.

357
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,420
I see. I got the wrong idea.

358
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,390
I thought we had a rift.

359
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,220
You know we can't.

360
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,690
I'll be careful from now on.

361
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,299
Why did you look in that file?

362
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,369
I was going after
Superintendent Nam.

363
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,339
You went in a little too deep.

364
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,440
Drop that and dig somewhere else.

365
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,309
Make sure not to upset
Kim Keon Yong, okay?

366
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,309
Yes, sir.

367
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,720
Bye, sir.

368
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,890
Mr. Hwang.

369
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,759
Congressman Park moved from the ICU
to a special ward.

370
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,000
Then two police officers
will guard the ward.

371
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,670
No, his wife said that she can't
trust the police,

372
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,200
so she hired private bodyguards.

373
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,069
Gosh, I didn't want to get
involved in trivial matters...

374
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,309
by bribing a few police officers.

375
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,779
Send in a skilled one
so it can be done quickly.

376
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,849
Don't kill the bodyguards.
Just make them faint.

377
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,750
- Yes, sir.
- And...

378
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,160
make him dress
exactly like a priest.

379
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:30,589
We'll have to frame him
at the right time.

380
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,099
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

381
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,259
What?

382
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,599
How can you tell me that now?
It's important!

383
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,640
Yes, sir. I understand.

384
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Yes.

385
00:22:16,809 --> 00:22:19,279
Detective Koo, Congressman Park
moved to a special ward.

386
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,609
That must be nice.

387
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,180
Darn it. It's been an hour since
they moved him. We have to go now.

388
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,880
What if Mr. Hwang's men
made their moves first?

389
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,190
Hurry up!

390
00:22:30,589 --> 00:22:31,619
I'm up.

391
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,730
- Let's go! Hurry.
- What?

392
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:47,200
(Hangang Hospital)

393
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,369
Come on.

394
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,240
Detective Koo, get out already.

395
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,750
I drank eight bottles of Baijiu
to get information out of...

396
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,420
You can throw up later!

397
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,799
(Elevator under maintenance)

398
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,180
Detective Koo, hurry!

399
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,869
You have one more man to kill.

400
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:19,930
Who sent you?

401
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,799
Who sent you?

402
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,099
I don't know.

403
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,569
You're Russian.

404
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,109
Answer the phone.

405
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,079
Hurry up!

406
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,319
Are you done with it?

407
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,859
- Yes.
- I'm still waiting.

408
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,130
It's just one woman,
so it'll be quick.

409
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Okay.

410
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,109
Who is the woman?

411
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,410
I don't know.

412
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,079
I'm asking you for the last time.

413
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,720
Who is the woman?

414
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,130
Detective Koo! Hurry!

415
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,240
Where did Father Kim go?

416
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,910
What?

417
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,009
Is he the culprit?

418
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,009
(Culprit)

419
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,519
He is the culprit.
Let's arrest him first.

420
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,390
You have the right...

421
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,559
And refuse to...

422
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,430
Detective Koo!

423
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,599
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:13,859
Are you okay?

425
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,500
(The Fiery Priest)

426
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,369
Did a person really break this?

427
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,500
Thank you.

428
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,869
I guess you really meant it
when you said you'd pray for me.

429
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:02,170
Thank the Lord.

430
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:03,869
You're awake, Ms. Park.

431
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:06,609
I never go down. I'm a phoenix.

432
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:08,779
Phoenix. Sun, sun!

433
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,779
(The prosecutor has changed.)

434
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:10,980
You want to go after the club?

435
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,519
Yes, let's do a thorough job on it.

436
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,619
(Everyone wants justice.)

437
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,720
Let's begin.
