1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,110
Mr. Park, where's Mr. Kim's room?

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,410
Okay.

3
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,129
Are you okay?

4
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:27,889
(Episode 25)

5
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,789
They might really get rid of you
this time, Mr. Hwang.

6
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,930
That will never happen.

7
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,099
Now...

8
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,500
we know their biggest weakness.

9
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,870
We are the ones
who followed their orders.

10
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,639
And they're the ones who ordered us.

11
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,780
Let's begin
a face-to-face fight tonight.

12
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,819
Did a person really break this?

13
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,479
Are you okay?

14
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,719
I'm fine. What about the culprit?

15
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,159
We haven't caught him yet.

16
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,629
Are you okay, Father?

17
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,930
I'm fine as you can see.

18
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,599
Thank you for saving me.

19
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,909
You should thank the Lord, not me.

20
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,979
It must be true that...

21
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,990
you're praying for me.

22
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,520
That's why you're safe and sound.

23
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,329
The Lord doesn't like freeloaders.

24
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,129
You're awake, Ms. Park.

25
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,730
You're here.

26
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,800
What happened to your face?

27
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,439
I had a fight with my family.

28
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,680
You should stay with her.
I have somewhere to go.

29
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
Where are you going?

30
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,189
You don't have to worry.

31
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,329
Forget about
the personal information.

32
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,569
I'm asking this out of curiosity.

33
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,139
Who ordered you
to kill Congressman Park?

34
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,709
Call my attorney.

35
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:04,709
Cut that out.
I know you're good in Korean.

36
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,980
You're better at the spelling
than me based on your texts.

37
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,189
Hold on.

38
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,259
My gosh.

39
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,759
- You're an addict, aren't you?
- Hey!

40
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,129
Sir,
about Congressman Park's attacker.

41
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,230
- I think he's an addict.
- Since this is an important case,

42
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:30,230
- you should deal with it, Mr. Lee.
- Yes, sir.

43
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,300
I should finish it since I started.

44
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,439
How dare you talk back
to a superintendent?

45
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,870
Get out!

46
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Follow me.

47
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,850
How dare you?

48
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,160
What's happening?

49
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,569
It's uncomfortable
now that it's dark, isn't it?

50
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,339
Who are you?

51
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,980
We can't let anyone find out
about Rising Moon and Diabol.

52
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,949
Congressman Park is one thing.

53
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,550
But who attempted to murder
Prosecutor Park?

54
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:26,259
We have nothing to do with that.

55
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,930
I'll look into it
and take care of it.

56
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,930
We can't even get rid of
Congressman Park anymore.

57
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,829
What are we going to do
if he wakes up?

58
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,829
What's more important than that
is to make sure...

59
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,170
no one finds out about Rising Moon.

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,170
Sir, you should ask
your superiors for help.

61
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,769
Ask the director if you can.

62
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,759
- You little jerk.
- Mr. Hwang.

63
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,629
You're the one who recommended
the druggie from Rising Moon.

64
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,170
All I did was following your orders.

65
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,470
Are you...

66
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,379
blaming it on me right now?

67
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:21,410
I'm not blaming you.

68
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,019
I'm just telling you
the accurate cause of all this.

69
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,819
And...

70
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,160
it's not always the best answer
to kill someone.

71
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,160
Today,

72
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm going to take some rest.

73
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,740
- Let's go.
- That little punk.

74
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,290
Why don't you guys have
a tattoo here?

75
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:10,129
Are you here to find Diabol,
Father Kim?

76
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,529
"Diabol"?
Are you talking about the devil?

77
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,269
What are you talking about?

78
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,399
The guys who have tattoos
on their wrists.

79
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,240
That's the name of their gang.

80
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,810
They used to work for me,

81
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,879
but they left and
made a gang of their own.

82
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,550
If you guys managed to come
to your homeland,

83
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,350
you should be living
a diligent life.

84
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,320
But you're doing all the bad stuff.

85
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,350
At least we don't do drugs...

86
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,090
Do they do drugs?

87
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,899
- No... No.
- Where are they?

88
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,669
They're at Rising Moon that's
located at Gudam intersection.

89
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,639
Why are you looking for them?
Did they cause trouble again?

90
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,009
It's nothing serious.

91
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:57,740
They just tried to kill
a congressman and a prosecutor.

92
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,110
What a bunch of lunatics.

93
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,149
If that's the case,
they're not going to be there.

94
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,350
They're probably already...

95
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,860
Are they on a boat?

96
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,830
No, they're not.
They're definitely not on a boat.

97
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,860
You're very transparent. Thanks.

98
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,600
Stop looking at me.

99
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,039
Detective Seo, have him transferred
to the detention center.

100
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,279
Why? He didn't even give
a proper statement.

101
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,509
He did.

102
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,379
He tried to kill Congressman Park
because he didn't like...

103
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,379
his policy regarding foreigners.

104
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,820
"His policy regarding foreigners"?

105
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,419
Then he should get punished
in Korea.

106
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,759
He was a criminal in Russia
for drug abuse.

107
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,529
We need to send him back
based on the international treaty.

108
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,929
We can't do that, sir.

109
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,000
His motive for murder
doesn't even make sense.

110
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,500
This is totally absurd.

111
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Seo Seung Ah!

112
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,169
It's the superintendent's order.
Hurry up and get it done.

113
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,019
I'm sure it wasn't just a burglar.
I'm sure of it.

114
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,590
Gosh, how long
are you going to take?

115
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,690
The wind keeps coming in.

116
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,100
Don't worry and just wait.

117
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,870
I even do all the interior design
at my house.

118
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,029
I'll get it done perfectly.

119
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,110
Gosh, my curtain...
My wallpaper...

120
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,460
Just leave it.
I'll just enjoy the night wind.

121
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
Okay.

122
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,860
Back when I was young,
this was nothing.

123
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,799
The wind is cold enough...

124
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,570
to make someone freeze to death.

125
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,570
You should sit down
and take some rest.

126
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,169
Okay.

127
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,940
It seems like you're getting along
with Father Kim these days.

128
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,279
What are you talking about?

129
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,320
If he wasn't a priest,
I would've slapped him already.

130
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,320
Did you make up your mind
to side with Father Kim?

131
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,120
Gosh, what are you talking about?
I'm not on his side.

132
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,529
You really can't afford
to make a mistake this time.

133
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,860
If anything goes wrong, you'll all
end up dead. You know that, right?

134
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,860
You're totally mistaken.

135
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,470
Hey, Detective Seo. What's up?

136
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
What? Really?

137
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,039
Okay, I'll go back
to the police station.

138
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,649
Okay, bye. See you.

139
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,679
Do you think you can be here
by yourself?

140
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,450
- Would you like to come with me?
- No, it's okay.

141
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,090
I'm sure they won't come again.

142
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,590
I'm really fine. You should go.

143
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,559
Okay, then.
Gosh, I feel sorry for leaving.

144
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,470
- Bye.
- Bye.

145
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,799
I can't believe the heating
isn't working either.

146
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:19,580
Did the attempted murderer
get sent to the detention center?

147
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,350
Yes, he left a while ago.

148
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,580
Did you call Incheon port?

149
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,149
Yes, there aren't any boats
heading for Russia today.

150
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:29,320
But there's a cargo ship
that's headed for Vladivostok...

151
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,559
via Fukuoka at 11pm
from wharf number 1.

152
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,490
This is it.

153
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,659
We have less than 40 minutes. It'll
take at least an hour to get there.

154
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,059
Call the police at Incheon port
and request them for help. Let's go.

155
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:42,200
Because of arresting a smuggling
gang in the passenger terminal,

156
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,830
all the cops are there.

157
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,570
This always happens.
What a lousy timing.

158
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,440
Then let's just
get them ourselves.

159
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,039
If we hurry,
we might be able to catch up.

160
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,679
How can we get there in 40 minutes?

161
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,039
Detective Seo and I will go.

162
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,279
Meanwhile, I want you
to look into Rising Moon.

163
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,250
Rising Moon? Why?

164
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,580
Because the guys who
tried to murder...

165
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,820
Congressman Park and Prosecutor Park
are from there.

166
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,850
Then are they all members of Diabol?

167
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,990
(Daebum Trading)

168
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,299
Gosh, you startled me.

169
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,269
Goodness, Jang Ryong.

170
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,970
It's nice to meet you.
It's very nice to meet you.

171
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,970
What's this? This is so old school.
You're falling behind the trend.

172
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,970
- Then what's in trend?
- This is what's in trend.

173
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,210
Don't you know this?

174
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,779
It's nice to meet you.
It's very nice to meet you.

175
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Gosh, Jang Ryong.
I feel great every time I see you.

176
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,490
We should drink.

177
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,759
We drank so much this afternoon,
and you want to drink again?

178
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:39,690
That was just an appetizer.

179
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,259
A new place opened up
at the nearby intersection.

180
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,759
It's not fun if I drink without you.

181
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,029
Come on. Let's drink.

182
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:49,470
I guess you're not feeling well.
I'll just go by myself.

183
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,570
Gosh, don't be so hasty.

184
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,570
I can't go right now.
Let's meet after midnight.

185
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,509
Okay, then. I'll wait
at the police station...

186
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,879
and head there
once the clock hits 12.

187
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,649
I'll see you later, okay?

188
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:04,110
You'd better show up, okay?

189
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:06,179
You're the best.

190
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,419
It seems like we click.

191
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:24,970
Will you turn that off?

192
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,480
Will you please tell Anton to wire
the money before the holidays?

193
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,740
That's none of your business.

194
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,950
He always wires the money
after the weekend.

195
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,879
Follow me.

196
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,330
We got here in 28 minutes.

197
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,740
No wonder they call it
a speeding taxi.

198
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,340
- Father Kim.
- Let's go.

199
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,960
Diabol brothers.

200
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,629
Don't get on the boat.

201
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,730
- You should come with me.
- Who are you?

202
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:45,049
Detective Seo, take it easy.

203
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,919
Okay.

204
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,350
Mister.

205
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,320
Why don't you come over here?

206
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,759
Mister.

207
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:00,029
You should manage the port,

208
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,230
not be a broker to smuggle
people abroad.

209
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,539
Oh, that's...

210
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,769
It's for people who want to go home
but can't for some reasons.

211
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,779
What a tear-jerking story.

212
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:18,820
A ledger?

213
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,289
You shipped a lot of people.

214
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,190
Do you do business with Godzhayev?

215
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,720
Yes, sometimes.

216
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,490
- Detective Seo.
- Yes?

217
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,299
What's the date of the day
we lost the two witnesses?

218
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,269
February 13.

219
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,899
(1M 1F, Vladivostok)

220
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,340
Oh, them.

221
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,269
Hey. Stop this.

222
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,080
What's going on?

223
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,509
I sent them in a case.

224
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,049
Godzhayev paid me so little.

225
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,320
If you toss, who receives
the packages in Vladivostok?

226
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,329
Can we find out if the receiver...

227
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,930
sent them somewhere else?

228
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,099
Will you quit stalling?

229
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,910
This isn't working.

230
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,509
You're too used to
pleading the Fifth.

231
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,309
I'll perform an exorcism.

232
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,730
Mister, it's too cold out here.

233
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,069
Mister. Mister.

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,009
Hae Il, it's been so long.

235
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,809
How have you been?

236
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,039
Let's catch up later.
Are you in Vladivostok?

237
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,880
Yes. I'm in Sakhalin now,
but I will go back tomorrow.

238
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,779
Why?

239
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,549
Can you do me a favor...

240
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,089
but keep it from the NIS?

241
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,539
If I may say so,

242
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,670
trying to take out
a serving prosecutor...

243
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:25,279
was a very dangerous move.

244
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:26,940
So why did she...

245
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,109
have to visit
the singer in the hospital?

246
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,619
Making that call just because
she did that was...

247
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,720
Conscience or whatever it is called,
it takes only a moment...

248
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,250
for someone to change one's mind.

249
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,819
She must be stopped
from the beginning!

250
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:42,089
If things go wrong,

251
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,400
the suspicion and blame
could fall on you.

252
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,599
That blame...

253
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,640
is for you to block with your life.

254
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,109
Didn't my dad put you
there to do that for us?

255
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,450
I'll end this with a warning.

256
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:03,849
If this happens again,

257
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:06,750
you'll be held responsible too.

258
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,779
The first thing we must check
is who planned this.

259
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
- Goodbye.
- Buh-bye.

260
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,789
- I told you not to talk.
- I'm sorry, you pig.

261
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,660
Of course. I wondered
why you two weren't here.

262
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,670
Good job. Where's the Father?

263
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,269
Bring him in. I'll question him
and type up the report.

264
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,670
I'll take him.

265
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,380
- Come along.
- Isn't this just too much?

266
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,190
Do you have a problem with
your team leader taking over?

267
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,660
If this is how we do things,
who would trust us?

268
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,259
Detective Seo, drop it.

269
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,049
Being alone is
scarier than I thought.

270
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,349
I feel so scared.

271
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

272
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,630
I am not afraid. I'm not...

273
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:58,259
Gosh, that scared me.

274
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,539
Hello?

275
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,740
Okay. I'll be right there.

276
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,000
Are you the priest?

277
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:10,329
The one who beats people up?
You're famous.

278
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,539
I came today to just look around.

279
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,470
But how dare you keep a cross
and the Virgin Mary here?

280
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,740
Bring that. Put them away.

281
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,940
We're all Catholics too.

282
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,049
We decide whether to put them away.

283
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Do you?

284
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,549
Then I'll put you away first.

285
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,849
What's he saying?

286
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,599
Why are there so many of you?

287
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,910
Seriously, why were there so many?

288
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,779
I had no idea of their number.

289
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,920
Where's the assailant you caught?

290
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,059
He was sent to lock-up.

291
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,960
Who approved that?

292
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,000
He was wanted in Russia
for dealing drugs,

293
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
so he'll be repatriated.

294
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,599
You sent him away without taking
the victim's statement?

295
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,440
He admitted to the crime.

296
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,740
He broke in to rob and kill you.

297
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,910
Are you kidding me?

298
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,680
Who said you could
make that call and hand him over?

299
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:28,509
What if his purpose
wasn't to rob and kill me?

300
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,579
The possibility of that
seemed very slim.

301
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,349
Forget it. Bring him right back.

302
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,950
Bring him right now!

303
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,359
He was transferred already.
I can't do that.

304
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,390
Darn you.

305
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,630
I know you're all useless fools,
but what do you think you're doing?

306
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,299
Prosecutor Park,
you're going a bit too far.

307
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,529
You are all useless fools.

308
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I almost died.

309
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,869
Did you send Congressman Park's
attacker to be repatriated too?

310
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:55,609
You did?

311
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,819
Hey, team leader.
Where are you going?

312
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,690
By the way,
I need to leave this here.

313
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,450
- Detective Na.
- Yes, Father.

314
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,589
Help me with this.

315
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,460
So what, he left with the cross
and Virgin Mary statue?

316
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,460
What kind of a priest is he?

317
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,799
You should be glad that
he ran off first.

318
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,670
You'd all be dead
if you didn't have enough men.

319
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,339
Is he that good a fighter?

320
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,869
He crushed
Godzhayev's boys long ago.

321
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,750
So, Congressman Park's attacker...

322
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,150
and Prosecutor Park's
attacker are friends?

323
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,579
Yes. They're the best of friends.

324
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,789
I'm sorry we failed to kill
the congressman.

325
00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,819
No, it's fine. It worked out.

326
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,759
Who gave the order
to have the prosecutor killed?

327
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:58,970
Hanjoo Group's
Director Kim Keon Yong.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,170
Oh, dear.

329
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,009
Why did it have to
go down on the same day?

330
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,579
Do you have any ideas on...

331
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,519
who tried to have you killed?

332
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,190
I saw Kang Seok Tae
leaving Rising Moon earlier.

333
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,730
Him, Rising Moon,
and something that only you know.

334
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,329
Juggle those three.

335
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,740
Here's a tip.
Before an assassination,

336
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,869
you follow the target
for a few days,

337
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,980
one day at least.

338
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:42,549
To see whom they meet and
decide the best time to attack.

339
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,750
If someone was following you,
this was definitely planned.

340
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,019
Where did you go today?

341
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,559
Hurry up and tell me.
I'm an expert in this.

342
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,069
I was at the office,

343
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,240
and I went to the hospital
to see Mr. Kim.

344
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,240
Mr. Kim the idol singer?

345
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:15,680
The victim who tried to commit
suicide because of the meth case?

346
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,150
That's right.

347
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,279
- Why did you go there?
- I just...

348
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,019
wanted to see how he was.

349
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,960
I went home right away
after visiting the hospital.

350
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,430
At what time did you
arrive at the hospital?

351
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
What time was it?

352
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,279
Would it be okay to stay alone?

353
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:53,349
I'm not scared of anything,

354
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,519
but the wind is blowing through
the broken window.

355
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,019
I'll just endure the cold night.

356
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,660
Bye.

357
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,880
Stop looking back.
Go pack your stuff and come down.

358
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:24,849
Why?

359
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,720
Why? Why do you want me to?

360
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,130
Sister Angela,
you must've been really shocked.

361
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,400
What on earth happened?

362
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,470
How have you been?

363
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,970
You can stay at the annex...

364
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,609
where we prepared a temporary room.

365
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,710
You must've skipped your dinner.

366
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,309
No, it's fine. I'm not hungry.

367
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,150
Please give her something.

368
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,079
Her stomach sounded like
water pipes on her way here.

369
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,769
There's leftover rice,
so please tell me if you need it.

370
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,339
Okay.

371
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,309
Why don't you come
to our church anymore?

372
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,150
It's just that...

373
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,250
I've been really busy.

374
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,589
Is Father Lee's case...

375
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,220
making you uncomfortable
with Father Kim?

376
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,059
We all know that.

377
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:46,500
I know what kind of things
you do, Sister Angela.

378
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,700
I'm not saying this
to make you uncomfortable.

379
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,170
I'm saying it to make you
be at ease.

380
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,609
Thank you.

381
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,869
Father Lee...

382
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:01,480
especially loved you, Sister Angela.

383
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,380
He loved you for doing
the same work that the Lord does.

384
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,750
He said you might be
inexperienced now,

385
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,990
but one day you will
become able like the Lord.

386
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,819
He told us to bless you a lot.

387
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,960
Thank you, Father.

388
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,579
Your uncontrollable daughter
came back to you, Lord.

389
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,980
She could've gone to hell.

390
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,920
There must be a reason
you saved her.

391
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,259
But is she aware of the fact...

392
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:52,059
the chance to repent
is the biggest blessing?
