00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,270
(Episode 37)

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,550
Run! Father Han, run away, now!

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,679
Stop it!

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,050
Come to me. What are you doing?

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,919
Father Han.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,890
Hey! Seong Kyu!

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:22,530
Hae Il.

8
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,100
You'll be fine.

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,739
Lee Joong Kwon, you jerk!

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,740
Why do you always curse and bully me
whenever you see me?

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,810
Don't bother me anymore.

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,109
Where's the money?

13
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,509
I'll kill you if you lay your hands
on him.

14
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:42,780
You're responsible for everything...

15
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,850
that happens from now on.

16
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,090
Joong Kwon.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,689
Joong Kwon, it's my fault.

18
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,159
I'll give you the money back.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,000
Just this once. I'm begging you.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Go.

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,670
No, no. Don't do it. Don't.

22
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,209
Seong Kyu. No. Don't! No!

23
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,019
Father Han... Please...

24
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,129
One moment, please.

25
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,569
Wait.

26
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,169
Wait.

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,199
(Central Operating Room)

28
00:03:01,289 --> 00:03:04,159
I'm going to kill Lee Joong Kwon.

29
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,530
What happened? How is he?

30
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,099
We'll only know
once the surgery ends.

31
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,860
Is Mr. Han Seong Kyu's guardian
present?

32
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,870
Seong Kyu... How is Father Han?

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,710
The epidural hemorrhage was
quite severe.

34
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,409
We've prevented him from dying,

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,349
but he's in a critical state.

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,120
"Critical"? What do you mean?

37
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,550
We've done everything we could.

38
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,520
Now, we must rely
on his will to live...

39
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,520
and hope for a miracle.

40
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,719
What's the likelihood
of his recovery?

41
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,960
It's very low.

42
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't be ridiculous.

43
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,410
He should live
since he received the surgery.

44
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,310
You should save him.

45
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,279
You're a doctor, aren't you?

46
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,410
Shouldn't you be able to save him?

47
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,819
You are a doctor!

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,550
Doctor.

49
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,720
Please save him.

50
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,120
Please save him, doctor.

51
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,860
- Save him.
- Father Kim.

52
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,490
He can live, right? Doctor.

53
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,459
Please save him, doctor.

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,699
Doctor!

55
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,050
Father Kim...

56
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:31,839
Aren't you...

57
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,509
Aren't you satisfied yet?

58
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,680
Why?

59
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,519
Why are you doing this to me?

60
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,959
Why?

61
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,899
Why are you making me go through
such a harsh trial?

62
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,939
How much more
do you need to take from me...

63
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,949
to feel satisfied?

64
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,519
How much more...

65
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,060
How much more do you need
to take from me?

66
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:47,410
Why are you being so cruel to me?

67
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,449
What more do you need from me?

68
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,040
It's late. You both should go home.

69
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,209
I'll stay by Sister Kim's side.

70
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,319
Father Han was like an angel.

71
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,860
He was the kindest man on earth.

72
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,689
Father Marco.

73
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,259
Let's go, Detective Seo.

74
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,139
Hey, did he die?

75
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:56,579
If you don't tell me
where the money is,

76
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll do the same thing
to all of your friends.

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,250
It's your choice.

78
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,990
Aren't you going to answer me?

79
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,959
Do you know what you did wrong?

80
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,389
What?

81
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,930
You messed...

82
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,069
with the person that should never
disappear from this world.

83
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,199
Are you drunk?

84
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,470
It's not just an act
of killing one person.

85
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,769
It's the same thing
as destroying this world.

86
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,939
Why do you keep talking nonsense
instead of answering my question?

87
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,120
I take back the week
I promised to give you last time.

88
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,289
I'll kill you...

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,429
the moment I see you.

90
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,070
Gosh.

91
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
It sounds like he's really enraged.

92
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,580
Then what about the money?

93
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,509
The money isn't
the problem right now.

94
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,580
The problem is
that we're wanted criminals.

95
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,350
Then what should we do?

96
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,049
We need to flee abroad.

97
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:12,519
And let's try to find the money
before that if we can.

98
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,389
Listen to me carefully.

99
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,600
Pay the guys so that they'll be able
to get by for a couple of months.

100
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,330
And shut down the company.

101
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,470
After that, I want you guys
to stay hidden for a while.

102
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,269
No, I'll take care of the company
after settling things with the guys.

103
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,509
Me too. We can't just stay hidden.

104
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,080
We can always start a business again
as long as we're alive.

105
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,179
So the important thing is
not to get caught and stay alive.

106
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,350
Do you understand?

107
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

108
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,820
But what are you going to do
from now on, sir?

109
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,019
I'm a wanted criminal.

110
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,889
And it's only a matter of time
before the same happens to you.

111
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,460
So we need to flee abroad.

112
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,000
What if they prohibit you
from leaving the country?

113
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,100
I'll call a guy I know
in Mullae-dong and ask him...

114
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,870
if he knows a trustworthy guy
who sells fake passports.

115
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:59,340
Are you going to use
a fake passport?

116
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:00,840
You need to hurry.

117
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,179
But I want to meet Lee Joong Kwon
before we leave.

118
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,409
We're in a bad situation, so why
don't you punish him next time?

119
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,779
I'm not trying to punish him.

120
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,080
I just need to set things straight.

121
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,289
Father Lee, are you listening?

122
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:22,830
If...

123
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,860
the Lord...

124
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:29,370
also takes Father Han,

125
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:33,669
wouldn't that be too harsh?

126
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,470
Even my heart breaks
because of what happened,

127
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,309
so imagine how painful
Father Kim must feel.

128
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:42,750
I really think...

129
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,450
he's been given
a harsh trial this time.

130
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:18,850
I must protect the people here
no matter what happens.

131
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,090
But in order to do that,

132
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,830
I must leave them.

133
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Lord.

134
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,970
I ask you to lead me
to the wilderness without any guide.

135
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,139
(Kim Seon Myeong)

136
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,679
(Letter of Resignation)

137
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,850
What's this?

138
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:57,490
Did you consult this
with your mentor?

139
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,460
I know a lot has happened to you.

140
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,559
But at times like this, you must
learn to seek the Lord's will...

141
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,470
by patiently praying and waiting.

142
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,429
I don't need to consult with anyone.

143
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,509
Father Kim.

144
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,399
Are you still searching
for Chief Prosecutor Kang,

145
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,700
Hwang Cheol Bum,
and Lee Joong Kwon?

146
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,039
Yes, the investigation squad is
looking for...

147
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,639
Chief Prosecutor Kang
and Hwang Cheol Bum.

148
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,909
And the NIS just took over
the case on Lee Joong Kwon.

149
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,710
They took over? Why?

150
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,080
They're going to have
a special team look for him.

151
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,850
They said it'll be quite difficult
for us to handle.

152
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,850
I guess they're right.
He has quick access to information.

153
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,289
So it won't be easy for us
to find him.

154
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,320
Gosh, I'm honored to have you visit
a shabby place like this.

155
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,559
Don't act up.

156
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,690
Can you get me
an unregistered van...

157
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,629
and fake passports
for four of us?

158
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,200
I can get you the van
without a problem,

159
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,029
but I'm done with fake passports.

160
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,570
From what I know,
your last deal was a week ago.

161
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,470
I quit it six days ago.

162
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,950
Then you can die
on your seventh day.

163
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,350
I guess I could do it again.

164
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,090
Yes. How long will it take?

165
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,120
- About a week.
- I want it done in three days.

166
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,840
I want you to make an access code
within an hour.

167
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,409
One with an IP address
that can't be traced.

168
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,850
What... What kind of access code?

169
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,820
- The place I used to work.
- The NIS?

170
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,289
I can't do that.

171
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,120
My life will be over
if I get caught.

172
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,990
Here's my messenger ID.
Send it to me once you're done.

173
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,559
But I already...

174
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,100
helped you with Gapyeong's
French village last time.

175
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,299
That was a request.

176
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,399
But this is an order.

177
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,309
You have one hour.

178
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,009
You know what will happen to you
if you take longer, right?

179
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:35,649
Yes.

180
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,019
Bye.

181
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,519
His cell phone's been turned off
since this morning.

182
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,519
According to Sister Kim,
he left early in the morning.

183
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:47,990
Where in the world did he go?

184
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,690
Ms. Park, there's something
I need to show you urgently.

(Mount Youngyu,
Wildlife Management CCTV)

187
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,610
This is killing me.

188
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,049
Is this...

189
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,649
It's footage of Jang Ryong
and his subordinate...

190
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,250
moving Father Lee's body.

191
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,429
Did Father Kim watch this?

192
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,730
We couldn't tell him yesterday
because of what happened.

193
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,730
And we couldn't tell him today
because we couldn't reach him.

194
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:29,570
First, let's arrest
this bobbed-hair punk.

195
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,929
Yes, Ms. Park.

196
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,000
And Ms. Seo, Father Kim
might turn his cell phone on,

197
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,610
so send this to him
and wait for him to contact you.

198
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
Okay.

199
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,210
And we should have armed police
guard the church, just in case.

200
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,450
Okay.

201
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,509
Cheol Bum and I worked so hard
to get Daebum Trading going.

202
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,710
It's gone at a single cast.

203
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,250
Long Dragon. Why the long face?

204
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,289
Why are you here
instead of eating jajangmyeon?

205
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,590
I'm sick of it.

206
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,830
Is it because I scare you?

207
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,970
No.

208
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,340
I got sick of it like magic.

209
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,500
And I don't have an appetite.

210
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:42,809
Follow me.

211
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,539
It's my break time.

212
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,750
Spare me just 20 minutes.

213
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,980
"20 minutes"...

214
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,950
Are you going to beat me up again?

215
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,289
Shut your mouth and follow me.

216
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,919
Hey.

217
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,690
He's on a scooter.

218
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,259
How should I follow...

219
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Here.

220
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,299
Deep-fried squid.

221
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,170
Eat all you want. It's half
price at the employee discount.

222
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:15,839
Why are you here?

223
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,910
Long Dragon was sick of jajangmyeon,
so I brought him here.

224
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,609
I can be sick of something
if I want.

225
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,750
Just eat, Long Dragon.

226
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,279
And don't be rude.

227
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,450
Why you...

228
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:34,289
You look down on me too now?

229
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:37,430
Here you go.

230
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,259
Eat up.

231
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,900
Are you buying me this...

232
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,170
because you feel bad about
beating me up?

233
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,240
What was that?

234
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,269
That tongue twister.

235
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,640
You made me do that.

236
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,480
Are you teasing me?

237
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,539
No.

238
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,480
I'm treating you
because you are my friend.

239
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:57,049
Who's your friend?

240
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,180
Anyone can tell
you're 12 years older than me.

241
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,490
Yes, you shouldn't
be friends with just anyone.

242
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,619
Give up on him.

243
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,289
How dare you talk like that,
you fat pig?

244
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,230
You know what?

245
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,930
You were my friend from the start.

246
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,470
Ever since I moved to
this neighborhood,

247
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,269
you were the first person
who talked to me.

248
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,769
"Where are you from, idiot?"

249
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,839
"Why are you here?"

250
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,349
I liked it, even if
you weren't nice.

251
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,549
Here's a deep-fried squid stick.

252
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,720
Eat.

253
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,990
Why are you so nice to him?

254
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,420
It's okay.

255
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,759
You got me wrong.

256
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,099
I didn't care about you.
I was lashing out.

257
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,329
I'll eat because you told me to.

258
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,779
- It's good.
- I know, right?

259
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,910
- Shall we eat too?
- Yes, let's.

260
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:08,720
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:14,289

267
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,039
You're embarrassing me.

268
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,740
We feel more embarrassed.

269
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,309

Father Kim did what?

335
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,720
Hello.

336
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,349
Let's sit down.

337
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,430
What is going on?

338
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,359
Father Kim...

339
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:21,670
handed in the resignation
to the monastery.

340
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,069
Do you mean he quit being a priest?

341
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,839
The monastery has procedures.

342
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,470
They won't have
accepted his request just yet.

343
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,339
But why...

344
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,750
I think he's determined to leave us.

345
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:37,450
He's doing this...

346
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,920
to keep us out of danger.

347
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,119
I think there's another reason
he wants to quit.

348
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:49,829
He might go after Lee Joong Kwon
and do something bad.

349
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,529
Something that shouldn't be
done as a priest.

350
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:56,299
No. He can't do that. He mustn't.

Father Kim...

356
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,309
might never be able to return to us.

357
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,059

00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,430

00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,150
but I'll leave a message, Father.

362
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,359
I learned something as a prosecutor.

363
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,230
The evil of this world
has no eyes or ears.

364
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:35,369
They don't care who the target is.

365
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,799
No matter how you
scream and ask why it's you,

366
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,769
it never answers.

367
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,940
What I want to tell you is,

368
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:49,509
all these bad things
aren't happening because of you.

369
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,819
They're just happening.

370
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,420
So...

371
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:58,589
don't blame yourself too much.

372
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,789
Okay?

373
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,109
Kim Hae Il?

374
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,880
How many years has it been?

375
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,990
I'm sorry to suddenly show up
to ask for a favor.

376
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:09,960
I need an emergency kit.

377
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,670
You know that only
current field agents can get one.

378
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,769
Please, sir.

379
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,779
Does it have something to do with
three of our agents...

380
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,220
that were attacked
in Wonil-dong today?

381
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,390
Yes.

382
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,089
Take it.

383
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,359
Chief Oh told me to give it to you
if you asked for it.
