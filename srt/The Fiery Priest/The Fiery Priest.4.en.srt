1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,970
Why on earth are those jerks
throwing a fit here?

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,650
Mr. Hwang's people
should never come to our church.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,380
You've learned nothing until now.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,349
What kind of church bans
certain people from coming?

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,120
Do you think those jerks...

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,160
will repent and live
according to God's will?

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,660
How dare you say that
in God's house?

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,429
It's our job and duty to wait
until they change...

9
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,070
even if they don't change.

10
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,000
There are so many people
who don't change even if we wait.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,270
Why should we live like that?

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,240
Do you think this world will change
if we keep waiting?

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,539
We need to get angry
when we have to.

14
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:36,979
There are people
who change the world...

15
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,009
by facing anger head-to-head.

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,009
We have to change the world
from where we stand.

17
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,780
How?

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,549
We only make those jerks feel better
when we bless them.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,890
We don't bless them
as if we give them candies.

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,590
It's like medicine that warms
their hearts which have gone cold.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,590
We have to wait.

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,000
Why do you keep saying that?
That's not everything.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,130
I didn't lead you
to the priesthood...

24
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,969
so that you can
face the world obstinately.

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,239
I wished you to warm people's hearts
with the pain you have inside.

26
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,739
My pain?

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,480
Hae Il.

28
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,480
It's your duty to...

29
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,349
abandon hatred and pain
and save others.

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,950
No.

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,659
It's my job to select good people
from the bad ones...

32
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,689
who are not even like humans.

33
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:45,439
Name.

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,709
Jang Ryong.

35
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,819
How dare you?
Tell me your real name.

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,689
It's Long Dragon.

37
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,489
Who told you to laugh?

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,099
You seem happy
with purple bruises on your face.

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
It's funny. I can't help but laugh.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,930
Long Dragon.

41
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,370
Come here.

42
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,039
I should hit your right side, so it
can match your left cheek's color.

43
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,039
Detective Seo.

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,710
Let them go.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
Pardon?

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,009
These guys did bad things
at the church and even harassed me.

47
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,050
Come on.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,849
When will you deal with big cases
if you focus on such little matters?

49
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:27,050
- Mr. Lee.
- Be quiet.

50
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,750
Let me go already.

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,419
Thank you,
Mr. Receive Your Punishment.

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,360
- Don't bring that up.
- Have you heard of Mr. Punishment?

53
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,860
Okay.

54
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,900
See you again, hip-hop girl.

55
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,500
Wear your helmets
when riding your bikes.

56
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,340
You never know
when I'll kick your heads.

57
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,009
Make sure to wear bullet-proof vest
also, hip-hop girl.

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,210
You never know...

59
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,550
when I'll stab you.

60
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,349
- That little...
- Don't, Detective Seo. Stop it.

61
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,050
Hey, hey.

62
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,860
It's her first day, so treat her
to something nice for dinner.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,620
Thank you.

64
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,960
What would you like to have?
There's a nice tripe place nearby.

65
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:16,699
- Mr. Hwang!
- Yes.

66
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,039
How can you ruin it like that?

67
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:21,409
I told you to take care of it fast!
Why did you make it worse?

68
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,770
I'm so sorry.

69
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,939
Don't be clumsy,
and get it done properly.

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,340
You remember
what Congressman Park said, right?

71
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,879
Forget about making money
in Gudam-gu...

72
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,879
if you mess it up.

73
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,430
Hoon Seok.

74
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,699
Do you believe that God exists?

75
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,539
If I commit too many sins,

76
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,139
will I actually go to hell?

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,909
Right?

78
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,650
Even if I go to hell,

79
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,520
I can just become the boss there.

80
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,250
That brat.

81
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:29,970
(This is Gudam Police Station.
The offender was released.)

82
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,000
(Please call us if you have
any question.)

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,689
I emptied my stomach.
I should fill it with dinner.

84
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,689
So this was it.

85
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,319
Gudam's Mr. Punishment.

86
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:57,600
Why are you looking up
such things?

87
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,500
I heard you were beaten...

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,870
by Exit Three Gang.

89
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,670
Anything can happen...

90
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,240
- while working as a cop.
- Mr. Koo.

91
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,970
This isn't just anything.

92
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,569
It's an embarrassing incident.

93
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,180
I wondered why you were
so small in front of them.

94
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,449
Detective Seo, the thing is...

95
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,879
every region has its own...

96
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,920
Where's everyone?

97
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,519
I asked, where's everyone?

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,990
I let everyone go.

99
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,230
What? Why?

100
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,259
I mean, it's not a big deal,

101
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,699
and it was just a small incident.

102
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,470
A small incident?

103
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,139
You call threatening a priest
and damaging properties...

104
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:40,139
a small incident?

105
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,740
I can't request an arrest warrant
with such a small matter.

106
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,939
Of course you should! You can't just
give a warning and let them go!

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,040
Why are you yelling, Father?

108
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,149
I was a fool to trust you guys.

109
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,220
No, actually,
I've never trusted you guys.

110
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,649
How can you be so predictable?

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,860
Excuse me, Father!

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,699
Fix the water purifier
before you go!

113
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,699
No!

114
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,100
I hate you too!

115
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,470
What's wrong with that priest?

116
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,269
I'll get going first.
Let's have dinner some other time.

117
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,639
Where are you going? You promised
to have dinner with me tonight.

118
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:18,910
Let's have tripe.

119
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:20,779
Detective Seo!

120
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,550
It's a really famous restaurant that
its ingredients run out really fast!

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,939
Hey.

122
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,649
Why are you calling me at this hour?

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,750
Right now?

124
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,100
It's not much different
from where you were, is it?

125
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,399
No. It's completely different.

126
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,440
Everything here blows.

127
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,409
Everyone's useless.

128
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,480
Why do you let
the bad people chew you up?

129
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,049
Sir.

130
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,690
Do you know what
a firefighter's number one rule is?

131
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,059
Yes. It's to save lives.

132
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,590
Save lives.

133
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,659
- Check it out.
- No.

134
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,639
It's to stay safe yourself.

135
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,570
Is it?

136
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:30,539
Then why are you a cop?

137
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:32,179
You should be a firefighter.

138
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,279
Scumbags will never disappear.

139
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,620
What?

140
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,289
If my death were to kill them all,

141
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,990
I'd have died long ago.

142
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,259
But it's not like that.

143
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,629
We must give up certain things...

144
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,029
and preserve our own lives.

145
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,200
Keeping the world turn well enough.

146
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,809
That is what a realistic cop does.

147
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,179
A realistic cop, my foot.

148
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,250
I'm leaving.

149
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,720
This just blows.

150
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,179
Anyone who isn't Korean is an enemy.

151
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:42,879
Shoot to kill, okay?

152
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,659
Heat this up to eat.

153
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:06,830
Don't skip breakfast.

154
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,009
Here you are.

155
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,539
- Why?
- Father Lee didn't lead dawn mass.

156
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,350
I can't reach him either.

157
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:29,389
(Violent Crimes Team 2)

158
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,200
Gudam Police Station
Violent Crimes...

159
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,559
Detective Koo Dae Young speaking.

160
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,669
What?

161
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,899
The phone is turned off.

162
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,940
Darn it.

163
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,509
The phone is turned off.
Please leave...

164
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,980
His phone's turned off.

165
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,279
Where did he go?

166
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,490
When did you last see him?

167
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:05,590
I didn't see him
after he went to bed.

168
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:08,259
He wouldn't disappear
without a word.

169
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,889
The phone is turned off.

170
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,179
What's wrong?

171
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,899
This just came in.

172
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,110
Father Lee of Gudam Church...

173
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,610
fell off a cliff on Mount Youngyu...

174
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,240
and was found dead.

175
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,179
Police are treating it as a suicide,

176
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,750
but so far...

177
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,750
they were unable to find
a note at the scene.

178
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,490
Father Lee was highly regarded...

179
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,159
Please be with him.

180
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,559
May the lamb
be blessed in your presence...

181
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,299
No!

182
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,759
No. It's nonsense.

183
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Wait.

184
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,090
No.

185
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,180
It can't be suicide.

186
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:56,410
The circumstantial evidence says so.

187
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,480
So do the shoes left on the cliff.

188
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,779
Someone else could've
put the shoes there.

189
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,950
That means it's murder.

190
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,690
Who would kill Father Lee?

191
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,660
What about Hwang Cheol Bum's men?

192
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,990
They could've kept a grudge.

193
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,930
They're not involved.

194
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
It was just a prank.

195
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,000
Then why did he kill himself?

196
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,470
He had dinner
and went to bed as usual.

197
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,539
There's no reason.

198
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,339
I'm sorry to say this,

199
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,210
but it's possible no one knew
the reason for his suicide.

200
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,240
It happens.

201
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,509
He spent his whole life
serving God and people.

202
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:28,450
He's stronger than anyone.

203
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,950
In Catholicism,
suicide is a huge sin.

204
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,450
Would Father Lee
commit such a huge sin?

205
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,650
There could be a reason
you don't know about.

206
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,220
There's no such thing!

207
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,519
Why do you keep yelling?

208
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,589
I request a proper investigation.

209
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,660
From the church to the cliff.

210
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,829
Check all the security and
traffic camera footage on the way.

211
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,130
I also request an autopsy.

212
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,029
You need something to justify...

213
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,940
an official investigation.

214
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,170
Checking camera footage
isn't an easy job.

215
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,180
We can't investigate
just to make you feel better.

216
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,339
Also,

217
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,009
we won't even get a warrant.

218
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:09,890
Look at this.

219
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,720
Identical bruises...

220
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,519
were found under both armpits.

221
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,089
There's no way...

222
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,029
they were caused by
falling over a cliff.

223
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,029
How could these appear?

224
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,329
I saw this when studying about
bruises and lividity.

225
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,200
When a body's
held tight before death...

226
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,769
To be exact, these bruises appear...

227
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,980
when a body's moved while
blood still flows before death.

228
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,410
Father Lee was moved
while he was still breathing.

229
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,950
And the topography.

230
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,190
There were big and small rocks
all the way to the top.

231
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,059
It's a hard trek even for
a healthy young man.

232
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,759
Does it make sense that...

233
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,029
an old man with worn kneecaps
walked up there alone?

234
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,700
Such bruises can be caused by
many other things.

235
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,259
And people with weak knees
can get there just fine.

236
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,900
Don't interpret the facts your way.

237
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,140
That's why
I'm asking for an autopsy!

238
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,009
What is your problem?

239
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,079
I apologize.
I don't know what to say.

240
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,190
Don't unexpected incidents
happen all the time?

241
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,920
Don't you try to defend him.

242
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,890
This won't solve the problem.

243
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,789
The church people
are demanding an autopsy.

244
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,759
This could become
a much bigger problem.

245
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,369
If we can't fix this soon,

246
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,500
we might have to give up our plans.

247
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,210
I will correct the mistake I made.

248
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,109
I'll come up with something.

249
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:38,480
How can we trust you again?

250
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,750
This time, I'll put
my life on the line.

251
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,019
Do you have an idea?

252
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Yes.

253
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,460
But I'll need you to...

254
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,160
help set things up for me.

255
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,730
Are you confident?

256
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,029
Yes.

257
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,430
As long as you can
guarantee success,

258
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,170
we'll back you up.

259
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,940
Brief us first.

260
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,769
But...

261
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,170
there'd better be no problems.

262
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:12,940
I understand.

263
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,779
You and I are linked spiritually.

264
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,980
So wherever you go
and however it may be,

265
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:53,849
we will always meet again.

266
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,190
This is what priests really
have to do, you know.

267
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,559
We have to find precious things
people lost.

268
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:29,089
Hae Il.

269
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,420
It seems like you're drinking alone,

270
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,289
so I'm writing
instead of disturbing you.

271
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,529
I'm sorry for
getting angry with you earlier.

272
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,369
I know your hurt better than anyone.

273
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,640
I may be older,

274
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,269
but I guess I haven't
grown spiritually at all.

275
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,539
This is the first time
I'm telling anyone this.

276
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,710
I get angry sometimes as well.

277
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,119
Many times a day.

278
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,759
But the reason I hold back...

279
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,130
is because I don't want
things to end with anger.

280
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,700
A priest's anger should be used...

281
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,799
solely to better the world
and the people.

282
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,740
But your anger...

283
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,170
is still only for yourself.

284
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:23,569
But one day,

285
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:28,180
you will anger for something.

286
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,549
With that,
I believe you'll do something...

287
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,279
no one else could.

288
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:35,920
Forget about that.

289
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,619
You'll be making faces
with a hangover tomorrow.

290
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,589
I'll cook bean sprout soup.

291
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,200
Enjoy it.

292
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,700
I love you, Hae Il.

293
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:18,960
Read this.

(Roadmap of
Father Lee Young Jun's Case)

295
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,839
Must we go this far?

296
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,079
We don't have to
if things get sorted out.

297
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,049
If it gets messed up,
we follow that plan.

298
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,380
Even so, how could we do this?

299
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,880
It's our superintendent's orders.

300
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,089
- Wait.
- What?

301
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,559
Why should I be in charge?

302
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,490
I got dragged in and came this far.

303
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,029
Don't you complain.

304
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:53,500
Won't you get promoted?

305
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,130
The others in your year
are above you.

306
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,130
Dae Young.

307
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,339
Sort this out well...

308
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,170
and get promoted two ranks.

309
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
I believe in you.

310
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,319
Why won't they do an autopsy?

311
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,289
The prosecutor won't say yes.

312
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,460
I explained the topography...

313
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,400
and movement and showed you photos.

314
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,569
Did you do that?

315
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,369
That's not nearly enough.

316
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,009
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

317
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,710
Why do you want to know that?

318
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,839
You can't see her.

319
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,910
Who's in charge?

320
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,049
Go away.

321
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,650
You can't keep pestering us.

322
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,950
- Who are you?
- I'm the superintendent.

323
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,319
Then you'll have gotten the report.

324
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,359
Why won't you investigate
or do an autopsy?

325
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,599
Do we exist to grant wishes?

326
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,329
We have to follow the principles.

327
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,769
The principles?

328
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,369
Since when did you
follow principles?

329
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,170
Even if you're a priest,

330
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,380
you can't say that about the police.

331
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,210
Would I if you did your job?

332
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,250
What?

333
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,980
If you say one more thing...

334
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,250
Father, come with me.

335
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,980
Let go. You people
don't do anything properly.

336
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,690
I have something to tell you.

337
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:27,089
Will you stop that priest
from coming here?

338
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,130
You went too far.

339
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,930
If you do this again,
you won't be let off lightly.

(Seoul Central District,
Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon)

341
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,680
I'm very sorry about...

342
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,250
what happened to Father Lee.

343
00:26:56,849 --> 00:27:00,490
You should be sorry that
you didn't allow an autopsy.

344
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,329
Did you hear my analysis?

345
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,829
I did.

346
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,700
Do you watch a lot of shows...

347
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,170
like CSI and so on?

348
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,839
If you say you have evidence...

349
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,539
based on knowledge from dramas,
you can go to prison.

350
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,009
I said it's evidence
because I'm sure it is.

351

Father.

352
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,910
You can't take hope for truth.

353
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,049
You're just so predictable.

354
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,250
You have no soul.

355
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,490
You're predictable yourself.

You curse so spiritually.

357

Did you think that if you showed up,

358
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,690
I'd feel something
and allow an autopsy?

359
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,599

00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,970
Don't touch me. I'll see myself out.

364
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,309
Once I do,
I'll call the media, diocese,

365
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,380
and the Vatican.

366
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,740
Do what you want.

367
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,549
Go on social media
and protest in the cold too.

368
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,750
I really hope
you don't get hypothermia.

369
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,319
Once more thing.

370
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,519
Don't come to our church anymore.

371
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,490
Why come to church
if you won't follow God's word?

372
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,089
Does a priest have the right
to send a believer away?

373
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,759
I have the right to refuse
like you can refuse warrants.

374
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,029
I strip you of your qualifications
as a Catholic.

375
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,769
In whose name?

376
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:21,369
Mine.

377
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,839
I'm stripped?

378
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,910
I'm stripped of my qualifications
as a believer.

379
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,779
That's just nonsense.

380
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,019
I'm low on sugar.

381
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,630
He's not there too?

382
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,559
All right.

383
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:50,529
How strange.

384
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,140
What is it? Is something wrong?

385
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,339
Yes.

386
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,609
It's about
the head of general affairs.

387
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,940
He's been out of reach
since yesterday.

388
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,940
There are
so many things to take care of.

389
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
Father!

390
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,619
- What's wrong?
- Take a look at this.

391
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,859
The provost of Gudam Church,
Father Lee...

392
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,660
is assumed to have committed suicide
by jumping off at Mount Youngyu...

393
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,430
because he couldn't endure...

394
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,140
the pressure he received
during the police investigation.

395
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,339
According to the police,

396
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,069
Father Lee was accused of sexually
molesting a female churchgoer,

397
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,910
embezzling the church's offertory,

398
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,609
and being on the racket.
He was being investigated secretly.

399
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:36,150
He's assumed
to have committed suicide...

400
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,980
because he couldn't stand
the pressure.

401
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,650
- The police have gathered...
- Goodness.

402
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,589
all the related evidence.

403
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:46,259
These guys are going
too far with this.

404
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,359
If it turns out that he actually...

405
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:50,960
molested the female churchgoer
and embezzled offertory,

406
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,460
and committed suicide because
he couldn't endure the pressure,

407
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,400
it'll be a shock to not only
to the religious community,

408
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,769
but to the public as well.

409
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:13,319
(The police that put citizens first)

410
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,460
I've never seen you smile.
What's the occasion?

411
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,390
(Guest star:
Anchorwoman Park Eun Kyoung)

412
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,099
(The Fiery Priest)

413
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,140
Everything's fabricated.
Father Lee was wrongly killed.

414
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,339
You know what kind of a person
Father Lee was.

415
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,579
How can you say that about him?

416
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,880
I let my guard down
because he's a priest.

417
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,009
How can a detective of Violent
Crimes Team let his guard down?

418
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:19,220
Everyone, you should be careful.
This priest beats people.

419
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,519
What are you doing here?

420
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,549
I'm here to send you
to a prison, Father.

421
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,049
You have to go somewhere with me.

422
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,720
I heard you quit,

423
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,759
but I guess you're back.
