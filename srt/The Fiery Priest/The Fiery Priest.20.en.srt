1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,240
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa
is the key point.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,379
If that's where Father Lee
was murdered,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,809
there must be crucial evidence left
like blood stains.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,179
The testimonies of Wangmat Foods'
employees are enough.

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,150
Let's get a warrant and move in.

6
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,550
Would we get a warrant?

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,890
Park Kyeong Seon...

8
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,420
will get in the way
and say, "No. No."

9
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,789
Right. So this time,

10
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,690
we must obtain and preserve
incriminating evidence.

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,929
It must be done in secret
so no one knows...

12
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,260
we came and went.

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,730
How about we use camouflage?

14
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,929
"You've never tasted
anything like this."

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,800
"Is this galbi or fried chicken?"
Something like that.

16
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:33,969
Don't mention that film around me.

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,810
I'll go with
an odd covert infiltration.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,380
You must make sure
no one knows about this.

19
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,079
The Pope said...

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,850
he won't help again
if something goes wrong.

21
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,420
Really?

22
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,850
Yes. The Vatican sent a letter.

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,320
Like Father Kim said,
an infiltration sounds best.

24
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,530
First, we need eyes on
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa.

25
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,299
There's something
I'd been wanting to ask.

26
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,500
Why are you doing this here...

27
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:06,299
when you could all meet
in the police station?

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,810
That's because there are
too many evil eyes and ears there.

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,609
- So...
- Okay.

30
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,519
Then this is the headquarters
of a special investigation.

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,189
Wow. That's fascinating.

32
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:27,959
Make this your main base
and use it when you must.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,159
Detective Seo. Detective Koo.

34
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,769
- Prepare to play Dedenchi.
- Dedenchi?

35
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,739
Palm up, palm down. That game?

36
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,840
We said, "Denji C orange C,
eat whatever you can."

37
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,010
"Cry, cry, or your socks
will fall down."

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,450
"Up, down, don't say
if it's broken, poop in a pot."

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,849
- It's not that.
- That's the wrong phrase.

40
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,620
Should I kill them all?

41
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:54,090
Can you stop?

42
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,120
- Denji C orange C...
- Up, down...

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,159
Stop!

44
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,230
Let's call it Dedenchi.

45
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,099
You people... I just have to shout.

46
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,500
Why should we do this?

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,870
Just do it. Then I'll tell you.

48
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,500
Play or you're out. Dedenchi.

49
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,229
It's freezing cold. Darn it.

50
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,900
I won't play
that game ever again.

51
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,000
Rock-paper-scissors it is.

52
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,699
This is a cartwheel.

53
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,509
And then...

54
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,939
What fools.

55
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,050
Yes, Father.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,150
His henchmen look like
they'll be here for a while.

57
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,560
They don't do much anyway.

58
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,060
- Any cameras?
- Two by the entrance.

59
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,060
Can I go back to the church?

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,199
Don't be an idiot.
No. Stay there until sundown.

61
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,069
It'll get as cold
as Siberia at night.

62
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,870
My mouth will freeze by my ears.

63
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,740
That's not possible.

64
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,340
Come to the church later.

65
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:23,639
I'll buy steamed buns.

66
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:25,080
Wait, wait.

67
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,650
2 red bean and 1 vegetable bun.

68
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,580
Why is he so greedy?

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,490
Watch how well she does.

70
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,689
Prosecutor Park can slice
anyone and anything.

71
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,889
You're the greatest lifesaver
of my political career.

72
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,129
Thank you.

73
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,330
I'm flattered. It was nothing.

74
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,530
Oh, right.

75
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,069
I told you someone out of office
dealt with Father Lee.

76
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:51,669
Yes.

77
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,639
That was Mr. Hwang here.

78
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,939
He's the one who
took out the priest too.

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,449
Oh, I see.

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,780
I am greatly impressed.

81
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,150
It was nothing really. Thank you.

82
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,389
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

83
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,590
Cheers.

84
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,899
Prosecutor Park,
do you need anything?

85
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,829
Anything you need, I'll grant.

86
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,370
It's fine.

87
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,300
I must make an urgent call.
Excuse me for a moment.

88
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,050
Yes, Ms. Park.

89
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:45,660
What? You want to question
Father Kim as a reference?

90
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,189
Mr. Hwang wants to...

91
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,089
sue him for
the Wangmat Foods incident.

92
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,730
They settled.
There's no need to question him.

93
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,360
Don't you know the priest's hurt?

94
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,800
He's hurt? How badly? Why?

95
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,769
Mr. Hwang made a move.

96
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,910
Is that so?

97
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,709
He's a pretty capable fighter.
I doubt he was badly hurt.

98
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,279
He was badly hurt.

99
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,379
He broke an arm and a rib
and is bruised all over.

100
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:11,980
I see.

101
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,949
Then tell him to get well soon.

102
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,629
"I see. Tell him to get well soon."

103
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,800
Her snarkiness has reached
a whole new level.

104
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,170
He ended up breaking
a few bones? My gosh.

105
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,040
What kind of a priest
doesn't care about his body?

106
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,579
I ruined my mood,
and my bowels are complaining now.

107
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,920
Are you done with the call?

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,459
You go do Gudam Church, don't you?

109
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,790
I wondered where we met.

110
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,930
And we meet again like this.

111
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,629
So? What did you do with Father Lee?

112
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,600
Why would you suddenly...

113
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:06,500
Why are you asking about that?

114
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,769
Tell me quick. From the church
to Mount Youngyu's cliff.

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,339
Pretty Ms. Prosecutor.

116
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:17,720
I'm sorry, but there are
trade secrets I can't reveal.

117
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,350
Please understand.

118
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,550
Since we're on the topic,

119
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,290
why did you release
Father Kim that time?

120
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,689
We wouldn't have this mess
if you'd locked him up properly.

121
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:31,360
Stop trying to look tough.

122
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you upset about something?

123
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,139
- You're a bit too rude...
- I'm a prosecutor.

124
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,870
Should I grovel to
a neighborhood thug?

125
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,480
The speak to me casually.

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Don't cross the line just because
we ate together once.

127
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,980
That's old-fashioned.

128
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,449
I don't like
crossing lines carelessly.

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,160
But they say when lapels touch,
a special relationship is born.

130
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,360
Hey, Hwang.

131
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:01,290
Do you know where the lapel is?

132
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:03,660
I don't.

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,759
It's this here.

134
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,100
For these to touch,
you must hug at least.

135
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,600
That means the relationship
is already very special.

136
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,610
Oh, gosh.

137
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,040
I learned something new today.

138
00:07:19,209 --> 00:07:21,050
When you're around me,
don't do two things.

139
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,279
Don't pretend to be tough
or close with me.

140
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,230
She's really tough.

141
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,269
My gosh.

142
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,670
Ms. Jeong made a comeback
after just one day,

143
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,240
and we met
Congressman Seong for nothing.

144
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,439
No.

145
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,509
We'll keep him in our loop.

146
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:53,410
Even after Ms. Jeong's back?

147
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,050
Let's replace her
at all costs this time.

148
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,819
Wangmat Foods became a problem.

149
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,689
Something similar
could always happen again.

150
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,660
- We must be prepared.
- How about...

151
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,959
I make a move this time?

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
You can't go in there. I said no.

153
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,569
Please leave.

154
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:18,970
I said no.

155
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,540
Don't.

156
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,439
Who are you?

157
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,639
We're from the Corrupt
Official Investigation Office.

158
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,350
So what?

159
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,449
We're here to investigate you...

160
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,179
for illegal hiring and favors.

161
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,720
- What?
- Take everything.

162
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,820
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,759
Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

164
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,429
What for?

165
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:46,360
What? That's impossible.

166
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,269
Okay, I'll be there in an hour.

167
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,009
Plump and chewy.

168
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,649
Badger noodles.

169
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,450
Come and have a badger.

170
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,019
Let me see.

171
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,059
No way, there are...

172
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,730
Two?

173
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:36,610
Come on.

174
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,320
They're leaving.

175
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,289
What did I eat to cause this?

176
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,259
Did I poop myself?

177
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,240
Can you teleport?

178
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,210
Why are you outside my place?

179
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,149
Why would I be here?

180
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,120
I came to give you this.

181
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,149
No thanks. I don't need it.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,789
It's not from me.

183
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:18,659
It's from the borough chief.

184
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,259
I'm just the delivery boy.

185
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:21,730
I refuse it. Send it back.

186
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,830
If you refuse to take this car,

187
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:27,700
Ms. Jeong will send me back
every day.

188
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,840
I guess I wouldn't mind that.

189
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,539
I get to see you every day.

190
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,440
What did I do in my previous life...

191
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,809
to have to see you every day?

192
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,710
Then will you accept this car...

193
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,580
or see me every day?

194
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:53,090
You must really hate to see me.

195
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,490
If that's all, leave.

196
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,960
Anyway,

197
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,769
this is a lovely car.

198
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,730
Drive it however you see fit.

199
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,090
My gosh.

200
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,700
It is lovely.

201
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,070
The wheel's nice and soft.

202
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,000
The seat's comfortable.

203
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,940
The headrest's comfortable.

204
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,950
My conscience is not, though.

205
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,049
Where is the lid to this thing?

206
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,690
She complained about
what I said to her,

207
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,889
but she started off with a car.

208
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,299
She did just as I expected.
She's complete trash.

209
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,000
I got the buns and am
heading to the church.

210
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,139
Almost everyone left.

211
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,710
The last janitor just left.

212
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,350
It's empty.

213
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,019
Okay. Keep watch.

214
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,649
Father. I wished I would never...

215
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,379
have to come here.

216
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,289
Please let this be the last time.

217
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,029
It's freezing cold.
Why isn't he here yet?

218
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,440
I hear a motorcycle.

219
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:26,769
What?

220
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,009
Who's that?

221
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,570
- Father.
- Father.

222
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,840
It's me.

223
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,909
Bayaba.

224
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,080
My goodness.

225
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,279
Gosh, Father, you look...

226
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,149
Wow, this is a 2,000cc bike.

227
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,250
It's a 600cc.

228
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,059
Where did you get it?

229
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,190
It's from God.

230
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,529
Does God give priests
motorcycles too?

231
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,830
Can I take it out?

232
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,360
No. Is everything okay?

233
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,200
Yes. The place is empty.

234
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,029
Call in if something happens.

235
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,929
It's for your ear.

236
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,340
I've never worn this before.

237
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,740
You went to Yongsan
Electronics Market?

238
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,870
Wear it already.

239
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,440
There are security cameras,
digital locks,

240
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,750
and security systems.
What about those?

241
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,379
I'll deal with those.
Just follow me.

242
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,220
They'll catch our faces.

243
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,750
My gosh, seriously?

244
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,129
Right. You could dress like a thief.

245
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,600
You want a priest and a detective
to pretend to be thieves?

246
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,169
It's not a bad idea.

247
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,940
Anyone would think you're a thief.

248
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,279
Just a moment.

249
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,909
What is it this time?

250
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,710
It's a lucky charm. Keep this.

251
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,620
What is it?

252
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,220
There's only one
per a noodle packet.

253
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,789
Once every 10 years, you get 2.

254
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,429
On such a day,
you're bound to get lucky.

255
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,899
- Keep watch for us.
- Okay.

256
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,330
- Keep it. It'll bring luck.
- No thanks.

257
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,100
When did you wash this?
It smells of something rotten.

258
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm so sorry.

259
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,039
- Good luck.
- It smells.

260
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,240
Good luck.

261
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,389
It's not too late.
I can do this alone.

262
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,019
I'm wearing a mask, so it's okay.

263
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,389
I've been in Violent Crimes
for years. This is nothing.

264
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,309
- What's that?
- A video signal jammer.

265
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,039
To mess with the cameras?

266
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,680
You did go to
the Electronics Market.

267
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,019
Put these on.

268
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,259
Foot covers to prevent you
from leaving footprints.

269
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,460
Forensics people wear these.

270
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,309
(Unlocking)

271
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,220
He gets cooler every day.

272
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,319
It's like an explosion
of sex appeal.

273
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,349
I'm asking because
I'm genuinely curious.

274
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,589
Did you learn this
in the College of Theology?

275
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,650
Yes.

276
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,789
We have to pick locks
to get into heaven.

277
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,160
I see.

278
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,589
There's a lock
to the door to heaven.

279
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,430
What a liar.

280
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,230
Mr. Hwang has a very poor taste...

281
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:47,759
in interior.

282
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:00,440
This room looks so empty.

283
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,849
What is this smell?

284
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
It's bleach.

285
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,529
It is. Bleach.

286
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,859
For the smell to be this strong,

287
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,059
they must have used a lot
to clean something.

288
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,269
Look at the marks.

289
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:26,769
There was a table here.

290
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,869
Here, here, here, and here.

291
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,140
It makes sense considering
where the couches are.

292
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,119
If it was...

293
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,390
What are you doing? Move.

294
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,599
Not to that side. This side.

295
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,140
No. Go over there.

296
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,009
If the table was here...

297
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,049
and if the table
was made of glass...

298
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,519
If you look at the back of his neck,
there are small scars.

299
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,630
The small ones gathered right here.

300
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,700
These can only be formed when
small chips of glasses are embedded.

301
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,160
But there can't be
any glasses near the cliff.

302
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,230
These must be lacerated wounds...

303
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,970
formed by broken pieces of glass
from somewhere else than a cliff.

304
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,420
Then you're assuming
that there was a glass table here?

305
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,690
But it isn't here now.

306
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,029
In other words,

307
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:01,099
the weapon used to murder
Father Lee is gone.

308
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,500
That's right.

309
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:09,940
Isn't that luminol? That's used
to detect traces of blood.

310
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,240
You're right.

311
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,140
Are you Doraemon? You carry around
all sorts of things.

312
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,250
You have everything in your bag.

313
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,920
By the way, if they cleaned
the floor with bleach,

314
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,259
we won't be able to use
the blood stain even if we find one.

315
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,990
It'd have been badly contaminated
that we won't get any DNA from it.

316
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,029
Blood cells don't last long
due to their unstable structure,

317
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,660
but DNAs last long because
their structures are stable.

318
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,569
Really? I've never
learned that before.

319
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,069
You learn all sorts of things
at the college of theology.

320
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,240
Here.

321
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,900
I wonder if it still has the DNA.

322
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,329
We'll have to give it a try first.

323
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,539
One thing for sure
is that this is a crime scene.

324
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,069
Three cars are
approaching the villa.

325
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,680
You should get out now!

326
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,380
Again? Why do they come
when we're trying to do something?

327
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,019
They're all getting out
of their cars.

328
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:27,849
Who are they?

329
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,650
Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon,
Hwang Cheol Bum,

330
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,490
Chief Jeong, and the henchmen
of Hwang Cheol Bum.

331
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:37,529
But I can't identify the man
who got out with Ms. Park.

332
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Darn it.

333
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,210
This is the best place to talk
away from people.

334
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,849
Please take a seat here.

335
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,019
You have a connection in the
Supreme Prosecutors' Office, right?

336
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,859
I do, but I'm not that close.

337
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,789
What about you, Ms. Park?

338
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,400
I have 2 friends from the 40th class
and a senior from the 39th class.

339
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,630
But I'm not that close to them.

340
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,970
So I guess we have
no connections at all.

341
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,099
What we have to check first
is who planned the whole...

342
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,579
Haven't you eaten?

343
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,609
Never mind, sir. Please continue.

344
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,450
What we have to check first...

345
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,349
is who planned the whole thing.

346
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,119
The planner knows that...

347
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,990
you don't have any connection
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

348
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,059
(Who's the one wearing glasses?)

349
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,089
(I don't know either.)

350
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,099
Then we have the answer.

351
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,099
(If we get caught, we'll all die.
Let's go.)

352
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,160
It must be Mr. Nam
and Congressman Park.

353
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,170
(If we get out now,
we'll get caught!)

354
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,970
(Let's get out! I want to get out!)

355
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,750
What is it?

356
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,380
It's nothing. I'll go and turn on
lights on the second floor.

357
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:13,460
- We'll go out through the window.
- You can't.

358
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,759
The henchmen are right
below the window.

359
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,359
What about other exits?

360
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:22,970
It seems like there's none.

361
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,789
(Why did you take my bag?
Give it to me.)

362
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,789
(You should've taken it
since it's yours!)

363
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:25,160
(Take it easy.)

364
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,700
(I'll go first,
so follow me carefully.)

365
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,039
Do you really think it's what
Mr. Nam and Congressman Park did?

366
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,809
There's no one else than them.

367
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,720
I'm really sorry, sir.

368
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,019
I'll go and use the bathroom.

369
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,890
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

370
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:03,000
The women's bathroom is in front
of the stairs on the second floor.

371
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,269
Got it.

372
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,569
The henchmen went into the annex.

373
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,039
I think you can exit
through the windows.

374
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,460
What did I eat today?

375
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,569
There's no tissue.

376
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:41,769
It must be here somewhere.

377
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:43,940
Here it is.

378
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,640
What's this?
There's only one piece left?

379
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
(The talisman.)

380
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,349
(You crazy jerk!)

381
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,119
(Throw it to me!)

382
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,119
(No way.)

383
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:03,690
I don't think one piece would be
enough no matter how hard I try.

384
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,369
Throw it.

385
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,440
What's this doing here?

386
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,750
Why is the toilet paper here?

387
00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:34,890
Oh, my. Oh, no.

388
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,930
Oh, no. I'm in trouble.

389
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,799
This is driving me crazy. Oh, no!

390
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,720
I lost the timing because
I was looking for toilet paper.

391
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,049
(Guest star, Jeong Si A)

392
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,269
(The Fiery Priest)

393
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,539
Detective and Father run away,
and the henchmen come after them.

394
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,740
What kind of situation is this?

395
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
(Find the masked hero.)

396
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,809
Someone broke into their villa
and stole a gourd bottle.

397
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,910
It's just larceny,
not special larceny.

398
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,910
Why are you worked up?
You're not even the thief.

399
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,880
People might think I'm one.

400
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,750
- You like Father Kim, don't you?
- What?

401
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,190
Go to a temple.
Temple foods are really nice.

402
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,089
It's a good thing.
I didn't like him anyway.

403
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,119
(Someone's going to die tonight?)

404
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,730
Eat it all, you pig.

405
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,890
What's wrong with you?
You're making me feel bad.

406
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,029
(The priest is on his way.)
