1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,569
If he committed suicide because
he couldn't endure the pressure,

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,440
it'll be a shock to not only
to the religious community,

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:05,809
but to the public as well.

4
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:07,450
What's the occasion for your smile?

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,170
Dae Young.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
Dae Young, are you okay?

7
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,009
Dae Young!

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,219
Swans?

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,490
Come on.

10
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,630
Dae Young.

11
00:00:58,729 --> 00:01:00,329
Darn it, he's here again.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,099
What's wrong with him?
Who did this to him?

13
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,239
Did you just...

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,540
How could a priest do this?

15
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,579
Then what about you guys?

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,510
Sexually molesting a female
churchgoer and embezzling offertory?

17
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,849
You should've at least
made it sound real.

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,650
How could you make up a story
so insincerely?

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,849
What do you mean?

20
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,189
It's the accurate result of
the secret investigation.

21
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,959
You don't know what
"monsignor" is, do you?

22
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,189
(Monsignor is an honorific form
of address granted to elder clergy.)

23
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,730
It's a title given to the holiest
and honorable clergy.

24
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,900
Father Lee was granted such title
by the Pope himself.

25
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,129
How could you dishonor
a man like him?

26
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,700
Whatever that word means,

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,700
if he committed crimes,

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,810
then he should receive punishment.

29
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,170
Just tell me the reason then.

30
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,439
What do you gain from this?

31
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:47,549
Why would you dishonor
such an old and weak priest?

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,409
Is it because of money?

33
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,879
Or is someone going to make you
the Commissioner General?

34
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:55,950
What kind of groundless accusation
are you making?

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,959
Dismiss him!

36
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,620
Arrest him and
request for a warrant!

37
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,629
- Yes, sir.
- You're under arrest...

38
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:02,629
for assaulting a police officer
and spreading false information.

39
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,400
I haven't spread it yet!

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,760
You are going to. On top of that,
you are also slandering the police.

41
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,800
Do you even have
any honor left for me to slander?

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,569
Come here, you jerk!

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,710
- Stop it, sir.
- Do you know who I am?

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,610
- Who are you?
- I'm the superintendent, you jerk!

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,009
Superintendent, my foot!

46
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,379
Father!

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,550
Salute.

48
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:30,889
My nose is clogged.

49
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,490
Sir, my nose is clogged.

50
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,090
Please give me strong antibiotics.

51
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:37,900
Sir, my nose is clogged.

52
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:40,770
- Hey!
- Hey!

53
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,270
- Call an ambulance!
- Let me go.

54
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,969
- Go!
- Come here, you!

55
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:46,770
Lock him up in the jail!

56
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,680
Who assaulted whom?

57
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
He hit the detective in charge.

58
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,310
It was because he wasn't happy
with the investigation result.

59
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:56,479
So you're saying...

60
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,780
that the detective was beaten
by the priest,

61
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,250
and the police requested a warrant
on the priest, right?

62
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,419
That's right.

63
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,360
I heard...

64
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,259
the detective's nose bled
in a butterfly shape.

65
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,129
The two men are causing
so much trouble.

66
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,729
Remove the ceiling,

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,800
and install air purifying system
all over the place.

68
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,099
Our kids with bright future
shouldn't inhale fine dust.

69
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,979
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, ma'am?

70
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,349
Our kids and I don't understand...

71
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,479
the situation.

72
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,719
This is what Father Lee
and I agreed upon...

73
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,590
a long time ago.

74
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,889
We decided that I'd take care
of this place and the other one...

75
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,889
once Father Lee passes away.

76
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,689
No. I've never heard of it.

77
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,129
Of course you haven't.
But it's true.

78
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,129
Father Lee...

79
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,870
was transparent with the management
of our orphanage, and...

80
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,270
Hello, children.

81
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:55,039
I'll make this place nice
for you all to live in.

82
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,740
I'll get you a lot of toys
and school supplies.

83
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,539
Got it?

84
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,379
Do I look scary?

85
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,620
Ma'am, why don't you
get them some pizza?

86
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:13,560
Don't buy something cheap.
Buy one with beef. What's it called?

87
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,830
Right. Get the steak combination.

88
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,199
Take it.

89
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,230
- Wait.
- Take it.

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,500
Buy them a lot, okay?

91
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,970
(Pharmacy)

92
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,370
He could've broken my nose.

93
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,910
My nose is the signature
of my features.

94
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,779
I let my guard down
because he's a priest.

95
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,250
If he weren't a priest,
when he attacked me,

96
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,519
I could've lightly avoided
his punch to the right...

97
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,019
and hit him with my wrist snap only.

98
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,389
I could've counterattacked him.

99
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,889
Like Floyd Mayweather.

100
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,129
Let me ask you this again.

101
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,230
Is the investigation result of
Father Lee absolutely true?

102
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:55,930
Of course, we investigated him
in secret for months.

103
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,470
But some things just don't add up.

104
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,740
I feel like it needs
to be reinvestigated.

105
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,939
You're so frustrating.

106
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,509
Trust your senior colleague's words.

107
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,079
If the investigation result...

108
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,050
is not true,

109
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,180
I'm going to quit my job.

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,449
I don't care
if it's a stable job for life.

111
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,689
Those who say such things
work hard for over 30 years.

112
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,670
(We'll work hard for our citizens
with warm hearts.)

113
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,709
Are you Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon?

114
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,279
Yes.

115
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm Lee Myeong Su, the team leader
of Violent Crimes Team.

116
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,589
Please remove your nose hair
before working.

117
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:53,089
You deal with civil complaints also.

118
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,430
I'll go remove it right away.

119
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,470
Where's the priest?

120
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,439
- Detective Heo.
- Follow me.

121
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,949
Goodness, Father.

122
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,250
You're a very dynamic priest.

123
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,920
What brings you here?

124
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,819
I came to put you in jail.

125
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,790
You came all the way here
to put me in jail?

126
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,529
Of course.
It's a very rare opportunity...

127
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,269
for a prosecutor to get a priest
locked up in jail.

128
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,730
This is a very new experience.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,839
Thanks to you, I'll also get to
experience something new.

130
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,439
What? I don't think it'll be
so pleasant for you.

131
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,240
You must not know
how much you'll suffer...

132
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,480
when you're dealing with
the Department of Justice.

133
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,410
I'll tell you how hard it gets
once I experience it firsthand.

134
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:51,250
Are you doing this
because your faith is that strong?

135
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,279
Or were you just born bold?

136
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,819
If you must know,
it's a mixture of both.

137
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,490
Unlock the door.

138
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,259
Come outside. I need to talk to you.

139
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,000
(Seoul Gudam Police Station,
Request for arrest warrant)

140
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,310
You should get new ink.
Why is it so blurry?

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

142
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,790
I just saved you, Father.

143
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,019
You save all the lost souls.

144
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,089
And I save thoughtless law-breakers.

145
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,160
It's nice, isn't it?

146
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,100
So what's your point?

147
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,040
You want me to call it even
and stay quiet?

148
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,800
You're really good
at summarizing things.

149
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,939
I'm doing you a huge favor.

150
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,709
If you let me out,
I might cause a bigger mess.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,310
Do you think you can deal with that?

152
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,079
Nothing will change
regardless of what you do.

153
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:57,949
Actually,
maybe one thing will change.

154
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:59,750
Your life will become complicated.

155
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,990
You're really good
at cursing a priest.

156
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,990
Since nothing I do
will be able to change anything,

157
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,529
just tell me.

158
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,100
Why did it have to be Father Lee?

159
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,660
I don't get the main point
of that question.

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,399
Why did it have to be Father Lee?

161
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,040
Maybe it's because
he committed a crime.

162
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,939
Up until a few days ago, he listened
to you confess your sins,

163
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,579
pardoned you,
and treated you with love.

164
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,009
How can you be so nonchalant?

165
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,550
Stop talking to me
like I'm your friend.

166
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,649
I'm a prosecutor.

167
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,919
I'm very strict
when it comes to criminals.

168
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,789
You may go now.

169
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm going to make them
do an autopsy first...

170
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:42,759
since that will prove everything.

171
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,929
Keep this in mind.

172
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,940
If you get yourself in trouble
and show up in front of me again,

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,200
I won't be easy on you
just because you're a priest.

174
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,480
Why doesn't he listen
until I'm done talking?

your nose has become.

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,460
You're a Violent Crimes detective.
Can't you defend yourself?

178
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,330
I never imagined that
a priest would punch me.

179
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,960
Are the investigation records
regarding Father Lee all legitimate?

180
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,529
Yes, they're all legitimate.

181
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,830
- Be more confident.
- Yes, they're legitimate.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,840
The woman who claimed
to have gotten raped.

183
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,539
The administrative director who
helped him embezzle the offerings.

184
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,970
- Do you have all the evidence?
- Pardon? Yes.

185
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,110
Then can I trust all the evidence
and wrap up the case?

186
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:42,250
The last thing you should be doing
is getting intimidated.

187
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,360
I'll be the one getting in trouble
if you don't do things properly.

188
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,190
And I assure you,
it won't be a pretty sight.

189
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:47,990
I'm sorry, ma'am.

190
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,759
Why do you have to ruin the mood
by getting me so worked up?

191
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:58,570
Stop being so clumsy, okay?

192
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,340
- Especially you, big nose.
- Yes, ma'am.

193
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,779
And I need you
to take care of something.

194
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,190
What is this nonsense?
Why won't you let us take his body?

195
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,090
We got orders
from the prosecution.

196
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,220
They think the corpse's condition...

197
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,559
- might get fabricated.
- Who in the world would...

198
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:20,360
That's complete nonsense.

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,990
You can take his body...

200
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,100
accompanied by the cops
on the morning of his funeral.

201
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,269
And you need to hand in
where you're planning to bury him.

202
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:29,769
What kind of nonsense is this?

203
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,870
Forget all this.
We'll be taking his body.

204
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,509
Father, things will get out of hand
if you do this.

205
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,769
Father.

206
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,009
We even need to stand guard
for stuff like this?

207
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,309
(Chapel of Rest)

208
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,419
Prosecutor Park gave us orders
to stand guard.

209
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,220
Why did she release the priest
in the first place?

210
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,519
We had no reason
to keep him locked up.

211
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,159
What do you mean
we had no reason?

212
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,230
He broke my nose...

213
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,769
He's here.

214
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,769
We have a code red situation
in front of the chapel of rest.

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,509
Didn't you hear anything
from the hospital administrator?

216
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:11,509
I did, but I don't care.
So get out of my way!

217
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,080
I really don't want to do this,

218
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,480
but you're really
giving me no choice.

219
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,519
You should turn on the power first.

220
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,889
Oh, right.

221
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,889
Father, you're only making things
difficult for us.

222
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,620
Am I supposed to care about that?

223
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:28,289
Hurry up and get over here!

224
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,299
Sir, what exactly is a code red?

225
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,330
Code...

226
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,600
Do you not watch American dramas?
Just try to understand the context.

227
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,940
A priest is currently
trying to steal a corpse.

228
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,710
Steal? Did you seriously
just say that? Get over here.

229
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,169
Father.

230
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,149
See? This is why I said it was
a code red situation. An emergency.

231
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,820
You all should be careful.
This priest hits people.

232
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,590
Most importantly, be careful
not to get your noses hurt.

233
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,559
Brothers, please take a step back.

234
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,490
You're the one
who should take a step back.

235
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,759
You'll get yourself in a mess
if you keep doing this.

236
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:04,559
Do you want to see which one of us
will end up in a bigger mess?

237
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,970
Look at the way
he's flexing his fist.

238
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,340
You should hold your anger.
Let's just go back for today.

239
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,470
He's right, Father.
You should leave at least for today.

240
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,139
No.

241
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,909
If you come closer,
I'll pull the trigger.

242
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,480
- I'm going to count to three.
- Go ahead and pull the trigger.

243
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,720
Do you think you'll be able
to knock me out with that?

244
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,750
One.

245
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,950
Two.

246
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,590
Father.

247
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,350
He got released?

248
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes, the prosecutor in charge
released him.

249
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,850
Why would they let that lout free?

250
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,149
Who's the prosecutor in charge?

251
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,419
She gets direct orders
from Chief Prosecutor Kang.

252
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,590
Chief Prosecutor Kang?

253
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:08,789
But why...

254
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,460
I don't get it.
Gosh, why can't we work in harmony?

255
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:16,600
Yes, sir.

256
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,799
Yes, sir. I see.

257
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,539
Yes, I'll be there tonight.

258
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,039
Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Bye.

259
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,850
Gosh.

260
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,950
Darn it. These jerks
really won't leave me alone.

261
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,049
Father.

262
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:46,330
Father.

263
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,500
Are you okay, Father?

264
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,899
Gosh, it stings.

265
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm going to count to three.

266
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,539
One.

267
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,639
Two.

268
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,419
He was supposed to count to three.

269
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,350
Did he shoot after counting to two?

270
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,659
Let's go back to the church.

271
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,559
No, wait. Stay here and rest.

272
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,700
I need to go somewhere.

273
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
What if you get stunned
with a stun gun again?

274
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,129
No, I'm not going to the morgue.

275
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,039
(Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Korea)

276
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,850
There's nothing I can do
to help you at this point.

277
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
It's such a serious issue.

278
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,389
Are you saying we should just leave
Father Lee's body there?

279
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,330
We can't do anything
until the archbishop...

280
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,029
makes an official statement.

281
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,870
Father, this isn't a simple case.

282
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,070
Everything was fabricated.

283
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,870
Father Lee died a wrongful death.

284
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,200
Father Kim.

285
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:02,269
If you claim...

286
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,940
that he's innocent
without having any clear evidence,

287
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:09,009
you might get harshly criticized
by the press and public.

288
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,820
You should be careful
of what you say.

289
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,519
I'm being...
I'm already being very careful.

290
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,649
Why won't you believe me?

291
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,720
You need to check the facts.

292
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,559
Father Lee is already dead,

293
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,929
so it'll be hard to accurately
check the facts.

294
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,830
As for now, we decided to trust
the police's announcement.

295
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,169
I have nothing more to say to you.

296
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,840
- Are you serious right now?
- Lower...

297
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,480
your voice, Father.

298
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,649
- We should go.
- Let me go.

299
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,580
Let go! Don't you know what kind
of a person Father Lee was?

300
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,950
He sacrificed his entire life
for the Lord.

301
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,190
How can you say that?

302
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,559
How can you do this to him?

303
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,990
Let me go! Let go!

304
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,759
Hurry up and let me go.
I said, let go!

305
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,059
Darn it.

306
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,830
They're just hoping
this won't spread anymore.

307
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,600
It's a sensitive topic,

308
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,840
and he committed suicide,
the biggest sin of all.

309
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,940
You know he's not the type
to commit such sin!

310
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,720
Who are they?

311
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,519
We are in front of Gudam Church.

312
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,929
As you can see,
there is no one here.

313
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,759
Some of the church members are here!

314
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,259
(The scene at Gudam Church)

315
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,899
Wait a minute!

316
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,370
Sexual molestation
and offertory embezzlement...

317
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,769
have been discussed.

318
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,169
Were you two unaware of this?

319
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,580
You can't be certain...

320
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,409
How did he embezzle the offertory,

321
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
and where did he use it?

322
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,279
Was it used to bribe someone
in regard to the molestation?

323
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,019
Molestation?

324
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,049
That's ridiculous.
Please watch what you say.

325
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,250
Do you have anything to say
to the female victim?

326
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,389
How will you apologize
to the believers?

327
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,960
No, wait.

328
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,930
You just said no.
Are you denying these charges?

329
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,200
Are the members of the church
trying to hide something?

330
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,769
- Please stop and leave.
- What do you say?

331
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,000
- Leave!
- One word, Father.

332
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,509
- Hold on!
- Stop it!

333
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,539
- Leave!
- Please!

334
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,440
- Stop filming! Stop!
- Wait!

335
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,740
The priest whom I met today...

336
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,410
was nothing but an evil individual
of the church.

337
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,519
This was Oh Bo Young of UBS News.

338
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,490
No matter how handsome he is,
he looks ugly on TV.

339
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,289
He committed suicide.

340
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:33,920
What was that face?

341
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,160
Can you add more sugar?

342
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Is it bitter?

343
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:41,269
Well, not really,
but I'd like it to be sweeter.

344
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
Okay. Two teaspoons?

345
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,039
- 3?
- 3?

346
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,809
I think my face looked better.

347
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,940
The priest whom I met today...

348
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,039
was nothing but an evil individual
of the church.

349
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:58,380
Aren't they taking this too far?

350
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,519
What did he mean by
"an evil individual of the church"?

351
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,460
Did you all hear
about the orphanage?

352
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:09,029
We did.

353
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,130
We were just talking about it...

354
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,400
before we saw him on the news.

355
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:20,740
Did Mr. Hwang really say that?

356
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:23,509
Yes. It was already settled...

357
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,579
with Father Lee.

358
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,079
What kind of garbage is that?

359
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,210
Father Kim.

360
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:33,319
I understand that you are angry,

361
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,490
but please watch what you say.

362
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,059
Did he say anything else?

363
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,960
He said he'd do anything
the kids wanted.

364
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,430
Now, he's lying to the kids.

365
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,299
Father Kim,
please watch what you say.

366
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,740
Then should I say that
he did something very holy?

367
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,569
Sister.

368
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
Should we tell him?

369
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,509
About Father Lee's request?

370
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,650
What is it?

371
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,849
You know how Mr. Hwang's men
came here and caused a scene?

372
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,089
But we told you that...

373
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,059
they came here for fun because...

374
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,630
they considered Father Lee
a pushover.

375
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,230
But that wasn't true?

376
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,799
Tell me. Please?

377
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,799
Fine.

378
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:26,970
I won't get mad, so tell me.

379
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,369
Well...

380
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,380
When Father Lee came...

381
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,150
Right. Please make sure
Father Kim...

382
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,049
and Mr. Hwang's men never fight.

383
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,420
Okay?

384
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,089
Also, you cannot tell him
that his men are here...

385
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,059
regarding the consignment operation
of the welfare facility.

386
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,960
If he finds out, he'll explode.

387
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,329
Okay?

388
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,200
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

389
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,730
I told you.

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,839
He made sure we didn't tell you.

391
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:01,269
Then you should've
at least told me this morning.

392
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,410
I... I didn't have the time.

393
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,039
Don't be ridiculous. You could've
told me during our mealtime, break,

394
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,609
or on your way to the bathroom!

395
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,319
Goodness.

396
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:19,990
I'm facing the biggest crisis
of my church life.

397
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,190
What should I do?

398
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,559
I'm sorry to ask you
for a trifling favor.

399
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,170
Not at all.

400
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,900
Anything you ask me for is
of utmost importance.

401
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,000
Thanks for thinking that way.

402
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,640
By the way,

403
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,339
why was that young priest released?

404
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,150
I was afraid that If
we acted too harshly,

405
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,380
we'd create a strife
with the religious community.

406
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm sure you made the right choice.

407
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,319
Sir.

408
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:52,690
About the evidence regarding
Father Lee's doings,

409
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,730
who mapped it out?

410
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,789
I don't think it was the cops.

411
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,160
There's this guy
at the Gudam-gu office.

412
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,799
Do you want to meet him?

413
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,829
It's okay. I was just curious.

414
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,369
Make sure you wrap this up well
and gain their favor.

415
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,539
The chief prosecutor has taken
a liking to you.

416
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,480
If you do a bit better,

417
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,880
I guarantee that
you'll get an easy life.

418
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,619
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Cheers.

419
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:47,410
Hello? Have you been well?

420
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,009
It's me, Kim Hae Il.

421
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:54,789
I see that you tried hard.

422
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,690
If you did well from the start,
we wouldn't have come to this.

423
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,029
I'm sorry, sir. I'll make sure
not to make such mistakes again.

424
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,859
Nevertheless, I liked your plan.

425
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,500
My men complimented you as well.

426
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:11,170
Thank you, sir.
You can ask me for anything.

427
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,640
I'll map them out perfectly.

428
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,809
This means we can immediately
take over the operation...

429
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:15,910
of the orphanage, right?

430
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,009
Yes, sir. You can start right now.

431
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,180
Make sure you don't make
another mistake again.

432
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,950
If that happens, that'll be the end.

433
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:24,920
Understood, sir.

434
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,450
This wasn't planned, you know?

435
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,950
But now that Father Lee is gone,

436
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:33,690
a huge burden has been lifted
from our shoulders.

437
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,390
Sometimes, unexpected events
work in your favor.

438
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,900
Let's say that the man up there
has helped us.

439
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,059
Amen.

440
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,170
Why are you still standing there?
Are you going to join us?

441
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,410
It's okay, sir.

442
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,839
You may leave.

443
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,039
Yes, sir. Please enjoy your time.

444
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,789
You did well in there,
listening to those old men.

445
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,000
Darn it.

446
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,930
Look at you. You're steaming.

447
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:18,900
I'm sorry I couldn't cover for you.

448
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,839
They live off of the crumbs
that I spill.

449
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:26,440
How dare those dirtbags say
that they'll forgive me?

450
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,980
I'm telling you.

451
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,809
When it's time,
I'm going to kill them myself.

452
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,480
You can do whatever you want
when that time comes.

453
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,220
But before then,

454
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,019
we have to listen to them.

455
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,390
Oh, right.

456
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,059
Award me something
from the gu office.

457
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,859
It can be the Good Citizenship Award
or whatever.

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,029
What for?

459
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:47,259
If I'm going to
take over the facility,

460
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,230
I should have something to my name.

461
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:55,569
Sure.

462
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,880
I'll make you a nice award.

463
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:02,049
The ceremony will be
grand as well. Okay?

464
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,789
How long has it been?

465
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,430
Was the last time we met
for the Wirkistan Operation?

466
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,960
What have you been doing lately?

467
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,529
It's the same old.

468
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,529
I'm always wrestling with bodies.

469
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,630
I heard you quit your job.

470
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
I guess you went back.

471
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,710
What's this about that
you're disguised as a pastor?

472
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,440
It's not a disguise.
I'm Father Michael.

473
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,809
That was quite funny.

474
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,380
Agent Kim is now a priest?

475
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,450
It's true.
Michael is my baptismal name.

476
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,789
Will I be meeting you next year
as a monk?

477
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,089
You'll have to shave it all off.

478
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,359
I'm telling you the truth!

479
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,299
Why can't you trust a priest?

480
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Are you being serious?

481
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,400
Are you telling me that Agent Kim,

482
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,940
who destroyed 11 terrorists
with a single sword,

483
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,970
is now a pastor?

484
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:06,240
- I'm a priest, not a pastor.
- Right, a priest.

485
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,940
We'll talk in details later.

486
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,910
We need to go somewhere.

487
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,349
I'm definitely up for some drinks.

488
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:14,819
Not that.

489
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:16,789
Your hands are always trembling
from drinking too much.

490
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,859
Why did you have to
become a pastor?

491
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:23,160
I'm a priest, not a pastor.

492
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,000
They're the same.

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,029
They're completely different.

494
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,329
Goodness.

495
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,170
(Chapel of Rest)

496
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,369
That body looks severely marred.

497
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,240
He fell from a bike,

498
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,440
and his face was
run over by a truck.

499
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,920
Judging from the damage
done on the occipital bone,

500
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,619
his death is caused
by an external shock.

501
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,119
We can only be sure
after the autopsy,

502
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,660
but the cause of death
seems to be a hemorrhage.

503
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,059
His body suffered
from multiple fractures.

504
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,930
It's only natural
as he fell off from a cliff.

505
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,170
But this is the main cause.

506
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,109
If you look at the back of his neck,
there are small scars.

507
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,079
The small ones gathered right here.

508
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,579
Here. If I magnify them,

509
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,910
they are in small straight lines.

510
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,519
These can only be formed when
small chips of glasses are embedded.

511
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,150
Oh, right. About the wound
on the inner side of his arm,

512
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,960
it could've been formed due to
a strong force that grabbed him...

513
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,029
before he passed away.

514
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,859
But it could be
because of his old age.

515
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,000
What do you think?

516
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:09,500
I think the former one
sounds more plausible.

517
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,769
A bruise made because
he was grabbed by someone.

518
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,069
Can we get a warrant
with this much information?

519
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,809
We would've gotten one
already by the book.

520
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,680
But they're scheming the whole thing
and even guarding the corpse.

521
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,210
It doesn't seem like a small case.

522
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,380
What's taking them so long?

523
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,819
Who?

524
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,690
The guy who's supposed to
move the corpse.

525
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:33,720
It's been over 10 minutes already,
but he's still not here yet.

526
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,190
10 minutes?
