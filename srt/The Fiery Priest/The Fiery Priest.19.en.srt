1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,639
Hold him.

2
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:22,230
Let's end it for all today, Father.

3
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,140
My goodness.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,140
I hit him right at the spot,
but he's still conscious.

5
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,679
You really are sturdy.

6
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:40,310
Just lie down, you jerk.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,390
If you left without causing any
trouble when I went easy on you,

8
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,469
you'd have saved your life,
and I wouldn't have wasted my time.

9
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,099
How great would it have been?

10
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,340
Why did you have to
complicate things?

11
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,879
Hey.

12
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,049
Are you laughing?

13
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,819
Are you laughing right now?

14
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,260
You wouldn't be able to laugh soon,

15
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,129
so go ahead and laugh.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,170
You should go now.

17
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,629
Go and say hello...

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,239
to Father Lee for me.

19
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,810
Who are you?

20
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,950
We got a report that a wild boar
burst into the warehouse.

21
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,790
- What?
- Well...

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,489
We might have to
search around a little.

23
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,489
What's this?

24
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,430
I don't think we have to.

25
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,329
Gosh, it must hurt so much.

26
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,199
Let's go.

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,539
Where do you think you're going?

28
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,539
Stop right there.

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,349
Report to the cops,

30
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,949
and tell them we need
two ambulances.

31
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:29,949
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,520
Yes, Dong Ja.

33
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,090
He'll be quiet for a while.

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,689
Yes, okay.

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,330
Bye.

36
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:42,270
The Grim Reaper
in charge of the priest...

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,099
must've taken the day off today.

38
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,409
Let's go.

39
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,180
(Do not urinate.)

40
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,719
Father Kim. Father Kim!

41
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
Father Kim.

42
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,229
- Call... Call an ambulance.
- Okay.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,360
Gosh.

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,530
Father Kim. Father Kim, wake up.

45
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,370
What... Father Kim.

46
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,009
I'm not going to die.

47
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,909
Goodness, Kyeong Seon.
You really are amazing.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,520
People's opinions about the chief
of borough have changed completely.

49
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,319
Young people do have better insight
when it comes to dealing with...

50
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,590
the press and the web.

51
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,259
Older people like us
aren't so very good at it.

52
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,919
It's actually become a lot easier...

53
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,560
to manipulate the public opinion
compared to the past.

54
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,090
That's what's so interesting.

55
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,259
With the development
of the internet and media,

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,199
you'd expect that people
would become smarter.

57
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,430
But they get fooled more easily.

58
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,099
And even when the truth
comes out later on,

59
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,210
they don't admit
that they got fooled.

60
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,409
Why? Because they're embarrassed.

61
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,580
Not only do they not admit,

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,009
but they also attack the truth
because of their embarrassment.

63
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,180
Exactly.

64
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,319
And we just have to
put that to our use.

65
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,090
By the way, we'll no longer
have to worry about that priest.

66
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,490
Remember the guy...

67
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,960
I told you about last time
that took care of Father Lee?

68
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,329
It seems like he dealt
with the priest.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,029
What do you mean?

70
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,870
He beat him up so much
that he's half dead.

71
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,500
Well, that's that.

72
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,310
I called you here to tell you
something important.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,509
Kyeong Seon.

74
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,410
Oh, yes. Please tell me.

75
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,290
My gosh. Goodness, you startled me.

76
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,399
It's Yo Han and Song Sac.

77
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,870
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I didn't get badly injured.

78
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,110
I hurt my head,

79
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,639
so I had to get stitches.

80
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:05,379
But I'm okay.

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,250
I'm more worried about you,
Father Kim.

82
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,050
Your hand got injured even worse.

83
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,850
You fractured your 3rd and 4th rib.

84
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,019
And your entire body is bruised.

85
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,850
Fortunately, that's it.

86
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,959
Father Kim.

87
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:21,060
I need to go back
to the convenience store...

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,089
because it's time for
the new products to arrive.

89
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,459
I also need to get up early
to move the ingredients...

90
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,930
and clean the restaurant.

91
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,399
I'm sorry, you guys.

92
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,240
No, don't say that.

93
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,439
Father Kim, we helped
because we wanted to.

94
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,569
Right?

95
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
- You jerk.
- I'm sorry.

96
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,079
Yes, you guys should go now.

97
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,850
And make sure you buy painkillers
on your way back.

98
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,220
- Okay.
- Let's go.

99
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,300
I know it hurts,
but doesn't it feel nice?

100
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,230
We did something huge.

101
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,629
You shouldn't let Jang Ryong
mess around with you anymore.

102
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,430
Just fight back, okay?

103
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,870
I won't...

104
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,269
get beaten up,
but I won't fight back either.

105
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,149
I need to work hard, earn money,
and send that to Thailand.

106
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,910
If I get hurt,
I won't be able to work.

107
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,319
But you still need to show
that you're angry.

108
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,920
You can't always let them
mess around with you.

109
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,189
A person who doesn't know
how to get angry is a fool.

110
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,459
But a person who chooses
not to get angry is wise.

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,029
Does that mean I acted like a fool
earlier at the restaurant?

112
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,569
Yes, so don't get angry from now on
for my sake.

113
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,100
You'll get hurt again.

114
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,040
Okay, fine. I'm the fool.

115
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,980
Live the rest of your life
letting them mess around with you.

116
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,480
- Hey, Yo Han.
- Let go of me.

117
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Yo Han.

118
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,360
Yo Han.

119
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,540
Kyeong Seon, would you like to
become a member of our group?

120
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,310
If you officially become a member,

121
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,139
you can go from Seocho-dong
to Yeouido and Hyoja-dong.

122
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,879
You can go wherever you want.

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,949
And of course,
you'll get paid more than enough.

124
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:23,779
What do you say?

125
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,449
It's a huge honor, sir.

126
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,149
But can you please
give me some time?

127
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,290
Are you trying to play hard to get?

128
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,060
No, sir.

129
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,100
It's just that I need to take care
of some stuff first.

130
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Then I should give you time
to do that.

131
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,370
But don't take too long.

132
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,519
(Father Tsunami Kim)

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,790
It's weird for me to call him.

134
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,060
How much did he get injured?

135
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,560
Gosh.

136
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,100
What's wrong with you today?

137
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:20,569
What?

138
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,370
You sacrificed yourself
to rescue Detective Seo.

139
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,180
Then you made a report
and saved me.

140
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,810
And now, you're feeding me
abalone soup.

141
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:29,180
Did you choose to spend all day
doing nice things?

142
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,620
Yes, that's right.
I woke up this morning...

143
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,450
and set a goal to do just that.

144
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,990
Come on. Tell me why
you're being like this.

145
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:43,929
Well...

146
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,629
Well, the thing is...

147
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,200
If I didn't do anything,
someone would've gotten hurt.

148
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,940
That's why. There's no other reason.

149
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,750
- What are you going to do from now?
- What do you mean?

150
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,080
Are you...

151
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,350
going to continue doing nice things?

152
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,419
Or are you going to continue
being Cheol Bum's minion?

153
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,460
Let's not talk about him.

154
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,899
Gosh.

155
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,669
Goodness, Detective Koo.

156
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:26,100
You don't need to be in front
of the cross to atone for something.

157
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,970
Going back to where
you first started...

158
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,940
and choosing to walk
the right path...

159
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,750
is also an act of
atoning for your sins.

160
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,620
You should finish up.

161
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:47,330
No.

162
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,629
I want to go downstairs.
Can you get me a wheelchair?

163
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,299
What a relief.

164
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,740
Her fever's gone, and she's slowly
regaining her consciousness.

165
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,169
Why didn't they treat her with
good medicine from the beginning?

166
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,080
We should make Wangmat Foods...

167
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,350
pay for the rest
of her medical expenses.

168
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,450
Now that I see Eun Ji,

169
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,950
what you said to me
finally feels like reality.

170
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,289
What? The fact that
we at least got a half point?

171
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:30,899
(Ledger)

172
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,950
Check the names of the people
and firms that are in the ledger.

173
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:47,620
You might find
Cheol Bum's connections...

174
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,019
or additional information.

175
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
There's never a moment
when he's not cool.

176
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,960
(Ledger)

177
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,500
(Feb 5, 7pm: Business trip to
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa)

178

183
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,759
(Sunwoo Hospital)

184
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,230
What did I tell you?

185
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,570
I constantly told you to be careful.

186
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,769
I told you again and again
that you'll get yourself in trouble,

187
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,940
but you never listened.

188
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,769
Now, look at what happened to you.

189
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,370
Okay, I get it. I'm very sorry.

190
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,480
But your nagging is hurting my ears.

191
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,750
Look at all those scars
on his handsome face.

192
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,980
It must hurt so much.

193
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,179
Weren't you with him, Detective Koo?

194
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,389
It... It would've been nice
if I was there to fight with him...

195
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,820
He came late because
he had to catch a robber.

196
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,429
If it weren't for him,
things would've been even worse.

197
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,799
I knew it. This time again.

198
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:08,100
Thank you, Detective Koo.
Thank you.

199
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,899
You didn't look nice at first sight,

200
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,639
but as I get to see you more...

201
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
What?

202
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,710
Goodness, Father.

203
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,250
You got more scratches
than I thought.

204
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,250
This is...

205
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,990
how my boss feels.

206
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,360
It's a special set.
It costs 100 dollars.

207
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,159
Why did you come to the hospital?

208
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,629
You should just go today, Mr. Jang.

209
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,029
I'm not here today
to pick up a fight.

210
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,169
As our boss is so busy,

211
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,669
I came here to give his word
on behalf of him.

212
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,940
It's the same as you give a word
in your church.

213
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,340
I don't want to listen. Get lost.

214
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,549
Listen to me carefully, Father.

215
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,980
If you play smart one more time,

216
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,950
my boss will make people prepare
for the funerals of you,

217
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,250
the part-timer at the convenience
store, and the Thai delivery guy.

218
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,549
You really...

219
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,129
Are you feeling bad?

220
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:10,429
I should go now then.

221
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,700
That punk.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,129
I'm worried about you.

223
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,370
That evil gangs.

224
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,779
Father Han, please start
the discharge procedures.

225
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,850
No. You need to stay here longer.

226
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,850
No, I'm fine.

227
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,279
I'll get changed at the church
and go to the station, so go first.

228
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,919
Don't tell me you have pain
in your back later.

229
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,019
I won't.

230
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,529
Wait a minute.

231
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:46,100
Before I go to church,
I need to stop by at one place.

232
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,509
Why?

233
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,149
(You're a coward who hits
from the back.)

234
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,129
(You're a coward who hits
from the back.)

235
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,700
What a jerk.

236
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,500
Is that true?

237
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,539
Superintendent Nam
and Congressman Park?

238
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:29,340
Yes. I think they met
Congressman Seong Dong Cheol...

239
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,539
to make him a new candidate
for the chief of borough.

240
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,610
I'm speechless.

241
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,750
I guess it finally started.

242
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,750
Let's make the new player
play an exhibition game.

243
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,230
This is the message the Pope
sent himself at dawn.

244
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,870
I heard unfortunate news.

245
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,240
The behavior of Father Michael...

246
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:03,009
to save Father Gabriel
is becoming a problem.

247
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,610
I heard that public opinion
is not favorable.

248
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,779
We need to put
the national laws first.

249
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,950
If a legal problem occurs in Korea,

250
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,250
the Vatican cannot help you.

251
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,289
Please mind your words and behavior.

252
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,830
If a problem occurs again,

253
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,860
I will stop putting my trust
on Father Michael.

254
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,370
Any further measures...

255
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,899
on Father Gabriel would stop.

256
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,269
Father.

257
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,440
The news yesterday is not
Father Kim's fault.

258
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,179
I will keep in mind...

259
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,779
of what the Pope said.

260
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,950
Park Kyeong Seon.

261
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,029
(Gudam Police Station,
Superintendent Nam Seok Gu)

262
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,330
What's this?

263
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,029
These are materials on Nam Seok Gu,
Gudam Police Station Superintendent,

264
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:00,860
and Park Won Mu, the congressman
in Gudam Borough.

265
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,000
Aren't these two
among your party...

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,539
of Gudam Borough?

267
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:07,710
That's right.

268
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,139
I'm going to do
an interim evaluation...

269
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,139
to check if they're really qualified
to be a family.

270
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,580
Analyze those carefully.

271
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,879
Yes. I understand.

272
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,279
It's a little bit strange, isn't it?

273
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,279
You wonder if you're shooting
to an ally.

274
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,450
No, it's not.

275
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,190
You know,

276
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,620
I like treason, but I hate traitors.

277
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,129
You understand that, right?

278
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,190
Yes.

279
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,860
I'll check these out in detail.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,210
People say everyone has a skeleton
in their closet,

281
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,710
but their closets are made of
skeletons in the first place.

282
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,049
If I follow my decision,

283
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,149
I'd like to take
all the responsibilities...

284
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,820
and leave the office
of chief of borough.

285
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,860
However,
as people of Gudam...

286
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,220
and netizens want,

287
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,259
I...

288
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,289
will reverse my resignation...

289
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:07,559
and stay at the office
of Chief of Gudam Borough...

290
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,170
once again.

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,440
Her comments are all so
a piece of dirt.

292
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,369
Gosh.

293
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,849
(Prosecution says, "It's not illegal
and we're investigating properly.")

294
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,460
What?

295
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,720
Are you going to have a new member?

296
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,589
Why are you being so sensitive?

297
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,900
She's not a member yet.

298
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,960
She's about an intern for now.

299
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:44,369
- Who is it?
- You know.

300
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,869
The one that helps us among
Chief Prosecutor Kang's juniors.

301
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,609
She took care of my business
so neatly this time.

302
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,309
She also stabbed
that priest in the back.

303
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,579
You can exchange greetings
with her later.

304
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Dong Ja.

305
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,950
You didn't bring her
as you don't trust me, did you?

306
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,619
How can you say that?

307
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,359
She's working in a totally
different field from yours.

308
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:12,700
You're right.
Our fields are different.

309
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:14,970
It's fine then.

310
00:18:15,069 --> 00:18:18,140
You should fill up the hole made
from Wangmat Foods.

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,670
You should save money
not to get the blame.

312
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,069
Right.

313
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,369
I need to fill up that hole.

314
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,039
That's my job.

318
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,559
You go around filling up holes
every day...

319
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,890
and take all the blame.

320
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,559
Aren't you sick of it honestly?

321
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,700
I'm just taking care of you.

322
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,000
Are you?

323
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,640
What are you going to do if I say,
"We'll risk our lives."

324
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,240
I'll be on the front line.

325

You're saying nonsense, you punk.

326
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,019
Are you going to be on the front
without me, you punk?

327
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,779
I get it.

328
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,160
Let's see.

329

330
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,960

Who's the woman
my husband is with?

333
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,569
Long hair and burgundy lipstick.

334
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,009

and cowboy boots.

female energy overall.

the name of the motel is...

340
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,059

356
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,940
and you're selling junks here?

357
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,539
She made a reservation.

358
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,750
And you will take care
of that part, I guess.

359
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,180
Shut up.

360
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,819
In two weeks, apply for a foundation
and make one quickly.

361
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,089
Do it as fast as you can.

362
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,920
I didn't get the orphanage yet.

363
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,059
Did the ones in the ranks allow it?

364
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,329
You punk. It's an order. An order.

365
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,230
You shouldn't do that.

366
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,829
If I listen to what you say
and get in trouble...

367
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:01,930
Just do as I say.

368
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,569
Master!

369
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,940
Who told you to think...

370
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,440
about if that makes sense or not?

371
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,779
Don't beat him!
You'd better beat me!

372
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,509
Are you really going to be beaten?

373
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,279
I will show Master my enlightenment.

374
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,349
Ukha!

375
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:25,859
Ukha.

376
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,059
Hey.

377
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,690
Wait a minute.

378
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,200
Help me!

379
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,730
He must be possessed
by an evil spirit!

380
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,039
Ukha!

381
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,160
Gosh, really.
What can you get from that?

382
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,259
Detective Seo, wake up. Wake up.

383
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,099
Take this off.

384
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,400
Go to the women's lounge
and sleep comfortably.

385
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,569
It's okay.

386
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:18,410
Isn't this the copy of
Wangmat Foods' ledger?

387
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,539
What are you doing with these?

388
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,180
Father Kim wanted me
to check on some things.

389
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,680
Why did he have to
spread himself so thin?

390
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,589
Why would you put it that way?

391
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,019
It'd be good to secure a list.

392
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,160
Father.

393
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,490
What happened to your face, Father?

394
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,490
I had a fight with Hwang Cheol Bum.

395
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,859
If you look this bad,
then he must be in the ICU.

396
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,299
- He's in a bad shape.
- I bet he is.

397
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,769
Bad shape, my foot.
He's totally fine.

398
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,339
He hit Father Kim first
from the back.

399
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,910
That cowardly jerk.

400
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,109
How dare he hit Father Kim's face?

401
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,440
I'll go and get them this second.

402
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,079
Don't get worked up.
You can do that next time.

403
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,680
- Did you find anything new?
- That's not what's important!

404
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,950
It is important
to find something new.

405
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,450
Yes, I found something new.

406
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,990
I found something suspicious.

407
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,359
Take a look at this.

408
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,500
(Feb 5, 7pm: Business trip to
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa)

409
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,000
"Feb 5, Business trip to..."

410
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,769
"Hwang Cheol Bum's villa."

411
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:19,740
Feb 5 is...

412
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,670
That's the day
Father Lee passed away.

413
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,079
- Where is the villa?
- According to its registration,

414
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,910
it's located on the outskirts
of Gudam, Gyowae-dong, 37.

415
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,750
How far is it from the place
where Father Lee's body was found?

416
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,849
It's 1.2km far.

417
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,549
1.2km? That's very close.

418
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,740
This must be it.
I'm getting the vibes. This is it.

419
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,339
Let's go. Let's go get them.
Let's go fight.

420
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,500
Let's go!

421
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,569
What is it? What are you up to?
You're making me nervous.

422
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,079
What happened?

423
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,509
There's a great duck restaurant,

424
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,910
so we were checking its location
on the map.

425
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,289
So you like a grilled duck.

426
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:10,619
My gosh.

427
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,619
What happened to your face, Father?

428
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,289
Why are you acting like
you don't know?

429
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,759
You got the call
from the paramedics.

430
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:20,130
It must've been obvious.

431
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,500
Tell me how the grilled duck is
after you taste it first.

432
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,769
(Violent Crimes Team 2)

433
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:30,740
He's just saying that
out of embarrassment.

434
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,410
- Detective Seo.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,980
Find the whereabouts of
Wangmat Foods' Ki Yong Chan first.

436
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,019
I'll go alone today.

437
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,819
Why?

438
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,359
You can work with me only when
you make your stance clear.

439
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,190
I can't work with someone
whose identity is uncertain.

440
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,630
One more thing. Reflect on yourself
and think about what you've done.

441
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,299
I'm off now.

442
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,869
- Father Kim.
- What?

443
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:00,599
Call me if anything unusual happens.

444
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,509
Since many are keeping an eye
on me, I'll be at the church.

445
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,079
Good.

446
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,819
Does that mean you're broke?

447
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,359
Darn it. Then what should we do?

448
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,200
You said we'd go to Guam together.

449
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,599
- Don't you remember?
- Don't worry.

450
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,630
I have so many
secret bank accounts.

451
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,700
Really?

452
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,170
What shall we do at Guam?

453
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,509
When we are at Guam...
Can't we just live there?

454
00:25:38,509 --> 00:25:40,440
Shall we? Shall we live there?

455
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,009
I'd love that.

456
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,950
Then...

457
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,880
we'll go out of touch
once we reach Guam.

458
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,390
- Right.
- Then...

459
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,819
they'll never hear from us.

460
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:54,759
They'll never hear from us.

461
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,059
You're so funny.

462
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,069
Don't say such things.
That annoys me.

463
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:07,839
Sorry? I already paid a third
of the hospital fee.

464
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,210
I'll pay the rest even if I have to
borrow money from loan sharks.

465
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,809
Take a seat. I'm here
to talk about something else.

466
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,839
Okay.

467
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,980
I'd like a glass of ssanghwacha.

468
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,079
- Okay.
- Hurry.

469
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,119
Why did you deliver food...

470
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,990
to Hwang Cheol Bum's villa
on Feb 5?

471
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,329
Pardon?

472
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,759
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa
on Feb 5.

473
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,029
How can I remember that?

474
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,670
You must remember it since
it's related to Hwang Cheol Bum.

475
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,140
I'm not sure. I must've delivered it
because they made an order.

476
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,750
Of course you must've delivered it
because they made an order.

477
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,819
That wasn't the point
of my question.

478
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:00,619
Who delivered the food?

479
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,690
I can't remember.

480
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,029
Here's your ssanghwacha.

481
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,299
It's still hot.

482
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:10,500
Thank you.

483
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,809
Gosh, it's hot.

484
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,859
Do you want me to make you
drink this in two seconds?

485
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,430
Only then you'd be able to remember.

486
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,829
Did just the two of you go there
on that day?

487
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:47,000
Yes, there wasn't much to deliver,

488
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,910
so just the two of us
could cover it.

489
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,440
Around how many servings
did you deliver?

490
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,910
It was a meal for 3 to 4 people,

491
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,779
and some snacks for wine.

492
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,819
What kind of snack suits wine?

493
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,519
- Pardon?
- Hey.

494
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,190
I'll just have soju then.

495
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,460
What was it like at the scene?

496
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,930
Hello.

497
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,730
- Many people were guarding,
- Will you hurry up?

498
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,500
and it looked like people of
high ranks were inside.

499
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,069
Who was inside the villa?

500
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,470
We were in the living room.

501
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,240
- All right.
- I only saw Mr. Hwang...

502
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,410
- Sounds good.
- and his employees.

503
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,450
Don't be late.

504
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,380
And I took a peek at the room
when Mr. Hwang entered it.

505
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,190
There were two more people
in the room.

506
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,890
Were they men or women?

507
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
They were men.

508
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,160
You didn't get to see
the people in the room?

509
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,089
No, they told us to stay outside
when they had their meal.

510
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,130
Did anyone new come to the villa?

511
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,099
Oh, right. Before we left,

512
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,430
one more person came.

513
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,839
I couldn't see him clearly.
I only saw the back of his head.

514
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,940
Can you remember anything else?

515
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,880
I think it was a man.

516
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,049
His back hair was long.

517
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,750
He had grey hair. Right?

518
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,750
Yes.

519
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,859
And also,

520
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:15,829
I could tell he was an old man
from the way he walked.

521
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,140
I think they're talking about
Father Lee.
