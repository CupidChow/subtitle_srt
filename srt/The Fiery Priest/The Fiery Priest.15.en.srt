1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,280
I'll make this place...

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,049
the chapel of Maegakgyo.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,949
A priest hit someone.

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,160
It's Satan!

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,359
A priest hit someone!

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,899
Father Kim!

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,350
How could you cause a mess again?

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:43,109
- Are you okay?
- Of course I am.

9
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,950
But who's that man with the hat?

10
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,359
A man with the hat?
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,670
This is the diagnosis
of the CT scan.

12
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,180
A strong force hit his forehead,

13
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,140
making him lose his consciousness.

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,379
The reason why he lost
his consciousness...

15
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,219
seems to be the temporary
malfunction of the brain.

16
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,349
What's the final diagnosis?

17
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,359
Cerebral concussion.

18
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,730
What is cerebral concussion?

19
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:31,760
It's a concussion.

20
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,870
A concussion?

21
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,000
That's when...

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,870
you get dizzy and feel like
throwing up, right?

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,769
Yes, according to the test result,
nothing's wrong with him.

24
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,680
He can be discharged
as soon as he gets up.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,739
But...

26
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,409
(Emergency ward)

27
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,420
But why did you have to make it
sound so serious?

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,090
My voice is actually deep.

30
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,290
I won't go with you, Grandpa.

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,000
Is he sleeping with his eyes open?

32
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,329
Grandpa.

33
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:09,099
I won't go with you.

34
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,740
I should've been beaten
until I fainted.

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,539
That could've been the final blow.

36
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:21,449
I was really worried thinking
you might be seriously hurt.

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,620
Those who are enlightened...

38
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,020
have a high bone density.

39
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,360
So getting hit doesn't hurt me.

40
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,060
Ukha.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,129
I think with a clip from
the video I took,

42
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,229
we can more than sue him.

43
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,000
How dare a priest swing a bat
on someone?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,069
He's just given up to be a priest.

45
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,740
If he gives up,

46
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:52,280
then he can get married.

47
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,479
He should get married.

48
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,949
- Get married?
- He can be a groom.

49
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,289
- Give me your phone.
- My phone? Okay.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,719
I took a great video of him.

51
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,659
If a priest doesn't know how to
hold back, that makes him Satan.

52
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,729
Satan!

53
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,569
My phone is not here.

54
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,740
Come on. It's not the right time
to joke around.

55
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,039
I'm not joking.

56
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,770
My phone is not here.

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,409
- Look for it.
- Okay.

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,379
I'll go and look for it.

59
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,819
What do I do?
Where did it go?

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Darn it!

61
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,490
As you know,

62
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,000
Father Kim is hot-tempered.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,169
He has anger issues.

64
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,639
He couldn't even
control his anger...

65
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,669
in the orphanage
and swung the baseball bat.

66
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:55,340
That's when I thought,
"This isn't right."

67
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,740
I ran to him right away...

68
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,840
and got hit by the bat.

69
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,550
You sacrificed yourself
and got hit by the bat.

70
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,050
It's a good thing in many aspects.

71
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,789
Thank you, Detective Koo.

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,949
Thank you, Lord.

73
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,060
That's right.

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,159
I also think
Detective Koo did a great job.

75
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,589
Otherwise, terrible things
could've happened.

76
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,430
I'm upset about what Mr. Ki did,

77
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,569
but I support you.

78
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,399
On the verge of death,

79
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,040
wisdom and agility
will give you strength.

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,009
Oh, right.

81
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,939
The lady who looks like
the stepmother of Snow White...

82
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,879
took a video of what happened.

83
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,350
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ki.

84
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,180
(State Maegakgyo as
the state religion.)

85
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:44,519
- Stop crying.
- "Stop crying."

86
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,959
It's nowhere to be found?

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,689
I can't find it anywhere.
Please just kill me, sir!

88
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,600
I'm so sorry!

89
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,670
Hey!

90
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,139
Oh, gosh.

91
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,139
Ukha!

92
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,339
Oh, gosh.

93
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,379
Darn it!

94
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,879
It doesn't matter.
Don't worry about it.

95
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,050
No, Father Kim.

96
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,449
This could lead to
a very serious situation.

97
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,350
Goodness, what are we going to do?

98
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,720
All the cult believers are
going to swarm into our church.

99
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,589
I... I have something to say.

100
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,240
Doesn't that cell phone
belong to the evil woman?

101
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,199
My goodness.

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,470
No, wait.

103
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:38,509
Did you steal it?

104
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,810
Well, not... Not exactly.

105
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,379
But then again, I guess
you could say that.

106
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,250
I just couldn't stay still.

107
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,360
I... I saw her
taking a video, you see.

108
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:06,769
Goodness, the fact that you didn't
return it to her...

109
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,339
means that you stole it.

110
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,740
Goodness, Lord.

111
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,180
Does...

112
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,110
Does that mean I've become
a sinner now?

113
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,220
Lord.

114
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,319
This is crazy.

115
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,089
You didn't steal the phone.

116
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,360
You just found a lost cell phone
at the orphanage.

117
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:30,259
And then, you just...

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,899
gave it to a police officer.
Correct?

119
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,670
Yes... Yes.

120
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,139
Goodness, that's great.
That was very natural.

121
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,670
Yes, everything about it
was very natural.

122
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,079
My goodness.
Thank you so much, Detective Koo.

123
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,610
Thank you, Lord.

124
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,519
I work for the people,
so it's only right for me to help.

125
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,620
What a bunch of nonsense.

126
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,290
My goodness, what's wrong with him?

127
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,560
Everyone's trying to help.
Why is he so perverse?

128
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,300
He's always like that.

129
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,800
You should be more understanding.

130
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,139
- Okay.
- Okay.

131
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,339
- Hey.
- Detective Koo, did you hear?

132
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:21,910
- What?
- Ms. Park Kyeong Seon apparently...

133
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,019
got sent to the office in Yeongwol.

134
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,519
- Do you know why?
- No, I don't.

135
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,889
I just overheard Mr. Lee
talk about it.

136
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,259
Okay, thanks for the news.

137
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,329
Will you guys please
stop being so clumsy?

138
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,029
Especially you, Detective Koo.

139
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,069
I knew something bad would happen
the moment she started acting up.

140
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,040
How bad did he hurt his head?

141
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,579
He got hit with a baseball bat
like this.

142
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,220
I think he should go
to the hospital again.

143
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:04,689
(We welcome back Park Kyeong Seon,
the daughter of Yeongwol.)

144
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,189
Why is there so many?

145
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,160
There are two more boxes.

146
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,000
Goodness, it is her.

147
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,870
She's our friend's daughter.

148
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,170
Look at you.
You're Kyeong Seon, aren't you?

149
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:23,910
Don't you remember me?

150
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,810
I'm Soon Nam's dad.
We used to be next-door neighbors.

151
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,879
Gosh, she's become so successful.

152
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,420
No wonder her dad's so proud of her.

153
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,480
Exactly.

154
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,519
You should've told us
that you'll be here.

155
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,190
You came back so successful.

156
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,659
My goodness.

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,559
Stop treating her like a kid.
She's a prosecutor now.

158
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,299
Excuse me. I'm working right now.

159
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,429
- So...
- It's really nice to see you.

160
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,830
Shouldn't we have beef tonight?

161
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,539
Yes, we should gather everyone.

162
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,909
You've never had beef here,
have you?

163
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,440
The beef here is really the best.

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,539
- That's right.
- Gosh.

165
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,519
Do you know how
fighting dog owners...

166
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,049
tame their strongest
and most violent dog?

167
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,460
They pour boiling hot water
into the dog's mouth.

168
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,429
Then they force it shut
and make sure they can't open it.

169
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,830
And that makes the dog
go through severe pain.

170
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,539
They're in pain, and the insides
of their mouth get burned.

171
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,899
And a couple of their teeth
fall off as well.

172
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,610
But what's interesting is...

173
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,450
that the moment they let them
spit the water out,

174
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,850
they become very obedient.

175
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
So...

176
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,159
are you saying you'll put boiling
water inside Kyeong Seon's mouth?

177
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,389
Goodness, it must be so hot.

178
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,830
It won't be that hot.
It'll just sting a little.

179
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,399
You didn't tell Mr. Hwang...

180
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,700
about inviting Kyeong Seon
as our new member, right?

181
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,240
Of course not. I didn't tell him.

182
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,269
Good.

183
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,909
Fighting dogs tend to be
very obsessive...

184
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,379
when it comes to
protecting their turf.

185
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,220
Why did she have to
lose her cell phone?

186
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,120
- I'm sorry, Mr. Hwang.
- Gosh, just shut it.

187
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm not going to let you
plan anything from now on.

188
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,840
I hope everything's okay
with Wangmat Foods.

189
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,610
How badly is that place
getting managed?

190
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,610
There's always something
happening over there.

191
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,779
That priest is apparently
going to come again tomorrow.

192
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,049
He looks like a pretty boy.

193
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,490
He's Satan that's disguised
as a priest.

194
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,029
I heard...

195
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,830
Ms. Park Kyeong Seon
got sent to the office in Yeongwol.

196
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:00,970
Why?

197
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,769
You never know what might happen
to you when you're a prosecutor.

198
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,700
She's probably getting punished
for acting up.

199
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,539
Why are you telling me that?

200
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,039
She used to come to this church.

201
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,409
Do you not care about the people
who come to this church?

202
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,480
No, I don't.

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,379
Where are you going to go now?

204
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,649
I'm done for today. You can go.

205
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,720
People at the church
are worried about you.

206
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,090
You should be more careful
from now on.

207
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:30,759
What I'm doing right now
requires a little bit of risk.

208
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,129
And who said you could lecture me?

209
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm not lecturing you.
It's because I care...

210
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,639
You care?

211
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,500
You care about me?

212
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,470
What a joke.

213
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,340
Gosh, you really have a way
of stomping on a person's sincerity.

214
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,480
You're not the type to protect
or care about others.

215
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,820
You're right. I'm not.

216
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,259
But I do worry about people
even if it's not that much.

217
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,759
Do you think
I'm a psychopath or what?

218
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:12,399
Gosh, why is he the one
getting angry?

219
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,370
(Lawsuits in Yeongwol)

220
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,009
They're all lawsuits
regarding land development.

221
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,480
Yes, you're right.

222
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,110
They said hot spring water
was going to come out.

223
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,779
But later on,
they went back on their word.

224
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,320
And then, they said hot spring water
was going to come out again,

225
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,590
so a lot of people
bought land there.

226
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,389
But then, they went back
on their word again.

227
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,120
So people are fighting
saying it was a scam...

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,529
and blaming each other
for what happened...

229
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,629
That's enough.

230
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,899
I'm going to rest today.
I'll start working tomorrow.

231
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,269
- Where's the accommodation?
- The accommodation... Well...

232
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,570
We do have an accommodation,

233
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,440
but the boiler broke down,
so it's under construction.

234
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,669
The room is freezing.

235
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,070
So...

236
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,580
you'll have to stay somewhere else
for a few days.

237
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:56,610
Where?

238
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,649
(Sejong Motel)

239
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,289
It may be a little old,
but it's fine as long as it's quiet.

240
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,330
I'm going to kill you both today.

241
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,059
What do you think you're doing?

242
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,830
You're going to die today.

243
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,269
- Please.
- Get over here.

244
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,370
Please...

245
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,009
Unbelievable.

246
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,690
Ms. Park Kyeong Seon apparently
got sent to the office in Yeongwol.

247
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,519
What are you going to do
if the pope...

248
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,230
checks up on how you're doing?

249
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,759
"What have you done until now?"

250
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,799
Father Lee.

251
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:51,340
Please help me get to my senses
as soon as possible.

252
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:05,980
Gosh, it popped.

253
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,190
It's gross.

254
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,490
Gross.

255
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:19,559
Why is a cockroach
as big as a squirrel?

256
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:22,730
Gosh.

257
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,509
Prosecutor!

258
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,379
Prosecutor!

259
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,210
Who is it?

260
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,580
It's us. We're your dad's friends.

261
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,990
I told you that I don't need
a welcoming party.

262
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,919
We can't just let the day go by.

263
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,159
We made a reservation at
a barbecue restaurant, so let's go.

264
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,789
Gosh, it's okay.

265
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:51,960
Plus, I'm a vegetarian.

266
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:53,659
What did she say?

267
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,299
She said her stomach's
about to burst.

268
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,100
Her stomach's about to burst?

269
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:00,740
- Her stomach shouldn't burst.
- No, it shouldn't.

270
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,009
Can you please just go?

271
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,710
Hurry up and just go!

272
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,309
What did she say this time?

273
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:09,279
She says her back hurts.

274
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,879
Her back shouldn't hurt.

275
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:14,750
All right. We're leaving.

276
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,789
She resembles her father.

277
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,259
She has a temper.

278
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,919
- I guess it hurts a lot.
- Right.

279
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,190
It's so delicious.

280
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,100
I need to go on a hunger strike
again tomorrow.

281
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,899
Goodness. For what reason this time?

282
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,139
The law to record pro-Japanese
group's past deeds.

283
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,909
I need to oppose it.

284
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,340
Those crazy punks.

285
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,879
Why would they
do such a useless thing?

286
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,080
That should not happen.

287
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,210
Why would they record things
that happened in the past?

288
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
It's a waste of tax.

289
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,850
And about the president of the food
distributor that caused trouble.

290
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,850
Yes?

291
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,120
I heard he's a nephew
of Maegakgyo's leader.

292
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,460
Yes. That's right.

293
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,029
Don't ever let it become an issue...

294
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,759
and affect us. Do you understand?

295
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,330
Yes. I'll keep that in mind.

296
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,899
Oh, right. Chief Prosecutor.

297
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:05,100
Are we really going to invite
the prosecutor as a new member?

298
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,669
What?

299
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,039
What are you saying?

300
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,850
I mean your junior prosecutor.

301
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,480
Didn't you say that she's going
to join us?

302
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,820
Superintendent.

303
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,679
You can enjoy your meal.

304
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,759
I guess I was confused.

305
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,529
Not a new member...

306
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,230
but a consultant, right?

307
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,600
Yes, that's right.

308
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,970
Enjoy your meal.

309
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,190
Yo Han.

310
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,400
Yo Han!

311
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,269
Hello.

312
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:11,799
You do a part-time job for 24 hours.
When do you get to sleep?

313
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,339
I can get a short nap like this.

314
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,369
I don't like to sleep that much.

315
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:17,309
It could ruin you.

316
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,009
You need to go out and exercise.

317
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:20,210
You need to get some sleep.

318
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,680
Even Lord...

319
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,079
cannot help lack of exercise
and lack of sleep.

320
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,349
Okay. Thank you.

321
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,259
Is it true...

322
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,130
your hearing gets better...

323
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,529
when you eat and become full?

324
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,170
Yes. You may not believe it,
but it's true.

325
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,470
In that case...

326
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:52,609
Let's work together.

327
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,750
I'm like Lee Jung Jae
from "New World".

328
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,750
What's my duty?

329
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,619
Are you going to
Wangmat Foods tomorrow?

330
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:04,660
Yes, I'm going to quit tomorrow.

331
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:07,829
After listening to you,
it seems like a horrible company.

332
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:10,259
No, don't quit it.
Keep working there for now.

333
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,769
Listen carefully to
what I say now.

334
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,509
Don't open your eyes like that.
It scares me.

335
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,750
There's something you must listen...

336
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,480
at all costs.

337
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,690
I need to listen?

338
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,990
Listen to me first.

339
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,539
Here I go. Here I go.

340
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,980
Catch it. Catch it!

341
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:10,990
Catch it. Catch it!

342
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,130
That's it.

343
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,269
Thank you for your sermon tonight.

344
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll give you this
instead of offering.

345
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,170
I didn't expect
he'd live an ordinary life.

346
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,339
I'm sure there's something more.

347
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,609
How can someone get
information like this...

348
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,019
if he's not in a national agency?

349
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,150
How have you been?

350
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,160
You're still working for
NIS, aren't you?

351
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,089
I still have a long time left
to return to prosecution.

352
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,329
Why?

353
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,130
Then do me a favor, please.

354
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,369
I'm surprised
that you're asking me a favor.

355
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:57,940
What is it? Tell me.

356
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,170
Please get information on someone
in detail.

357
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,109
Find the data there.

358
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:21,859
Come in.

359
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,430
This is unbelievable, Father Han.

360
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,140
What did you do to ramyeon?

361
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,869
For the first time in my life,

362
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,339
I cooked it following
the official recipe.

363
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,180
You should do
as the developer tells you to.

364
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,279
Exactly.

365
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:43,309
Just how we live
as God orders us,

366
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:46,079
we should cook ramyeon
as the developer tells us to.

367
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,119
No.

368
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,750
It totally...

369
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,319
calls for soju.

370
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,990
Do you want a glass?

371
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,259
No, I'm fine.

372
00:20:57,859 --> 00:20:58,930
Well, Father Kim.

373
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,869
About Detective Koo.

374
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,700
What about him?

375
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,609
I roughly know the reason
why the police assigned him...

376
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,140
as your partner.

377
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,109
And I know the fact
that he's not on our side.

378
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,880
You know that.
Then why did you do that?

379
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,049
You sided with him and cooked
for him this afternoon.

380
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,390
Good job.

381
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,950
Don't be mad.

382
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,890
What I want to tell you is...

383
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,160
It's been a few days
with him now.

384
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,890
He seems to be a weak person,
not an evil person.

385
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,799
Right. He seems to be a weak person.

386
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,000
His eyes are bleary...

387
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,730
and then his eyelids
become like this.

388
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,640
All he thinks about
are his petty tricks.

389
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,240
His eyes are like this
and then like this.

390
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,339
Right. Like this.

391
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,339
Yes.

392
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,109
But if you bless him...

393
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:46,809
and warm his heart gradually,

394
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,910
he may side with us.

395
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:53,319
I don't need someone like him
on my side.

396
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,549
I'm not a warmer.

397
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,730
We don't bless them
as if we give them candies.

398
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:08,269
It's like medicine that warms
their hearts which have gone cold.

399
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:09,470
We have to wait.

400
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,910
So I hope you don't say anything...

401
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,170
that would hurt him.

402
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,890
You're not the type to protect...

403
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,319
or care about others.

404
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,859
You're right. I'm not.

405
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,230
But I do worry about people
even if it's not that much.

406
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,269
Goodness.

407
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Gosh.

408
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,170
Gosh.

409
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,279
It feels uncomfortable.

410
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,549
The weather must be crazy.

411
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:57,549
It's almost spring.
Why is it still so cold?

412
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Gosh.

413
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,319
Would you like some eggs?

414
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,819
Come on. You should have
let me know you were there.

415
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,089
You seemed to be
lost in thoughts...

416
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,130
so we didn't want to interrupt you.

417
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,960
Eat it. It's one day past
the expiry date.

418
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,970
Working as a detective,

419
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,599
I get to face the filthy world...

420
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,470
and that torments me.

421
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,079
I don't know what it means,
but it's really awesome.

422
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,940
Stop saying "awesome" to me, please.

423
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:31,450
There are so many people
more awesome and bigger than me.

424
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,519
You know what?

425
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,990
The bigger a planet,
the shorter its life is.

426
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,190
The bigger a planet, its area
becomes larger...

427
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,759
and wears down more.

428
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,130
My brain is going to wear down now.

429
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,130
What are you saying?

430
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,759
I'm saying that you'll remain...

431
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,829
strong and long
like a little star...

432
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,029
although it shines less and is less
noticeable.

433
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,900
Tell me the reason.

434
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
Why on earth do you think
I'm awesome?

435
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,640
You don't look scary...

436
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,009
and you seem like a good person.

437
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,849
You're a strong detective
in Violent Crimes squad.

438
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,349
I agree.

439
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,119
How do you know if I am good or not?

440
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,589
I've met more bad people...

441
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:16,529
than good people. I can recognize
when I see bad people.

442
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,759
You're a good man.
An awesome man.

443
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,400
I shouldn't have asked.

444
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,569
- My regular is coming.
- What?

445
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:30,740
Exactly after five seconds,
a female customer will be here...

446
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,779
for a bento box.

447
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,250
She did.

448
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,049
I should go. Bye.

449
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,059
How did you know that?
It's unbelievable.

450
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,089
I heard her footsteps.

451
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,329
That pig.

452
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:55,500
He ate so much food a while ago.

453
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,039
- You'd better go, you punk.
- I see.

454
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:01,869
Goodbye.

455
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,109
They just made it worse for me.

456
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,519
(Annoying Father)

457
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,720
Let's talk.

458
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,220
It's late. Why does he want to talk?

459
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Hoon Seok.

460
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,430
I think someone strong
will join our party.

461
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Do you mean...

462
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,329
a new member is joining us?

463
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,140
If we do a better job,

464
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,809
she won't be able to join us.

465
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:40,410
If she does a better job,
then we'll be kicked out.

466
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,079
Anyway, Dong Ja
has completely changed, right?

467
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,460
Did you see this?

468
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,690
Take a look at this.

469
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,099
This is what my men took
on the street.

470
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,200
Is he really a detective?

471
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:04,769
He looks like an idiot.

472
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:07,240
In Russia, idiots like him...

473
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,170
are hung on a cow and dragged...

474
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,710
Darn that stupid Detective Koo.

475
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,750
He doesn't do anything right.

476
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,960
I said something...

477
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,130
I shouldn't have as a priest.

478
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,400
I'm regretful.

479
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:39,470
What was it that you said?

480
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,769
Oh, right.

481
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,769
"You're not the type to protect
or care about others."

482
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:45,579
That's a fact.

483
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,440
You're right.
I'm that kind of person.

484
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,150
I said...

485
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,049
I'm regretful.

486
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,319
You can express...

487
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,849
regret in many other ways.

488
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,119
Why would you express it like that?

489
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,890
And are you a spokesperson?
You sounded so unnatural.

490
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:09,329
I'm sorry.

491
00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:13,200
- Pardon?
- I'm sorry.

492
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,470
What did you say?

493
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,210
I said something wrong earlier!
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

494
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,109
You completely ignored
my sincerity.

495
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:24,309
And you keep mentioning
how you feel regretful.

496
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,220
I'm apologizing sincerely.
Why can't you accept my apology?

497
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,549
Stop trying to take the upper hand.

498
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,089
Are you getting angry at me?

499
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:32,859
No, I'm not.

500
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,430
And from now on, don't try to do
anything to help or assist me.

501
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,930
In case of emergencies like what
happened today, I should help.

502
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,670
I said, don't help me. Why are you
acting up these days?

503
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,470
I know you're a priest,
but I'm a year older than you.

504
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,000
How can you talk down to me
like that?

505
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,470
If you feel bad,
then don't follow me around.

506
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,740
I'll work with Detective Seo.

507
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,910
No, I won't allow that.

508
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,309
I'm sure you'll get in trouble
with the newbie.

509
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,039
I'll get in trouble?

510
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:56,549
I take back my apology.
Just leave! Go!

511
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,450
I was going to leave anyway
because my butt got cold.

512
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,349
I won't accept your apology.
My goodness.

513
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:01,789
How cheap.

514
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:05,059
What? You called me cheap?
Is that what you said?

515
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,519
Why? Are you going to hit me?

516
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,559
Go ahead. Hit me.

517
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,190
Hit someone who has a concussion.
Go ahead.

518
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,390
But don't hit my nose.

519
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,730
- Darn it, you jerk.
- Hit me!

520
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,730
- Father.
- Hit me!

521
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,539
You two should be nice
to each other.

522
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,240
There's never been a taste
like this.

523
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,670
Is this fried chicken or ribs?

524
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,579
Let's have fried chicken and beer.

525
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,430
He should apologize properly
if he wants to say he's sorry.

526
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,230
He stood on his pride until the end.

527
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,470
Who's calling at this hour?

528
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,369
Yes, sir.
