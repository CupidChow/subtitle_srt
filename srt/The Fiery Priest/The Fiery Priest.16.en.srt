00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,140
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,990
That was 10 points out of 10 points.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,920
Your life's been smooth, hasn't it?

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,660
You don't have to work as a cop
because you're helping the priest.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,129
You slack off,
and drink whenever you want.

6
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:28,629
You smile even when you get hit
by a baseball bat.

7
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,340
When that priest attacked Maegakgyo
and Wangmat Foods,

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,369
you didn't even stop him.

9
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,280
- I didn't just stay still.
- How dare you?

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,009
I told you many times, didn't I?

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,250
I told you to keep an eye on him
and stop him at all costs.

12
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,619
And yet, you just fooled around
next to him?

13
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,090
Hey, do you not
take my words seriously?

14
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, my gosh.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,729
Get up.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,270
Dae Young.

17
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,340
I'm telling you for the last time.
Listen carefully.

18
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,640
Make that priest leave this country,
got it?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,879
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't let him
get anything on Wangmat Foods.

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
Mess things up.

22
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:17,650
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
You can go now.

24
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,090
If you don't listen to me
and fool around again,

25
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,519
I'll make sure to bury...

26
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,260
your dead friend's wife and son...

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,829
where nobody can find
their corpses.

28
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:35,030
Do you understand?

29
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:41,569
I've seen this look before.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,180
It's from the old days,
the ones that ended up dying.

31
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,219
Do your job, okay?

32
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,419
Hurry up!

33
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,180
Hurry up!

34
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,360
I think it's the Russian alley.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,530
Just run!

36
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,689
Why are they so fast?

37
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,030
My goodness.

38
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,599
Come here.

39
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,669
Who are those punks?

40
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,039
Why are they blocking our way?

41
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,509
Hey, we aren't here to arrest you.

42
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,680
Make way. Move.

43
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,250
I told you to move.
Move before I kill you all.

44
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,780
He said he'll kill you.

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,620
Darn it.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,659
Gosh, look at him.

47
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,930
You scumbags!

48
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,569
Detective Lee, follow him.
I'll take care of them.

49
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,469
You can't take care
of everyone here.

50
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm doing what I can!

51
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,490
Come get me, you jerks!
I'll kill you all.

52
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,800
Detective Lee!

53
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,069
Young Cheon.

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,879
Detective Lee!

55
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,120
Stop it.

56
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,930
Young Cheon. Hey.

57
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,490
Young Cheon.

58
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,800
Young Cheon. Why... How...

59
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,069
Young Cheon.

60
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:24,740
You fools. I'll put you all
behind bars!

61
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,439
Are you a policeman?

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,180
How dare they attack
a police officer?

63
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,540
Who did this?

64
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,610
Young Cheon.

65
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,879
Young Cheon. Wake up.

66
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:40,449
Put them behind bars later.

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,850
Take him to a hospital first.

68
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,790
You just wait. I'll kill
every one of you jerks.

69
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,060
Young Cheon. Get up.

70
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,029
Young Cheon.

71
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,069
Hang in there.

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,670
What is it? What?

73
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,910
Don't die.

74
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,339
What?

75
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,649
Don't die.

76
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,279
You fool.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,490
Okay, I won't die, so hang in there.

78
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,529
Stay strong, Young Cheon.

79
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,009
What's your problem?

80
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,250
- Sir.
- I told you not to go in there.

81
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,750
You were to call me first.

82
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,120
How can I call during a chase?

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,149
Be quiet.

84
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,220
You're the one
who got Young Cheon killed.

85
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,329
- How dare you?
- Dae Young.

86
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,329
How can you say that?

87
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,660
You idiot!
If you'd listened to me...

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,970
What's going on here?

89
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,149
That's him.

90
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,120
- Calm down.
- Hold back.

91
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,819
His minions killed Young Cheon.

92
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:20,850
Okay, stay still!

93
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,319
His minions killed Young Cheon!

94
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,689
I get it, okay?

95
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:48,579
Fine.

96
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,079
I won't die, like you said.

97
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,389
And I'll protect the others.

98
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,370
Wait.

99
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,769
It's just me again?

100
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,269
I'm the first one here again.

101
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,069
No one else is here.

102
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,079
What's this? Dae Young.

103
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,350
You slept here?

104
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,149
Why didn't you go home?

105
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,220
It still aches.

106
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,589
- Are you hurt?
- Yes, I am.

107
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,629
My body and heart both hurt.

108
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,129
What time is it?

109
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,300
8:40am.

110
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,829
I need to go.

111
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,939
You won't wait for Father Kim?

112
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,870
I'm boycotting him today.

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,310
What's the problem now?

114
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,209
If he wants to go somewhere,
you go with him instead, okay?

115
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:53,709
He might raid Wangmat Foods today.

116
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,480
- I don't care.
- Dae Young!

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,519
I don't care.

118
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,290
I just can't get to like him.

119
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,519
He'll value me only when I'm gone.

120
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,819
Let's see him ruin his case.

121
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,660
One dollar, please.

122
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,560
- Thanks.
- Enjoy your snack.

123
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,639
Hello.

124
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,139
I looked into the guy
you asked me to.

125
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,139
- Who is he?
- Why?

126
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,139
The first profile I got
was exactly what you told me.

127
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,579
I tried to get more details,

128
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,910
but I don't have access.

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,620
What does that mean?

130
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,889
That he's no ordinary guy.

131
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,019
He's a North Korean
we're protecting,

132
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,860
an ex-agent of ours,

133
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,059
or someone whose
real identity can't get out.

134
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,710
Hello, Head Nun.

135
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:02,879
Yes.

136
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,220
We just got a call
from Eun Ji's hospital.

137
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,259
If we don't settle her medical bill,

138
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,190
they'll send her home today.

139
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,059
What should we do?

140
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,570
I left to avoid him and we met.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,039
Where's he going with that frown?

142
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,340
(Balance: 2,082 dollars 1 cent)

143
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,120
No, Father.

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,690
Please, sir.

145
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,490
I'll pay 2,000 dollars now.

146
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,299
Can't I pay the rest in three days?

147
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,929
It must be paid in one go,
so I can't do that.

148
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:56,870
If you can't pay today,
the girl goes home.

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,899
Show some lenience and
help me out just this once.

150
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,539
I've been doing this for years.

151
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:05,909
If I help someone out,
they keep asking for favors.

152
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:07,850
Handle this.

153
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,450
Don't say that.

154
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,720
I'm asking for your help
just this once.

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,350
We can't allow for
everyone's difficulties.

156
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,350
I'm begging you.

157
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm not saying I won't pay
and she's a little kid.

158
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,220
Sir.

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,059
Come on now.

160
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:25,100
Hello, Detective Koo.

161
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:29,100
Why are you being so stubborn?

162
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,799
Have you ever seen a priest
who cons people?

163
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,940
I haven't.

164
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,970
Be merciful and give him
a week to pay the rest.

165
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,139
This isn't up to me.

166
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:42,309
If things go wrong,
I'll be penalized.

167
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,720
When you were caught
with a prostitute at a karaoke bar,

168
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,149
you got out the side door.

169
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,590
Who let you out?

170
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,559
Why are you bringing that up now?

171
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,029
Don't commit adultery.
Don't covet another man's woman.

172
00:10:58,029 --> 00:10:59,230
But...

173
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,730
One week, okay?

174
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,830
They'll dock my pay.

175
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll be penalized.

176
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,970
Wow, full marks.

177
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,549
You needn't thank me.
That will just be embarrassing.

178
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,519
Right.

179
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,720
Where will you get the money?

180
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,090
From those who are responsible.

181
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,490
Who would want to pay up?

182
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,360
Do me a favor.

183
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,330
You won't be able to stop
what will happen,

184
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,330
but don't get in the way of
Eun Ji's treatment.

185
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,870
How did I get in the way?

186
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,370
She's just a kid.

187
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,269
What'll become of her
if things go wrong?

188
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,009
She's an orphan
and the world is against her.

189
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:51,080
She needs to be healthy at least.

190
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,120
I don't care if you try to
block, ruin, or stop me,

191
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,029
but wait until Eun Ji's okay.

192
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,230
Then I'll take you on.

193
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:09,669
Did I do something to stop you?

194
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,000
You will soon.

195
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,610
I'm off to...

196
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,909
raid Wangmat Foods.

197
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,419
What if I help in earnest?

198
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,269
Father Kim Tsunami.
Who are you and what did you do?

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,870
Who are you?

200
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,980
Ms. Park, someone outside
wishes to see you.

201
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,320
Who is it?

202
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,389
Kyeong Seon.

203
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,570
This is crazy.

204
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,240
Did you come here
because you heard I was here?

205
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,269
Yes.

206
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,480
You came back home.

207
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,580
How could I not know?

208
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,450
I have nothing to say to you.

209
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,009
Kyeong Seon.

210
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,080
So...

211
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,620
Do me one last thing.

212
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,159
Do a favor for your useless father.

213
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:42,759
You're not a useless father.
You're a useless human being.

214
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:46,399
Kyeong Seon.
It's not something serious.

215
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,200
Our neighbors
are involved in a lawsuit.

216
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,070
Could you move things on for us?

217
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,070
Did someone send you here?

218
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,009
Did they promise you
money and alcohol in return?

219
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,840
What are you saying?
It's not like that.

220
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,509
Kyeong Seon.

221
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,720
They're all neighbors
who saw you grow up.

222
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,990
You made promises
you couldn't fulfill and...

223
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,389
ruined your life and
still haven't grown up?

224
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,860
Didn't going to prison
teach you anything?

225
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,960
Shall I send you back?

226
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,230
You were used your whole life.

227
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,399
Aren't you sick of that?

228
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,470
You abandoned your family
to live like trash.

229
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:27,809
I am...

230
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,639
just so sick of it.

231
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,620
It's such a relief that
I'm not like you.

232
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,460
Kyeong Seon.

233
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,860
Do you...

234
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,159
happen to have...

235
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:53,259
any money?

236
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,559
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

237
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:27,970
Have you still not worked things out
with Dae Young?

238
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,600
There's nothing to work out.

239
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,570
I'd like you to come with me today.

240
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,909
I'd love that.

241
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,279
I mean, I'm in a great mood today.

242
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,980
Do you know Alive Young?

243
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,820
I got a 50-percent discount coupon.

244
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,820
Dae Young.

245
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,889
You left as if
you'd be gone for the day.

246
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,759
I did not.

247
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,990
I had a corndog.

248
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:02,629
Pack a high-powered camcorder
and anti-riot gear.

249
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,700
- Okay.
- What's the anti-riot gear for?

250
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,000
To fight a riot. Would we
crack walnuts with it?

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,769
That place isn't a thug hideout.

252
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:10,470
Why pack that
to visit a private company?

253
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,909
What if there's another Choco?

254
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,340
We have to bring them all in.

255
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,710
"Choco"?

256
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,889
I'll go and get a camcorder.

257
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,860
We can shoot the factory
with our phones.

258
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,730
My stomach hurts again.

259
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,100
Give me three minutes.

260
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,429
No.

261
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,230
I might poop right now.

262
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,179
What's he up to?

263
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,059
Don't let him
get anything on Wangmat Foods.

264
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,820
Mess things up.

265
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,970
Mr. Hwang. Father Kim's about to...

266
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,940
head over to Wangmat Foods.

267
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,109
He wants to take everyone down.

268
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,240
You'd best be prepared.

269
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,039
Things are really going pear-shaped.

270
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,809
- Jang Ryong.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,980
Take some good fighters and
if the priest acts up,

272
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,250
crush him good, okay?

273
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
Yes, sir.

274
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,890
Sir, why don't you
deal with this quietly?

275
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,960
If Ms. Jeong finds out...

276
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,059
What if she does?

277
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,230
How else are we to stop him?

278
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,400
Chat with him over tea?

279
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,369
Director Kim's being
awfully cautious these days.

280
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,799
You weren't like this before.

281
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:48,440
Did you see a ghost?

282
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,339
I'll flatten him for good, sir.

283
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,980
Sort him out properly.

284
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,250
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

285
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,400
Come in.

286
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,099
Why are you here?

287
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:21,970
Shouldn't you be at work?

288
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,319
Put me back where I belong.

289
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,279
I'll do anything...

290
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,190
you tell me to.

291
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,220
No.

292
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,160
I'll do anything without a mistake.

293
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,029
- Yo Han, bring the bean sprouts.
- Okay.

295
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,509
Oh, right.

296
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,410
I'll bring some salt from storage.

297
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,470
Why isn't he back with the salt?

298
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:34,339
- What's going on?
- Honey, where are my socks?

299
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,480
I'm always out.

300
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,779
Leave it by the door.

301
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,579
Can we move on from kissing?

302
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,619
Okay.

303
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,420
What now?

304
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,119
Shall we hide it now?

305
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,460
Already? Why bother?

306
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,960
Where should we put it?

307
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,299
We'll be ruined if we're found out.

308
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,630
Why are you so scared?

309
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:56,269
What?

310
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:59,539
Sir. Just put it in the safe.

311
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,470
They'll search that first
with the search warrant, moron.

312
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,339
- Darn you.
- Then where...

How about that place?

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,329
You should've brought one
that functions.

This is broken.

Will you keep still?
You're shaking the camcorder.

318

Be quiet. We're
staking out at the scene.

319
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,700
When scoping the setting or people,

320
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,569
pick an open spot
where you can look downwards.

321
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,910
If you're at eye-level,
you're likely to lose them.

322
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,109
Okay.

00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,609

a drill sergeant today.

You could've done that sooner.

330

Zoom right in.

331

Don't you like donations, Father?

335

That's a bribe, not a donation.

336
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,559
Think, will you?

Song Sac. There's no time. Do it.

366
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,430
Okay.

367
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,170
What are you doing?

368
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,910
Lift me up. 1, 2, 3.

369
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,349
Are you sure the priest
asked you to do this?

370
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,609
Yes.

371
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,589
Yo Han was given some sort of order.

372
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,390
Do you feel better?
Has the urge gone?

373
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,490
Yes, kind of.

374
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,329
Father. Did you expect them to
react like this?

375
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,670
Yes.

376
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,769
Then the reason
you came here yesterday...

377
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,440
To learn who's
watching this place...

378
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,140
and how they go about it.

379
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,809
Right. That's awesome.

380
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:01,809
You're good.

381
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,819
Wait. What are they doing?

382
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:08,920
That's it.

383
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,049
(Notice)

384
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:13,960
It's a formality.

385
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,460
That's right.

386
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,660
He's getting them a ticket.

387
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,299
Then do you think somebody
sued them?

388
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,730
I don't think so.

389
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,470
It's all planned.

390
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,839
- Pardon?
- They'll be suspended for a month,

391
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,039
and pay the fine.

392
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:28,440
When things settle down,
they'll start their business again.

393
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,769
Those jerks.

394
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,039
That must be how they've been
running their business so far.

395
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,240
That's right.

396
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,779
They ran it however they wanted
since no one could stop them.

397
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:40,250
Let's get going
since we saw everything.

398
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,390
Aren't we done yet?

399
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,250
We got all the evidence.

400
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,259
Darn it. We have to go catch them
since we have all the evidence.

401
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,390
Move.

402
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,700
Hold on.

403
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,569
Yo Han. Yo Han.

404
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,210
That pig.

405
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,220
Why did you leave me behind?

406
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,500
Be quiet!

407
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,400
(Wangmat Foods)

408
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:07,500
(Wangmat Foods)

409
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,039
Why are your eyes so full of anger?

410
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,640
You look like someone
who's lost his country.

411
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,349
You're not going to
perform capoeira today, are you?

412
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,819
This one? That time,
it was a performance,

413
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:26,619
but you attacked me suddenly.
Isn't that cheating?

414
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,990
Can't you get rid of your bob cut?

415
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,329
It's annoying me like crazy.

416
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:34,160
You're also annoying like crazy,
hip-hop girl.

417
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,269
Why do you keep getting in my way?
You're so annoying.

418
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:37,900
- That scumbag.
- Hold on.

419
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,099
Hold on.

420
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
Let's do it
according to the procedure.

421
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,240
Those who have to be arrested,
leave with us.

422
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,579
Those who don't have to may stay.

423
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,349
Detective Koo, don't get involved
and move out of the way...

424
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,680
before I break your bone.

425
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:56,619
Okay.

426
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,319
I won't take care of the aftermath.

427
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Gosh.

428
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,700
Let's see.

429
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:15,509
How many of you are going to get on
the bus to the fiery pit?

430
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,710
Let's see. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

431
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,109
A combination must be enough.

432
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,380
What did he say? A combination?

433
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,619
Okay, then. Let the fight begin.

434
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:31,920
Come here!

435
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,279
(Wangmat Foods)

436
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:08,690
Your skull's going to hurt
a lot today, hip-hop girl.

437
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,700
(The Fiery Priest)

438
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,539
Through the investigation,
the secrets of Gudam...

439
00:29:58,539 --> 00:29:59,839
How could you handle it like this?

440
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,299
I told you many times
to do a better job.

441
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,569
(The evils are breaking up.)

442
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,910
The opponents need to be weakened,

443
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,609
so we can obtain the information
we want.

444
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:07,910
Are you okay?
You were beaten a lot earlier.

445
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,009
Thank you for helping me.

446
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:11,509
I can do that much for you
since I'm your senior.

447
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,650
Who took the ledger
of Wangmat Foods?

448
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,549
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

449
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:16,789
Don't kill me!

450
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:17,990
(A dangerous counterattack
will begin.)

451
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,920
- Get back to Seoul quickly.
- Yes, sir!

452
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,589
Shall we get rid of them?

453
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,589
What kind of nonsense it that?
