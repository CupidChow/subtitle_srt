My goodness.
You're such an annoying priest.

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,730
How shall I hit you?

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,829
Have you ever heard of it?

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,200
Do you know capoeira?

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,140
You can't attack me
when I'm changing, okay?

7

after getting rid of the priest.

Stop!

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,810
Don't you know
what kind of a day today is?

I was hit without any reason.

14
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,010
How can I just leave him alone?

15

Get up already! Don't make a scene.

16
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:27,790
You should leave for now.

17
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,359
Move your hand.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
I will if you tell me...

19
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,930

20

I won't, so move your hand.

21

I'll make you leave
if you don't leave by yourself.

22
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,579

25

You're just letting him go?

26

Or what? Do you want to be
on the news for beating priest?

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,799
Of course.

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,400

close with Mr. Hwang,

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,649

laughing like that?

are you talking about?

78

- Father.
- You are unbelievable.

to take him away.

doesn't this event give out
any free gifts?

- Please calm down.

180
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:05,139
Let go of me.

181
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,909
I know you're angry,
but please don't hurt yourself.

182
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,879
I can't mortify Father Lee
even after his death.

183
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
What?

184
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,480
If we just end this
without finding out the truth,

185
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,250
it'll be mortifying Father Lee
even after he died.

186
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,759
But I feel like
I'm not doing anything right.

187
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,460
Don't think that way.
You're doing your best.

188
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,500
No.

189
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,169
We won't be able to
disclose anything like this.

190
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,970
We need to pressure them a lot more.

191
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,570
Don't try to fight all by yourself.

192
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,580
Both Sister Kim and I
are on your side.

193
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,480
And I'm sure the archdiocese
will help us out as well.

194
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,149
Father.

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,950
- Excuse me, Father.
- Yes?

196
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,919
You have a guest.

197
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,659
A guest?

198
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:04,159
I'm sorry I can't be of great help.

199
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,960
I didn't expect anything,
so you don't need to be sorry.

200
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,730
I hope this doesn't cause
a misunderstanding.

201
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,700
The archbishop thought about it
for a long time...

202
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,669
I'll trust that he did.

203
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,009
But why are you here?

204
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,080
We can't continue to leave
the provost position vacant.

205
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:23,950
So we'd like Father Han...

206
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,419
to become the provost
of Gudam Church...

207
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,090
according to the Code of Canon Law.

208
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,620
Okay. What?

209
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,860
Me? Why me?

210
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,200
We're just following the code.

211
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,169
But I'm not...
I don't know anything yet.

212
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,169
Father Kim is more suitable
for the position than I am...

213
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,539
I'm not part of this diocese, so
I'm not qualified for the position.

214
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:47,639
He's right.

215
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,340
I know the church isn't exactly
in the best situation,

216
00:12:50,539 --> 00:12:51,879
but I hope you guide it
in the right direction.

217
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,259
I'm so glad.

218
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,659
I'll finally be able
to feel at ease.

219
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,289
I really don't know anything.

220
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,730
I'm not good enough
for the position.

221
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,429
No, you're more than qualified.
You can do it.

222
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,460
You'll do great.

223
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,399
You need to do well
so that I can leave at ease.

224
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,269
No, you must stay for a while.

225
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,340
Father Kim needs to go back
to his diocese.

226
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,179
Yes, I know.

227
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,740
But not now.

228
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,149
I'm sure everyone
will be really happy...

229
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:34,190
when Father Han starts
holding the mass. Don't you agree?

230
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,250
The fact that I have to fill
Father Lee's shoes...

231
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,720
is making me
feel extremely pressured.

232
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,159
Can you at least hold the mass...

233
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,860
until the end of this month?

234
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,429
Sure.

235
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,539
You should just do it yourself,
Father Han.

236
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,299
Why? I said I'll do it.

237
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,580
Okay, fine. Do whatever you want.

238
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,840
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

239
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,309
I get that you're pressured.

240
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,279
But you need to
pull yourself together.

241
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,419
Hallelujah

242
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,320
Why can't you just do it yourself?

243
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,990
What? Again?

244
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,659
But thankfully,
he didn't cause a mess today.

245
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,159
He just left after he ate.

246
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,740
All my Gudam-gu acquaintances
are throwing a fit...

247
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,240
and asking me why I didn't send him
to jail when I had the chance.

248
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,909
I'm not trying to question
your decision.

249
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,080
But I don't think your choice
was 100 percent correct.

250
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,450
Do you also admit?

251
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,190
- I'm sorry, sir.
- You're sorry?

252
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,220
Okay.

253
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,029
Next time, just send him to jail...

254
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,429
the moment he makes
the smallest mistake.

255
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,429
Yes, sir.

256
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,169
(Chief Prosecutor, Kang Seok Tae)

257
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,580
Gosh, really.
He doesn't listen to me at all.

258
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm sure he didn't listen to
his mom either.

259
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,389
I told him...

260
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,759
That punk.

261
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,070
Song Sac. Song Sac.

262
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:36,509
Sit down. Sit down.

263
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,149
The expiration date is over
by a minute now. You can eat this.

264
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,350
(The food has to be
disposed of in principle,)

265
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,519
(but sometimes
the employees eat it.)

266
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,850
I only eat Burger King.
You can eat this.

267
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,059
You're so picky.
It's really annoying.

268
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,059
Eat it!

269
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
I...

270
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,809
went to church at dawn...

271
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,179
as I miss Father Lee.

272
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:14,549
He's not there anyway.
Why do you keep going there?

273
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:15,980
I go there as I miss him.

274
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,179
When I go there, he's there.

275
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:22,649
His face,

276
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,759
his voice, and his cookies.

277
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,059
Gosh, really.

278
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,429
You make me think of him.

279
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,340
As he's like an angel,

280
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:47,440
he must have become
a star in the sky.

281
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,919
Over there... That star.

282
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,350
That's not his star.

283
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,120
It's the brightest star in
the Charioteer, Capella.

284
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,860
It's the sixth bright star
in the sky...

285
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,460
and a first-magnitude star
closest to the Polaris.

286
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,059
I know that it's not his star.

287
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:11,569
How come you don't understand
how I feel, Yo Han?

288
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,269
As someone who studied stars,
I'm telling you a fact...

289
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,740
to give information.

290
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,150
Yo Han.

291
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,420
Even if we can't afford
a lot of devotion,

292
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,190
let's observe Sunday.

293
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,789
Sure. I'm a devout Catholic.

294
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:31,789
Don't worry.

295
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,130
Please don't eat bread during
a mass. I'm so embarrassed.

296
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,460
I ate it as I couldn't hear well.

297
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,559
Why are you saying that?

298
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,900
Then if you eat a lot of food,

299
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,400
can you hear something
from far away?

300
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,799
Yes. How do you know that?

301
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,509
I guess...

302
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,740
I have supernatural power.

303
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,079
Don't be ridiculous.

304
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,980
It's true. Stay here and tell me.

305
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:00,250
Go ahead. Song Sac, say something.

306
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,349
Say something now.

307
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,450
Say it.

308
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:06,519
Peter Piper picked a pack of
pickled peppers.

309
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,289
Song Sac, say anything. Go ahead.

310
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,259
I said it, you pig.

311
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,000
Where did you learn such a word?

312
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,140
Say something politer.

314
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,690
You're here.

315
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,660
What's that?

316
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
It's your new mass clothes.

317
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,200
I can wear what I have now.

318
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,970
It looked small as I saw it
at the last mass.

319
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,539
Thank you.

320
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,009
- Father Kim.
- Yes.

321
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,910
If there are much fewer people
at church this week...

322
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,509
although I'm preparing my heart...

323
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,319
The number of people who visit
the church is nothing, but...

324
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:43,690
Let's just do it.

325
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,319
If someone comes to church
trusting Father Lee,

326
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,990
I should hold a mass
even for just one person.

327
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,359
Yes, Father Kim.

328
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,900
Let's keep the church,

329
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,470
recover Father Lee's honor,

330
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,039
and correct the wrongs.

331
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,210
Yes.

332
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,690
I never imagined there would be
such a few people.

333
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,119
It might get better after two weeks.

334
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,190
If it goes like this...

335
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,460
Our church wouldn't be
one without a priest, right?

336
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,170
That won't happen.

337
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,000
Here they are.

338
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,369
- Hello.
- Hello.

339
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,009
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

340
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,410
Did you eat bread?

341
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:41,309
Yes, I ate it before I came here.

342
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:42,880
Flick a crumb off of your mouth.

343
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,690
Hello.

344
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,759
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

345
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,269
Are you going to come in or not?

346
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,609
If you're going to stay here,
go home and watch "Animal Farm".

347
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:16,009
Well, we were being considerate
to come here.

348
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:18,079
You shouldn't say so.

349
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,819
It's not easy for us to come in.

350
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:22,190
Staying here means...

351
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,750
that you beg the question that
Father Lee did a bad thing.

352
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,089
I don't want to hold mass for people
who have such thoughts.

353
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,630
You need to apologize to us.

354
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,960
How come you blame us?

355
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,500
What do I have to apologize?

356
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,660
Father.

357
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,500
You believe easily, judge easily,

358
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,269
and get swept off easily.

359
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,930
You don't deserve to believe in God.

360
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,440
You don't have to come to church.
Go back.

361
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,900
I'm really appalled.

362
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,569
Are you saying it's our fault?

363
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,609
Well, Catarina...

364
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:49,079
Father Kim is quite sensitive
these days...

365
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,380
Fine.

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Let's go.

367
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,079
You know...

368
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,119
Catarina, Catarina.

369
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,490
Wait a minute!

370
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
How...

371
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,829
How can you do this?

372
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:07,759
Not so many people
come to church anyway.

373
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Excuse me...

374
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,700
Father!

375
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,509
Father!

376
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,480
It's troublesome to go to
another church.

377
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,849
It might be embarrassing
if I just go inside.

378
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,710
I told you not to come
to our church, old man.

379
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,279
I'm the one who decides
to come here or not.

380
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,819
I told you that you're
not qualified to come here.

381
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,789
Did you think I wouldn't come...

382
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:38,859
as I worry,
"He says I'm not qualified."

383
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,789
I don't want you to listen to
my sermon.

384
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,390
I don't come here to listen to
your sermon.

385
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,029
I'm here to relax.

386
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:47,430
Go to a sauna or a good restaurant
if you want to relax.

387
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll kick you out if you come again
next week.

388
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,130
You need to be careful.
If you get caught again...

389
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,769
- you're in big trouble.
- What?

390
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,210
You shouldn't go too far.

391
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,279
Do you get an allergic reaction
if you don't get in trouble?

392
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:00,180
Does it prevent the descent of
the Holy Ghost?

393
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,210
I guess you heard about Mr. Hwang's
awarding ceremony.

394
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,049
Yes, I did. So please keep quiet.

395
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,880
How many times
do I have to tell you?

396
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,990
I'm currently losing, but I'll soon
catch up and turn the tables.

397
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,619
It's driving me crazy.

398
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,289
Do you know why I'm not sending
you to prison...

399
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,500
and leaving you alone?

400
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,670
It's how I express my last respect
to Father Lee.

401
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,440
Regardless of the crime,
I thought him as a saint once.

402
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,769
It's how I show my respect.
Do you understand?

403
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:30,569
However,

404
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,539
my respect has a limit.

405
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,240
So you need to realize
the situation.

406
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,910
I'll go as far as I can go.

407
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,549
- So tell them to be prepared.
- Do as you like.

408
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,119
You can go to National Assembly
or the Blue House.

409
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,259
If things don't work out,
you can tattle to the pope.

410
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,460
Tattle it. Tattle.

411
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,259
You might be joking,

412
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,130
but you shouldn't mention the pope.
It's impious.

413
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm scared.

414
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,730
Pope! Pope, pope, pope!

415
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,130
Help me, pope!

416
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,410
Pope!

417
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:07,579
(Seongwongak)

418
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:09,809
Song Sac.

419
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,509
(Seongwongak)

420
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,890
- Hello.
- Did you practice?

421
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,089
- Pardon?
- Try this tongue twister.

422
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,099
Jjajang factory's owner is...

423
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,829
Mr. Gang.

424
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,799
Darn it. I told you to practice,
didn't I?

425
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,900
- Try it again.
- I'm sorry.

426
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,940
Try it. Go.

427
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,339
The factory owner of...

428
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,279
- How dare you laugh?
- I'm sorry.

429
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,950
What the priest said
during the award ceremony...

430
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,049
is being talked about
among the congressmen.

431
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,490
The congressmen of the ruling party
are making it a political issue.

432
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,349
You know.

433
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,589
They're dying to find our faults.

434
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,730
I told you I will take care
of those guys.

435
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,390
I've been saying this for years.

436
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,259
They're more sensitive...

437
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,299
since it's about
the welfare facility.

438
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,869
If you say that you're going to be
in charge, they won't let it slide.

439
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,609
Darn it. I should rip
that priest's lips.

440
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,339
Don't get upset.

441
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,740
Find a replacement.

442
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,319
Pick a religious group.
The religion doesn't matter.

443
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:21,549
You should manage it.

444
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,289
Can you think of anyone?

445
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,329
Our leader!

446
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,859
- Our leader!
- Our leader!

447
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,829
- Our leader!
- Our leader!

448
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,799
- Our leader!
- Our leader!

449
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,039
(Daegakgyo)

450
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:58,319
- Our leader!
- Our leader!

451
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,559
- Our leader!
- Our leader!

452
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,730
You must've heard this
from the news.

453
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,140
You must be aware of horrible sins
that a Catholic priest committed.

454
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,970
It's so embarrassing
to even mention it.

455
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,339
My goodness.

456
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,880
Those shameless people...

457
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,450
belittled Daegakgyo like this.

458
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,450
They said we're deceiving people
and that we're pseudo-religion.

459
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,519
I mean, how dare they call us that?

460
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,150
They are the ones who committed
the worst sins in the world.

461
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,259
You're right.

462
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,759
- You're right!
- You're right!

463
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:35,829
We don't need...

464
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,259
Buddha or Jehovah.

465
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,529
Our enlightenment is
our God and our bible.

466
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,140
That enlightenment will bring us
wealth, honor, and eternal life.

467
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,700
It will bring us everything.

468
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,470
The source of that enlightenment...

469
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,740
is me.

470
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,509
The leader of Daegakgyo,
Ki Yong Moon.

471
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:02,089
Did I or did I not tell you that
I'll enlighten you?

472
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:03,349
You did.

473
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,890
- You did!
- You did!

474
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,119
Are you following what I told you?

475
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,490
Yes, we are.

476
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,500
- We'll be enlightened!
- We'll be enlightened!

477
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,470
- We'll be enlightened!
- We'll be enlightened!

478
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,369
- We'll be enlightened!
- We'll be enlightened!

479
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,470
Let us all pray.

480
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:28,849
Did anyone leave their
electric iron plugged in...

481
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:30,710
because you had to come here
from early morning?

482
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,319
My gosh.

483
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,650
I did!

484
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,559
I order her house...

485
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:45,859
to have a blackout
until the afternoon!
