00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,439
What's this?

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,810
(Episode 29)

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,879
What's all this?

4
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:07,309
What's going on?

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,619
Put your hands down.
Put them down!

6
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:13,849
Why are you upset
when we arrested suspects?

7
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:16,489
How could you arrest everyone
without any solid evidence?

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,230
That sword... Where did you get it?

9
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,129
I got it luckily.

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,439
Superintendent Nam, you should be
locked behind bars also!

11
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:38,280
It seems like
it's almost over now.

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,079
What's with that smirk
on your face?

13
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:44,320
"It's not over until it's over."

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,420
Do you know that saying?

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,649
- What?
- Detective.

16
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,460
I'm here to turn myself in.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
For what?

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,530
I'm the one who gave orders
to kill Congressman Park...

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,840
to Anton.

20
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,579
My goodness, Geon Woo.
That was you?

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,849
Why did you do something
I never ordered you to do?

22
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,180
He cussed at me every time
he visited our office.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,219
So I got angry at him.

24
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,760
I know it wasn't you.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,129
You're just here as a replacement.

26
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:37,969
I'm the one who instigated
the murder.

27
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,640
You jerk.

28
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,239
Don't lie, and look straight
into my eyes.

29
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,310
You're here to go to jail
on behalf of him, aren't you?

30
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,379
I already told you. No.

31
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:52,879
What are you doing?
Hurry up and protect the suspect!

32
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,519
Why are you doing this?

33
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,590
Prosecutor Park.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,259
Come to the director's office
as soon as you get to work.

35
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,389
What in the world have you learned?

36
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,270
Cases like this should be
handled internally!

37
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:46,400
I was never taught to let
off an obvious murderer.

38
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,610
What?

39
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,069
Prosecutor Park, shut your mouth.

40
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,139
I think she's just
a little emotional right now.

41
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,610
Once she calms down...

42
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,580
I'm reasonable more than ever.

43
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,150
Will you just...

44
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,259
If this is worth my life,
I'll just give it back.

45
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,960
I'll wait for the measures.

46
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,199
That... That little...

47
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,439
That's how I am.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,949
The fortune teller already told me
that I'm not lucky with money.

49
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,719
But I have to say,
I feel so relieved now.

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,919
Hey, Prosecutor Park.

51
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,219
Starting from today,

52
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,919
you'll be placed
on the waiting list indefinitely.

53
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,590
I'll keep that in mind.

54
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,189
And about the Kim Keon Yong case...

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,860
It's Prosecutor Nam's now.

56
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,090
That jerk...

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,099
Prosecutor Nam again?

58
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,300
Yes. It would've been nice
if you'd behaved yourself.

59
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,569
You're so pathetic.

60
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,460
It tore. Darn it.

execution as a priest henceforth.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,750
Will you explain this yourself?

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,889
What I was informed of,
is everything true?

78
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,490
One thing is not.

79
00:05:58,829 --> 00:05:59,899
It was not my call.

80
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,529
I followed my superior's command.

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,139
I see.

82
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,939
But we can't ignore
the ultimate problem.

83
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,079
From the day
you started training until today,

84
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,920
you lived under a lie.

85
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,389
That was...

86
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,990
only because...

87
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,689
my previous employer
deleted my records.

88
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,029
It was unavoidable.

89
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,529
Even so, it is unacceptable.

90
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,069
Now that I know,
I cannot let this slide.

91
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,540
I will inform the order.

92
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,480
Just know that
it could become a big problem.

93
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:14,410
You brought it on yourself.

94
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:19,110
This will be the last time
we just stand and talk like this.

95
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:21,879

96
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,529
My gosh.

97
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,459
Is this a study room for students?

98
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,170
They at least have WiFi.

99
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,699
I smell mold.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,970
We could get tuberculosis
if we stay here too long.

101
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,810
I'm sorry.
It's because we're useless seniors.

102
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,350
It's fine. I'm proud to be here.

103
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,149
What did we do to deserve
you with lots of guts?

104
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,289
Superintendent Nam's a threat,
so keep your distance from him.

105
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:41,789
Let's leave Hwang Cheol Bum for now.

106
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,299
He's just a dog
that guards the warehouse.

107
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,059
If we get rid of him now,

108
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,669
it'll be tough
to find a replacement.

109
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,929
That's true.

110
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,539
We need Mr. Hwang for a while.

111
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,110
When will the fingerprint
software programmer get here?

112
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,169
Tomorrow.

113
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:59,179
You can open the vault.
Just pick someone trustworthy...

114
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:02,179
to watch over the vault
with Hwang Cheol Bum.

115
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,419
Who can we trust?

116
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
The arrogant fools.

117
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,889
They want to send me to prison?

118
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,399
I'll deal with the guy...

119
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,299
who took the fall for you.

120
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,940
You sort out Rising Moon for me.

121
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,409
The accountant and the ledgers.

122
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,809
Hide them first.

123
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,279
We'll be dead
if the contents get out.

124
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,710
- Okay?
- Yes.

125
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,820
How dare they?

(Seoul Gudam Police Station)

127
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,490
- I'm glad you're out.
- Me too.

128
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159

Hoon Seok.

130
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,470
Take a lawyer and visit Geon Woo
and shut him up.

131
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,139
Tell him not to worry,
that I'll look after his parents.

132
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,740
- Yes, sir.
- And Rising Moon's accountant.

133
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,309
Quickly send him away to Oahu.

134
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:06,309
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,110
But what about Detective Koo?

136
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,679
I think he sided completely
with the priest.

137
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,590
The scumbag of a jerk.

138
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,960
We'll deal with Rising Moon first.

139
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,330
Whether we kill him or not,

140
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,860
we'll think of that then.

141
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,529
Darn it.

142
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,700
What's wrong?

143
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,139
Hwang Cheol Bum got out.

144
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:35,009
And Anton changed his story.

145
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,710
What do you mean?
What about Kim Keon Yong then?

146
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,909
The prosecutor in charge
isn't Ms. Park anymore.

147
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,250
You know what'll happen.

148
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:45,279
We went through all that
to bring them in.

149
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,679
I know.

150
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,049
Why won't the priest pick up?
He's not at the church either.

151
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,889
I couldn't reach him either,
so I left him a text.

152
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,690
What were you doing?

153
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:57,559
Checking the hard disk drive
we got from Rising Moon.

154
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,360
We handed that all over.

155
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,129
I made a copy just in case.

156
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,539
I taught you well.
You nailed the basics.

157
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,539
Hello, Director Kim Keon Yong.

158
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
What is it?

159
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,120
Get rid of someone.

160
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,320
A female prosecutor.
Her name is Park Kyeong Seon.

161
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,320
She lives in Gudam-gu.

162
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,929
Make it look like a thief did it.

163
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,730
How much does it cost these days?

164
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,970
Wow, what a lowlife scum...

165
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,570
My goodness.

166
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,769
Just hearing that
really made my blood boil.

167
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,210
"How much does it cost?"

168
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:45,179
Am I a fish or something?

169
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,379
This is incriminating evidence.

170
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,649
Why not go to a TV station?

171
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,679
I'm so angry my head is spinning.

172
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,419
Is there Hwang Cheol Bum's voice?

173
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:59,120
No. Anton didn't record him
because they're on the same side.

174
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,429
Then we can't go after him again.

175
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:02,789
No.

176
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,429
But we can definitely
get Kim Keon Yong.

177
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,909
- Come here.
- Okay.

178
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,279
Who knows about this recording?

179
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,950
Right now it's just me
and Koo Dae Young.

180
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,990
Okay. Detective Seo.

181
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,590
- Yes?
- You trust me a little, right?

182
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,059
You hate me but not too much, right?

183
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,830
Well, yes.

184
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,870
Then work with me once.

185
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,169
Work with you?

186
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,480
(Who owns Rising Moon?)

187
00:12:54,879 --> 00:13:00,019
(Who owns Rising Moon?)

188
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:02,389
Who did this?

189
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,519
(Who owns Rising Moon?)

190
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,500
(Repent)

191
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,360
(Accounting)

192
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,769
(Accounting)

193
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,039
Accounting?

194
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,669
(Repent)

195
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,049
(R Club Gate)

196
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,980
(Superintendent Nam Seok Gu)

197
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,820
(Prove ownership.
Drugs, connections)

198
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,789
It's just like what happened to
Jeong Dong Ja.

199
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,519
We have nothing incriminating
to tie Rising Moon...

200
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,389
and Superintendent Nam together
to take him down with.

201
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,960
On the ledger we got
from Rising Moon,

202
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,429
there are only records of
pocketing profits...

203
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:47,399
and information on selling
liquor without a permit.

204
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,200
There's no record
of its actual owner.

205
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,809
Who is the owner of Rising Moon?

206
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,909
Winning with doubt is the reason
for a certain defeat.

207
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:03,710
We have to destroy Mr. Nam
before it's too late.

208
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,789
(Confirming the actual owner,
drugs, connections)

209
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,190
The tip was hidden right here.

210
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,929
This is a definite tip.

211
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:16,759
"Confirming the actual owner."

212
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,960
This will be
the only evidence we'll need.

213
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,399
Explain it to us.

214
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,899
All the ledgers we got
are all fake.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,240
Those are all lies.
We need the real ones.

216
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,070
We need to get their
actual accounting documents.

217
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,710
Have you checked the accounting
firm of Rising Moon?

218
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,509
We haven't check it yet.

219
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:34,879
My gosh. You should've
checked that first.

220
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,409
- Dig into that, Detective Seo.
- Yes, ma'am.

221
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,889
(Accounting)

222
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,590
Lord.

223
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,429
If we find this out,

224
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:54,730
Rising Moon and Mr. Nam
will be over.

225
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,929
The documents must have
all the transfers made,

226
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,570
how the money was distributed
and all sorts of purchase records.

227
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,740
What if they destroyed
all the previous documents?

228
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,480
No, no, no.

229
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,340
They can never destroy them.

230
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,110
It's because they are
the secret ledgers...

231
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,850
of those who are sharing
the profits.

232
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,750
Okay, then we should attack them
with their accounting records first!

233
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,490
Okay, let's get it!

234
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,059
Let's get it!

235
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,960
What's up with my helmet?
I look horrible!

236
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,629
I didn't have an extra,
so I borrowed Song Sac's.

237
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,629
Darn it.

238
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,940
Darn it, I made eye contact
with the person passing by!

239
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,980
We'll catch Mr. Nam in three days,
okay?

240
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,250
Darn it! Don't grab my waist
like that!

241
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,009
It's scary!

242
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,620
Darn it!

243
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,860
Hey! Diabol.

244
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,960
I'll attack them first today.

245
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,929
Hey, hey, don't show off. All right.

246
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,070
You grow up after taking
a few beatings.

247
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:23,350
My goodness, your fists
are not that powerful.

248
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,220
You must be glad
to have powerful fists.

249
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,600
You're Accountant Kim Bu Gi, right?

250
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:42,039
You're Kim Bu Gi, right?

251
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,740
Yes, I am.

252
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,179
You're headed to Hawaii.

253
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,710
"You go to Hawaii."

254
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:51,480
You can't go to Hawaii.

255
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,889
You're in charge of Rising Moon.

256
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,360
- Yes, I am.
- Then follow me.

257
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,289
You have to hold the ears
diagonally to give more pain.

258
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,799
I know it's not your fault.

259
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,740
Those who have power
wanted to play with the numbers.

260
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,740
You must've had no other choice.

261
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,240
Yes, that's right.

262
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,910
Stop.

263
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,650
140 dollars?

264
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,690
It's 150 dollars. Wrong!

265
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,089
You were wrong four times.

266
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,789
You have only one more chance.

267
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:36,160
Start again!

268
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,759
But you shouldn't have
listened to them, don't you think?

269
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,900
Of course, not.

270
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,000
I just followed their orders.

271
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,170
To repent truthfully,

272
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,740
you must start with
transparent accounting.

273
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,509
That's great advice.

274
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,150
That's a great saying.

275
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,779
"To repent truthfully, you must
start with transparent accounting."

276
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,150
Stop!

277
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,119
360 dollars.

278
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:07,589
What's the final score of this game?

279
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:14,359
360 dollars is wrong.
It's 370 dollars.

280
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
Yes!

281
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,440
Now, you were wrong for five times.

282
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,339
Give me the original
accounting documents...

283
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:22,670
of Rising Moon.

284
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,710
- Pardon?
- In the documents,

285
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,180
everything including the actual
owner of Rising Moon,

286
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,009
the distribution of profits,
and cash flow are in there, right?

287
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,109
No, that'll kill many people.

288
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,019
Everyone will die including me.

289
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,119
You might be killed by me instead.

290
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,319
Sir, I don't know
why you're doing this,

291
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,819
please understand me.

292
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,329
Accounting fabrication is...

293
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,230
the shadow and a fate
in Korea's capitalism.

294
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:48,470
Hey, if that's the fate of
a society, then it should be ruined.

295
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,599
What kind of a country is that?

296
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,200
Please...

297
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,299
I beg of you.

298
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,509
I still have two young children.

299
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,339
Gosh, you're so incompetent.

300
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:01,009
Why did you commit a crime
and hold your kids as collateral?

301
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,480
All bad guys do that.

302
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,779
Detective Koo, hold his thighs.

303
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,180
I must twist his legs.

304
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,420
Sounds good.

305
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,690
It doesn't only happen in
dramas or movies.

306
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,319
If you move, you'll get hurt.

307
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:19,359
Okay, I'll say it. I'll say it.

308
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,970
I don't have the documents.

309
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:27,539
You don't?

310
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,569
Actually,

311
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,109
someone took them from me.

312
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:36,750
What do you mean? Who took them?

313
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,779
(Accounting Firm Dozen)

314
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,450
What a ridiculous man.

315
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,220
He got that taken away
because he gambled on it?

316
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,529
That means the actual ledgers
are in the gambling house.

317
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,730
How can a tax accountant
be that clumsy?

318
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,160
How dare he gamble on it?

319
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,000
I bet Mr. Nam
doesn't know this also.

320
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,940
If he did, it'd have caused a stir.

321
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,369
But they don't know the new
location of the gambling house.

322
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,539
How do we find it?

323
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,269
So I...

324
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,210
already got the number of Ggonggi.

325
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:07,609
When did you do that?

326
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,109
I got the number from his texts.

327
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,119
You're quite an amateur
in this field.

328
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,150
Detective, you're quite
arrogant these days.

329
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,319
Come over here.

330
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,730
Let go, let go of this.
I can't be beaten anymore, you brat!

331
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,640
Gosh, why did they
polish my car so poorly?

332
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,009
They should've made it look like
a mirror. They never do a good job.

333
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,279
Those guys are quite audacious.

334
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,109
Those guys are easy-going,
not audacious.

335
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,150
Who are you?

336
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,180
I'm a priest.

337
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,549
I'm Tom, the one who catches Jerry.

338
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,490
You are Jerry who supplies money
to the gambling house, right?

339
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,720
What are you saying?

340
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:58,329
Gosh, I didn't want anyone to bleed.

341
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,730
Goodness, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

342
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,230
Let's try another one.

343
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,069
Are you a cop?

344
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:07,269
No, we are half-priest-half-cop.

345
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,910
Don't say such things.
It's childish.

346
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,039
You know Kim Bu Gi, right?

347
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,910
No, I don't.

348
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,910
It's hot! It's hot!

349
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,849
You know Kim Bu Gi, right?

350
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,190
I do. He's a pushover.

351
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,420
Where's the new gambling house?

352
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
I heard you moved.

353
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,789
I've never...

354
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,500
I want to do it too.

355
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:33,329
Gosh, it's hot! Okay!

356
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:35,430
I'll say it. I'll say it.

357
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,140
Say it.

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,369
This has to make sense.

359
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,910
What should I do?

360
00:21:49,779 --> 00:21:50,849
Mr. Kang.

361
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,549
I must've gone mad.

362
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,150
I tend to be like this...

363
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,759
when I get too angry.

364
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,960
It doesn't happen every day,

365
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,789
but it does happen
from time to time.

366
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
My head must be the problem.

367
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,470
I actually...

368
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,269
take drugs because I have
bipolar disorder as well.

369
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,779
I...

370
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,950
What's wrong with me?

371
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,680
Have I really gone mad?

372
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,589
You crazy wench. You crazy wench!

373
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,960
You crazy wench. You crazy wench!

374
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,190
Mom, I must've gone crazy!

375
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,890
Stop crying.

376
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier
if you had such a problem?

377
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
I had no idea.

378
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,539
If I told you about my state,

379
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:52,579
you'd have had a prejudice
against me.

380
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,509
Then the case regarding Mr. Kim
can be closed neatly, right?

381
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:02,950
If you give me another chance,
I'll do my best...

382
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,089
Okay, okay.

383
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,960
Let me text something. Hold on.

384
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:12,500
The last time I kneeled,
it was for me to survive.

385
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,230
This time, it's for the case
to gain momentum!

386
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,079
Okay. But...

387
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:31,309
we have such little trust in you,
so you have to recover...

388
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,519
If you give me another chance,
I'll do my best.

389
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:39,819
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,890
What is it?

391
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,289
There's a disturbance
Ms. Park's office.

392
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,730
- Pardon?
- Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon!

393
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,670
What's wrong with you?

394
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,299
- Where is she?
- What's wrong with you?

395
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,599
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you doing?

396
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:56,710
You're finally here.

397
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,109
Are you happy to close
all the cases?

398
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,109
You said you wanted to
work with me...

399
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,380
and you've ruined everything.

400
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,420
How dare you act up?

401
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:08,349
You even threatened the witness
of Kim Keon Yong.

402
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,190
And you call yourself a prosecutor?

403
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,019
How could you?

404
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Do you want to die?

405
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,900
Kill me! Kill me if you want to!

406
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,299
Submit a petition right now.

407
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,740
I'm going to report this
to your boss, okay?

408
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,900
Go ahead! Do whatever you want!

409
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,069
Do whatever you want to!

410
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,279
Come here, you brat.

411
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,740
What are you trying to do?

412
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,279
Do you want both of us to die?

413
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,349
Hold on, hold on.

414
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,690
Stop it! What's wrong with you?

415
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,690
I'm going to kill you!

416
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,599
Come on.

417
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,960
Here you go.

418
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,930
This is what I wanted from you.

419
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,799
- Let it go!
- Stop it!

420
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,000
- Let go!
- My gosh.

421
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,880
(Just prosecution, happy citizens)

422
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,089
Are your cheeks okay?
I hit them too hard, right?

423
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,589
Yes, you added a snap to it
when you slapped me.

424
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,789
I've never hit anyone else,
so I didn't know any better.

425
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,259
I couldn't control my power.

426
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:27,029
Hey, I could feel your full force
when you pulled my hair.

427
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,630
At least we succeeded.

428
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:33,039
- Keep this secret to Father Kim.
- Yes, ma'am.

429
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,869
- By the way,
- Yes?

430
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:39,240
I've always wanted to
ask you this.

431
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,809
Ask away.

432
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,180
What do you like about
Father Kim?

433
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:44,710
What?

434
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,849
It's just between us. Don't be shy.

435
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,359
It's just that he's...

436
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,690
- Except for his good looks.
- Okay.

437
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,730
Father...

438
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,529
Spare me with the talk about
his long legs and wide shoulders.

439
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,769
Okay. Father Kim...

440
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,730
He's a little out of style
but his hair is parted...

441
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,869
in the middle in a cute way.
I know that too.

442
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,440
That's not what I wanted to say.

443
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,569
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,609
I like him because
he's like a magician.

445
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,549
A magician?

446
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,380
Like someone who says the spells?

447
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,690
Yes, he has the ability
to change things,

448
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,289
such as the surrounding people
and situations.

449
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,230
At first, it was
so hard and chaotic,

450
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,400
but as time passed by,

451
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,769
it became natural as though
it's always been like that.

452
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Right.

453
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,410
Changing entails confusion
and pain.

454
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,339
Pardon?

455
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,710
Keep up the good work. I'm off.

456
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,380
Good work.

457
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,950
All right!

458
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,819
What? Who stole it?

459
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,990
At the gambling house?

460
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,089
He lied that he had it at first,

461
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,420
but he confessed finally.

462
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:03,630
This is driving me crazy!

463
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,099
Who took them?

464
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,259
I can't be sure of that,

465
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:10,569
but the guy who paid money for the
gambling house is wanted.

466
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,069
Find him no matter what. Hurry.

467
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,509
Yes, sir. One more thing.

468
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,579
Father Kim
must've been here already.

469
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,039
Darn it!

470
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,480
That darn father already went there?

471
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,589
I wonder if Geon Woo is eating well.

472
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:31,390
How could Mr. Hwang
send my right-hand man...

473
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,059
as a substitute? Darn it.

474
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,359
This is so annoying.
I don't like this.

475
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,029
- Enjoy your food.
- Hey, hey.

476
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,930
Bring another one. This is all dry.

477
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,640
This is dried radish, not pickles.

478
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
They're all the same.

479
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,910
Our restaurant's pickles
are delicious.

480
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,779
Bring another one and
don't be arrogant.

481
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,660
What's with your eyes?
Is something in there?

482
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Go get your own pickles.

483
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,160
You long dragon punk.

484
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,230
Did I hear it wrong?

485
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,640
What did you say? Long what?

486
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,039
"Long"...

487
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,210
"Dragon"...

488
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,740
"Punk".
