00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,009
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:05,379
You evil jerk!

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,880
- Darn it.
- Let go of me, you jerk.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,349
Let me go.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,279
- Come here, you lunatic.
- Let me go.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,650
Darn it.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,329
- Let go of him.
- Let me go.

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,390
Let go of him.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,300
What?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,199
What, you jerk?

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,409
What?

12
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,619
Don't commit a sin.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,759
Let go of him first.

14
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:04,540
I wondered who it was.
You're the new priest.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,170
I wondered who you were.
You are the one who sat...

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,409
in the middle of the church.

17
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,739
Anyway, don't mind the town's
business and go on your way.

18
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,810
I became the part of this town
as of yesterday.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,879
Don't tell me what to do.

20
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,120
Mr. Hwang, are you okay?

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,650
Do I look okay to you?

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,189
Are you a cop?

23
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,689
Yes, I am.

24
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,090
Then why did you
just stand and watch...

25
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,560
when those people were being beaten?

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,390
Darn it.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,060
Who on earth is he?
He popped out of nowhere.

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,430
Move.

29
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,840
- Do you go to church?
- No, I'm Buddhist.

30
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:45,310
- What about you?
- I've been to church just once.

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,349
Then why did you throw a fit
using God's holy name?

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,379
It's because you were
passing by, Father.

33
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:54,250
You have no idea how
difficult my situation...

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,090
Darn it, I got involved again.

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,890
Should I call an ambulance?

36
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,590
Then what? Are you going to call
a hot line or something?

37
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,459
You're talking total nonsense.

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,260
Move!

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Why are you in such a horrible
condition? Who did that to you?

40
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,639
That guy, Mr. Hwang.

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,939
He stapled my head
with a huge stapler...

42
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,669
because I wouldn't sell my land...

43
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,979
at a giveaway price.

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,080
Hey, Mr. Seo.

45
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,780
Don't go overboard.

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,050
This isn't the ideal timing to say
hello, but let me introduce myself.

47
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,780
I'm Hwang Cheol Bum.

48
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,419
Are you the gangster of this town?

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,090
Gangster? Me? Who?

50
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,889
Who is gangster here?

51
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,469
They all look like one.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,740
Father, your language
is a little vulgar.

53
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:48,539
Just go on your way
when we treat you as a priest.

54
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,939
I might wet my pants
because I'm so scared.

55
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,949
I should get going then.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Father Ha.

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,849
I've taken photos of your faces.

58
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,219
Don't you get caught by me again.

59
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,789
What's your title
and where do you work?

60
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,599
I'm Detective Koo in Violent Crimes
Team of Gudam Police Station.

61
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,300
You can't get promoted
because you're bad at your job.

62
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,969
What a pity.

63
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,740
Let's go. People who need
to go to hospital, get going now.

64
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,009
Move. Let's go.

65
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,280
Do I look like I haven't
gotten promoted?

66
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,710
Who on earth is he?

67
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,349
Hey, Dae Young.

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,180
I told you to take care
of those who bother me.

69
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,650
Yes, sir.

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,919
Why do you look so uneasy...

71
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,490
every time I say something to you?

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,759
Are you still holding grudges
because of that incident?

73
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,860
No, not at all.

74
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,030
Then stop frowning.

75
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,330
Gosh, those jerks.

76
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:54,169
By the way, you're quite glib.

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,509
I can kill people with my words.

78
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,580
That guy, Mr. Hwang.
He's a gangster, right?

79
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,310
I think so,

80
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,620
although he's a CEO on the surface.

81
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,319
Father Lee should've been
careful whom to accept.

82
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,789
He accepts just about anyone.

83
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,090
Church is open to anyone.

84
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,259
Even the sinners.

85
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,819
I wish we had things like...

86
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,830
disqualification or a suspension
for church believers.

87
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,860
Isn't that against God's will?

88
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,470
Who knows what God's wills are?

89
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,230
Darn it.

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
(No entering)

91
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,810
- Chief!
- Hey, there.

92
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:34,980
What are you doing here?

93
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,220
I went hiking to Mount Youngyu...

94
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,420
and stopped by.

95
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,649
I see.

96
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,550
Then let me take you
to a great duck baeksuk restaurant.

97
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,490
It's okay. I have an appointment.

98
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:46,959
I came by to give you this.

99
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,060
Here.

100
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,699
Hanjoo Group's CEO Kim gave me
a box of Korean Sweets as a gift.

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,870
He gave me too much,
so I brought the other half.

102
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,800
Oh, I see.

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,300
It's too big to share at
the Prosecutor's Office, isn't it?

104
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:01,639
That's why I dropped by.

105
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,509
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

106
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,310
You shouldn't cause
any trouble with this, okay?

107
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,009
Use it well, okay?

108
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,379
I will, thank you.
Hope you have a safe trip.

109
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,949
All right. See you.

110
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:16,990
Goodbye, sir.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,009
He told me it's Korean sweets, but
why is my heart beating like crazy?

112
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,430
My gosh.

113
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:00,829
Oh, my gosh.

114
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,500
He shared exactly the half of it.

115
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,920
Why do I feel uncomfortable...

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,550
and yet reassured at the same time?

117
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,160
(Gudam Police Station)

118
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,459
Hello, sir.

119
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,600
- I want jjamppong!
- But there's only one.

120
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
That's mine!

121
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Turn your head.

122
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,810
You get jjajangmyeon,
and I get jjamppong.

123
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,870
- Have a seat.
- We have another jjamppong.

124
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,040
That's the sauce for tangsuyuk.

125
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,939
Just eat your jjajangmyeon.

126
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,610
Let's eat.

127
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,449
Detective Koo,
the ceremony ended, right?

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
Yes.

129
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,990
You guys always complain
that we need more people,

130
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,620
so I accepted a new recruit.
Say hello.

131
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,290
Hello, my name is Seo Seung Ah.

132
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,560
I look forward
to working with you all.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,360
You really don't seem
like a detective.

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,029
Are you good at anything?

135
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,129
I used to be a member
of the national sepaktakraw team.

136
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,569
And I'm good at kicking...

137
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,170
a culprit's jaw open.

138
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,240
You're very rough
unlike how you seem.

139
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,050
My I continue
with my self-introduction?

140
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,579
There's no need to...

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,279
Check it out

142
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,519
Your trashy composite shows
that you have no conscience

143
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,360
And as I look at you,
I cover you up

144
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,829
The blanket of punishment
is what you will have to live with

145
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,730
And as for me

146
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,360
I am the lamp that put you in jail

147
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,040
Okay.

148
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,439
I see.

149
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,509
Who's going to be her partner?

150
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,790
- Let's move.
- Let's move.

151
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,490
Hey, come on.

152
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,129
Right, I have to go.

153
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,100
I look forward to
being your partner, sir.

154
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,509
Run faster.

155
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,690
Faster.

156
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,620
- Let's go faster.
- Faster?

157
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,860
Hello, Father.

158
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,220
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

159
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,759
I don't know how long
this is going to last,

160
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,470
but I hope we get along
while I'm here.

161
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,100
Father Lee lied to us.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,039
What did he lie to you about?

163
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,740
He told us that the new priest
is really good-looking.

164
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:02,049
No one's ever criticized me
about my looks.

165
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:05,549
You're not exactly ugly.
But you have big nostrils.

166
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:08,049
That's because you're
looking at me from down there.

167
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,120
How about now?
I look good-looking, don't I?

168
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,830
- Father.
- Yes?

169
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,860
I think you have lettuce
stuck in your teeth.

170
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,039
Get over here!

171
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,769
Hurry up and set it off!

172
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,129
I heard there are kids inside, sir.

173
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,740
- There aren't any kids inside.
- But we should still check!

174
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,340
I already checked, you punk!

175
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,070
Do you want to die?
Hurry up and throw it!

176
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,940
Do it, you punk!

177
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,019
Father, are you okay?

178
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,649
Are you really okay?

179
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:27,820
Yes, I'm fine.

180
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,460
You guys are here.

181
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,529
Goodness, you almost missed them.

182
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,529
He's Father Kim Hae Il.

183
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,600
Hello, I'm Bae Hee Jung.

184
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,730
Hello.

185
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,740
I'll be inside.

186
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Okay, go ahead.

187
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,440
I was very much impressed
by today's sermon.

188
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,080
It wasn't that big of a deal,
but thank you.

189
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,549
I'm sorry, but I need to
get to an appointment.

190
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,350
(Psychiatric Clinic)

191
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,419
You can visit me
whenever you feel comfortable.

192
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:04,789
Pardon?

193
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,820
I'll see you next week.

194
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,190
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

195
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,340
You should talk to Ms. Bae.

196
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,809
Just feel free to tell her
everything that's in your heart.

197
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:26,039
It's not that serious.
I don't need treatment.

198
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:29,049
How do you know that?
A professional would know better.

199
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:32,049
All I need to do is pray, meditate,
and have soju with you sometimes.

200
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,750
Hey, what do you do
when you get a cold?

201
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,690
Do you go to the hospital or pray?

202
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,720
I pray.

203
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,519
I prayed even when
my appendix burst.

204
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,389
Not everything will get resolved
just by praying.

205
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,230
No, I don't want to go.

206
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,200
It's your old mentor's wish.

207
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,840
Please give it a try.

208
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,139
Hey, come on. I'm begging you.

209
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,210
- Gosh, what's wrong with you?
- My joints hurt.

210
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,909
Okay, fine. Get back up. I'll go.

211
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:02,980
Are you really going to go?

212
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
Thank you.

213
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:14,889
He totally tricked me.

214
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,529
Gosh, I always get tricked by him.

215
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:26,940
What happened at the ceremony?

216
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,669
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

217
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,039
Why do you keep handling things
like this these days?

218
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,179
Are you trying to show off
that you're a gangster?

219
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,710
I already took care of everything.
You don't need to worry.

220
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,720
Gosh, when will you
get rid of that gangster look?

221
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,889
I'm sorry, sir.

222
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,919
From now on, I'll try harder
not to look like a gangster.

223
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:45,990
How are things going...

224
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,990
with Gudam Church
and the welfare center project?

225
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,490
I'm constantly pressuring them.

226
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,129
You said you'll get it done
within a month. What happened?

227
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:55,899
The owner of that land is a priest.

228
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,039
It's not owned by a civilian,
so it's not easy to convince him.

229
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,009
We put Mr. Hwang in charge
because we knew it wouldn't be easy.

230
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:04,240
Can't you just do what you always do
and force them to leave?

231
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,309
Convincing Gudam Church
to hand over their land...

232
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,450
is the most urgent issue right now.

233
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:13,379
- Mr. Hwang.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,990
You should get it over with.

235
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,389
- Yes, sir. I'll try harder.
- If...

236
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,620
If you fail to take care of this,

237
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:23,590
you'll have to leave
this neighborhood.

238
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,870
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry for worrying you.

239
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:37,909
What's this?

240
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,919
Welcome.

241
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,429
You're the guy that ate bread
in church, aren't you?

242
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,029
Do you know that you need to fast
before mass?

243
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,039
Yes.

244
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,370
Do you know that you could
get kicked out of church...

245
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,840
if you get caught eating something
during mass?

246
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,610
- Yes.
- Then why did you...

247
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,909
Why did you eat?

248
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,720
And why did it have to be
as big as a human's head?

249
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,450
Father, I can't hear things
very well when my stomach's empty.

250
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,720
So I couldn't hear
what you were saying.

251
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,659
What does your stomach have
anything to do with your hearing?

252
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:29,230
It's true. I swear. I swear to God.

253
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,700
Did you really just swear?

254
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,570
Even so, it's still wrong.
Don't eat anything next time.

255
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,240
Don't eat even if you can't hear.

256
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,940
Stop nodding and answer me.

257
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,070
Okay.

258
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:01,690
I guess you live near the church.

259
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,900
That's why I'm in a tracksuit here.

260
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,099
Is it okay for a priest to drink
so much alcohol?

261
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,440
I'm going to stack these up
and drink a little at a time.

262
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:13,240
I see.

263
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,009
I forgot.

264
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,509
Next week, I'll confess to you,
Father.

265
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:20,579
Reformation and rehabilitation come
before anything for my job.

266
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,650
No, thanks.

267
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,579
Conviction and judgment come
before anything for my job.

268
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,950
Why are you so judgmental
of everything I say?

269
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,430
He looks so handsome
even after sunset.

270
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,930
I should have worn some makeup.

271
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,430
Everything you say?

272
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:42,569
Hey, old man.

273
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,569
Find someone else if you want to
flaunt yourself, old man.

274
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,950
How come he got so close to me
suddenly?

275
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,009
What are you doing?

276
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,950
Well, this morning...

277
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,819
a little girl in the primary
department threw away things,

278
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,490
and she accidentally threw away
her favorite doll too.

279
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,289
It's a small bunny.

280
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,089
She was all crying as she lost
what her dad bought her.

281
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,289
So I told her I would find it
for her.

282
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,200
Is that why you're searching through
the recyclable waste now?

283
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,200
What can I do?

284
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,539
You can tell her dad
to buy her one more.

285
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,140
Two months ago,

286
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:57,440
her dad...

287
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,349
passed away due to a car accident.

288
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,950
I understand she's feeling sad,

289
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,789
but do you really have to do this?

290
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,529
This is what priests really
have to do, you know.

291
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,730
We have to find precious things
people lost.

292
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:21,829
And we have to make those things...

293
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,099
give peace of mind to them.

294
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,809
Gosh, really. No one can stop you.

295
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:36,609
Never mind.

296
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,119
Just go inside and sleep.

297
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,950
I'm afraid you would complain later
if I go inside now.

298
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,519
You're right.

299
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,859
It will be enough to complain
for about a year.

300
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,299
I found it.

301
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,029
Is this that bunny?

302
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,640
This is it.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,710
This is it. We found it.

304
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,450
How can we clean these up?

305
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,380
Gosh.

306
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,579
(Seoul Central District
Prosecutor's Office)

307
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,920
I really don't know.

308
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,920
That day, the singer just went
to the party...

309
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,519
Chairman Kim's son was throwing.

310
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,559
What do you mean that
he distributed drugs?

311
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:26,529
I heard that
he confessed at your place.

312
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,799
It's because he got scared.

313
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,799
And...

314
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,240
I think this is clearly
a coercive investigation.

315
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,240
I won't just stand by this time.

316
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,740
I'll call the big law firms...

317
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:39,839
Excuse me.

318
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,519
You're, "Big Pig Entertainment's..."
What does it say?

319
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,549
"President Park Jae Beom"?

320
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,990
Yes.

321
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,319
A coercive investigation?

322
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,119
Big law firms?

323
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,000
You have unusually great spirits,
don't you?

324
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,529
It's so unusually great
that I feel unpleasant.

325
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,170
Do the representative of the agency
and the singer want...

326
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,839
to stay in the room where
the Ministry of Justice provides?

327
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,380
Do you want me to investigate it
so thoroughly...

328
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,579
like a grandma unboning fish
for her grandchild?

329
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,779
I didn't mean to upset you
intentionally.

330
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,289
I feel so upset. It's the most
upsetting day in this year.

331
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,349
What?

332
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,490
- Sir.
- Yes.

333
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,960
You can shut up
and accept this situation.

334
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,559
You're not losing anything from it.

335
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,460
You're learning how to lose from it.

336
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,630
And if you learn how to lose well,

337
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:39,400
you can survive for a long time.

338
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,269
Okay?

339
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,839
You can stop
your hasty action here...

340
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,440
and go home in five seconds.

341
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,890
I'm annoyed from the morning.
I'm even hungry.

342
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:05,759
Ms. Seo,
order a jjamppong with rice for me.

343
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,230
I'd like to eat something greasy.

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,069
I'll have a spicy seafood noodle
soup with rice too.

345
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,970
2 jjamppong with rice
and 1 jjajangmyeon.

346
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,299
And fried dumplings on the house.

347
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:19,039
Well, here's our main jurisdiction.

348
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,480
- Look carefully.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,079
This is the Chinese alley.

350
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,549
There are a lot of good restaurants.

351
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:35,329
Here. They have great lamb skewers.

352
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,599
- Let's get off here.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,700
(China Town)

354
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,769
What's over there?
It's written in a foreign language.

355
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,279
That's...

356
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,279
a special district for Russians.

357
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,579
By the way, there's one thing
you should know.

358
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,750
You should never
go in there alone.

359
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,519
It's a very scary area.

360
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,960
They don't go easy on you even if
you're a police officer. Why?

361
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,359
They can just stab you
and run away in a boat.

362
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,130
That sounds very exciting.

363
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,700
Then you can't
go in there alone, right?

364
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,799
I can surely walk around by myself.

365
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,940
Who's the one
they're most afraid of?

366
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,539
It's me.

367
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,670
Are you good at fighting?

368
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,839
If someone wants to fight with me,

369
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,240
he needs to sign up for a membership
in a funeral service company first.

370
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,309
It sounds unreliable.

371
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:33,750
If you hang out
with a legendary figure,

372
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,390
you might have cognitive dissonance.

373
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,319
I hope I can catch
just one criminal today...

374
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,390
to use my kick after a long time.

375
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,390
(China Town)

376
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,029
Why do you want to use a kick
suddenly?

377
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,299
Why am I getting a bad hunch?

378
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,470
Hey, It's Pororo!

379
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,109
I like playing the most too.

380
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,849
I like to play all day

381
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,319
Come join me all my friends

382
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,519
Don't say anything...

383
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,690
- and stand still.
- Father Lee.

384
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,089
It's going to be all right.

385
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,930
Welcome.

386
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,730
Are you here for the cookies?

387
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,660
Why do you always tell me
to have cookies?

388
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,130
Is that a swear among the priests?

389
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,069
"Eat the cookies."

390
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,099
How come...

391
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,539
you're swearing to me?

392
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,039
Goodness. Don't do this.

393
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:31,140
You punks!

394
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,779
Don't do this.
You dropped these on the ground.

395
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,180
I'm not going to tell you
nicely anymore...

396
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,950
from now on.

397
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,450
I'm going to sit here and beat up
all the people who come to church...

398
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,519
whether it's a child or an old man.

399
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,559
Please don't do this.

400
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,789
What have we done wrong?

401
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,130
You've done wrong.

402
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,230
You didn't listen to my boss.

403
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,599
Don't do this.

404
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,329
You might commit a sin
if you do this.

405
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,640
Then you can send me to hell!

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,839
You punk...

407
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,240
Do you really want to go to hell?

408
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,240
You should just leave now. Michael!

409
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,509
You're the priest
who were playing smart yesterday.

410
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:09,779
Come out of the church.

411
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,579
Stop it, Michael!

412
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:13,650
Why are you telling me to come out?

413
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,049
Are you going to beat us up?

414
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:18,190
I'll wipe the church floor
with your faces.

415
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,660
Come on.

416
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:24,789
Priests these days
make a great joke.

417
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,029
All right. Let's get out of here.

418
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,170
- Come on.
- I said stop!

419
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,269
I don't need to pray.

420
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,039
What's your religion, Detective Seo?

421
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,240
Father, just stay there.

422
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,609
These guys are
good-for-nothing trash.

423
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:38,680
- Come out!
- Trash? Trash?

424
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Stop what you're doing!

425
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,710
Detective Seo! We can just go.

426
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,579
What on earth is that?

427
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,450
Are you a rapper?

428
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,619
You just wait there.

429
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,420
What are you doing here?

430
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:57,089
(Seo Seung Ah,
National Police Agency)

431
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,599
These people come every day
and scare us...

432
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,829
and today, they even laid
their hands on the provost.

433
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,539
Last time, to me, they were...

434
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,440
She's a cutie.
Is she new, Detective Koo?

435
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,450
You need to come with me first.

436
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,180
When you're new,
you need to behave like one.

437
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,490
You need to get the spirit
of the occasion, you know.
