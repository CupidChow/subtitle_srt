00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,940
(Episode 34)

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:08,750
There's construction going on
in front of Daebum Trading,

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,720
so everything will happen behind
the building.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,349
Thinking about stealing
150 million dollars is...

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,349
making me nervous.

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,190
It'd be wonderful if all that money
were mine.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,460
You can't buy happiness with money.

8
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:24,899
In those cases, it's because
you don't have enough money...

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,359
to buy happiness.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,370
Sure, you can't buy happiness,
but money can prevent misfortunes.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,200
I love money so much.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,310
- I really do.
- Hey!

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,109
You capitalistic human beings!

14
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,979
How dare you talk about that
in this sacred place?

15
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,609
Oh, my. It's been a while since
you've been enraged.

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,649
Please go on.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,079
All right. Our mission is simple.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,119
We'll attach a tracker to the car
that will be carrying the money.

19
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,060
Then, we'll chase after them...

20
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,630
and get the money!
Mission accomplished!

21
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,890
Simple, right?

22
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,200
Just in case something might happen,
Mr. Lee and the others...

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,729
will also follow them.

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,969
Then what about me?
I'll be there all alone.

25
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,099
Listen to me, old man.

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,500
We'll be waiting for you
until you come out...

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,870
safe and sound.

28
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,769
And we'll be listening...

29
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,780
to everything that they'll talk
about in the car!

30
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,480
Still, I feel uneasy.

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,379
Just be yourself.

32
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,290
Have you thought about what
you're going to do with the money?

33
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,719
Not yet.

34
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,129
You should do that soon.

35
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,329
We can't have the money
just lying around.

36
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,930
We'll get greedy.

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,099
Okay, I'll think about that. Anyway,
let's make it quick tomorrow.

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,769
- All right, let's get it!
- Let's get it!

39
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,239
Let's get it!

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,409
Let's go! Go!

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,480
- I should try a new move tomorrow.
- Go! Go!

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,750
Money!

43
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,819
Hey, Daebum Trading!
That money will be mine!

44
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,980
You lunatic. What did you just say?

45
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:15,569
Are they all here?

46
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,979
Yes, every single one of them
is here.

47
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:20,550
Good. Make sure they behave.

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,050
And feed them fully beforehand.

49
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,080
I didn't want us to cause
a scene outside,

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,719
so we ordered in.

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,229
(Fiery Lunchbox)

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,370
Your food is here!

53
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey, go get them.

54
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,110
Enjoy.

55
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,009
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

56
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,250
Enjoy.

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,550
This is water! Water!

66
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,319
We meet again,

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,160
Hwang Cheol Bum the dog.

68
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,329
I made a decision as of today.

69
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,800
You'll die in my hands.

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Let's go in, sir.

71
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,769
Old man.

72
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,509
If you can hear me well,

73
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,509
lift your sunglasses
with your left hand.

74
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,519
That black leather jacket!
That's the guy who beat me up.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,019
What? That darned jerk.
I've got you in my sights.

76
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,259
What is that? Is that a knife scar?

77
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,589
Is that Lee Joong Kwon?

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,399
Yes. Doesn't he look so vulgar?

79
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,339
Smile all while you can.
I won't be on your side for long.

80
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,920
What is it?

81
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,990
Darn it.

82
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,860
We can't use a tracker.

83
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,230
They have a jamming machine.

84
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,459
- That black thing?
- That one?

85
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,959
Darn it.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,529
Mr. Lee, are you in position?

87
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,970
Yes. We're currently on standby.

88
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,170
We can't use a tracker.

89
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,470
They have a jamming machine
on the top of their truck.

90
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,740
Don't worry. We'll tail them.

91
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,850
Lager.

92
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,180
"Lager"? Are you talking about beer?

93
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,180
Don't you watch American movies?

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,920
Like FBI agents.

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,389
It's not "lager".

96
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,160
It's "roger".

97
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,990
Shut it.

99
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,399
Why is the building so empty?
It's not the weekend yet.

100
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,699
Everyone's on business trips.

101
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,569
We shouldn't be lazy to make money.

102
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,889
Once they give us the signal,
we'll go, okay?

103
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,220
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

If you do this, you're dead meat.
Got it?

On the count of three.

107

- Three.
- Let's go!

109
00:07:05,329 --> 00:07:07,730
I said it's a rehearsal, you punks!

110
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,990
Gosh, coming in here
makes me nervous.

The fingerprints are a match.

113

You're in front of the safe, right?

114
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,519
Don't be nervous.

Yes.

118

No way.

This will be my last mission.

131

What is this?

135
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,429
Did you swallow that?

136
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,590
Do you have any snacks?

137

- Gosh.

- One more sip.
- No, you can't.

for your convenience.

75 million dollars, right?

Do you truly believe that...

147
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,000
you'll be able to leave
with the money unscathed?

148
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,370
Why not? What would stop me?

149
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,309
Do you think...

150
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,710
I didn't expect this to happen?

I'll make an acrostic poem...

Hello, losers.

What? Long Dragon,
you can step aside.

Busy with what?
Straightening your hair?

179

for the past couple of days.

to really hate you.

that I might wet my pants.

- Did you wet yours?
- I did.

185
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,009
Why am I sweating?

186
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,950
- Do you see that?
- I think they’re almost dying.

187
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,210
We're in a dangerous situation
right now.

188
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,179
- We should leave.
- Yes, let's get out of here.

189
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,120
Go back inside.

190
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,450
Why did you come out?

191
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,220
Put a smile on your faces,
and go in.

192
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,629
What? Is that a moonwalk?

193
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,230
Sure, moonwalk all the way
back home.

194
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,799
And drink at home this early!

195
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,840
Why am I sweating so much?

196
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:20,240
My stomach doesn't
feel good either.

197
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,879
What's wrong with me?

198
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,889
Many of his men are on standby.

199
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,259
- Hey.
- Yes?

200
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,100
- Go check.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,570
What a punk.

202
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,370
You're only quick
when it comes to these things.

203
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,840
These days, sad forebodings
don't fail to disappoint me,

204
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,480
you dirtbag.

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,250
What?

206
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,149
Have you gone mad?

207
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,590
Kill me. Do it.

208
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,759
But if you do,

209
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,960
everyone here dies along with me.

210
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,730
Come on. If we only do
what we planned to do,

211
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,629
things won't get ugly.

212
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,870
What's wrong with you?

213
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,740
I was going to do that as well,

214
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,769
but I don't think
he's on the same boat as us.

215
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:26,679
What will you do?

216
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,549
Will you kill me
and bring on bloodshed?

217
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,350
Or would you like to leave quietly?

218
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,789
In two minutes,

219
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,190
my boys will come down here.

220
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,299
Hurry up! Hurry!

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,169
It seems like the fight
will happen soon.

222
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,240
They should fight outside
so that they will move the money.

223
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,909
We'll succeed, right?

224
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,279
I'm so nervous.

225
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,120
How should we take down
Cheol Bum's men?

226
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,950
Gosh, my stomach hurts.
Let me go to the bathroom first.

227
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,120
Right.

228
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,990
We can take them down like that.

229
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,059
During ancient war times in China,

230
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,730
there was a secret weapon used
to emasculate opponents.

231
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,429
Flower intoxication.

232
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,440
Flowers that contain poison.

233
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,470
One drop of its extract...

234
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,809
and your intestines will twist
and have diarrhea.

235
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,409
In the end, your intestines
will be paralyzed.

236
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:37,679
You'll have no choice
but to lie down for an hour.

237
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,450
Before the great explosion,

238
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,919
you'll be sweating buckets.

239
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,559
What is the name...

240
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,629
of this flower?

241
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,830
To leak, "seol". To spill, "sa".
And flower, "hwa".

242
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,330
Seolsahwa.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,870
Just hearing its name
makes me have diarrhea.

244
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,399
But these flowers only grow
in China.

245
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,509
And due to its poisonous nature,
it's forbidden to bring them in.

246
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,440
All right. What do you need?

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,679
I need some flowers
named Seolsahwa.

248
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,450
What was that?

249
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,850
Seolsahwa.

250
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,860
(Fiery Lunchbox)

251
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,320
Eat up, all right?

252
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

253
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,799
Goodness, look at you.
Where are you going?

254
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,259
You can't wander around like that.

255
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,629
You need to die.

256
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,740
Kill him.

257
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,080
It went as planned.

258
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,080
Seolsahwa! It is indeed
an amazing flower!

259
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,049
They can't even move! Look!

260
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:58,419
This is not a humane way
of going about this.

261
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,820
I can't bear to watch.
Was this really necessary?

262
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,970
You darned rat.

263
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,069
Look at you, trying to be smart.

264
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,970
They're a bit strange.

265
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:23,549
Sir.

266
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,819
The boys are...

267
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,700
It hurts.

268
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,869
What's going on?

269
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,940
Everyone has diarrhea.

270
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,410
There's an explosion upstairs.

271
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,480
My stomach... I can't feel it.

272
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,589
Hey, move the money.

273
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,019
(Gudam Express)

274
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,890
(Anywhere in the country,
Gudam Express)

275
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,430
I can't feel my stomach.

276
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:21,410
You know how they anesthetize you
before pulling your teeth out?

277
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,470
Like that, I can't feel anything.

278
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,109
I want to get up.

279
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,849
Mommy...

280
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,619
What's wrong with me?

281
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,750
Stop talking. You're making me spew.

282
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,289
You little...

283
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,769
It's going as planned.

284
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,940
Do you still wish to live?

285
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,180
You crazy punk.

286
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,450
I don't think you're in the best
situation to talk like that.

287
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,250
Both of you, go inside.

288
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,950
Why? Will you kill us in there?

289
00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:10,150
Yes. Why bother asking?

290
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,390
You can't kill someone in here.

291
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,730
Sir, that will only cause
a bigger problem.

292
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,460
- Let's just...
- Shut it. You, go inside as well.

293
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,900
Me? Why me?

294
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,430
Just go inside.

295
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,470
What's going on?

296
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,240
Didn't I warn you?

297
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,740
I told you not to betray
my expectations for you.

298
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,809
Did you understand that or not?

299
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,680
Hey, I know that you and Cheol Bum
planned on this together.

300
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,410
Who? When? Why?
What did I do?

301
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,380
I never did that.

302
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,650
I never planned anything
with Prosecutor Park.

303
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,920
He denies it.

304
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,119
Hey, we heard you two
talking to each other.

305
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,930
And don't believe what
Chief Prosecutor Kang says.

306
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,559
"I'm hungry." "I'm sleepy."

307
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,799
Everything he says besides that
is a lie. Do you understand?

308
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,240
You must be kidding me.

309
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,769
Hey. What did you say?

310
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,309
Everything I say except
"I'm hungry" and "I'm sleepy"...

311
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,609
is a lie?

312
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,579
You must've lost your minds.

313
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,680
Gosh, I wasn't smart enough
to think about modern technology.

314
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,079
Get in there.

315
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,089
Why should I go in? Do I deserve
to die for that or something?

316
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,329
Go in.

317
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,269
You said they would suffocate
because of the air loss in there.

318
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,339
Right. Then what should we do?

319
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:33,440
- Watch the situation from here.
- Where are you going?

320
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,970
She is in danger.

321
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,779
We're in a serious situation,
but he's so cool.

322
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:43,980
What is cool about him?

323
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,920
He's just barging in like that
without a plan. My goodness.

324
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,650
(Daebum Trading)

325
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:24,049
Father Kim.

326
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,420
Go fight.

327
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,569
Hoon Seok.

328
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,769
Don't interfere
when the elders are fighting, okay?

329
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,170
Excuse me?

330
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,190
You jerks.
The numbers aren't even.

331
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,589
Why are you butting in?

332
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,789
I have a debt to payback too.

333
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,470
What are you waiting for?
Just shoot them.

334
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,339
Should I just kill them?

335
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,269
You should quickly go.

336
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,769
Hey, didn't you barge in
too recklessly?

337
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,470
That's what I mean.

338
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,839
Let's leave Ms. Park out of this.

339
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,140
I'll go in the safe.

340
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,150
Is that why you're here?
Are you two dating each other?

341
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,579
I'm telling you to leave her out
since I'll go in the safe.

342
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,019
Forget it. I'll just stay here.

343
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:05,819
Gosh, they got us wrong.
This is embarrassing.

344
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,630
Seriously. What is this?

345
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,460
Hey, are all of you
on the same side?

346
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,930
Forget it. Seriously.

347
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,599
You're right. I'm on the same side
with Father Kim. Why?

348
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:17,299
My gosh, you're all crazy.

349
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,170
Then you were lying
about siding with me too.

350
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,480
You jerks.

351
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,539
You.

352
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,710
Hello, hip-hop girl.

353
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,079
What happened here?

354
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,920
Is this the neighborhood bank?
Why is everyone walking in?

355
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,089
I told you to wait outside.

356
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:40,460
How could we wait outside?

357
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,259
Hey, aren't those blank rounds?

358
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,589
They aren't blank rounds.

359
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:45,859
Then try shooting them.

360
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,569
- I told you they're not.
- So try shooting them.

361
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,799
- Gosh, he's too smart.
- My goodness.

362
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,869
Mr. Kang.

363
00:23:55,509 --> 00:23:57,569
- What?
- If I'm alive until tomorrow,

364
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,410
you'll be in deep trouble.

365
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,410
Is it bipolar disorder again?

366
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,079
Aren't you kneeling down
and acting now?

367
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:07,019
My gosh. You're bluffing to the end.
My goodness.

368
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,490
Hey, take care of them.

369
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,490
Hey, Lee Joong Kwon.

370
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,160
Your life will become much better
without me.

371
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,490
Nobody will try to kill you either.

372
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,829
I said that I'll go in.
Can't you let me do that much?

373
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,069
- Father Kim.
- No, Father Kim.

374
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:25,500
Think wisely.
Stop bullying kids and women.

375
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,839
You used to be with
the special forces.

376
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,170
Aren't you embarrassed of yourself?

377
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,380
You should use this opportunity
to think wisely as a man.

378
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,549
Okay.

379
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,180
(Gudam Express)

380
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,819
It's nice to take care of this
by making others do it for us.

381
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,859
Let's get going if we're done now.

382
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,430
Gosh, you're so immature.

383
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:29,299
Why would I have to...

384
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,039
help a mere chief prosecutor
like you?

385
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,839
Haven't you thought about that?

386
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:35,740
You jerk.

387
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,910
Hey, I'll make good use
of the money you gathered.

388
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,039
Thank you.

389
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,279
Will you bring it here?

390
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,450
But I still had my mercy
to get this for you.

391
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,849
You should take it and use it well.

392
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,289
If I had any bad feelings about you,

393
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,960
I would've pushed you
into the safe with the others.

394
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:57,559
You can't do anything
with that money.

395
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:58,799
You're right.

396
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,170
I'll at least make a bed out of it
if I have no use for the money.

397
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,069
And don't try to catch me.

398
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,140
I know so many of your weak spots.

399
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,599
I could expose everything.

400
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,170
Do you understand?

401
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,269
Let's go.

402
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,410
Hey, let's go.

403
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,829
That guy is really cheap and cruel.

404
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:37,000
He's such a real jerk.

405
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:38,940
So why did you have to taunt him?

406
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,309
I know, right?
We could've solved it well.

407
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,869
Gosh, I'm at a loss for words.

408
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,440
This is driving me crazy. Seriously.

409
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:49,779
But it isn't that difficult
to breathe than I thought.

410
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,089
What is that?

411
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,759
That loud noise...

412
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,799
Isn't that the thing?
The thing that gets rid of air.

413
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,599
What is that?

414
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,799
Gosh, I found 50 dollars.

415
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,710
Now, our lives...

416
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,480
have 15 minutes left. Darn it.

417
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,809
It's 15 minutes for a person.
We're...

418
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,079
2, 4, 6...

419
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:30,589
My gosh. We only have
2 to 3 minutes?

420
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,990
Are we all dying here?

421
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,470
(The Fiery Priest)

422
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,369
Lee Joong Kwon beat up
Chief Prosecutor Kang...

423
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:24,539
and ran away with the money.
It's 150 million dollars.

424
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:25,910
I'll go find that money.

425
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,339
How did they get out?

426
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,349
We'll need more extreme measures.

427
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,880
Why do I keep smelling poop?

428
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
Can you guarantee my son's safety?

429
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,019
Yes.

430
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:38,559
I'll make sure I repay you for this.
