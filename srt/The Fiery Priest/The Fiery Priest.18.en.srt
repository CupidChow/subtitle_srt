00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,740
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,910
My condition's not like before.

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:16,719
Why is this...

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,789
How dare they?

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,390
It's not bad!

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,760
Sir, please slow down.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,629
What did I tell you?

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,670
I told you Ms. Jeong
and Mr. Hwang...

9
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,539
would cause trouble someday.

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,170
I doubted it.

11
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,409
Why did Ms. Jeong run her mouth?

12
00:00:37,009 --> 00:00:38,340
If she steps down,

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,850
and someone from the ruling party
gets voted,

14
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,280
what will you do then?

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,020
There won't be any Savings Day.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,520
All the more reason for making sure
she keeps her position.

17
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,090
But I don't think that's necessary.

18
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,229
- Pardon?
- Let's take this opportunity...

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,630
and let someone from our side
take that position.

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,439
Right.

21
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,340
Let's ask Mr. Kang
what he thinks about this idea.

22
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,609
How about we don't tell...

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,180
this to Mr. Kang?

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,010
I also...

25
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,180
think the same.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,969
Why are you doing this?

27
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't know anything

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,209
I hate how your face says that.

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,849
Why on earth are you doing this?

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,049
Who stole the ledger
of Wangmat Foods?

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,150
Sorry?

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,790
I've never been...

33
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:58,359
this angry these days.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,590
So tell me quickly.

35
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,930
I have no idea.

36
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,000
I asked Father Kim,

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,000
but he didn't tell me
saying it's a secret.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,439
- Move on to the next phase.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:26,280
I seriously have no idea.

40
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,389
I gave you the information
you asked for in the morning!

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,389
I seriously have no idea, Mr. Hwang!

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,090
I mean it!

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,159
Let me ask you again.

44
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:43,099
If you lie again,
you'll become one...

45
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,969
with those steels
like the movie, "Transformers".

46
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,039
Who was it?

47
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,039
Who stole the ledger?

48
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,240
I'm serious.

49
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,680
I really don't know.

50
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,830
I really don't know! Don't kill me!

51
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,349
I guess you really have no idea.

52
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,319
Let's go.

53
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:05,219
You did well.

54
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:08,250
You did well, Dae Young.

55
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,960
I don't regret it.
I don't regret it.

56
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,430
I don't regret it.

57
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,970
Hwang Cheol Bum...

58
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,750
Give me the key, will you?

59
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,120
Be quiet.

60
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,689
Or order us some jajangmyeon.

61
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,089
We're the Hungry Gang of
South Chungcheong Province.

62
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,800
If Ms. Jeong resigns on her own,

63
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,470
who will take care of us?

64
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,029
It'll be the end of us.

65
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,240
She won't care about us.

66
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,470
She'll just take care of herself.

67
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,240
If worse comes to worst,

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,339
let's just disclose everything.

69
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,480
Let's tell the cops that we just did
what we were told to do, okay?

70
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,649
Details of the report,
editing, and filtering...

71
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,649
will be done exactly the way
I tell you to do.

72
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,689
Don't add anything unnecessary.

73
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,889
Just listen to me.

74
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,470
This scumbag of a reporter is
having the time of his life.

75
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,870
It feels like reporters these days
are more interested in making...

76
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,970
things sound more
dramatic than they actually are.

77
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,040
I can't say we're that different.

78
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:43,680
Why was the warrant denied?

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,980
I'm not sure either.
I was just told so.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,990
What kind of nonsense is this?

81
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,959
(Prison)

82
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,360
Open up.

83
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,129
You can go home for now.

84
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,399
The head of health office,
the employees, and you will stay.

85
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,399
- Why?
- What do you mean?

86
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello, hip-hop girl.

87
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,939
Why are you letting them go?

88
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:09,709
Why wasn't the warrant issued?

89
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:11,709
The prosecutor in charge
has changed.

90
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,350
It's someone you all know very well.

91
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,980
- Prosecutor Park Kyeong Seon?
- Yes.

92
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,420
I'll be off now.

93
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,860
It hasn't even been that long since
she left for Yeongwol!

94
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,019
I'm so vexed!

95
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,689
Why are you so angry?

96
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,189
Why shouldn't I be?

97
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,230
Every time I try to do something,
they become even slyer.

98
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,500
Yes, Sister.

99
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,240
I don't know why the prosecutor
wants to see me so suddenly.

100
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,009
We'll only know after we see her.

101
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,980
I'm just nervous.

102
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,209
It's not anything bad, is it?

103
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,910
Don't worry too much.

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
I'll meet you at the station.

105
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,220
What is it?

106
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:00,829
It seems like Sister Angela has
given us a counterattack.

107
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,870
Hello, Father.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,740
I see that you've made
a terrible mess.

109
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:13,439
You're like a tsunami, aren't you?

110
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,939
Seeing how you're back, you must've
kneeled down in front of them.

111
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,579
What? "Kneeled down"?

112
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,910
How old-fashioned are you?

113
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,980
I know I'm asking for too much,

114
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,319
but I do hope you do this
fair and square, got it?

115
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,990
I swore in front of Lady Justice.

116
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,250
Fair and square, equality,
and justice.

117
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,920
"Fair and square". Lady Justice?

118
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,889
Are you sure you didn't swear
in front of a rock?

119
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,129
Why do you have no trust in me?

120
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,829
Father, you should strengthen
your belief in me.

121
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:42,500
- Trust me.
- I do respect belief.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,899
But doubting is what protects me.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,709
I finally feel like I'm back,

124
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,209
hearing how you're chewing me out
so sacredly and elegantly.

125
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,149
Why aren't you saying hi? We haven't
seen each other in a while.

126
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,480
Hello.

127
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,689
I see that your nose originally
looks like that.

128
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,120
It wasn't because
it was swollen last time.

129
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,490
Health office, follow me.

130
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,540
That little wench.

131
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,709
You must be exhausted
from the early morning,

132
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,009
so I'll make this short.

133
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:23,269
- The documents, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,180
Find your names.

135
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,410
I know that you must be unhappy...

136
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,279
with the borough office
and Ms. Jeong.

137
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,490
But still, a public official
shouldn't be so emotional.

138
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,690
After all, you were benefited
by the borough office.

139
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,360
(CCTV Footage Evidence)

140
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,759
(Hurrah Karaoke)

141
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,029
I bet you wanted to disclose
everything in the end.

142
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,169
"Whatever, you can all die!"

143
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,200
But you can't do that.

144
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,940
You should take responsibility
like true men.

145
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,870
If not, I'll go with the charges
you've already been given.

146
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,710
Your wives, children, and parents...

147
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,379
will be so shocked.

148
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,250
If they find out that...

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,379
you've been visiting
prostitutes and brothels...

150
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,059
All right, then. You will take
responsibility for everything.

151
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,129
How awesome are they?

152
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,129
If you lack insight,
you should have information.

153
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,730
If you lack information, you should
at least have some sense in you.

154
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,840
If you lack sense,
then should've at least listened!

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,610
I apologize, sir.

156
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,940
If you're truly sorry,
you should die.

157
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,409
Spare your energy.
You're on a fast right now.

158
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,580
Calm down.

159
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,980
We're currently working on
Ms. Jeong's issue.

160
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,519
Soon, we will hear some good news.

161
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,419
She volunteered to resign,

162
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,220
so how can we fix this?

163
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,559
You'll see.

164
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,990
Even if she took her words back,

165
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,659
it wouldn't be too big of a problem.

166
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,559
Look at all this mess
because of that priest.

167
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,230
Yes, that priest!
Let's do something about him,

168
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,629
whether we kill him or not!

169
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,940
After all, we're not going
to end up in paradise anyway.

170
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,769
Let's kill him as we did
with Father Lee!

171
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,419
Before that, I think we should
focus on strengthening...

172
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,149
our side.

173
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,190
Why bother fixing a stable...

174
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,360
when we have already lost the cow?

175
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,860
We should if we're going
to bring in a new cow.

176
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,299
Speaking of which,
I'd like to become the new leader...

177
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,730
even if it doesn't mean much.

178
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,139
It's to help strengthen
our solidarity.

179
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,169
I ask that you run
all information, acquisitions,

180
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:38,980
and decisions by me.

181
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,279
What? Why?

182
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,879
Also, if we're to decide
on the leader,

183
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,620
we should at least vote.

184
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,649
Why?

185
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,620
Are you against it?

186
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,289
Well... Not really, but...

187
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,330
I agree with him.

188
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,269
Well, he knows best about us.

189
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,570
I'm down.

190
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,470
What?

191
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,039
Thank you, everyone.

192
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:19,549
Darn it.

193
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,519
Why did you have to make
spoiled food?

194
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,620
First, President Ki,

195
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,889
please pay for Eun Ji's hospital fee
up until today,

196
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,000
and pay for all the cost
in the future as well.

197
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,159
We haven't even
gone through trial yet.

198
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,730
If you don't,

199
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,330
I'll double your charge on bribery.

200
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,500
Should I double that one more time?

201
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,970
Fine. I'll pay.

202
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,840
Sister, please drop the suit,

203
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,110
write a memorandum,
and get it notarized.

204
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,480
Promise that after
you receive the payment,

205
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,710
you won't bring up
this issue anymore.

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,049
No, ma'am. I can't do that.

207
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,179
We will receive the payment...

208
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,519
and also see to it
that his company gets punished.

209
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Sister.

210
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,590
Lee and Park Law Firm is
working for them.

211
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,759
Do you know them?

212
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,299
Of course, I do. I know that much.

213
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,100
If you want to sue them,

214
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,169
it'll take about two years
to get reimbursed.

215
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,899
Who will pay the hospital bills
until then?

216
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,139
Even if you win the suit,
you won't get the full amount.

217
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:16,269
Do you know why?
That law firm...

218
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,009
will do their best
to cut down on the cost.

219
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,779
You need to be wise and think
what's best for Eun Ji.

220
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:25,379
What should I do?

221
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,889
I'll give you a minute.

222
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
You guys can talk over it.

223
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,029
Hello, Mr. Lee. I guess you're back
from the Czech Republic.

224
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,759
I'd like you to look into a person.

225
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,769
His name is Kim Hae Il.

226
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,769
He's currently a priest.

227
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,519
Father.

228
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,259
What is it?

229
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,330
We went through so much
from the early morning.

230
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,629
This won't all go to waste,
would it?

231
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:16,000
Not this time.
We have solid evidence.

232
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,000
But look at what's happening.

233
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,870
I'm so angry.

234
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,210
Hey. Why would you cry?

235
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,139
It's not because I'm sad.

236
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,279
I'm just that much enraged.

237
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,549
They're all scumbags.

238
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,519
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:47,299
I'm sorry. I must look pathetic.

240
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,269
I feel like I've gott a friend who
sincerely cares about me.

241
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,440
I feel encouraged.

242
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,639
Don't make me embarrassed.

243
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,049
I must be out of my mind.

244
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,909
Look at them.

245
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,919
You're not.

246
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,250
Father, wait.

247
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,220
Oh, my.

248
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,460
How dare she flirt with him?

249
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,259
Give it back if you're done.

250
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:18,659
No, I'll wash it for you.

251
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,070
- Are you all right?
- I am.

252
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,210
I'll take you to the hospital.

253
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,039
I said I'm fine,
so why are you exaggerating?

254
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,379
Apologies, sir.

255
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,779
I found out who took...

256
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,019
the ledger.

257
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,019
What?

258
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,049
I couldn't find them because
there were no CCTVs there.

259
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,620
But I found this black box footage
inside a car that was...

260
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,389
parked outside the factory.

261
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,299
Those dirtbags.

262
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,940
Get them.

263
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:01,539
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,750
Kim Hae Il, that scumbag.

265
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,679
Today,

266
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,590
let's not be nice.

267
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,850
Yes, sir.

268
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,700
I finally feel alive.

269
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,240
When my stomach gets full,
I feel so happy.

270
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,370
Song Sac!

271
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,379
I should liven up my spirits.

272
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:44,320
Hello.

273
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,289
Come on.

274
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,490
Let me see if you've done
your homework.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,629
How much wood would
a woodchuck chuck...

276
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,799
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

277
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,539
Your turn.

278
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,309
- How much would a chuck...
- What?

279
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,039
- Chuck wood if woodchuck...
- Chuck? Wood?

280
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,009
Why are you so stupid?

281
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,480
Is it that hard for you
to memorize it?

282
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,379
Repeat.

283
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,850
Excuse me.

284
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,929
It's okay. What is it?

285
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,429
Would you like to try mine?

286
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,470
Yo Han, stop it.

287
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:38,940
Is this a battle?

288
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,139
Another tongue-twister, is it?

289
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,610
Bring it on.

290
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,539
Let me show off
my majestic enunciation.

291
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,409
All right. It's easy.

292
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,350
Silly Sally swiftly shooed
seven silly sheep.

293
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,389
The seven silly sheep
Silly Sally shooed...

294
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:58,059
shilly-shallied south.

295
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,919
These sheep shouldn't sleep
in a shack.

296
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,659
Sheep should sleep in a shed.

297
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,170
What are you doing?

298
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:12,299
What?

299
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,509
Are you a rapper or what?

300
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,609
Try it.

301
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:17,640
I'll finish it in one breath,
so listen carefully.

302
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,640
Silly Sally swiftly shooed...

303
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,809
- seven silly sheep.
- Wrong!

304
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,920
Silly Sally swiftly shooed
seven silly sheep.

305
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,789
- Yo Han, stop.
- Did you see that?

306
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,920
I was just warming up.

307
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,589
Silly Sally swiftly shooed...

308
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,130
- seven... Seven silly... Sheep.
- Wrong.

309
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,329
Silly Sally swiftly shooed
seven silly sheep.

310
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,130
Swag.

311
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,940
Silly Sally swiftly shooed...

312
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,410
seven... Seven...

313
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,750
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

314
00:17:57,849 --> 00:18:00,680
The word that I hate the most...

315
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,720
is "wrong".

316
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:07,519
Yo Han! Yo Han!

317
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,029
I like "correct" better.

318
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,259
I think I should show off
my karate kicks tonight.

319
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Hey.

320
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,740
Who?

321
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:24,640
Catch whom?

322
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,079
I already did.

323
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,349
Did you sign the agreement?

324
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,990
I did. I thought I had
to save Eun Ji first.

325
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,630
My lawyer told me that
that would be better.

326
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,160
Then we won't be able
to punish them completely.

327
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,660
That will only...

328
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,769
That will only reduce
their sentences.

329
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,369
Then I made the wrong choice.

330
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,809
Father.

331
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,019
It has turned out that
Chief of Borough Jeong Dong Ja's...

332
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,920
voluntary resignation two days ago
happened due to...

333
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,619
a priest's coercion
while trying to cover up...

334
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:13,660
the evil deeds of a church.

335
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,930
This feels ominous.

336
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,630
Goodness.

337
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,700
That's it?

338
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,670
This man is heard speaking rudely
to the Chief of Borough.

339
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,869
He is Priest Kim of Gudam Church.

340
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,170
That voice is repulsive.

341
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:28,369
Be quiet.

342
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:31,109
How could they alter
the voice like that?

343
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,809
Last month, Priest Lee committed
suicide after feeling pressured...

344
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:36,380
while being interrogated
for sexual harassment...

345
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,579
and stealing money from the church.

346
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,549
He was mocked by the citizens.

347
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,450
Afterwards, Priest Kim attempted
to provoke the police...

348
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,190
in order to turn the tables around.

349
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,460
But if you really feel upset
about taking responsibility...

350
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,029
and feel like you didn't do
anything wrong,

351
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,670
you can just blame your employees
for what happened.

352
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,869
Okay, it's official!

353
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,069
You're really going to
step down, right?

354
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:02,670
Then you'd better get ready
to step down, ma'am.

355
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,579
And at the end,
he was able to get...

356
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,240
what he wanted.

357
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:11,009
I promise that I will step down
from my position...

358
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,680
("Criticisms on
the Priest's Provocation")

359
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,880
as the Chief of Borough.

360
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,119
Feeling humiliated,
the Chief of Borough decided...

361
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,089
to take complete responsibility.

362
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,690
What shocks the people more is
how he reacted afterward.

363
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,930
He threw copies
of unconfirmed evidence in the air.

364
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,700
Priests are supposed to help
our souls find peace.

365
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,769
However, this priest tormented
a human's soul...

366
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,569
in order to gain profit.

367
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,539
It is crucial for all religions
to think once again...

368
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,450
about how a true believer
should act.

369
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,309
This was Lee Mi Yeon
of QNN News.

370
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,000
Father, take a deep breath.

371
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,539
That was such malicious editing.

372
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,539
Hey, everyone these days knows...

373
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,309
that that was fake.

374
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,319
(- He's nothing but a thug.
- He's not even human.)

375
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,410
(Gudam Police Station)

376
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,440
Old man!

377
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,210
Well, aren't you the polite type?

378
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,380
You made the health office
take all responsibility,

379
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,990
used the sick child
to drop the suit,

380
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,150
and made me look like a fool.

381
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,319
You've done so well.

382
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,829
Now, will you get a raise...

383
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,089
and land a position
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

384
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,630
Today, you're not just arguing,
but slandering me.

385
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,000
Forget about everything else,
but how could you use a sick child?

386
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:11,500
Enough! You should behave yourself.

387
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,180
Behave myself? What do you mean?

388
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,980
I'm talking about that Seo girl.

389
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,579
That cop who has a crush on you.

390
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,819
She smiles at you like this...

391
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,890
and removes stuff
from your shoulder.

392
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,759
- What?
- Being all lovey-dovey...

393
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,759
with a young, pretty girl will taint
your reputation as a priest.

394
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,930
What kinds of impure thoughts
do you have?

395
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,170
How could you say that to a priest?

396
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,829
Then are you allowed to talk...

397
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,369
about a prosecutor getting a raise
and landing a job like that?

398
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:47,569
Fine.

399
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:49,569
I'll take them all back
and rephrase it.

400
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,579
Garbage.

401
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,920
Garbage that cannot be recycled.

402
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,420
You...

403
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,930
What did you say?

404
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,359
Ma'am! Father!

405
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,769
You can't do this in front
of the police station.

406
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,599
"Garbage"?

407
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,839
I hate that word the most.

408
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,509
You deserve to be called so.

409
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:23,539
Also...

410
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:26,880
It won't stop bleeding.

411
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,380
That's awesome.
I just need to hit you once more.

412
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:31,410
Sure, do that.

413
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,150
Let me get reimbursed
by a prosecutor.

414
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,390
- Hold it in.
- Let me go, Big Nose.

415
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,789
Why are you talking rudely
to your elder?

416
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,319
- Do you not like that?
- No. I mean, it's okay.

417
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,190
- He's fine.
- I don't like it!

418
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,190
- How could you hit a priest?
- Do something!

419
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,029
I'm going to sue you
after going to the hospital.

420
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,299
"Sue"?

421
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,529
I'm bleeding!

422
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I'll sue you as well!

423
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,039
How could you sue me
when you hit me first?

424
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:55,470
How could you be so stupid?

425
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,039
What? You've never got kicked
by me, have you?

426
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,549
- Let me go!
- Please!

427
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,250
I'm so sorry.

428
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,450
You have a mean punch.

429
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,289
You cheated when you hit him.

430
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,519
Cheated?

431
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,420
It's because I have a longer middle
finger than most people, okay?

432
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,490
I'll go get some tissue, Father.

433
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,990
Detective Koo!

434
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,130
Why do you live like this?

435
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,500
You're in a position where
you don't have to hurt anyone.

436
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,210
When did I hurt anyone?

437
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,339
I did? What did I do?

438
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,539
Please think about others too, okay?

439
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,279
You are a prosecutor,
for goodness' sake!

440
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,710
Think about others?

441
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,150
I've been laying low
because of you...

442
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,380
and keeping what
I wanted to say to myself.

443
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:44,960
Never mind!
What good would this do to me?

444
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,559
Then are you saying that's my fault?
What are you trying to say?

445
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,029
Do you take me as a sociopath
because I joke around with you?

446
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:54,200
But you do look like
a sociopath, Ms. Park.

447
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,630
There are many tests to determine
whether you are one or not,

448
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,829
so look it up online and try it.

449
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,240
You're going far with this.

450
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,539
If you're a priest, you should know
how to see one's inner side.

451
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,250
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

452
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:16,390
Detective Koo.

453
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:31,269
I couldn't wrap it up nicely,

454
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,839
and I got beaten up on top of that.
How embarrassing.

455
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,380
Half point.

456
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,150
I said, half point.

457
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,819
What are you saying?

458
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,319
That's how they keep score in judo.

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,319
No point, half point,
and a full point.

460
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,920
Father, you scored
half point this time.

461
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,130
You didn't expect to win at once.

462
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,990
Right?

463
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,730
If you keep going like this,

464
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,700
you'll be able to win a full point.

465
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,569
You'll be
the winner of a full point,

466
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,170
Kim Hae Il.

467
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,109
Gosh, you crazy punk.

468
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,180
Why are you trying to hit me
when I'm consoling you?

469
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,019
Don't make me laugh.

470
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,390
I should buy
Yo Han and Song Sac a drink.

471
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,849
They went through so much
because of me.

472
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:26,819
What about me?

473
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,690
Come with me if you're going to buy.

474
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:31,059
I want to try the drinks
that were blessed by a priest.

475
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,200
You have a tendency to be clingy.

476
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,630
- Me?
- Yes.

477
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,440
That's total nonsense.

478
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Hello?

479
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,509
Where are you going?

480
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,950
Why's he running so fast?

481
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:49,769
Hey!

482
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,410
Father Kim.

483
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,180
Father Kim.

484
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,019
Come here, you jerks.

485
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:33,579
Move.

486
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,700
- You're slower than I thought.
- Don't you see this?

487
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,039
Don't you know how heavy this is?

488
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,809
You are slow.

489
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,319
Let's end it for all today, Father.

490
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:45,349
(The Fiery Priest)

491
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,319
You don't have to worry
about that priest anymore.

492
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,690
He's half dead.

493
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:50,490
What happened to your face, Father?

494
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,819
I had a fight with Hwang Cheol Bum.

495
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,119
- If you look this bad, then he...
- He's in a bad shape.

496
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,789
Bad shape, my foot.
He's totally fine.

497
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:56,930
He hit Father Kim first
from the back.

498
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,660
(The counterattack begins.)

499
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,130
Let's check on
Hwang Cheol Bum's villa first.

500
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,470
This is sort of like
a special investigation unit, right?

501
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,170
Shall we try going undercover also?

502
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,269
There's never been
a taste like this before.

503
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,769
(They use their secret weapon.)

504
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,940
Let's go. Let's go get them.
Let's go fight. Let's go!
