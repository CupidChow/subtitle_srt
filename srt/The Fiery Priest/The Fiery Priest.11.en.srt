1
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,329
Hold on.

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,710
You'll go to the fiery pit
if you hit women.

3
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,509
Are you okay?

4
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:42,679
Yes, Father.

5
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,630
Hey, stop!

6
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,299
Let's leave it.
We only need those two.

7
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,770
Brother, Sister!

8
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,400
Let's go back to Korea.

9
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:14,280
(Episode 11)

10
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,409
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,150
Hello, sir.

12
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,349
How dare you put
your hands in your pocket?

13
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,920
I'm sorry, sir.

14
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,230
Darn it. You're even chewing gum
when you're greeting me.

15
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,260
Spit it out.

16
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,359
Nothing's missing, right?

17
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,469
We've completed
this month's collection well.

18
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,670
Distribute them
and wrap them up well.

19
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,040
Don't you dare to steal them.

20
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,140
You know I don't mess with money.

21
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,049
I'm only saying this...

22
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,049
- because you did it once.
- Someone's calling you, sir.

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,549
Darn it.

24
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,519
What?

25
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,620
What? How did that happen?

26
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,859
With the priest?

27
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,530
I thought Mr. Nam had
his men under control.

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,469
How did this happen?
This is driving me crazy.

29
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, stop him right now.

30
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,639
Do what you have to and stop him.

31
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,710
Stop him no matter what!

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,280
Darn it. Darn that priest.

33
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,780
This won't do.

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,050
Hey, wrap them up well.

35
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,389
See you later, sir.

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,789
There's no trouble, right?

37
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,020
I don't have to worry, right?

38
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,289
Yes, sir!

39
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,629
I'm keeping an eye
on Father Kim...

40
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:38,199
day and night.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,860
I'm stopping every move...

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,930
he'd make in advance.

43
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,539
Great.

44
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,199
You certainly are
the ace of Gudam Police Station.

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,270
You're fit to be
the next team leader.

46
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,979
Thank you, sir!

47
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,479
I'll do my best to...

48
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,580
Hold on.

49
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,319
Hey, Mr. Hwang.

50
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,430
Doing your best, my foot!

51
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,629
You couldn't even put
a rookie under your control...

52
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:17,800
and you made me go through this?

53
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,969
Go deal with it right now!

54
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,810
How could she cause
such a big problem?

55
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,349
(Superintendent)

56
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:30,349
Hey!

57
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,250
Detective Seo, where are you?

58
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,349
I've arrested the witnesses
who made false testimonies.

59
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,120
I'm arriving in 58 minutes.

60
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,060
See you later, sir.

61
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,189
Detective Seo.

62
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,229
Today is spectacular as always.

63
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,270
Do you know where
those guys belong to?

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,069
Yes, they are from
the Russian Street.

65
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,740
I saw them once
when I went there before.

66
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,340
Excuse me. We're not culprits.
We're witnesses.

67
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,840
How can you handcuff us?

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,650
She's right.
When I get to the police station,

69
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,879
I'm going to sue you both.

70
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,379
Keep quiet, you two.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,979
Do you know how big of a crime
perjuring is?

72
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,889
What do you mean?

73
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,449
Do you have proof?

74
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,319
How would you explain
being protected by those guys...

75
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,360
while having a French dish?

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
Paying off the gambling debt
and card debt...

77
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,000
seems to be impossible now.

78
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,069
You won't be able
to get your share now.

79
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,079
Why don't you go to the restroom
if you want to poop?

80
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,079
You're bothering me.

81
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,449
Poop?

82
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm in big trouble, okay?

83
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,889
Yes.

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,350
When did he say he's coming?

85
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,990
I'll be there soon.

86
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm almost there. Okay.
See you there.

87
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:54,170
Go to the police station first.
I have to drop by at church.

88
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,170
Did something happen there?

89
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,939
No, nothing.

90
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,439
Can you stop over there?

91
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,670
Okay.

92
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,750
(Withdrawal of Management)

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,220
Gudam Orphanage
and Gudam Nursing Home.

94
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,459
This is the document to withdraw
the management by the church.

95
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,990
Please organize the ledger
and management within a month.

96
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,430
Also, please prepare for a handover.

97
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,459
Why are you doing this
all of a sudden?

98
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,600
You know the reason already.

99
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,300
What does this have to do
with what happened to Father Lee?

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,670
After the incident,
the number of people...

101
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,069
coming to church
and donation decreased a lot.

102
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,170
Even so.

103
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,209
How could you withdraw
the management unilaterally?

104
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,180
You also have to ask
the opinions of people...

105
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,480
in the facilities, let alone ours.

106
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:46,350
Your opinions are
of no great importance.

107
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,250
What if we can't accept it?

108
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,290
Then...

109
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:51,720
we'll have to force you
to hand over the business.

110
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,459
Who's going to manage them
if it can't be done by us?

111
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,100
It's undecided.

112
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,029
It'll be decided legitimately.

113
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,000
I won't ever allow this.

114
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:03,670
I can never accept this.

115
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:06,740
Then go through
administrative litigation.

116
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,379
Father, you can't tear...

117
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,550
The welfare facilities...

118
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,220
will be managed by us.

119
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,350
Then do what you want.

120
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,720
I won't be responsible
for what happens after.

121
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,470
Where are you going, Father?

122
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,480
If it's about this matter, take me
with you. My goodness.

123
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,910
It's not like I'm following
Father Kim...

124
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,379
because he's unstable.
Please stay here.

125
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,680
- Sister.
- Father Kim!

126
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,389
- Sister.
- Wait for me! Gosh.

127
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,350
Goodness.

128
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,160
We're almost there.

129
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,290
Don't even think about coming up
with a lame excuse.

130
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,660
You'll end up getting caught anyway.

131
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,259
Whatever. Just give me something
to eat when we get there.

132
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,199
- I'd like a bowl of sundae soup.
- Cut the nonsense.

133
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,250
What? It's you guys again?

134
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:23,779
Hey, it's them.

135
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,740
Over there.

136
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,790
Hey, stop right there!

137
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,549
Are you okay?

138
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,789
You should've stayed at the church.

139
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,029
No.

140
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,129
I don't know about anything else,

141
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,730
but when it comes to this,
I must hear it for myself.

142
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:51,740
Father Lee...

143
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,870
cared so much
about the welfare facilities.

144
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,269
(Head of Borough's Office)

145
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm okay. I'm fine.

146
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,049
Father.

147
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,090
Sister.

148
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:10,490
Do you even know...

149
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,460
how much Father Lee
has tarnished the reputation...

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,029
of Gudam-gu?

151
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,059
And you still want to know why
we want to cancel the consignment?

152
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,870
My goodness.

153
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,100
We're not done investigating
Father Lee's case.

154
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,769
Don't you know
that it's being reinvestigated?

155
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:26,899
I'm not a citizen of Vatican City.

156
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,309
I'm the head of Gudam Council
who follows the law of this country.

157
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,080
Ask everyone who works
at the welfare facilities.

158
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,409
I'm sure all of them would want
to continue working with the church.

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
They'll be disappointed if another
organization is put in charge.

160
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,350
You want me to trust a scandalous
religious institution...

161
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,960
with a welfare facility
that takes care of kids?

162
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,830
Do you really think
that makes any kind of sense?

163
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,429
That's out of the question.

164
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,970
What scandal? What scandal?

165
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:55,799
Did you seriously just say that?

166
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,169
The case isn't finished yet.
It's being reinvestigated.

167
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:02,970
We are people who abide
by the laws of Vatican City.

168
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,539
We're going to follow
the laws of the Vatican.

169
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,309
- Sister.
- Yes?

170
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,179
- Calm down.
- Okay.

171
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,850
Drink some tea.

172
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:16,919
Who's going to take over?
Is it Mr. Hwang of Daebum Trading?

173
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:19,190
Gosh, what kind of nonsense is this?

174
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,259
Daebum Trading isn't even
on the list of candidates.

175
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,690
Then who will be taking over?
Tell us.

176
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,700
That's confidential, and I have
no reason to reveal that to you.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,169
Then at least give us a hint.

178
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,299
Do you think this is a quiz show?
Why would you ask me for a hint?

179
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,870
If it was a quiz show,
we would've guessed already.

180
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,570
Not if the question
is really difficult.

181
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,840
You shouldn't be joking around
with a matter like this, ma'am.

182
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,379
Why would I joke around
with you and Father Kim?

183
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,350
- Then why are you being like this?
- There are already...

184
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,980
so many issues
I need to take care of.

185
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,850
Sister, we should go now.

186
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,059
No, I must listen to
everything she has to say.

187
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,730
I need to go somewhere.

188
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,929
Then go ahead. I'll be fine.

189
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,129
- Will you be okay?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

190
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll be off, then.

191
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,009
How convenient.

192
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,080
I can't believe he's just leaving...

193
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,350
after only saying
what he needed to say.

194
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:22,289
Okay, then.

195
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,720
You should also get going.

196
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,059
No.

197
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,559
Please sit down.

198
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,169
You and I have a lot left
to talk about.

199
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,429
(Warm and trustworthy police
that serve our citizens)

200
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,519
What's that?

201
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,049
Detective Seo, what's going on?

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,190
What happened?

203
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,190
Where are the witnesses?
Hey, Detective...

204
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,169
Detective Seo.

205
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,970
(Chief Prosecutor, Kang Seok Tae)

206
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,269
Gosh, so many things happened today.

207
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,879
We handled what we could,
so please wrap things up.

208
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,850
Okay, I'll take care of it.

209
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,179
Why did your subordinate
let the priest get discharged?

210
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,350
I knew something like this
would happen.

211
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,220
I should've been more careful.

213
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,899
Relax.

214
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:47,870
This time,
I'll make sure I send them...

215
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,669
to a place where
no one can find them.

216
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,909
And where is that?

217
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:56,110
Pavlovsk, Russia.

218
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,549
They're on their way
to get on a boat.

219
00:12:58,549 --> 00:12:59,679
Within an hour,

220
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,049
they'll be in the middle of the sea.

221
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,460
Didn't you also say they won't be
able to find them in France?

222
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,929
Well, that's...

223
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,429
I really don't understand
how they managed to find them there.

224
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,370
I also don't understand...

225
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,710
why I still haven't killed you yet.

226
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:31,379
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry
about what happened.

227
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Gosh.

228
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,029
Hurry up and make sure
they're well-hidden.

229
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,230
Someone will show up whether it be
the cops or the priest.

230
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,000
Priest? Father?

231
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,200
Is that priest a nuisance?

232
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,639
You can check for yourself.

233
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,639
Get lost.

234
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,340
I said, get lost!

235
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,110
Okay.

236
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,159
But how do you think
the cops found out?

237
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,159
Maybe it was the priest
that found out.

238
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,429
That's not possible.

239
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,129
There's no way a guy like him
would be able to find out.

240
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,539
Now, it's time
for some flattery again.

241
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,779
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,620
You see,

243
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,230
I despise people who are
nothing but talk.

244
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
I really don't know
what to say, sir.

245
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,269
And you're still talking...

246
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,639
even after all the mistakes
you've made.

247
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,470
It wasn't exactly Mr. Hwang's fault.

248
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,169
I think there was a problem
with the management of information.

249
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,210
He should've done a good job
of keeping things private.

250
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:07,850
How careless is he
with his information?

251
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,279
Hey.

252
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,220
Have you loosened up
and lost your sense of reality...

253
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,690
because we let you hang out
with us these days?

254
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,820
If we let you hang out with us,

255
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,889
you should make sure
you keep things in order.

256
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,399
How dare you mess things up
and cause trouble?

257
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,429
At this rate, you might even end up
causing a huge mess.

258
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,440
Am I right?

259
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,879
What's wrong? Did I upset you?

260
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,309
No, sir.

261
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,639
Are you upset?

262
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,779
No, sir.

263
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,279
Goodness, look at that punk's eyes.

264
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,360
I made a very big mistake.

265
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,399
I'll be more alert from now on.

266
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,669
Yes, I'm sure he'll be
more careful from now on.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,639
Will you please
do your job properly?

268
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,600
I can't sleep at night these days.

269
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:10,809
You don't need to keep things
nice and refined.

270
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:16,179
So remember where you came from...

271
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:19,379
and get your job done properly.
Do you understand?

272
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,330
Yes, sir.

273
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,240
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:42,409
Detective Seo,
you shouldn't be so stubborn.

275
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,139
You're taking things too far.

276
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,779
How dare they mess
with a police officer?

277
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,009
I'll bring Godzhayev and his men...

278
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,009
within an hour
and have them locked up in jail.

279
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,950
How do you know those guys
work for Godzhayev?

280
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,789
They're the ones I saw in
the Russian district the other day.

281
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,590
Are you sure?
Aren't you mistaken?

282
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,620
I'm not!

283
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,629
Strictly speaking, they're not
criminals. They're witnesses.

284
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,329
I think they took them back for
a reason. Don't you think so?

285
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,329
He's right.

286
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,730
There must be a reason
we don't know.

287
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,970
On whose side are all of you?

288
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:13,200
- Let's have a seat first.
- All right.

289
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,299
No. Fine.

290
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,069
We need to bring back
the people we lost.

291
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,240
You lost whom?

292
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:27,950
You lost whom?

293
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,990
I need to visit
the Gudam subway station team.

294
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,430
- Let's go, Detective Kim.
- Yes.

295
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,859
Why are you going there?

296
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,730
You don't have to explain at all.
Let me go with you.

297
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,000
I forgot. I have an appointment.

298
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,299
I promised Mr. Park to have
braised carp together.

299
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,400
Detective Koo need to
take care of it, then.

300
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,470
What do I need to take care of?

301
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
Summarize what happened.

302
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,009
Well, while escorting
the witnesses...

303
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,049
Not you.

304
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:58,150
Well, Father...

305
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:05,960
Why are you doing this?

306
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:07,619
Move over.

307
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,099
Are you sure you didn't intervene?

308
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,539
You heard it.

309
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,769
Detective Seo was the only one
who knew about it.

310
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,069
You called Detective Seo.

311
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,740
It was when she almost arrived
at the station.

312
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,779
You must have leaked the information
in the meantime.

313
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:28,849
Excuse me, Father.

314
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,450
My junior was escorting witnesses.

315
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,750
How can I leak the information
about it?

316
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:36,450
Do you think I'm scum?

317
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:40,460
Speaking of that,

318
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:44,859
you should cooperate with me,
shouldn't you?

319
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,000
Why do you pass me...

320
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,470
and go on an operation
with my junior.

321
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,299
We have a system
in the investigation.

322
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,099
How come you ignore me like this?

323
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,140
That's your system, not mine.

324
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,680
Please stop talking nonsense.

325
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,480
A Korean cop was
escorting witnesses...

326
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,849
and Russian gangs took
the witnesses.

327
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,720
And the police are
doing nothing about it.

328
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,549
Don't you think that's nonsense?

329
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,160
We need to listen to
what exactly happened.

330
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,099
That laugh again.

331
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:19,900
She wasn't arresting them...

332
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,849
I thought I was
ending the day peacefully.

333
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,380
Why was I holding this upside down?

334
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,190
(Warm and trustworthy police
that serve our citizens)

335
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,329
I didn't ask you as I was so busy.

336
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Didn't you get hurt?

337
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,230
No, I'm fine.

338
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,730
I'm sorry that I brought you
into trouble.

339
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,269
No, it's not trouble.

340
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,410
I always appreciate your help.

341
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,980
Father, I want to ask you something.

342
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,049
How did you find out
the information on the witnesses?

343
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,650
It was exactly correct.

344
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,750
We'll have a chance
to talk about it later.

345
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,549
Yes.

346
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,230
You shouldn't go on your own like
that. Team leader's permission...

347
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,789
I'm doing as the pope orders me.

348
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:27,400
Detective Seo.
Why are you doing this?

349
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,000
You should be reasonable.

350
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:32,799
I'm now 10 times more reasonable
than when I was taking KSAT.

351
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,609
Are you going with me or not?

352
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:43,880
Both of you can't go. You can't go.

353
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,650
Wait a minute.

354
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,750
I was going to get on.

355
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,420
Are you going without me?

356
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,880
Ms. Park.

357
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,609
You'd better use
the back door today.

358
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,779
Ms. Park.

359
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,720
You can call it a day.
I'm leaving now.

360
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,430
- She's coming.
- She's here.

361
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,430
Prosecutor.
About Kim's suicide attempt,

362
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,430
do you think you're
responsible for it?

363
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,000
A sensation about false confession
is being generated. Is that true?

364
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,539
Wasn't there a fundamental problem
in the investigation process?

365
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,440
Didn't you victimize Kim
instead of the son...

366
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,369
of Chairman Kim Joong Cheol
of Hanjoo Group?

367
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,910
Does it make him innocent...

368
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,779
when a suspect attempts suicide?

369
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,380
Is the result of the investigation
all wrong...

370
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,750
when a suspect attempts suicide?

371
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:58,589
There was much suspicion
from the beginning.

372
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,130
I didn't have such suspicion.

373
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,390
You're the ones
who had such suspicion.

374
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,599
Are you saying you don't feel
responsible at all?

375
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,700
I feel sorry, but being responsible
is a totally different thing.

376
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,269
Is that all?

377
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,569
- Prosecutor.
- Wait a minute!

378
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:17,509
- Please say a word.
- Prosecutor!

379
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,279
Welcome.

380
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,319
How come this place has
such an awkward atmosphere?

381
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,720
Which one is Godzhayev?

382
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,220
Are you Godzhayev?

383
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,859
You should pronounce it correctly.

384
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,630
It's Vladimir Godzhayev.

385
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,930
By the way, Father.

386
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,170
A Father should be in the church.
Why do you meddle in my business?

387
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,069
A Father is usually in the church...

388
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,839
but he sometimes goes out to catch
Satan like you.

389
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,079
What did you do with the witnesses
after you took them?

390
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,910
How come you talk down to someone
older than you? You're so mean.

391
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,480
Right. Godzhayev is at least
12 years older than you.

392
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,150
You shouldn't ignore people
who are older than you.

393
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,359
He's not just someone older than me
as you say.

394
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,160
He's just a Russian gang!

395
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,230
Wait a minute.

396
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,059
You were holding the soju bottle
the other day.

397
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,799
You come here.

398
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,299
That jerk.

399
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,140
Stop it!

400
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,609
I told you to be a nice guy!

401
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,210
We're not guilty.

402
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,609
They requested
their personal protection to us.

403
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,849
Who are you to receive
personal protection request?

404
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,150
Do you run a security company
or what?

405
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,690
We do everything
as long as we're paid.

406
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,920
Where did you hide the witnesses?

407
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,200
Witnesses?

408
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,259
What witnesses?

409
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,940
You sent them by a boat,
as you always do.

410
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:38,380
A boat? I didn't send them
by a boat.

411
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,920
They're already moving
on the sea, aren't they?

412
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:53,599
Stop looking at me.

413
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,269
Sea?

414
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,339
You really have the wrong idea.

415
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,539
Gosh, really.

416
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,009
It's the sea.

417
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,410
Shall I search for them
at the nearby ports?

418
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,940
Gosh, that stupid punk.

419
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,910
Where are you taking me?

420
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,009
Just get in!

421
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:43,210
This isn't what I expected!

422
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,490
Do you have any idea, Father?

423
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,390
The Russian stowing away gang
is hard to catch.

424
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:56,029
It takes a lot of time too.

425
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,130
We need to give it up first.

426
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:00,500
He's right.

427
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,599
You need to stake out
for several weeks...

428
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,829
to barely catch
Russian stowing away gangs.

429
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,640
How come you know such things,
Father?

430
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,140
I can know that.
It's not a national secret.

431
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,009
By the way, Detective Seo.

432
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,309
I've been curious about this
from a while ago.

433
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,579
How did you find out where
those witnesses are?

434
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,890
I got it from my source.

435
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,690
Your source? What source?

436
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,960
I shouldn't tell you.
It's my secret agent.

437
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,759
It's strange.

438
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,859
She doesn't have much experience.

439
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,099
Please drop me off over there.

440
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll take you to the church.

441
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,069
No, I can go by myself.
Stop the car.

442
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,349
- See you, Father.
- Goodbye.

443
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:50,779
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you for your work.

444
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,250
I did some work too.
What about me?

445
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:00,019
Today was another long day.

446
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,130
Darn it!

447
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,339
Darn it, it keeps dropping.

448
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,410
My gosh.

449
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:28,650
Gosh, why does it keep dropping?

450
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,319
You're good at catching people,
but not this.

451
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,660
Oh, let me correct myself. You're
good at catching innocent people.

452
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,829
Why are you picking a fight
in the quiet street?

453
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,930
I'm not picking a fight.

454
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm talking about the victim
who tried to commit suicide.

455
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's not talk about that.

456
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,769
People think chances are
given by people only.

457
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,809
And they'd die for such chances.

458
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,579
You may become rich through
the chances given by people,

459
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,150
but your spirit
will never be filled.

460
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:01,319
The only way to live
like a human being...

461
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,150
is to grab the chance given by God.

462
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,819
You keep missing...

463
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,319
that chance.

464
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,529
Or are you missing it on purpose?

465
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,660
Why don't you grab it
if you're not high and dry?

466
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,930
That's awesome!

467
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,680
Yesterday, you were a drunkard, but
now you're speaking like a priest.

468
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,480
I don't recall yesterday.

469
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,519
Don't go talking about my flaws,
and just take care of yourself.

470
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,390
Why can't you listen
when I speak nicely?

471
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,960
You want me to listen to you?
I can't because I can't hear you.

472
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:43,859
Didn't God give you the chance...

473
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,200
to live normally
without getting angry?

474
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,309
You can lecture me after
grabbing that chance yourself.

475
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,579
Thank you for the lecture at night.

476
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:04,509
I'll give you this
instead of the offertory.

477
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,650
Bye.
