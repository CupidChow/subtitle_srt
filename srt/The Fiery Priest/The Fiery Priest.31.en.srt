00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,410
(Episode 31)

2
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,120
This is the document...

3
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,750
you've all been looking for.

4
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,859
The one who wins three rounds first
is the final winner.

5
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,359
Oh, right.

6
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,629
What will you give me
if you lose, 10-Tailed Fox?

7
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,200
Well, you're right that
we have to bet something too.

8
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,370
I'll bet my wrist, happy?

9
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,469
You can't do that. You have to pray.

10
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,209
What would I
do with your wrist, Father?

11
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,280
It seems like you want
something specific.

12
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,049
If I win,

13
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,120
I want you to work for me
and quit being a nun.

14
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,549
Hey, you're talking nonsense.

15
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,590
Let's do that.

16
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,030
All right. Let's begin.

17
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,430
Let's play.

18
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,240
Here we go.

19
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,740
Here, here.

20
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,009
Good luck, everyone.

21
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,580
Stop right there, Brother.

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,009
Are you trying to trick us?

23
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:23,949
What are you saying?

24
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:28,120
Do I look like a total
pushover to you, Brother?

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,090
Why are you falsely accusing me?

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,020
You're making me play
with three-pair cards,

27
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,789
and you're giving him
five-pair cards.

28
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,400
And you? Are you going to play
with six-pair cards?

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,699
You even got rid of the peony card.

30
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,400
Hey, Horse Head. Go and check
if it really is the peony card.

31
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:50,009
What's this?

32
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,219
What are you trying to do?
Follow me.

33
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,650
Why are you guys so rough?

34
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,919
It was just a practice game! Let go!

35
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,520
I said, let go!

36
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,759
You still got sharp eyes.

37
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,199
Shall we begin the actual game?

38
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:50,770
I'm done for.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,469
What? That was unexpected.

40
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,009
It's 1 to 0.

41
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,310
It's one of her plans, right?

42
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:57,740
I hope so.

43
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,460
I'm done for.

44
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,600
Come on! What are you doing?

45
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,300
Are you determined
to lose or something?

46
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
My gosh.

47
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,300
It's 2 to 0.

48
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
- She's losing.
- She'll be fine.

49
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,870
- There'e one more round left.
- Let's pray.

50
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,939
This is driving me crazy.

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,410
What?

52
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,120
If you lose one more round,
it's over.

53
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,220
What will you do
if I win three rounds in a row?

54
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,689
Three rounds in a row?

55
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,860
You're trying to play a game
within the game?

56
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,259
Tell me what you want.

57
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,600
If I win three times in a row,

58
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,470
you'll have to hand over
the thumb drive...

59
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,139
and get hit by him three times.

60
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,939
Three times.

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,879
What?

62
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,810
Sure, I'll take that.

63
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,620
Then...

64
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,120
you should deal the cards.

65
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,410
Let's end this.

66
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,209
It's seven-pair cards.

67
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,120
Nine-pair cards.

68
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,620
Yes!

69
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,639
Seven-pair cards.

70
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,569
Two-pair cards.

71
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,480
- Goodness.
- It's going great.

72
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,319
It's embarrassing,
but I want to pee.

73
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,389
That is embarrassing. Keep that in.

74
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:24,990
- All right.
- It might ruin the game.

75
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,100
Why are you doing this to me?

76
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,339
My heart trusts you, Ms. Park.

77
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,939
But my brain doesn't.

78
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,180
But I'll follow what my
heart tells me to do.

79
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,209
I'll trust you.

80
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,750
But...

81
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,819
if you disappoint me again,

82
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,490
that gun will be fired for real.

83
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,519
Got it?

84
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,930
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,060
Let's not make it inconvenient.

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,069
All right. Let's make this clear.

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,569
All of us make a team.

88
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,009
It's just one team, okay?

89
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,110
Of course Mr. Lee and Ms. Park...

90
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,149
will be our strongest weapon.

91
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,850
And Congressman Park's shares...

92
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,379
will be divided to Mr. Hwang,
Mr. Lee, and Ms. Park.

93
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,189
I hope this is can make us...

94
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,060
trust each other until the end.

95
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,689
Don't you agree, Mr. Hwang?

96
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
This is our final round.

97
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,670
Deal the cards.

98
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,839
You want me to deal them again?

99
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,579
Do you really want?

100
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Okay, then.

101
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,319
1, 2, 3...

102
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,889
Five...

103
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,120
Four...

104
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:08,490
Wait.

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
This is our last round.

106
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:16,930
So how about I do a pile shuffle
just to be safe?

107
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,500
Sure.

108
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,240
What's a pile shuffle?

109
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,040
I'm not quite sure.

110
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,740
This is too nerve-racking.
I don't think I can watch.

111
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,679
(10-pair)

112
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,820
That pile shuffle
won't get you anywhere.

113
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
(10-pair)

114
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,500
Go ahead and show us.

115
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,330
"Open for me the gates
of the righteous."

116
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,639
"I will enter and give thanks
to the Lord."

117
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,289
I have the royal pair.

118
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,860
I won.

119
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,899
- Nice!
- Yes!

120
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,399
What's this?

121
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,110
You didn't do anything.

122
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,679
Yes, that's right.
I didn't do anything.

123
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,090
Okay, then.
I'll go ahead and take this finger.

124
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,419
I can't let you do that.

125
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:42,450
Why do you guys play so dirty?

126
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,590
Oh Kwang Du
and Horse Head of Daegwallyeong.

127
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,659
You're both under arrest
for murder,

128
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:55,929
illegal gambling, blackmailing,
and a list of other crimes.

129
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:57,360
- Arrest them.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,409
- Mr. Lee, wait.
- Yes?

131
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,279
He promised me one more thing...

132
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,950
other than this.

133
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,600
Gosh, it must've hurt so much.
My goodness.

134
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,500
He promised to take three hits.

135
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,970
But he fainted after two.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,470
We'll save the last one
for next time.

137
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,179
You can go first.

138
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,259
A punishment will naturally be
waiting for you.

139
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,730
Instead,

140
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,000
you will get punished if you lose.

141
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,169
So please win.

142
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,419
By the way,
about what you did earlier...

143
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,259
I'm not trying to gamble,
but I'm just so curious.

144
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:35,559
How did you do it?

145
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,529
Gosh, I didn't do anything.

146
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,169
It was just the Lord's will.

147
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:42,799
You liar!

148
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,539
You can't just say
it was the Lord's will.

149
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,970
Come on. Tell us.

150
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,769
I'd also like to know.

151
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,779
There really aren't any tricks.

152
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,950
Goodness, why is there
a ball of dust on your back?

153
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,220
Gosh, it's just something
that happens naturally.

154
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,090
Unbelievable.

155
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,889
Oh, my... I shouldn't call out
the Lord's name in vain.

156
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,360
I'll go bring some fruits.

157
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,299
- Can we have a lot of oranges?
- Sure.

158
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,230
I think this is how you do it.

159
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,769
Yes, she did this. Then she
took it out from the back of my ear.

160
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,309
Sister Kim, is this how you do it?

161
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,110
Do you hide it on your palm?

162
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,909
And then do you spin it?

163
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,940
This is quite hard, so you just...

164
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,019
Thank you, Father Kim.

165
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,690
Thanks to you, I was able to lift
a huge burden.

166
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,659
- Today, you were...
- So this is how you hide it.

167
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,029
like Father Lee Young Jun to me.

168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,370
I got a call
from the gambling house.

169
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,200
Did the nun win?

170
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,009
Yes. Also, the cops suddenly
showed up and arrested...

171
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,240
the entire gambling syndicate.

172
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,639
That's good.

173
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,049
Did you take care of everything
regarding Rising Moon?

174
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,450
Yes, we made sure we could
drop out whenever we wanted to.

175
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,720
So it wasn't hard
to get rid of everything.

176
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,620
Goodbye, Superintendent Nam Seok Gu.

177
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,830
It was so flabbergasting.

178
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,730
He put his gun to my head,
and it made me feel so angry.

179
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,870
Gosh, I'm so furious.

180
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,600
That's normally how you feel when
someone points a gun to your head.

181
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,669
Exactly.

182
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,570
Has the chief prosecutor
learned nothing?

183
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:31,080
There's a reason why I got angry and
tried to put Kim Keon Yong in jail.

184
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,909
It was because he tried to kill me.

185
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,279
Is that what you've been
trying to do?

186
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,149
You've been trying
to get into their group?

187
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,879
Yes.

188
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,190
I guess you could put it that way.

189
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,620
See?

190
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,690
How nice is it to alter the use
of your talent?

191
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,690
You're amazing!

192
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,830
By the way, are you not arresting
Kim Keon Yong on purpose?

193
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,730
Yes. I have proof regarding
his instigation on murder,

194
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,299
so I can have him behind bars
whenever I want to.

195
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,470
Gosh, that's incredible.
I just got goosebumps.

196
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,870
Then where did you get
the recording file?

197
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,279
It's from the hard drive that
we confiscated from Rising Moon.

198
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,009
Detective Seo and I made sure
to keep a backup drive.

199
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:09,379
Detective Seo didn't even
tell me about that.

200
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,220
I guess you guys
get along quite well.

201
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,179
I have to say,
she's quite impressive.

202
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,889
She's young, but she's a real cop.

203
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,919
By the way,
how much is in that vault?

204
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you saying you can't find
the accounting files on Rising Moon?

205
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,399
No, those gamblers are known
for being wanderers.

206
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,440
So we can't find them
once they're gone.

207
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,870
Does that mean someone else
might have those files?

208
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,970
Yes.

209
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,480
So I think you guys should prepare
for what might happen.

210
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,879
Didn't we send Superintendent Nam's
shares of Rising Moon...

211
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,279
to a borrowed-name bank account?

212
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,120
Yes, that's right.
But it can be traced down.

213
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,490
That's why he gave it to us
in the first place.

214
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,429
I need to have pork belly to get rid
of all the dust in my throat.

215
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,029
Hey.

216
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,269
Why is it so hard
to see you these days?

217
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,039
I'm really busy.

218
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,840
Why do you look so scruffy?

219
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:13,710
You're covered in dirt,
and you're holding a shovel.

220
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,009
I went to the mountain
to plant a tree,

221
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,450
and I ended up rolling down.

222
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,090
He's crazy.

223
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,190
Did... Did you say
150,000,000 million dollars?

224
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:33,929
And among that,
my share is 12,500,000 dollars.

225
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,840
Prosecutor Park,
you should just stay there.

226
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,070
And you should offer
2,500,000 dollars to the church.

227
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,409
Gosh, what are you talking about?

228
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:49,710
I mean, that's a lot of money.

229
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,879
No wonder those jerks
needed a foundation.

230
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,720
Oh, I almost forgot.

231
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,259
Here.

232
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,090
Gosh, that's disgusting.
What is that?

233
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,500
It's Rising Moon's accounting files.

234
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,970
You should pick someone trustworthy
and get the job done.

235
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,829
What do you mean
by "someone trustworthy"?

236
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,900
Someone who is just,

237
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,000
doesn't listen to their superiors,
is obstinate,

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,170
and doesn't get swayed.

239
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,039
Am I not that person?

240
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,910
Gosh, you can't do it yourself.
You need to protect the vault.

241
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,549
Oh, I see.

242
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,250
I thought maybe you were
having doubts about me.

243
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,750
Well, I can't entirely deny that.

244
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,690
Gosh, forget it.
You can take care of it yourself.

245
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:36,859
Why are you suddenly so sullen?
Hurry up and take it.

246
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,529
I had to fight with that huge sword
and go through so much.

247
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,230
But I guess that was
all for nothing.

248
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,869
What are you talking about?

249
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,240
I'll steam some dumplings for you.

250
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,380
The national gambling organization
Daegal faction...

251
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,980
committed 4 murders,
3 attempted murders,

252
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,650
threats, extortions, and kidnapping.

253
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,349
As it is
the worst gambling organization,

254
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,390
the gang has been running away from
the police for the last three years.

255
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,829
However, with information
and patience,

256
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,730
my team rounded them up...

257
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,170
and took them into custody
for questioning.

258
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:19,240
The Violent Crimes squad
in Gudam Police Station...

259
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,940
What's that punk doing?

260
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,240
What is he to do that...

261
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:29,849
We're from the finance
investigation team.

262
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,380
Nam Seok Gu.

263
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,150
You're arrested on charges of
violating real-name...

264
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,750
financial system,
tax evasion, and false accounting.

265
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,220
Arrest him.

266
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,289
What?

267
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,089
What are you doing?

268
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,670
I'll be back!

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,470
No, you jerks!

270
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,069
What are you doing?

271
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:02,210
Everyone, come here.

272
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,049
Seung Ah, you too.

273
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,390
Arresting Superintendent Nam
is not the end.

274
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,160
We're at the tip
of the deep-rooted evils.

275
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,859
We all should leave the office
and get punished.

276
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,259
We've never worked properly
when we were paid.

277
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,230
So I'm telling you.

278
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:25,869
I'll leave the office
and get punished in your place.

279
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,799
Come on. Why do you want to
do that alone?

280
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,039
As I don't have a family,
I'll get punished.

281
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,079
I was paid more than anyone here.

282
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,480
I needed money
for my child's surgery.

283
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,910
I'll quit the job.

284
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,420
I was always sparing of myself
and sitting in the office.

285
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,779
I'll sacrifice myself this time.

286
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,990
- Mr. Lee.
- No more comments.

287
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,549
Let me keep cool as a team leader.

288
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,289
I'll take all the responsibility.

289
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,660
But after I take care of everything
in Gudam-gu,

290
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,960
I'll quit the job.

291
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,400
Do you understand?

292
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,329
Do you?

293
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,069
My Lord,

294
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,940
I could wake up those
who are sleeping,

295
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,740
but I couldn't wake up those
who are pretending to sleep.

296
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,279
Waking up those who keep their eyes
closed when they know...

297
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,250
the situation was so hard.

298
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,349
However, now...

299
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,759
they, on their own,

300
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,460
begin to open their eyes.

301
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,170
They won't pretend to sleep anymore.

302
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,349
- Hi, Kyeong Seon.
- Hi.

303
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,150
Hi?

304
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,119
Is he crazy?

305
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,319
I should have slapped him
before I came in.

306
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,529
- Whom are you talking about?
- It's Prosecutor Nam.

307
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,930
He saw me on the hallway
and said, "Hi".

308
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,529
I thought he was an overseas Korean.

309
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,230
Has he gone crazy
as the spring came?

310
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,970
- You know what?
- I don't know.

311
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:08,009
It's an open secret.

312
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:11,109
I heard that Prosecutor Nam gets
support from a constructor.

313
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,910
Support?

314
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,349
He's a scum.

315
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:17,750
Is that why he's all smiling?

316
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,779
But the constructor is suspicious
in many respects.

317
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,019
He's smelly like a skunk.

318
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,920
But Prosecutor Nam is happy.
He changed his car...

319
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,259
and moved to a bigger place and all.

320
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:31,029
Gosh, he's so shameless.

321
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,000
There's no way...

322
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,869
to get Superintendent Nam out.

323
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,170
If Director Lee Seo Gyoon
is in charge of the case, it's over.

324
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,410
Can we clean up the borrowed-name
bank account related to him?

325
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:46,910
If we take care of it, we can erase
the records, I guess.

326
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,380
But the cost is what matters.

327
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,980
Erase the record,
whatever it costs.

328
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,349
Cut all the relations between
Superintendent Nam and me.

329
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:57,789
What shall I do with the Chief of
Borough's borrowed name stuff?

330
00:21:58,259 --> 00:21:59,359
I forgot.

331
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,390
Just leave it as it is.

332
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,269
You're off early today.

333
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,910
- You're that priest, right?
- Yes, I am.

334
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,380
You're the expert of making
connections, Kang Seok Tae, right?

335
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,019
You jerk.

336
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,990
Shut up and listen to me carefully.

337
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,529
You're next.

338
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,460
What are you going to do about me?

339
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,829
You're taking things easy.

340
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,630
Squeezing guys like you
is the easiest thing for me.

341
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,240
The Lord gave me that talent to me,
not the talent to forgive.

342
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,910
All right.

343
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,180
You'd better kill me here if you
want to live when you get out.

344
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,779
If you don't kill me here,
you'll get killed.

345
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:56,950
Are you acting out
because you have Lee Joong Kwon?

346
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,720
He had some beatings from me
a long time ago.

347
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,549
And one more thing.

348
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,119
Death of Father Lee Young Jun.

349
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,759
I can kill you right here,
right now.

350
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,130
But I will make you pay
for what you did.

351
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,299
We're almost there.

352
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,680
150 million...

353
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,150
150 million dollars?

354
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,460
Gosh. I can't even imagine.

355
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,190
Let's say your monthly salary
is 2,000 dollars.

356
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,829
It's even less than 2,000 dollars.

357
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,559
Let's say it's 2,000 dollars.

358
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,700
You need to save it for 6,250 years.

359
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,809
That's ridiculous.

360
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,009
We'll die, turn into dust
and petroleum,

361
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,509
and go into someone else's gas tank.

362
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,880
By then, people wouldn't use a car.

363
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
There would be a new form
of mass transportation.

364
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,480
There would be alternative energy.

365
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,789
May I say something now?

366
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:09,789
Sure.

367
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,920
I've given a lot of thought.

368
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,529
The money inside the safe.

369
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,390
Let's steal it.

370
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:18,930
What? Are you going to steal it?

371
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:23,869
Keep quiet.

372
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,470
I can steal a gourd bottle,

373
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,539
but I can't steal
150 million dollars.

374
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:33,109
With that money gone,
the Gudam Cartel...

375
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,009
is totally done. It will collapse.

376
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,109
Even though it's black money,

377
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,579
we can't steal it.

378
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,220
We can put it back to where it was.

379
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,650
We might return it
to the government.

380
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,420
No, let's not return it
to the government.

381
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,789
They're all the same, so let's put
it back to where it was.

382
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,160
As Detective Seo said,
it's too much for us.

383
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,529
Do you think so?

384
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,500
All right, then.
I was planning something.

385
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,829
Two of you can stay out of it.

386
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,740
I'll look for someone else.

387
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,440
You can take a break.

388
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,539
Go ahead.

389
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,339
All right.

390
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,750
Father. I didn't mean that
I'm not going to do it.

391
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,210
What are you going to do
without me?

392
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,450
Let me finish my meal first.

393
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,519
I think they put some drugs
into their jjajangmyeon.

394
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,059
I don't want to come,
but it attracts my tongue.

395
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,160
I'm back.

396
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,839
Song Sac, bring me
the pickled radish.

397
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,039
You can bring it yourself.
I'm busy now.

398
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,819
I can't stand it anymore.

399
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,460
You must be very busy.

400
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,029
Where's the pickled radish?

401
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:59,000
- Shall I go over there?
- Wait.

402
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,970
I have a homework for you.

403
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,569
What homework?

404
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,599
Memorize it until you come here
next time.

405
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,740
Listen to it carefully.
I won't say it twice.

406
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,640
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

407
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,710
Say it.

408
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,049
What does that mean?

409
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,880
It's "Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers" in Thai, you jerk.

410
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,150
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

411
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,430
Well, Peter Piper picked...

412
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,529
Wrong.

413
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,559
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

414
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,900
Peter Piper picked a peck...

415
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Wrong.

416
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:43,069
Do it again. Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

417
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,109
- Peter Piper picked...
- Wrong.

418
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,250
Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled peppers.

419
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,480
Peter Piper picked... Wrong.

420
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,779
Peter Piper picked... Again.

421
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,519
Peter Piper picked a peck...

422
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,589
You just should get beaten.
Come here.

423
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,559
Right. You can give it
to the media now.

424
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,059
Okay.

425
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,529
Next news.

426
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,240
An anonymous netizen disclosed
a writing and photos...

427
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,210
that heat up the Internet.

428
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,470
It astonishes Catholics
all over the country...

429
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,480
as well as nonbelievers.

430
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,049
On the national petition board
on the Blue House website,

431
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,650
criticism on a Catholic priest
is uploaded...

432
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,750
and becoming a controversy.

433
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,289
The believer insisted that
the controversial priest...

434
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:33,660
executed operations
as a special forces agent of...

435
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:37,059
the National Intelligence Service
and massacred civilian children.

436
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,960
After that, he disguised himself
as a priest...

437
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,130
and leads a peaceful life.

438
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,299
After inquiring about it
to archdiocese,

439
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:44,730
it is said that
he was told to inquire it...

440
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,369
to the monastery and Yeosu parish
that ordained the priest.

441
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:49,769
According to the petition,

442
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,009
the controversial priest turned out
to be an intelligence agent...

443
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:55,450
who was active in countries like
Syria, Pakistan, and Wirkistan...

444
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,480
in the 2000s.

445
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,279
He was referred to as a merciless
killer among his colleagues as well.

446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,750
During the Wirkistan Operation
in 2007,

447
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,349
he threw a grenade...

448
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,619
inside a building where there were
dozens of children...

449
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,730
and killed them all,
saying it was a mission...

450
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,730
to sweep up the enemies.

451
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,730
It's becoming more controversial as
pictures related to the mission...

452
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,230
are getting revealed.

453
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,700
Those who participated
in the mass that he led...

454
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,970
and believers who listened
to his sermons...

455
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,710
are complaining to the diocese
of the district...

456
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:27,910
My gosh.

457
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,349
His life is like a tsunami
just like his name.

458
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,190
Why are we here?

459
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:40,759
We're here to sacrifice
our fighting spirit.

460
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,490
We have to kick out the fake
priest out of Gudam-gu.

461
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,859
We have to get rid
of the fake church.

462
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,000
The group of people here
are the true forms of evil.

463
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,700
They're a group of
evil people, everyone!

464
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,940
- Ukha!
- Ukha!

465
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,109
Ukha!

466
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,079
- Ukha!
- Ukha!

467
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,809
- Ukha!
- Ukha!

468
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,509
- Ukha!
- There they are.

469
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:05,849
There's the fake priest
who killed 11 children.

470
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,319
(Murderer priest should leave
the earth. We'll never stop.)

471
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,349
What are you all doing here?

472
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,890
Get rid of those!

473
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,420
How dare you shout at us?

474
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,160
You group of evil people!

475
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,430
You killed the innocent children,

476
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:22,799
and yet,
you deceived us and became a priest?

477
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,630
Who killed the children?

478
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,200
It happened inevitably while he was
trying to protect our country!

479
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,039
She's right. And he didn't
deceive anyone.

480
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,839
Father Kim
has never deceived anyone!

481
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,180
Protect our country?

482
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,079
You are just a murderer.

483
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:39,680
You are the type of evil
who kills people for fun!

484
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,049
Father Kim, tell them clearly
that you didn't do that.

485
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,589
See? He can't say anything.

486
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:53,230
He's a fake priest, everyone!

487
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,700
You Satan, how dare you
run your mouth like that?

488
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,210
- Why did you kill those kids?
- Get out of here!

489
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,609
- Leave this town!
- Go!

490
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,380
- You're evil!
- You deserve to die!

491
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,980
- You're a murderer!
- You're not even a human.

492
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,650
Stop this!
