1
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,740
Father Kim.

2
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:07,309
Yes.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,650
Today,

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,219
you don't have to lean on the Lord.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,629
There are many people
around you whom you can lean on.

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,199
I might be small,
but you can lean on me also.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,929
I don't want to share...

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,170
the heaviness of my pain.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,109
Pain can make you cry,

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,380
but it can also give you a new path.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,420
A few days ago,

12
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,119
you made my pain...

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,920
into a new path.

14
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,630
You even walked on the path with me.

15
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,329
But on my path,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,099
there are still many children.

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,069
Those children...

18
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,109
must've already forgiven you
in the sky.

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,620
Even so,

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,349
that doesn't change the fact
that I killed them.

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,060
Why don't you believe in
another fact that doesn't change...

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,400
instead of that one?

23
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,469
You lose your temper easily,

24
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:40,569
but you're warmer than anyone else.

25
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,709
You like fried eggs
with burnt edges,

26
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:47,579
really hot dumplings, and oranges.

27
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,120
You like sitting on a kimchi fridge
like a cat.

28
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:56,450
You also take everyone else's pain.

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,819
You always stand by the weak...

30
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,930
and do all you can to
redress an injustice.

31
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,969
You're Gudam Church's
handsome and righteous...

32
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,840
captain.

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,770
That's a fact that doesn't change.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,580
You might suffer from the pain,

35
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:29,889
but you don't have to...

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,219
keep removing the scab,

37
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,259
cut it out,

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,560
or be in pain because of it.

39
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,800
From now on, at least.

40
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,789
It's okay.

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,960
We'll tell you the decision...

42
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,629
we've made after
piecing everything together.

43
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,659
We order Father Kim Hae Il
to go on an overseas mission...

44
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,599
to Argentina for two years.

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,500
Pardon?

46
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,810
Didn't I tell you this
when you became a priest?

47
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,939
I told you to be careful
all the time.

48
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,750
But I still have work to do
in Gudam-gu.

49
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,419
And I'm reinvestigating
Father Lee's case...

50
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,520
upon the order from the Pope.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,180
That's over for you also.

52
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,289
Over?

53
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,889
I have to find out the truth
through reinvestigation.

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,259
Please reconsider.

55
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't forget the vow you made
on your fate.

56
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,460
The honor of our order...

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,870
is at stake.

58
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,800
I hope you'll follow my order.

59
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,180
Well, is it impossible for him
to take his words back?

60
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,250
It's the decision made
by the heads of church.

61
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,120
So we must follow it.

62
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,189
How can we just let him leave?

63
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,689
You always part
when you meet someone.

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,930
But I don't think...

65
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,069
this is right.

66
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,660
How did you know I was here?

67
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,360
There are only few places
where we can drink in this town.

68
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:01,939
I heard you were told to leave.

69
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,740
Do you feel better now that...

70
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:08,610
I'm leaving?

71
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,180
Yes. I feel just great.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,319
So utterly great.

73
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,360
You know,

74
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:22,930
I grew up in a wrecked family.

75
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,230
My dad had nothing,

76
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,970
but he vouched for others
and got conned.

77
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,240
I really grit my teeth to study.

78
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,939
To succeed.

79
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,149
I don't care about others.

80
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,550
My success is what counts.

81
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,889
Who cares about others?

82
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
But...

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,899
then I started to think that...

84
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,600
my past ruined my future.

85
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,439
I'd never
thought about it like that,

86
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,110
but you showed up...

87
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,750
and got in my mind.

88
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,790
Anyway,

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,959
what I want to say here is,

90
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,459
your past...

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,029
hasn't ruined your future.

92
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,600
You could've become a mess like me.

93
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,769
But you had real courage...

94
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,779
and lived and acted so well.

95
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,480
So wherever you go,

96
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,350
live in peace.

97
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:00,560
Don't live with the guilt
like a fool.

98
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,759
Stand up straight.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,029
If we both live decent lives,

100
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,100
won't we meet again one day?

101
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,750
Thanks.

102
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,779
Thank you too.

103
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,959
(Chief of Borough Jeong Dong Ja)

104
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,170
What do you want?

105
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:43,569
We're from RIU's Financial Crimes.

106
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,540
Ms. Jeong.

107
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,740
For breaking the Real-name
Transactions Act,

108
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,209
accounting fraud,
and accumulation...

109
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,139
of a slush fund,
you're under arrest.

110
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:57,819
I'm sure
Chief Prosecutor Kang did this.

111
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,850
He didn't cover for her
to get rid of her.

112
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,990
It looks like...

113
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,329
he wants Superintendent Nam
and Ms. Jeong to take the fall.

114
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,230
So they won't take down
anyone higher up.

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,529
The congressman, superintendent,
and Ms. Jeong's gone.

116
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,569
We're taking
the chief prosecutor to war.

117
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,399
Let's get ready.

118
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,670
Yes, sir.

119
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,320
Sir. Father Kim's
going to Argentina.

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,990
From what I heard,
his superiors are sending him off.

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,289
Oh, dear. So this is how it ends.

122
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,799
He'd grown on me.

123
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,529
You're a real strategist.

124
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,799
How did you come up with that idea?

125
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,970
That mission is his weakness,
his Achilles' heel.

126
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,480
So everyone's gone
but Hwang Cheol Bum?

127
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,779
Yes.

128
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,509
Won't the dog fight to the very end?

129
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,379
He's still just a dog.

130
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,450
Placate it with some meat
then kill it.

131
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,789
It's so stuffy. I need fresh air.

132
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,299
What pretty colors.

133
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,370
What should I do?

134
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,840
My head aches.

135
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,250
That's it. The headbutt.

136
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,879
That.

137
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,259
That's it. That'll work.

138
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,460
(Departures)

139
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
(Travel ban)

140
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,639
Mr. Kim, you're forbidden to travel.

141
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,539
- What?
- Can you check again?

142
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,509
He's banned.

143
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,919
Gate One, please pick up
passenger with travel ban.

144
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,889
We will take it from here.

145
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,230
We're from Gudam Station's
Violent Crimes.

146
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,200
We'll take the suspect.

147
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,139
What's going on?

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,950
Saving Father Kim.

149
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:43,610
- What are you talking about?
- Why did you take that out?

150
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,320
It's embarrassing
with the handcuffs.

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,279
- Can you take them off?
- No, we go like this.

152
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,549
- Detective Seo.
- No.

153
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,490
Just wait until they come off.

154
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,960
Okay, well done.

155
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,230
Mission cleared.

156
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,370
Saving Father Kim.

157
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,799
Saving the Father.

158
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,710
The atrocities he committed
at your station or to you.

159
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,480
Write them all down
and apply for a warrant.

160
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,250
Start writing.

161
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,879
Write down all
you can think of. Everything.

162
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:23,220
Breaking the water cooler
and life-size cutout.

163
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,159
Threatening an officer
with a sharp bone.

164
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,059
Assaulting an officer.

165
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,799
Slamming sharp front teeth
into prosecutor's forehead.

166
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,500
Bl-blood?

167
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,870
Assaulting a prosecutor.

168
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,710
Why on earth?

169
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,840
Why did you put
a travel ban on Father Kim?

170
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,649
Why, when you have
absolutely nothing to do with him?

171
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,649
You'd better do as I say.

172
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,289
If you don't, I'll tell the press
about you and your sponsor.

173
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,330
They'll crack you open
like a chestnut in fall.

174
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,759
That priest assaulted
police officers...

175
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,470
and injured Ms. Park
on the forehead.

176
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,970
So what? What does that
have to do with you?

177
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,440
Well...

178
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:16,870
Park Kyeong Seon is...

179
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,279
the love of my life.

180
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
What?

181
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,320
How could he do that
to her lovely forehead?

182
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,350
Why you...

183
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,019
What a moron.

184
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,259
Whatever he says,
you'd better not give in.

185
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,259
Until the end.

186
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,299
Fall in love in your own time.

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Cancel the travel ban.

188
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,730
I can't.

189
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,639
I will see to it that
the priest gets punished.

190
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
I apologize.

191
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,740
Hey. Hey!

192
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,980
That psycho. What the...

193
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,080
Has everyone lost their minds?

194
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,590
Yes. Let's just end it.

195
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,389
The thing is,
their pay's quite high.

196
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,529
Okay, I'll call them.

197
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,259
Bye.

198
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,570
Poor you, Hae Il.

199
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,840
You're done for.

200
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,870
Cheers.

201
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,009
Can we break into
Mr. Hwang's safe now?

202
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,980
Break into a safe?

203
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,690
You'll do what?

204
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,990
You never told me that.

205
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,789
Detective Seo?

206
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:47,330
He said he's working on a plan,

207
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,970
and I said I'd join in.

208
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:52,200
Detective Seo. It looks like
he duped us again.

209
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,169
He always does this!

210
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,769
Why are you always
all over the place?

211
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,240
You're driving me crazy.

212
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,639
I'm not saying
we'll break into a safe.

213
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,450
It's the last and only way
to break the cartel.

214
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:05,750
Then is this...

215
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,750
part of bringing
the Lord's justice to earth?

216
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,889
That's it.

217
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,490
Then I'm in.

218
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,389
I don't know how much is inside,

219
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,889
but I could win it all.

220
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,629
Let's not do that anymore.

221
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:19,830
Shall we then?

222
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,500
I'm in.

223
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,940
Flap, flap. Flap, flap.
We always get duped.

224
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,070
We're definitely in.

225
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,610
This is insane. I shouldn't have
brought you back.

226
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,610
Then let's break into this safe!

227
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,080
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

228
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,980
Bottom's up.

229
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,080
I hate this feeling.

230
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,629
How deep did you get?

231
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,129
It's so hard.

232
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:55,169
I don't see the end of the tunnel.
The safe is so far off.

233
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,429
No, the calculations say
you're just a few meters away.

234
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,970
I had it measured.

235
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,639
Can't we just
kill them all and take it?

236
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,840
We're doing this
because that's not so easy.

237
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,940
Dig a bit more.

238
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,679
Godzhayev. You can do this. You can.

239
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,350
I hate the taste of soil.

240
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,570
Thanks for making the trip.

241
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Today,

242
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:55,279
we'll end it at that, sir.

243
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,329
Let's meet up.

244
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,569
I said I don't want to
see you again.

245
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,140
Get over here!

246
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,440
If you want to see me that badly.

247
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,380
Hey. What is it?

248
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,950
I have something urgent to say.

249
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,720
Could you come to the office?

250
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,890
- Is it important?
- Yes.

251
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,750
It's very important.

252
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,960
Sister.

253
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,660
Hello. Where are you off to?

254
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,170
- To a team dinner.
- I see.

255
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,299
Did you buy groceries?

256
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,900
I almost forgot.

257
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,039
It's Father Kim's birthday tomorrow.

258
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,710
Is it really? Thank you.

259
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,140
For what?

260
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,109
Nothing. See you.

261
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,349
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

262
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:06,779
Oh, dumplings.
I forgot the dumplings.

263
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,789
- Gosh.
- That's delicious.

264
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,019
It's so sweet.

265
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:13,759
What took you so long?

266
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,829
Sorry. I need to go back out though.

267
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,759
Just when you got here?

268
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,059
I'll only be 30 minutes.

269
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,970
I'll bring you some drinks
for your hangovers.

270
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,799
Hang in there, you lot.
See you in a bit.

271
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:31,940
- Hang in there.
- Hang in there.

272
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,210
Ready?

273
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,250
- Yet again today,
- Yet again today,

274
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,250
- I am drinking. Cheers.
- I am drinking. Cheers.

275
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,690
Why did you call me here?

276
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,789
To say something important.

277
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,029
Keep it short.

278
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,130
Pretty soon,

279
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,630
I plan to take all this.

280
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,900
What?

281
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,309
I don't want it all.

282
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,009
We can split it down the middle.

283
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,140
Let's share.

284
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,750
Are you crazy?

285
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,380
I'm sane and very serious.

286
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,549
What if I tell my chief?

287
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Ms. Park.

288
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,190
The second that gun
was aimed at your head,

289
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:27,259
didn't you lose all the loyalty
you had for the chief prosecutor?

290
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,670
This just got more interesting.

291
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,599
In that case...

292
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:33,869
Did it show?

293
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,809
It didn't just show.

294
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,410
You practically cursed
with your face.

295
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,950
Why do you want to
split this with me?

296
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,019
To secure my future,

297
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,750
I need your help more than anything.

298
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,920
Chief Prosecutor Kang
or Lee Joong Kwon...

299
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,289
has way more power.

300
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:53,690
That's true,

301
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:59,559
but those two scumbags
will kill me soon.

302
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,269
And I won't?

303
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,740
That's why I'm here with you.

304
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,309
If you don't join sides with me now,

305
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,670
things could go bad for you.

306
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:13,309
Are you saying I'll die too?

307
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,480
So instead of...

308
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,150
thinking I'm just a thug,

309
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,349
have a sense of camaraderie.

310
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,650
Then I will protect you...

311
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,589
and make sure your future
is a straight path.

312
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,160
A straight path?

313
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,140
Do you have a plan?

314
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,170
Yes.

315
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:41,470
Are you with me?

316
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,109
Let's hear your plan first.

317
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,579
The guy who visited.

318
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,880
He called me "sir".

319
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,950
Right.

320
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:58,319
Did he say hi?
Did you test his moves?

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,559
We may have the same training
but he's not like me.

322
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,460
He's a murder weapon.

323
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,559
He's different, right?

324
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,799
Those kids are tough,
like the Americans.

325
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,700
"Those kids"?

326
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,369
I trained up a few, just for you.

327
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,240
What will you do with
those killing machines?

328
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,180
If you're going to
harm the others...

329
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,349
Hey.

330
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,720
You don't have the right to choose.

331
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:33,690
Please.

332
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,960
Don't touch anyone else.

333
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,160
Oh, wow. No.

334
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,829
You caused...

335
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,630
way too much trouble
for others with them.

336
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,500
I can't just let that slide.

337
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,640
Come after just me.

338
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,240
I'll take you on.

339
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,380
I saw a movie in which
the lead got in everyone's face.

340
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,380
So everyone near him got killed
in the end.

341
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,849
Leave.

342
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,869
My goodness.

343
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Gosh. That was scary.

344
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,250
Why was he sitting out there?

345
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,859
Where are the two priests?

346
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,799
That's why we eat so much.

347
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,269
It tastes great,

348
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:54,039
- but when in a good mood...
- Have some more.

349
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,309
Father Kim.

350
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,539
Where are you?

351
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,079
Where are you?

352
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,650
Stop drinking, get sober,
and stay together.

353
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,319
Stop drinking and get sober!

354
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,890
It's so noisy I can't hear you.

355
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,319
Get over here. Come and join us.

356
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:14,019
We should share.

357
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,259
What's he saying? It's too noisy.

358
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,200
Leave this alone.

359
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,630
- I need to pee.
- Go ahead.

360
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,630
Don't throw up. It's a waste.

361
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,700
It is.

362
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,839
How delicious.

363
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,490
(Father Kim Hae Il)

364
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,170
Darn it.

365
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,339
Yes, Father.

366
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:05,539
They must be busy drinking.

367
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,109
- Where are you right now?
- What?

368
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,650
- I'm outside alone.
- I asked where you are.

369
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,319
I'm in the middle of
Samdo Food Alley...

370
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,319
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,440
Detective Seo. Detective Seo!

372
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,480
Who are you, you jerk?

373
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,980
You better hurry and get me, Hae Il.

374
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,359
We have to leave now?

375
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:56,460
Why on earth isn't
Detective Heo coming back?

376
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,529
Maybe he's pooping.

377
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,869
Ik Gu!

378
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,640
Detective Heo, did you poop?

379
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,869
Mr. Lee! Hurry!

380
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,650
Who are you, you jerk?

381
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,269
Hold on!

382
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,210
Did you hit my sister?

383
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,809
No.

384
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,420
No!

385
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,960
Seung Ah. Seung Ah! Wake up!

386
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,369
Seung Ah.

387
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,309
Hey, you scumbag!

388
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:01,680
Who are you to hit a person
this bad?

389
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,079
