00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,439
(Episode 36)

2
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,610
However you scold me
and put me down,

3
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,150
you're my sister.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,179
I'll look after you.

5
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,260
Did Hwang Cheol Bum send you?

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,160
Yes, yes. Say he sent you.

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,429
Yes.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,929
Mr. Hwang sent me.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,230
Good. You're doing great, Father.

10
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,070
You're much younger than I expected.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,070
I do look young for my age.

12
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,140
However,

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,479
I don't want to talk
and I have nothing to say.

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,750
No, Ms. Jeong.

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,750
You must talk so I can help you.

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,659
I'm the only one
who can help myself.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,820
Ms. Jeong.

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,729
Keeping quiet won't help you.

19
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:55,859
Mr. Han.

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,799
Silence is
the best statement I can give.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,500
Is it because of your son?

22
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,209
No.

23
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:10,239
You fear for his safety.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,980
I said no.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,609
I have nothing to say. Please leave.

26
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,019
Ready.

27
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,719
Action.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,120
Ms. Jeong.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,659
My mother got a life sentence.

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,569
She used to leave home every day.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,170
Then one day...

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,209
she just didn't come back.

33
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,680
My aunt asked around
and found her in prison.

34
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,489
I was just eight years old.

35
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,090
Eight. So young...

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,930
So what?

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,800
Pardon?

38
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,199
So what?

39
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,909
My mother got a life...

40
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,909
- So what?
- Life in prison.

41
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,210
What does that have to do with me?

42
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,780
This tear-jerking story
doesn't work on her?

43
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,949
Should we have gone with
the death penalty instead?

44
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,789
Father.

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,900
I think we should
switch to a documentary.

46
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:46,969
I got the signal.

47
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,810
Where? Where are they?

48
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,879
They're about 7km off.

49
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,180
You jerks can't get away from me.

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,610
Hold on tight.

51
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,180
- Booster!
- Hey.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,849
Okay then. If you have
nothing more to say,

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,659
I shall leave.

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,659
Something, anything. Just talk.

55
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,729
Arouse her maternal instinct,
acting genius. I believe in you.

56
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,259
Ms. Jeong.

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,969
What is it now?

58
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,740
Is that it?

59
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:19,599
What?

60
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,539
Will you leave your only son
the feeling of humiliation?

61
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,879
Wow. That's way over the top.

62
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,819
How dare you talk to me like that?

63
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,490
I'm talking about your son.

64
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,460
Do you think he doesn't know
if you're a good...

65
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,629
or bad chief of the borough?

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,830
He'll know everything.

67
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,740
He'll act proud around others.

68
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,740
"My mom's innocent.
She's a good chief of borough."

69
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:58,310
Because you're his mom.

70
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,849
If you admit to your crimes...

71
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,979
and tell the world what you did,

72
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,389
your son won't have to make excuses
for the rest of his life.

73
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:08,419
Am I wrong?

74
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,789
The inheritance...

75
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,629
you should leave him
isn't humiliation...

76
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,829
but the freedom to be honorable.

77
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,240
Mr. Han.

78
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:33,310
Can you really...

79
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,220
guarantee my son's safety?

80
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,589
Yes.

81
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,350
I work with the best in the field.

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,189
Can you protect my statement...

83
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,329
and hand it over to
a reliable prosecutor?

84
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,829
Yes. I can do that.

85
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,790
Father. You went from
sad to serious and pulled it off.

86
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,689
Will this be enough?

87
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,629
Not just enough.

88
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,800
You heard a story
that will turn Korea...

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
upside-down and inside-out.

90
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,769
That's a relief then.

91
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,000
Why are Gudam Church's
priests and nun...

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,709
all so talented? It's just crazy.

93
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:36,670
We should go and get
Ms. Jeong's son to safety.

94
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,709
- Let's go.
- Okay. We're off.

95
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,540
(Gudam Express)

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,079
Did you think
we wouldn't find you here?

97
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,920
Get out now.

98
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,519
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,449
Hey. Hey.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
- They're dead.
- Dead?

101
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,060
Darn it. I hate this opening.

102
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,930
Lee Joong Kwon you scumbag.

103
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,269
He found out.

104
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,509
I planted this last week
and he found it.

105
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,410
He kills people this easily?

106
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,610
He's such a jerk.

107
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,420
They're trash.
How could human beings do this?

108
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,850
I'm heading off.

109
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,360
You're bad too.

110
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,160
I think they only found his tracker.

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,300
Yes. The scrambler jammed both,

112
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
but they thought
there's only one tracker.

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,329
That's good for us.

114
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,439
Tell the local police
to collect the bodies.

115
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,240
What? She talked to a lawyer?

116
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,579
Yes. A guard on our side
heard them and reported to me.

117
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,079
Who's the lawyer?

118
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,689
Han Pan Seung from...

119
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,319
a firm called Means and Ways.

120
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,160
We checked multiple times,
but the firm and lawyer don't exist.

121
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,259
Darn it.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,470
What are you talking about?

123
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,899
I sent a lawyer?

124
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,170
Don't feign ignorance.

125
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,970
I got the message
and told him everything.

126
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,579
- What...
- Cheol Bum.

127
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,509
Let's pay the price
and live honest lives.

128
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:56,649
Even if we keep quiet,

129
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,949
the people high up
won't leave us alone.

130
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,649
What on earth are you talking about?

131
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,329
Is Ms. Jeong's statement any good?

132
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:08,689
She told us everything.

133
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,730
About the Gudam-gu cartel,

134
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,430
Maegakgyo, even the people high up.

135
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,930
Father Han scored big again.

136
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,069
Is there anything on Father Lee?

137
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,110
Ms. Jeong thinks that
Hwang Cheol Bum killed him...

138
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,980
and abandoned the body.

139
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,579
Did she give any details?

140
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:27,980
On how he was killed
and abandoned?

141
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,250
It's obvious that
she doesn't know anything.

142
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,750
She just assumed that
Hwang Cheol Bum did it.

143
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,519
But my gut tells me that...

144
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,460
there's something
we don't know about.

145
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,159
What do you have?

146
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,090
We're just as lost.

147
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,259
Hey. What happens if they...

148
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,370
take the money and go far away?

149
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,269
We lose 150 million dollars.

150
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,039
No! Don't you dare lose it.

151
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,169
My gosh.

152
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,840
One would think the money
belongs to you.

153
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,710
Let's get the bully first.

154
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:03,279
And get us an arrest warrant
for Lee Joong Kwon.

155
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,250
Okay. I can do that.

156
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,679
I'm Phoenix Seon.

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,419
Kang Seok Tae.

158
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,360
(Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae)

159
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,990
I have a warrant. Where is he?

160
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,159
I don't know where he went.

161
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:18,429
He just said he'd leave early.

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,230
He ran off.

163
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,570
After all that showing off
he did this morning.

164
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,070
- Mr. Park.
- Yes?

165
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,139
Type up the paperwork for...

166
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,110
Kang Seok Tae's travel ban.

167
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,309
I will.

168
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,279
Ki Yong Moon.

169
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,950
For fraud, assault, blackmail,

170
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,919
tax evasion, sexual
harassment and more,

171
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,220
you're under arrest.

172
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,389
(Arrest Warrant)

173
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,029
Those who lack enlightenment...

174
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,159
went and did something silly.

175
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:53,399
How dare you threaten my master.

176
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,669
Get out!

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,070
An Dul Ja.

178
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:59,600
You're also under arrest
for conspiracy of fraud.

179
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,509
Your real name is An Dul Ja?

180
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,909
Yes.

181
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,950
My enlightened followers
won't let this happen.

182
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,720
- Ukha.
- Ukha.

183
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,139
Thank you, sir.

184
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,110
Do you leave at dawn tomorrow?

185
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,139
Yes.

186
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's go.

187
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:53,960
What on earth did you get up to?

188
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,059
What? I gave you a chance to repent.

189
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,700
Stabbing me in the back
is against our deal.

190
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Don't you want to know
how Father Lee died?

191
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:04,740
We'll figure that out.
You don't have to worry.

192
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,570
I wanted to work with you
but it's really hard.

193
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,340
I think your arrest warrant
has been issued.

194
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,450
You should run away
or turn yourself in.

195
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,250
I will make this up to you one day.

196
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,519
Darn it.

197
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:25,019
My gosh.

198
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,389
Mr. Hwang. I was hoping to
handcuff him myself.

199
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,529
- The signal, the signal.
- Where? Where?

200
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,529
(Gyoha-dong)

201
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,769
(Confirmation of
Transfer of Suspect)

202
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,710
Good work.

203
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,350
Goodness. It's been a long time.

204
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,850
He held my hands telling me
to pray together...

205
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,389
and touched my thighs
while I was praying.

206
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,629
Is it true that Father Lee
embezzled offering?

207
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,700
Yes, it's true.

208
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,860
Where am I?

209
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,629
Just let me go.

210
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,200
Detective.

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,309
Goodness.

212
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840
What happened? Why?

213
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,049
What's this smell?

214
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:08,690
What's that?

215
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,159
Stay there for a minute.

216
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,269
You found this place all right.

217
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,940
The navigation on my cell phone
is accurate.

218
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,879
It's a return match.

219
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,909
Last time,

220
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,750
I was off my guard.

221
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:51,159
Go!

222
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,279
You jerks.
You will really regret this.

223
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,019
I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

224
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,190
Just go back to your sleep.

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,129
I settled outside
and called the police.

226
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,929
Now we just need to take the money.

227
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:05,940
Song Sac.

228
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,210
They sold me to a restaurant.

229
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,450
I cleaned king crabs all day long
and didn't get paid.

230
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,860
I tried to eat the crab in secret,
but they caught me...

231
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
and beat me up.

232
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,860
I was sold to a bear farm,

233
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,700
so I had to feed them
every day,

234
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,200
but the bears wanted to eat me
instead of the food.

235
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,070
I really hate bears.

236
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,740
I hate to see Winnie the Bear...

237
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,769
and I wouldn't do anything
related to bears.

238
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,169
So why did you commit perjury?

239
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,320
Then you should
tell me the truth now.

240
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,419
Did Father Lee sexually harass
you and embezzle money?

241
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,590
No, he didn't.

242
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,629
No, he didn't.

243
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,329
All right.

244
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,700
Don't tell such a lie.

245
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,299
That's not different from
selling your spirit again, okay?

246
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,740
We won't.

247
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,569
I'll pay for it, so order a sweet
and sour pork for them.

248
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,740
Yes.

249
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,410
Sweet and sour pork.

250
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,109
Did you put the money
in a safe place?

251
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,950
I had such a hard time
moving it today.

252
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,119
Everything went so smoothly today.

253
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,289
How can all things go so well
in a day?

254
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,190
Yes. All things went so well today,
and I was so busy.

255
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,690
We need to get Chief Prosecutor Kang
and Hwang Cheol Bum first.

256
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,589
They're the key figures after all.

257
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,329
We also need decisive evidence
for Father Lee's case.

258
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,039
I'm relieved that we at least
have testifiers now.

259
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,740
I heard it from Detective Seo.

260
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,480
That team leader of
the violent crimes squad...

261
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,910
will quit after they
solve this case.

262
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,079
I heard that too.

263
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,180
Mr. Lee doesn't know that.

264
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,920
After we're done with this case,
everyone except for Detective Seo...

265
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,549
will quit too.

266
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,190
They think that's the way
to be loyal and dutiful.

267
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:08,660
Gosh. They should have kept
loyalty and duty from the beginning.

268
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,730
It's too late now.

269
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,170
I get it.

270
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,269
I'll quit too.

271
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,339
I said I'll quit. Are you satisfied?

272
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,410
After this case is solved,

273
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:29,650
I'll quit this job
and pay for what I did.

274
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,480
Are you sure?

275
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,119
You know I can't live
with uncomfortable feelings left.

276
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,819
And I think that's the flow
and justice.

277
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,589
You're right. You should
go with the flow.

278
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,759
I'll settle everything and begin
the second act of my life.

279
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:51,029
Maybe I'll run a private detective
agency. I'm fit for the job.

280
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,339
Are there any other plans?

281
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,609
Any other plans?
If I'm going to think about it,

282
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:58,680
I can think of more than 100 things.

283
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,849
But I don't want to get embarrassed.
I'm Park Kyeong Seon.

284
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,079
And I told you once.

285
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,049
I think my past ruined my future.

286
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,859
So I'll try not to make my future...

287
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,829
ruin my future further ahead.

288
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,369
Thank you for your work, Father.

289
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,000
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you for your work.

290
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,819
It's a holiday, but I can't enjoy it
and I'm stuck in the office.

291
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,119
I have so much paperwork too.

292
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,759
Do you?

293
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,859
As my hands are slow,
I can't help you.

294
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,130
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,329
When the skin or hair turns white...

296
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,440
due to the lack of melanin pigment,
it's called an albinoidism.

297
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,210
In Mount Youngyu of Gudam-gu,
Seoul,

298
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,079
an albino marten, a rare species,
was detected.

299
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,809
A marten that's white all over
its body, from his head to legs,

300
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,579
runs around the forest.

301
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:14,650
A white albino marten is living...

302
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,190
with two other common brown
martens as a group.

303
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,789
An unmanned camera with sensors
vividly captured them.

304
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,390
They removed all the surveillance
cameras.

305
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,559
I wonder if they bury people
in this place.

306
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,029
I just saw a white marten
passing by.

307
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,670
However, although an albino marten
might look mysterious...

308
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,769
What is it, Dae Young?

309
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,769
What if there was an unmanned camera
with sensors...

310
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,039
where the martens appeared?

311
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,410
What?

312
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,279
Where are you going?

313
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,619
I'm going with you!

314
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,750
Early this morning,
four murder suspects...

315
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,220
who were arrested in a warehouse...

316
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,859
assaulted a police officer while
being taken in and ran away.

317
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,329
Mr. Lee and three others are...

318
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:57,859
key suspects related
to a violent murder case...

319
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,630
and they ran away while being taken
in to the district police station.

320
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,269
Kim Hyeong Seop reports it.

321
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,700
Yes, that's what we installed.

322
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,640
Don't you need permission
from Daebum Corporation?

323
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,609
Actually, we installed it
without permission.

324
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,740
Did they tell you
not to do that at first?

325
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,880
Yes, but...

326
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,019
after I found out
that an albino marten appeared,

327
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,980
I couldn't just stay
and do nothing about it.

328
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,789
So I installed it, taking a risk
of getting a disciplinary action.

329
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,589
You're a great person.

330
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,230
Can we check the records
filmed for the last two months?

331
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,200
We might find an important clue
for a murder case.

332
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,329
Yes.

333
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,369
I have records of up to a year ago.

334
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,069
Then I ask for your cooperation.

335
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:42,069
- Please, sir.
- Yes. Wait a minute.

336
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,470
This...

337
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,380
This is such a great institution.

338
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,740
Goodness.

339
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,059
How come there's so much dust
in every corner?

340
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,430
After you're done
with the vacuuming,

341
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,460
wipe the kimchi fridge
with a damp cloth.

342
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,470
As you sit on it all the time,
it got so dirty.

343
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,569
I didn't sit on it that much.
How can it get dirty by that?

344
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,599
You sat on it all the time.

345
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,069
Because of you...

346
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,779
the fresh kimchi in the fridge
is fermented already.

347
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:20,180
It's so fermented that we can make
braised kimchi with it.

348
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,750
That's nonsense.

349
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,880
How could kimchi get fermented
only by me sitting on the fridge?

350
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,750
Gosh, really. I'm falsely charged.

351
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,920
Father, Sister,

352
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,589
will you go out with me?

353
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,519
I'll buy you something delicious.

354
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,529
Goodness. You should
have told me earlier.

355
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:42,400
I need to play Go-Stop
with the old ladies.

356
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,470
Gosh.

357
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,400
I guess you two can go out.

358
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,740
Where do you want to go?
What are we going to eat?

359
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,210
- What are we going to eat?
- Then we can watch a movie...

360
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,910
and get some fresh air
after a long time.

361
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,509
- Let's finish it quickly and go.
- Let's finish this quickly.

362
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,259
This is the most delicious
pork belly I've ever had.

363
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,130
- I'll give you a wrap.
- Okay.

364
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,430
You're eating well.

365
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,369
Why are we taking a sticker photo,
just between men?

366
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:21,509
Even between men, people take
a photo for friendship.

367
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,309
I don't want to take it
with a man...

368
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,009
But this looks so fun.

369
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,829
Don't you think we should call
Father Kim about this?

370
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,700
Let's call him
if we find something concrete.

371
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,670
Wait a minute. Wait. Stop it there.

372
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,069
Play it again.

373
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,200
(CCTV in Mount Youngyu)

374
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,710
There. That thing.

375
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,470
I think it's a man.

376
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,240
He's approaching the camera.

377
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,710
My goodness.

378
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,519
That's...

379
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,559
The movie was too long. It's late.

380
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,990
Still, it was so fun.

381
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,500
It was fun to see a movie
after a long time.

382
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,569
By the way, we can't bring this
to Sister Kim. It's too late.

383
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,799
That's right.
We can give it tomorrow.

384
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,900
Right. We can do that tomorrow.

385
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,670
- Father.
- Yes?

386
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,180
I have something to ask you.

387
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,240
All right. Go ahead.

388
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,309
It's kind of against
the custom of priests,

389
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,849
but for just an hour a week,
when I'm with you alone,

390
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,119
can I call you casually
like to an older brother?

391
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,119
Of course, you can do that.

392
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:47,289
- You can do that.
- It will be fine, an hour a week.

393
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:48,589
Sure. No one can notice that.

394
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:52,160
- Then I'll call you casually.
- Okay.

395
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,660
Hae Il.

396
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,099
It's nice. My spiritual brother.

397
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,140
I feel so happy.

398
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:15,220
Father Han, you can stay here
for a minute.

399
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,730
Why are you here?

400
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,230
Run! Father Han, run away, now!

401
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,559
Stop it! You jerks.

402
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,769
Come here. Come here. Come to me.

403
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,130
Come to me. What are you doing?

404
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:07,369
Come on!

405
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,470
You jerks.
Don't lay your hands on him.

406
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,809
Come here.

407
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,779
No. Don't do it.

408
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,579
Father Han. Are you all right?

409
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,920
I'll be right there, Father Han.

410
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,519
Stop it. Run now!

411
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,319
Father Han!

412
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,289
Hey! Seong Kyu!

413
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,099
I'll be right there.

414
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,269
I'll be right there. Wait a second.
You'll be fine.

415
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,740
Hae Il.

416
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,539
You'll be fine.

417
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:49,410
Why do you always curse and bully me
whenever you see me?

418
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,980
Don't bother me anymore.

419
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,680
Where's the money?

420
00:26:57,819 --> 00:27:01,089
Lee Joong Kwon, you jerk!

421
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,759
I'll kill you if you lay your hands
on him.

422
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,799
Hey.

423
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,940
You're responsible for everything...

424
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,839
that happens from now on.

425
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,069
Joong Kwon.

426
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,940
Joong Kwon, it's my fault.

427
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,450
I'll give you the money back.

428
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,150
Just this once. I'm begging you.

429
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,779
- Go.
- Please.

430
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
No.

431
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,859
No, no. Don't do it. Don't.

432
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,769
Seong Kyu. No. Don't! No!
