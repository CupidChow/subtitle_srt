1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,209
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:07,209
Why would you call me out
so early in the morning?

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,580
We could've talked later
in the afternoon.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,179
It's urgent.

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:12,250
Brief me about the information
you got from Jang Ryong.

6
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:15,419
So the target is Mr. Nam, right?

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,059
Then the story about Rising Moon
fits with what Jang Ryong said.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,089
The actual owners of Rising Moon...

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,399
are Mr. Nam, Congressman Park,
Mr. Kang, Ms. Jeong,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,629
and Hwang Cheol Bum.

11
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,170
That's what everyone knows.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,170
Among them,
Mr. Nam's share is the largest.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,509
The police's protection is strong.

14
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:36,710
That must be why his is the largest.

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,210
And there's a guy named Anton.

16
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,649
He's the general manager
and the leader of Diabol.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,820
Using drug as a medium,
the son of a conglomerate,

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,820
the son of a high official,
and celebrities gather together.

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,189
The key person of them...

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,960
is Kim Keon Yong,
the son of Hanjoo Group's CEO.

21
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,689
That's how they began the community
and protected each other.

22
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,130
Right.

23
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,130
Prosecutors, policemen,
showbiz agencies, and companies...

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,399
are all related.

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,400
Anything they can't handle...

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,670
must be sent to those
with more power.

27
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,170
Right.

28
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,409
But Jang Ryong himself
doesn't know...

29
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,810
how far the line goes.

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,079
So the most corrupt one...

31
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,150
was hidden behind the veil.

32
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,379
They provided drugs
to the sons of CEOs and celebrities.

33
00:01:19,349 --> 00:01:20,890
- They made much profit, right?
- Yes.

34
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,620
In fact, 60 percent of the cartel's
income is from Rising Moon.

35
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,459
If we destroy Rising Moon,

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,090
the cartel will be damaged greatly,
right?

37
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,200
Of course.

38
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,060
It's been almost two years
since it opened.

39
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:34,930
I wonder where all this money
is gone to.

40
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,469
They can't save it at the bank,

41
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,239
and it wouldn't be easy
to keep it in cash.

42
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,510
- What's wrong?
- If...

43
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,010
If they couldn't hold out...

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,049
and needed a safe like a bank's,

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,549
"A safe like a bank's"?

46
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,620
- A foundation?
- That's right.

47
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:00,590
That's the biggest and most
efficient money laundering machine.

48
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,659
That must be why they wanted
to manage the welfare facility.

49
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,000
They wanted a foundation
for themselves.

50
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,000
So Rising Moon is
what killed Father Lee.

51
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,669
Hwang Cheol Bum, that jerk.

52
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,039
He's trying to bite his owner.

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,139
But we expected this to happen.

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,110
I heard Kim Hae Il
went to Rising Moon.

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
How did you know that?

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,389
Information about Rising Moon...

57
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,189
is always updated at our company.

58
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,060
No matter how hard
we try to hide the fact,

59
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,120
I can't hide it from you.

60
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,590
We can't dare to attack...

61
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,000
those who drink, take drugs,

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and seek for love at Rising Moon.

63
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,169
So you don't have to worry.

64
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,099
Gosh, this is sickening.

65
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,569
Mr. Lee. Let's just deal with it.

66
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,810
That priest and Hwang.

67
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,039
Okay.

68
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,710
We should deal with them.

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,009
But we have to change...

70
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,349
the way we get them.

71
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,729
Hey.

72
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,030
I thought I gave you
some time to think.

73
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,770
Why did you ignore my last advice?

74
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:16,939
Tell me!

75
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,669
- You brought it to yourself.
- Make it short.

76
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,879
This will be the last time
we just...

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,949
stand and talk like this.

78
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,810
It's a war.

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,069
Good morning.

80
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,539
Ms. Park. You're okay, right?

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,800
We were really shocked
when we heard the news.

82
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,740
I never go down.

83
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,340
I'm a phoenix.

84
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,610
A phoenix!

85
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,189
Ms. Park. Detective Seo
from Gudam Police Station...

86
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,919
sent us a CCTV footage.

87
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,289
A CCTV footage?

88
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,520
She said Father Kim
told her to do this.

89
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,460
That's you going inside.

90
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,829
Focus on the guy who's
wearing a jumper and following you.

91
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,540
The same person keeps chasing her.

92
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,480
He kept an eye on you.

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,379
This gives me goosebumps.

94
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,319
Before an assassination,
you follow the target...

95
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,290
for a few days, one day at least.

96
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,959
To see whom they meet...

97
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,930
and decide the best time to attack.

98
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:54,029
If someone was following you,
this was definitely planned.

99
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:02,110
I have a question.

100
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,180
Who wanted me dead?

101
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,610
Robbery?

102
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,550
You know very well that I'd neither
believe nor accept that.

103
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,420
So why did you provide a reason?

104
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:19,060
You know that Director Kim Keon Yong
is sensitive and ill-tempered.

105
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,759
Why did you have to make him
suspect you?

106
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,860
Was visiting that idol member
that big of a sin?

107
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,370
Is murdering someone
as easy as stepping...

108
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,399
on a cockroach for him?

109
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,740
"Easy"?
Are you really asking me that?

110
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,810
You know very well.

111
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,509
I'm a prosecutor of Korea, sir.

112
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,850
I made sure this didn't turn
into a big deal.

113
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,149
Stay away from Rising Moon
and that idol member.

114
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,680
If this happens again,

115
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,620
you'll be all alone, got it?

116
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,769
(Chief Prosecutor
Kang Seok Tae's Office)

117
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,800
Is my life nothing but an item
in a game for you?

118
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,110
Do you think you can
toy with it however you want?

119
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,779
You filthy scumbags.

120
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:19,750
We cannot just stay here.

121
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,389
If we want the believers to return,

122
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,019
we need to reach out first.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,790
I agree with you,

124
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,529
but I doubt just telling them
to come back will persuade them.

125
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,430
Of course, that won't.

126
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,569
We need to gain their trust
by getting even closer.

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,970
Through our actions,
we will show them...

128
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,170
I'll need to give them
the annual confession sheets.

129
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,610
All right. Let's start
with District One.

130
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,050
All right.

131
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,550
I'm done for.

132
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,689
- Sister Agnes, hello.
- Hello.

133
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:03,490
I came here to say hello
since it's been way too long...

134
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,459
since you've come to our church.

135
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,399
I don't go
since everyone else doesn't.

136
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,769
They're all mine!

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,740
- 12 cents.
- Goodness.

138
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,470
Since that's a "gwangbak"
and a "pibak",

139
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,079
that'll be 48 cents.

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,949
Darn it, my 48 cents.

141
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,550
Will you really not come back?

142
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,649
That's not the problem right now.

143
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,550
I've lost a whopping three dollars.

144
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,930
If I win back your money,

145
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,459
will you come back?

146
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,060
Of course.

147
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,970
I'll also bring
all the other fellow grandmas.

148
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,500
I'll be helping her,
starting with the next round.

149
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,540
- Would that be all right?
- Sure.

150
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,319
(Superintendent Nam Seok Gu)

151
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,750
Who are you?

152
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,889
What a surprise.

153
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,930
Aren't you the president
of Rising Moon?

154
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
What?

155
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,529
By the way,
where did you get this suit?

156
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,930
Did you get this
at a market or online?

157
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,069
Darn it.

158
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,839
Be quiet!

159
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,639
And about Rising Moon,

160
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,509
it'll soon go up in flames.

161
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:29,649
Do you think it'll be that easy?

162
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,879
Do you think you'll get
what you want?

163
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm not sure about getting
what I want,

164
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,759
but I'm sure the Lord will get
what he wants.

165
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,399
By the way, let me give you
an advice. When you get caught,

166
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,570
return back to your country,

167
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,870
and don't cause
our country any more harm.

168
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,070
Also, please change your name.

169
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,370
How about "Nambe" or "Nakamura"?

170
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,870
What?

171
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,840
Hey, hey! Put down that figure!

172
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,450
You take money
from practically everyone,

173
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,720
but you're so stingy with yours.

174
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,519
You...

175
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,860
That... That was so expensive!

176
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,440
These are both weak.
What should I do?

177
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,940
Which one should I put down?

178
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes! Yes!

179
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,480
Yay!

180
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,049
Let it be a dud! Let it be dud!

181
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,830
We have five "gwangs"
and "godori".

182
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,440
Let me see...

183
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,009
That'll be 3.7 dollars.

184
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,379
Since we're having a great time,

185
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,080
let's be generous
and only receive three dollars each.

186
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,110
All right.

187
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,049
You heard her, right?
Pay up three dollars.

188
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,750
You're coming back, right?

189
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,750
Of course, of course.

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,950
I'll bring them all.

191
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Please help me out again next time.

192
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,730
Sure.

193
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,330
Father?

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,029
Let's go.

195
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,340
How dare you try
to toy with my life?

196
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,509
I don't need any support
or whatever from those punks!

197
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,940
Anyone who's looked on
or is involved...

198
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,379
in my attempted murder
by even 0.00001 percent...

199
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:45,149
will be destroyed by me.

200
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:50,350
You guys have just stepped on poop.

201
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,590
And it's not just any poop.

202
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,429
It's poop that will never
come off from your soles.

203
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
You're all dead meat.

204
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,700
What? You want to
dig into Rising Moon?

205
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,139
Yes. Let's drill into it...

206
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:11,740
until we hit the rock bottom.

207
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:13,840
We don't even know who is involved.

208
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,950
It's too risky.

209
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,419
I'll do it.

210
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,919
Phoenix Park Kyeong Seon
will do it.

211
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,220
The biggest problem is that
we don't have an ally.

212
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,519
This is impossible to do on our own.

213
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,929
"An ally"?

214
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,889
Right.

215
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,429
We'll make one.

216
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:36,529
Why are you here at this hour?

217
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,610
What's wrong with your eyes?
Did you change your makeup?

218
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,240
I have an offer.

219
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,820
Let's join hands.

220
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,960
"Join hands"?

221
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,809
- Why all of a sudden?
- We need to destroy them.

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,909
There are some individuals
who need to be destroyed.

223
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,950
Are these individuals related
to your attempted murder?

224
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:24,320
Will you do it or will you not?

225
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,950
This isn't for justice.
This is your revenge.

226
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:30,149
Exactly. I'm trying to take revenge.

227
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,590
It'll be bloody revenge,
the best revenge of all.

228
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,129
Then we can't join hands.

229
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,789
How could you ask a priest
to aid you in your bloody revenge?

230
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,190
That is ridiculous.

231
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,330
We'll both get what we want.

232
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,929
You'll get your revenge
on those Gudam people...

233
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,769
and find evidence
regarding Father Lee.

234
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,570
And I'll get my own revenge
and social justice.

235
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,379
No. Never. Not in a million years.

236
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:52,809
Just imagine it.

237
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,549
Imagine the craziest woman
in Seocho-dong...

238
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,350
who was once your enemy,
siding with you.

239
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,149
We'll be allies.

240
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,450
This is game over.

241
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:04,220
Aren't you convinced?
You are, right?

242
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,360
Don't deny it.

243
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,659
"The craziest woman"...
That sounds interesting.

244
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,399
But still, no.

245
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,299
One more. If we succeed,

246
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,940
I'll give you information regarding
Father Lee's case.

247
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,139
- Are you serious?
- Of course. Should I notarize it?

248
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,009
Give me some time to think.

249
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:30,710
I need to discuss this
with my teammates.

250
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,750
Don't you like being alone?
What team?

251
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,019
It's Team Tsunami.

252
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,860
"Team Tsunami"?

253
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,429
Okay, okay.

254
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,429
Tell me by this evening.
Do you know why?

255
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,570
Because it's going
to happen tonight.

256
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,500
But if this gets disclosed,

257
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,169
won't this become
a political matter?

258
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,539
I can assure you
that it won't matter.

259
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,580
Only several of their underlings
will be harmed.

260
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,940
The leaders won't be affected.

261
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,710
That is because this is Korea.

262
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,649
That's exactly why
I wanted your take on this.

263
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,220
Should I do it or not?

264
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,960
I say let's do it.
Whatever her motives are,

265
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,659
we'll get what we want.

266
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,330
It doesn't seem like she's trying
to pull a fast one.

267
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,230
I think it's possible.

268
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,269
If you don't want to, that's fine.

269
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,570
That's not it.

270
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,169
Actually,

271
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,740
I have a burden.

272
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:33,710
What is it?

273
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,490
What are you doing there?

274
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,129
That's not your chair.

275
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,629
You know,

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,399
the back and the seat
maybe yours,

277
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,669
but aren't these five legs mine?

278
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,500
Why are you acting this way
since yesterday?

279
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,269
Do you know how
hard it was for me...

280
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,840
to placate Chief Prosecutor Kang?

281
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,309
Goodness.

282
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,049
You and the others
have already abandoned me.

283
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,490
Did you think I didn't know?

284
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,460
Then you
should've done better.

285
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:21,029
Since we have a history,

286
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,929
I won't cause you or the others
any harm.

287
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,860
So don't provoke me.

288
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,340
In other words,
we're all on our own.

289
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,610
Also, hand me
Congressman Park's share...

290
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:36,710
at the secret safe.

291
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,639
So this is how you'll be?

292
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:43,779
You better not think about...

293
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,350
doing away with me.

294
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,250
Because if you do,

295
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,960
that safe will go up in flames.

296
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,830
Why didn't you tell me this sooner?

297
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,799
I'm going to kill
every single one of them!

298
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,169
He's right! You should've
told me about this sooner!

299
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,809
I wanted to!

300
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,649
I made the wrong choice, right?

301
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,679
I'm a sinner, right?

302
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,820
Darn it.

303
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,019
Had you told me sooner,

304
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,159
I would've prayed for him.

305
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:33,830
I hope you'll put down
that burden of yours.

306
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,070
You've shared it with us.

307
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,870
I should.

308
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,509
I really want to.

309
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,620
If it's not for his family, will you
be able to go back to your old self?

310
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,419
- What?
- Will you be able...

311
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:02,259
to go back to the righteous
and passionate cop...

312
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,660
you once were
who didn't worry about anything?

313
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,609
Of course.

314
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,009
I'll destroy them all.

315
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,819
Okay, I got it.

316
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,119
One question.

317
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,990
Is this truly out of your desire
to take revenge?

318
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,460
Yes. Why?

319
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,460
Is it not because you're angry
about what you've done so far?

320
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,059
It's not like that.

321
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,259
I was just wondering.

322
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,029
Perhaps, you wanted to make amends.

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,039
You're thinking too much.

324
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,670
If that's right,

325
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,569
I'm going...

326
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,509
to help you until the end.

327
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,579
And you won't help if otherwise?

328
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,549
Will you do it or not?

329
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,420
Let's...

330
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,190
- join hands.
- Okay! Deal!

334
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,369
This is an extremely rare case,

335
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,309
but I, a prosecutor,
got the warrant myself.

336
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,039
I want to join.

337
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,680

Since I know how you guys are,

339
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,319
I won't coerce you.

340
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,289
If you don't want to come,
don't bother.

341
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,089
Just so you know, no one
in the drug squad wanted to come.

All right, then.
I'll be on my way to Rising Moon.

- I do.

you're going to the bathroom.

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,819
if you've sold drugs before,
come on out.

359
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,119
If not, we'll come to you!

360
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,720
Hey, let's do this the easy way.

361
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,430
The prosecutor came here herself.

362
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,859
Who cares?

363
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,230
We won't do anything,
so do as you wish.

364
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,240
Goodness, we should get
an express train to hell tonight.

365
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,900
I'll give you one minute.

366
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,170
All the druggies
step up voluntarily.

367
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,809
Get in a line!

368
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,009
How many times do I need
to repeat myself?

369
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,779
Prosecutor Park is here!

370
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,220
I told you she'd cause trouble.

371
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,390
I'll talk to her.

372
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:59,519
I doubt she'll listen to you
right now.

373
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,259
And why is there a priest here?

374
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,890
The priest is there too?

375
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,230
If I get caught again,
my father will kill me.

376
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,329
I'll get out of this my own way,
so wrap it up for me.

377
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Okay?

378
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,569
Sir. Sir!

379
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,049
What should we do?

380
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
We're allowed to kill you
as we please.

381
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,950
Get them!

382
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,799
What a grand entrance.

383
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,170
What's wrong with them?

384
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,930
They're all high.

385
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,109
This wasn't what we had in mind.

386
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:51,880
That startled me.

387
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,210
One more step, and I'll shoot.

388
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,279
Good thinking.
Why bother getting into a fight?

389
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,279
Good job.

390
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,890
You should've told us
if you had brought guns.

391
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,819
If they come closer,
shoot them in the legs.

392
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,990
Shoot. Shoot.

393
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,359
These are all blank bullets.

394
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,660
No way.

395
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,299
They don't care if they get killed.

396
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,140
If we stay, we'll all die!

397
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,009
I expected this...

398
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,609
and brought along
my own breakwater.

399
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,180
"Breakwater"?

400
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,849
- Choco!
- Coming, Father.

401
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,710
Oh, my. Hello, Choco.

402
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,349
By the way,
did you register at our church yet?

403
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:08,849
Yes, I did.

404
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,490
Why is he so big?
Are there two people inside him?

405
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,519
Choco and I will take care of them.

406
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,759
You two take
Prosecutor Kang with you.

407
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:17,859
My goodness.

408
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,869
How could a prosecutor run away?
That's humiliating.

409
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,529
Wouldn't getting humiliated
be better than dying?

410
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,200
Hey, you scumbags.
How dare you look straight...

411
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,309
into my eyes?

412
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,869
- Detective Seo.
- Got it, Father.

413
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,579
I'm not leaving. Why should I?

414
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,180
- Let's go.
- No.

415
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,279
I'll kill you all!

416
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,609
You shouldn't be stopped.
We will leave right away.

417
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,819
After we evacuate her,
I'll be back.

418
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,980
That's how you do it. There you go.

419
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,750
Come on!

420
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,480
What are you doing?

421
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,559
Darn it.
Why are there so many men outside?

422
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,559
Detective Seo,
get Ms. Park in the car and leave.

423
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,490
What are you talking about?
I want to be a part of this.

424
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,000
How dare these jerks attack us?

425
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,200
Are you going to be okay
on your own?

426
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,829
Don't worry. I'm gaining back
the skills I used to have.

427
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,400
- Hurry and leave!
- Please be careful.

428
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,240
Make sure not to get hurt.

429
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,950
Ms. Park. Ms. Park.

430
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,650
It looks like something serious
is happening.

431
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,819
I know. What's happening?

432
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,690
Why am I
at the fighting scene again?

433
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,000
My gosh!

434
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,970
Detective Seo.

435
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,650
Hey, they lack people.
What do we do?

436
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,279
- Well...
- It's dangerous.

437
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,579
What do we do?

438
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,849
Come here, you jerks!

439
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,589
My gosh. Oh, my goodness.

440
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,990
- No!
- Yo Han.

441
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,829
Baozi? My gosh.

442
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,369
Are you okay?

443
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,210
Hey, you scumbag! How could you...

444
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,039
Hold on!

445
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,099
Song Sac.

446
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:44,400
There you go. Hit him!

447
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,730
I'm a tiger protecting my own king.

448
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,190
Song Sac!

449
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,170
Song Sac.

450
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,269
(The Fiery Priest)

451
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:56,569
- Well done.
- Song Sac.

452
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,869
You're a great fighter.

453
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,779
I'll also help you, Father Kim.

454
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,039
(One by one, they become a hero.)

455
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,349
- Please teach me also, Song Sac.
- She called me by my name.

456
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,819
We need someone to act
as a criminal.

457
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,589
Important missions like this one
needs acting as well.

458
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,920
Father Han's face suits for acting.

459
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,160
- Let's all cheer for ourselves.
- Let's move.

460
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,460
(The birth of the Avengers!)

461
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,460
I just got angrier.
