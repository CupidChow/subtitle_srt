1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,840
What was that again?

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,109
"Long"...

3
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:04,410
"Dragon"...

4
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,639
"Punk".

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,849
You're quite funny.

6
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,390
There must be an epidemic that
makes people stupidly courageous.

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,890
But history shows...

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,190
that beating deadly is
the best cure for epidemics.

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,429
Song Sac.

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,699
- It's today.
- Okay.

11
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,030
Follow me outside.

12
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,140
What is this? A teen drama?
Is this "Teen Wolf"?

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,939
Hey, why are you
acting like this today?

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,679
It's all right, sir. Move aside.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,109
Hey, get out. You'll hurt yourself.

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,549
Finish it in one go.

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,789
Has your confidence gone up...

18
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,789
after that one victory
at Rising Moon?

19
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,130
You're nothing but a rookie fighter.

20
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,259
You don't know
whom you're up against.

21
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,929
There are 3 levels to my power,
but I'll only use level 1.

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,170
If I use level three, you'll die.
You long dragon punk.

23
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,510
Just do level three, will you?

24
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:10,780
Better yet, is there level nine?

25
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,480
I'm so flabbergasted.
Aren't you?

26
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,349
Oh, hello, Mr. Kim.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,780
I can't believe I'm doing this.

28
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,359
(A tiger who protects his own king)

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,590
Bring it on.

30
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:30,859
(Song Sac)

31
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:34,829
Are you mimicking Muay Thai now?

32
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,799
Capoeira is my minor.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,909
My major is...

34
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:49,379
(Jang Ryong)

35
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,780
Muay Thai.

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,189
(The rock head of Buyeo,
a 3-story stone pagoda)

37
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,370
Hello.

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,639
Did you just hit my head?

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,379
Watch out.
No, wait. Right.

40
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,169
You jerk!

41
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,120
Do you think you can beat me
with that?

42
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,270
Boss, I'll see you later!

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,069
- Song Sac! Song Sac!
- Song Sac! Song Sac!

44
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,139
- Song Sac! Song Sac!
- Song Sac! Song Sac!

45
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:25,379
Hey, are you okay?

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Stay still! Hey, breathe!

47
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,219
- Song Sac! Song Sac!
- Song Sac! Song Sac!

48
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:32,479
Song Sac wins!

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,849
- Song Sac! Song Sac!
- Song Sac! Song Sac!

50
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,789
Song Sac!

51
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,259
Help me.

52
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,889
- Song Sac! Song Sac!
- Song Sac! Song Sac!

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,069
This must be your lucky day.

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,370
Nice shot.

55
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,370
I'm doing quite well today.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,479
Your outfit makes
you look like a pro golfer.

57
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:02,949
I'm flattered.

58
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,319
By the way, I don't know how
should I ask for your forgiveness.

59
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,719
Give her a sincere apology
once again.

60
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,990
I'm sorry, ma'am.

61
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll do my best from now on also.

62
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,399
I'm sorry I couldn't
do this sooner...

63
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,300
and help them make up.

64
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,670
Don't say that.

65
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,410
I should give you a meaningful gift.

66
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,779
Not at all, sir.

67
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,250
I'm already content and grateful
for my current position.

68
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,579
If you ever need anything,
please tell me.

69
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,019
Sure.

70
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,389
All right, then. Shall we go eat?

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,290
- Sure.
- All right.

72
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,910
Why do all gambling houses
look so gloomy?

73
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,180
Do you expect them to gamble
where there's plenty of...

74
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,480
sunshine, a terrace,
and a nice view?

75
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,019
You should read at such a place.

76
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,720
What are the bestsellers these days?

77
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,720
Bestsellers, my foot.

78
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,790
Who are you? Leave.

79
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,230
We should've at least
listened to them.

80
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,769
We're going with
the blitz tactic from now on.

81
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,600
Anyone who knows Kim Bu Gi here!

82
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,149
Who are you?

83
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,079
And what is a priest doing here?

84
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:20,319
None of your business. We're here
to take back what you've stolen.

85
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,250
Are you cops?

86
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,259
No, we're half-priest-half-cop.

87
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,029
Half what?

88
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,829
What are you blabbering?

89
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,600
Are you lumberjacks?
Why are you carrying axes?

90
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,009
Do you even know who I am?

91
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,839
No, and we don't care.

92
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,209
I'm...

93
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,709
the Horse Head of Daegwallyeong.

94
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,290
I'm so sorry.
But what kind of a nickname is that?

95
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:00,860
Then I'm the Cow Head of Hoengseong.

96
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,500
Boys.

97
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:08,399
Make sure you cut them up nicely.

98
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,800
Got it?

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,269
Can't you just let me sleep?

100
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,110
Darn it.

101
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,149
Can't you just talk
instead of fighting?

102
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,920
You scumbags.

103
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,120
I'm sorry, boss.
But those punks were...

104
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,490
Shut it.

105
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,829
I'm Oh Kwang Du of Suncheon.

106
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,470
How may I help you?

107
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,279
We just need those files.

108
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,279
Expect a bloodshed
if you refuse to hand them over.

109
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,550
You are...

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,009
quite rude, Father.

111
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,550
I don't need to be polite.

112
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,089
Hey, Father. You don't know anything
about gambling houses, do you?

113
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,990
Even if an army raided this place,

114
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,589
they wouldn't retrieve
any money lost.

115
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,060
They hide...

116
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,930
their money in a place
no one can find.

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,269
We have rules.

118
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:18,600
If you want to retrieve them,

119
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,709
gamble.

120
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,180
Is my opponent that Horse Head
of Pyeongchang?

121
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,709
It's Daegwallyeong.

122
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,480
What's the difference?

123
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,579
No.

124
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,620
You're up against me.

125
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,990
I took it from that accountant.

126
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,659
Can't we just get a search warrant
and raid the place?

127
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,830
You've never been
to a gambling house, have you?

128
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,429
They're like dogs.

129
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,100
They can sniff out the cops
and flee the place in a minute.

130
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,299
We'll only catch the small fry.

131
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,610
Are those files the only
crucial evidence we have?

132
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,679
That's the only way we can catch
Superintendent Nam.

133
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:02,309
Where can we find
a gambling candidate?

134
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,220
Should I ask the investigation team
specializing in gambling?

135
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,250
Forget it.

136
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,649
The one who got caught
is only small fries.

137
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,690
What's the boss' name again?

138
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,059
The Horse Head of Daegwallyeong.

139
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,799
That guy has a boss too.

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,029
It's Oh Kwang Du of Suncheon.

141
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,210
What?

142
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,309
- What was his name again?
- Oh Kwang Du of Suncheon.

143
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,149
Do you know him?

144
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,059
No. It's just that he has
a similar name to someone I know.

145
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,090
Sister, your finger.

146
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,590
- Oh, no.
- My goodness. Silly me.

147
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:52,129
You should've been careful.

148
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:54,299
I know. Excuse me for a minute.

149
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,879
Lord.

150
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,019
Please don't make me
commit a sin again.

151
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:18,919
I'll be at the station.

152
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,230
- Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,470
I finally remembered
who that sister was.

154
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,240
Who is she?

155
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,870
20 years ago, a body came in.

156
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,509
It was a young man
who was stabbed while gambling.

157
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,580
And that man's older sister was her.

158
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,220
Her real name is
Kim In Gyeong, right?

159
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:51,789
She cried so much
and blamed herself.

160
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:03,230
Get up. I'm sorry.

161
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,470
And I found out later...

162
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,070
that Kim In Gyeong, the nun,

163
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,179
was also called
10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek.

164
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,679
She was a notorious gambler.

165
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,350
"10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek"?

166
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,289
Sir, could you look up
a past gambler named...

167
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,659
10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek?

168
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,159
What?

169
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,500
What did you just say?

170
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,169
Lady "10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek"?

171
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,730
"Lady"?

172
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,840
Yes.
Lady 10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek...

173
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,909
was not just a gambler.

174
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,480
She was the one and only
female gambler...

175
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,750
in all of Korean gambling history.

176
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,220
She's like the Joan of Arc
of gambling.

177
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,820
"Joan of Arc of gambling"?
Oh, please.

178
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,149
Go on.

179
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,720
20 years ago,

180
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,990
there were three notorious gamblers
in Korea.

181
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,059
Oh Kwang Du of Suncheon.

182
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:05,730
The Flounder of Masan.

183
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,830
(Flounder of Masan)

184
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,029
And the 10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek.

185
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,340
Legend says,

186
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,769
she hides her cards
under her 10th tail,

187
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:16,340
thus her nickname, 10-Tailed Fox,

188
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,509
not nine-tailed fox.

189
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,950
Can you stop exaggerating?

190
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,919
Anyway, these three gamblers...

191
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,490
had their first
and last game together.

192
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,389
Once the police found out,

193
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,419
they focused all their manpower
on apprehending them.

194
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,590
Jongno 4-ga, which was
the assumed place of gambling,

195
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,429
was completely surrounded.

196
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,200
It was a state of emergency
because of these three gamblers.

197
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,100
All the gamblers were desperate...

198
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,940
to witness this sight
and gathered together.

199
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,940
How did it end?

200
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,980
(Double nine)

201
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,149
(3-8 kwangs)

202
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:02,950
It was her complete victory.

203
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,720
- Okay.
- And on that day,

204
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,389
Oh Kwang Du and the flounder were
caught by the police,

205
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,090
but 10-Tailed Fox...

206
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,399
disappeared like smoke.

207
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,240
And she hasn't come back
til this day.

208
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,940
That's what Mr. Park told me.

209
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,710
That's it then. Isn't that enough?

210
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,610
You're not trying to
turn a nun into a gambler, are you?

211
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:32,179
Yes, she just needs to win.

212
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,019
Then she'll earn some helpful men,

213
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,820
and we'll be able to arrest Mr. Nam.

214
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,419
She left the secular world
because of those things.

215
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,320
And you're going to ask her
to gamble?

216
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,490
My gosh.

217
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,259
I still punch people even though
I left the secular world.

218
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,460
She might not feel
the same way as you.

219
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,000
Her situation and position
are different.

220
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,169
That's true. I missed that part.

221
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:57,269
You're quite thoughtful today,
Ms. Park.

222
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,549
What? You think of me
as some teenager? Come on.

223
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,950
That hurt my pride.

224
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,679
What's there to hurt?

225
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,750
Why can't she just play it
and win the game?

226
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,620
It'd be so simple then.

227
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,019
You're like a magician,

228
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,490
so you should talk to her.

229
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,690
"A magician"?
That was out of the blue.

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,360
I mean,

231
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,029
to some,
you might be like a magician.

232
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,269
I wish I could be a magician.

233
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,210
What should we do about that?
I'm getting a headache.

234
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:34,850
Hello, sir.

235
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,519
I'm Hwang Cheol Bum
who used to work in Yeosu.

236
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,120
It's an honor to meet you.

237
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:45,919
I heard a lot of good things
from Man Woo.

238
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,289
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,299
I'm sorry to interrupt your meal.

240
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,769
Gosh, I have so many visitors today.

241
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,039
And...

242
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,340
you must be here
because of the files also.

243
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,779
This is driving me crazy.

244
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,419
How did she win the best gambler
of the nation?

245
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,250
Can't we just destroy them all?

246
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,419
Then those in
Suncheon, Yeosu, and Gwangyang...

247
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,919
will join in for sure.

248
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,629
But we'll have to face them,
so look for some players.

249
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Yes, sir.

250
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,409
(Who owns Rising Moon?)

251
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,450
What's this?

252
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,149
What are all these?

253
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,990
Gosh, why are these here?

254
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:01,899
Yes, Mr. Park.

255
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm on my way. Yes.

256
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,299
Yes, see you soon.

257
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,549
So those accounting documents
are crucial evidence?

258
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,779
I think that's the only one
that can help us arrest Mr. Nam.

259
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,529
Are you still up?

260
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,389
Hi, Father Kim.

261
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,830
What are you doing late at night?

262
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:36,769
You must be concerned.

263
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,639
What are you worried about?

264
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,139
I'm just...

265
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,970
thinking about many things.

266
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,950
You must be disturbed
because of Oh Kwang Du.

267
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,289
So you got to know about it.

268
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,820
I knew this would happen.
I knew it!

269
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,330
My gosh, no wonder
I was so anxious!

270
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,299
I didn't recognize you because
you were wearing a mask.

271
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,700
My gosh, what do I do about this?

272
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,299
Please calm down. It's okay.

273
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,339
How much do you know?

274
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,009
I didn't hear a lot.

275
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,380
I heard about your brother,
and how you were...

276
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,289
a famous gambler called
10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek.

277
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,289
That means you know everything!

278
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,259
My gosh, what do I do about this?

279
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,029
Why did I bring tea then?

280
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
My gosh.

281
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,230
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

282
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,599
I didn't mean it at all.

283
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,140
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:52,609
I guess it can't be kept as a secret
since you know it all.

285
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,480
You actually...

286
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,619
want me to face Oh Kwang Du, right?

287
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:04,789
Frankly speaking,

288
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,359
yes.

289
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,230
I'd love to,

290
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:12,859
but it's not easy.

291
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:16,529
Of course not. I know that.

292
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,200
My brother wanted
to become a gambler...

293
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,769
just like me and got himself killed.

294
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,809
My petty talent killed my brother.

295
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:29,710
And he was killed by...

296
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,779
Oh Kwang Du's men.

297
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,490
It was in the evening of the day
I beat Oh Kwang Du.

298
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,019
That means he did that
out of grudge?

299
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,960
That little jerk.

300
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,299
Then he should get on
the bus to hell as well.

301
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,430
I'll help him get on it.

302
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:51,099
I'll send him to your brother...

303
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,200
I mean, since I know where he is...

304
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,509
Just ask me.

305
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,740
Well, because of many reasons,

306
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,250
it's difficult for me...

307
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,119
to start gambling again.

308
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,950
I don't want to have...

309
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,319
any unnecessary hatred or grudges.
That's my concern.

310
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,420
I'm sorry,

311
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,730
I must've thought of it too easily.

312
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:19,960
No, it's fine.

313
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,900
I also want Mr. Nam...

314
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,039
to be punished
as soon as possible.

315
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,170
He should.

316
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:30,740
For me, because of my talents,

317
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,980
many others were harmed.

318
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,450
That was a long ago.

319
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:41,289
I was given a talent in fighting
by the Lord.

320
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,559
But it was too good to be wasted.

321
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,630
I know how people are criticizing.

322
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,359
I know they complain
about me for fighting.

323
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,400
But that's not
important for me.

324
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,470
What's important for me...

325
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,140
is to make people...

326
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:03,710
live in a society
where the basic justice is realized.

327
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:10,279
That's why I've been like this.

328
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,920
If you're contemplating,
please consider...

329
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,559
my thinking a lot.

330
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:30,029
Now I finally see...

331
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,099
why Father Lee...

332
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,339
loved you so much.

333
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:54,289
Father.

334
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,759
Sister Kim and I had to face...

335
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,599
the ultimate truth today.

336
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,339
And those were our darkest secrets
that we wanted to hide.

337
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,079
But I was less scared today.

338
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,079
I felt as though I could
share my burden with her.

339
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,390
And, I'm fine now,
so please tell the Lord...

340
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,059
to stop asking her...

341
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:36,000
to take care of me.

342
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:43,210
Is that true?

343
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,180
Please act like you don't know
in front of Sister Kim.

344
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,380
I can't believe it.

345
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,680
It was 50 times more shocking...

346
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,849
than the fact that you were
a child actor Han Woo Ram.

347
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:57,420
I guess so.

348
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,130
She doesn't want to return, right?

349
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:06,099
I think so.

350
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,369
No matter how urgent
the situation is,

351
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:11,500
I don't want to force
or push her to do it.

352
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,869
No matter what decision she makes,

353
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,839
I'll follow it.

354
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,990
Gosh. What do I do? What do I do?

355
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,390
We don't have much time.

356
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,160
Hwang Cheol Bum must've
made his move already.

357
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,859
This is driving me crazy.
What do I do?

358
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
I've never felt like this
in a long time. It's thrilling.

359
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Gosh, we seriously
don't have much time.

360
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,279
My gosh, why is it raining?

361
00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:00,920
Oh, my gosh. My gosh!

362
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,819
What do I do?

363
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,769
Thank you.

364
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,799
Bright...

365
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,730
The Bright Card.

366
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:01,440
Lord!

367
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:04,049
The Bright Card!

368
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,750
Lord!

369
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,319
Father Kim, Father Kim.

370
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,460
I'll do it.

371
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,490
I'll play the game.

372
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:23,099
What's with your reactions?

373
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:30,069
But I have somewhere
to go to first.

374
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:41,519
So you're saying
you'll get involved with it again?

375
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:47,460
Head Nun, it's like a mission
to catch the evil one.

376
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,029
That's right.
It's like catching Satan.

377
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:53,099
Fathers, please keep quiet.

378
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,369
Even if I compromise,

379
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:59,539
it's not regarding someone's life.

380
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,769
I don't think the situation
is that desperate.

381
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:07,339
Right, it's not that desperate.

382
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,680
But it's to make the world just.

383
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,619
I know my talents are petty,

384
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:17,150
but I want to be a part of making
this world a better place.

385
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,960
I'll give up the Lord's way
just this time.

386
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,529
Sister Kim thought hard
to make this decision.

387
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,359
Please give her your permission.

388
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,329
We'll help her as one.

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,039
I'll do it even if you
don't allow me to.

390
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,779
However, I will face any punishment.

391
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,529
Come with me somewhere.

392
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,759
- Where?
- You'll know when we get there.

393
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,740
The game will start at 8pm tonight.

394
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,440
The ones who wins 2 rounds
out of 3 will be the final winner.

395
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:15,849
Are you the professional?

396
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,349
Right. Please say hello.

397
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm Lee Seok Sa of Ssangmun-dong.

398
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,089
Is there no one from
the priest's side joining us?

399
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,059
I guess they don't have anyone
to play.

400
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,660
Then...

401
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,670
I'll pay you with cash.

402
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,730
Forget it.

403
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,440
If you cause a fuss
or call the police...

404
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
during the game,

405
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,150
then I'll destroy
the files right away.

406
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,210
Got that?

407
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:53,579
Yes, sir.

408
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,759
Who is it?

409
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,029
10-Tailed Fox of Pyeongtaek.

410
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,099
Who?

411
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,240
You know what "have your cake
and eat it" means, right?

412
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,539
Yes, it's like a win-win situation.

413
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,309
- Catching 2 pigeons with 1 bean.
- To kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

414
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,640
Okay, let's try that one again.

415
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,190
I'm so busy handing out leaflets.

416
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,990
- What's going on?
- You can stop with that now.

417
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,430
There's a way our team
can get back to work.

418
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,490
What is it?

419
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:48,769
(Daebum Trading)

420
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,750
Hello, sir.

421
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,980
Loosen up. Let's start afresh.

422
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,359
Is Ms. Park going in as well?

423
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,519
Yes.

424
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:09,859
You don't seem happy about it.

425
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,799
This must be it.

426
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,609
This is what you've been doing.

427
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,410
Mr. Lee.

428
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,509
(The Fiery Priest)

429
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,380
What will you give if you lose?

430
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,950
It seems like there's something
particular you want.

431
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,220
If I lose...

432
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,450
- Let's go, Sister Kim.
- It's fine.

433
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,589
(A battle to get
the most precious item)

434
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,890
Let's start the game then.

435
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,190
I'll get punished in your place.

436
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,430
We've never worked properly
when we were paid.

437
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,299
It's so nice to use your talent
in the right place.

438
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,730
- Let's get it, baby.
- Yes.

439
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,930
(What's most precious to you?)

440
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,539
We must reinvestigate
the case and find out the truth.

441
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,599
Please report it.

442
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,099
That's over already.

443
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,640
How can you just let him go?

444
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,210
You always part
when you meet someone.

445
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,809
I'm going to solve everything
in two weeks...

446
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,309
and leave on my own.
