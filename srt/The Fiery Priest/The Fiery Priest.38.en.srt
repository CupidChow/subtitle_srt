(Episode 38)

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,980
Lee Joong Kwon.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,410
He'll flee abroad soon,

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,750
and he won't use dangerous options
like smuggling.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,750
The most natural
and familiar method...

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,250
He'll leave the country by using
a fake passport.

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,320
(Subjects for
fake passport inspection)

8
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:22,190
But he wouldn't have visited
who's on the inspection's list.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,460
Then it should be someone
who isn't on the list.

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:31,039
You would get so many women
with that look.

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,070
Why did you come
to see a matchmaker?

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,909
I don't need a wife.

13
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,810
My goodness. You're handsome,
but you speak rudely.

14
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:42,579
That makes you more charming.

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,750
I heard that this place makes
most of the fake passports.

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,689
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,890
Mr. Kim!

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,490
I'm sorry, but Mr. Kim...

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,890
fall asleep because his back
has been broken.

20
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,700
You're a police officer, aren't you?

21
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,980
Exclude all of these people
on the list.

22
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,540
Tell me everyone else you know.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,250
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

24
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,750
It's a trade secret.

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,390
I'm sorry to say this
when we've just met,

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,890
but don't tell me
that it's a secret ever again.

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,370
You being dead below ground
could be a secret forever.

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,670
There are
three fake passport sellers...

29
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,269
that aren't on the list.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,030

31
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,750
(Adult shop)

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,560
(Na Il Kwon)

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,229
Who are you?

34
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:40,400
(We buy used cars at a high price.)

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,069
Until when did you promise
Lee Joong Kwon his fake passport?

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,479
5, 4, 3, 2...

37
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,210
Tonight. It's tonight.

38
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,710
Is he alone, or are there
three more people?

39
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,310
There are three more people.

40
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,680
I'll give you another time
and location.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,490
Tell Lee Joong Kwon to come there.
Do you understand?

42
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,789
3, 2...

43
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:06,789
Okay.

44
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,180
Now, we must rely on
his will to live...

45
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,139
and hope for a miracle.

46
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,349
(Father Kim, please check
the video file I've sent.)

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,659
(Mount Youngyu
Wildlife Management CCTV)

48
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,879
You killed Father Lee, and now
you're talking about the truth?

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,379
I didn't kill him.

50
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:07,849
What?

51
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,150
I said I didn't kill him.

52
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,629
- Father Kim checked my message!
- When?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,529
I checked every 10 minutes,
so less than 10 minutes ago.

54
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,529
- Track him.
- Okay.

55
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,620
Boss, Jang Ryong has been arrested.

56
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,529
Why are you telling me this now?

57
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,160
- I didn't want you to worry.
- Does that matter right now?

58
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,800
We could be falsely accused of this.

59
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,000
And that will be the end for him.

60
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,600
You should hurry up and lie low.

61
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,339
- Okay.
- We should never get caught.

62
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,040
- What will you do?
- Don't mind me and go.

63
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,350
Darn it.

64
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,600
You should at least say hi.

65
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,740
Why bother when I'm going
to kill you?

66
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,769
Why?

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,610
Do you think I killed Father Lee?

68
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:37,379
I told you that I didn't kill him.

69
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,810
Even if you didn't kill Father Lee,

70
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,279
nothing will change.

71
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,620
You tampered with his body
and defamed him.

72
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,149
You killed Dae Young's subordinate
and threatened his family.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,759
These two reasons alone...

74
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,290
are enough for you to die.

75
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,800
You're right.

76
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,699
But...

77
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,509
if I repent, aren't I forgiven?

78
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,110
"Forgiven"?

79
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,750
Forgiveness is only for humans.

80
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,350
Are you saying that I'm not human?

81
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:17,550
And I don't offer lousy forgiveness.

82
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,350
Because that's exactly why
this world has been tainted.

83
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,149
Perhaps, it's because
you're a violent priest,

84
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,290
your philosophy is one of a kind.

85
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,660
The reason why I had let you live...

86
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,860
was because of the two priests
who begged me to be patient.

87
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,269
But now, I have no more reason
to do that.

88
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:40,269
Is it really necessary...

89
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,939
for a priest to have blood
on his hands?

90
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,910
If the world was righteous,

91
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,209
I'd have no reason
to dirty my hands.

92
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,920
Fine. I understand.

93
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,689
But shouldn't you know about
how Father Lee died?

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm neither asking you
to trust me...

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,329
nor trying to get away with it.

96
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,199
I just think it's unfair for me
to take all the blame.

97
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,199
That's why.

98
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,269
You know well...

99
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,139
that I had pestered him every day
regarding the foundation, right?

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,170
But things got complicated.

101
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,879
Today, I'll persuade Father myself.

102
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,410
Sorry?

103
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,279
You won't cut it.

104
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:26,379
But then again, he took you in
when you were young,

105
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,550
so you must have a soft spot
for him no matter what, right?

106
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,360
Sir, I'll take care of it.
Please give me one more...

107
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,790
Bring him here right now.

108
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,629
- Sir.
- Now!

109
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,910
Please sign the Withdrawal
Agreement for the Foundation...

110
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,449
before you leave today.

111
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:58,819
(Withdrawal Agreement
for the Foundation)

112
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,620
I'll give you whatever you want.

113
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,319
(Withdrawal Agreement
for the Foundation)

114
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,629
I can't do that, Cheol Bum.

115
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,889
Father Lee.

116
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,360
This is your last chance.

117
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,399
I don't know what you'll do
with the orphanage,

118
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,470
but I do know one thing.

119
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,170
You'll do something that will
go against what the Lord desires.

120
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,540
I could've been more aggressive,

121
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,810
but since it's you,

122
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,509
I'm giving you a chance.

123
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,810
Why can't you understand?

124
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:32,379
I am grateful for that.

125
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,090
However, could you show
your kindness in another way?

126
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,259
Father.

127
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,299
You took me in when I was a boy
and raised me like your own son.

128
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,529
Please help me out.

129
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,169
I'm refusing to do so
because you're like my son.

130
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want you to walk down
the wrong path.

131
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,440
Father.

132
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:57,379
Mr. Hwang, bring him in.

133
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,009
Is there someone else here?

134
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,789
Sit down, please.

135
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,220
It's okay.
I'll talk to you like this.

136
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,600
As I know, Mr. Hwang has been
talked to you about it often.

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,029
That's correct.

138
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Then I don't need to explain myself.

139
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,940
It seems like you're the boss here.

140
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,269
However,
nothing will change my mind.

141
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,750
Then should I try something else?

142
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,259
You know them well.

143
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,460
I believe you're very close.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

145
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,970
What about them?

146
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,639
If perhaps...

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,610
the church caught fire
and everyone inside burned to death,

148
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:06,580
would they be considered martyrs?

149
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,049
How... How...

150
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Their lives depend on your decision.

151
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,649
What will you do?

152
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,820
How terrible of you
to say such a thing!

153
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,190
Oh, my.

154
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,730
You talk quite harshly for a priest.

155
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:32,000
How dare you?

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,039
You're more evil than Satan himself!

157
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,379
How could you think so lightly
of such precious lives?

158
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,110
I will never forgive you,
let alone the Lord!

159
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,580
Calm down, Father!

160
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,450
- Let him be. Let him.
- Father!

161
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,049
You crazy geezer.

162
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,919
How dare you?

163
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,539
Father?

164
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,009
Father... Father?

165
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,350
Please wake up.

166
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,159
Darn it.

167
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,159
Hoon Seok.

168
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,860
Hoon Seok!

169
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,830
Yes, sir?

170
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,960
Gosh...

171
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,240
- Call... Call 911.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,509
Are you insane?

173
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,679
911?
What are you going to tell them?

174
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,809
Do you want the world to know
about this?

175
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,950
How could this happen?

176
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,250
Take care of it.

177
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,250
Wrap it up as the way you thugs do!

178
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,409
Darn it.

179
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,320
- Jang Ryong.
- Yes, sir?

180
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,129
Call one of your trusty men...

181
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,629
and take him with you.

182
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,330
- You want me to do it?
- And don't be seen.

183
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,309
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,029
Take full responsibility
for what happened today.

185
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,570
- What?
- It probably won't happen,

186
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:19,940
but if this gets disclosed,
I'll do my best to help.

187
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,669
Chief Prosecutor Kang...

188
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,269
I'm sure it's hard to accept this.

189
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,340
But you should.

190
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,779
Do you know why?

191
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,909
If the prosecution finds out
about this,

192
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,049
do you think they will arrest me,
an incumbent prosecutor,

193
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,250
or you, a thug?

194
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,590
That's not all.

195
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,460
I'm going to throw
all of your men,

196
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,090
whom you cherish so dearly,
in prison,

197
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,090
and let them rot in there.

198
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,769
Even more, I'm going to make sure...

199
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,570
their own families starve to death.

200
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,610
Would you rather accept my offer
and live a prosperous life...

201
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,450
or wage war with me
until one of us dies?

202
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,059
I'll consider that...

203
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,070
you've agreed.

204
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,149
Darn it!

205
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,360
That was it?

206
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,059
But you knew...

207
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,730
that he was alive until
he was carried to Mount Youngyu.

208
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,629
So how could you be indifferent?

209
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,000
The man who took you in
and raised you like his own son...

210
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,409
was dying in front of your eyes!

211
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,879
You're right. I didn't feel a thing.

212
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,879
Saving my own men
was more important to me.

213
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,049
He was good as dead,
and I had to take care of my men.

214
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,820
I built Daebum Trading
from the bottom up.

215
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,149
Yes.

216
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,460
You're a worthless piece of garbage.

217
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,169
I felt so indifferent
that it surprised me.

218
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,909
Do you know why?

219
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:42,149
There are things that can be
forgiven and things that cannot be.

220
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:44,250
I only do the latter.

221
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,820
And I'll keep living that life.

222
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,620
So quit your nonsense.

223
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,720
If you don't want to take
all the blame,

224
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,029
turn yourself in.

225
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:56,090
And then, what?

226
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,259
If Chief Prosecutor Kang decides
to put all the blame on me,

227
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,500
then that's the end.

228
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,799
There's no way out for me.

229
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,070
I'll take care of him,
so go turn yourself in.

230
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:09,370
No.

231
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:13,539
I'm going to get Lee Joong Kwon
and make him confess.

232
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,009
He's the only witness...

233
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,679
apart from Chief Prosecutor Kang
and me.

234
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,250
If you won't turn yourself in,
I'll have to kill you right now.

235
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,289
I have a favor.

236
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,230
I have my own truth
that needs to be uncovered,

237
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,159
so give me some time.

238
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,240
Boss.

239
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,599
Is this really necessary?

240
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,470
I can't believe
he ordered me to do this.

241
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,089
Boss!

242
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,809
1, 2, 3.

243
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,720
I didn't kill him.

244
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:02,990
I just obeyed the order, okay?

245
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,690
I just obeyed.

246
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,390
I...

247
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:09,960
I didn't kill him.

248
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,690
Hello, Father Kim.

250
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,960
- Just leave.
- Come on.

251
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,299
Why should I?

252
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,069
I know...

253
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,769
what you'll do.

254
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,910
We promised to work together
until the end.

255
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,480
You need to keep your word.

256
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,210
That's over.

257
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,880
Father Lee's case is not over yet.

258
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,049
It's over. So leave.

259
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,690
Until we handcuff the murderers,
we're not done.

260
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,119
I'll take care of it.

261
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,930
Why are you acting this way?

262
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:20,359
Will killing Lee Joong Kwon
change anything?

263
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,029
Why do you help others
return to their peaceful places...

264
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,769
while you try to return
to a painful place?

265
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,180
I'm not returning anywhere.
I was always in that place.

266
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,250
No, you are not.

267
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,190
The place you need to be
is at Gudam Church...

268
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,490
and in front of us.

269
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,789
If something happens to you,

270
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,130
we'll have to live with that
our entire lives.

271
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,400
What am I to you?
Just forget about me.

272
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,839
You really don't know
how much you mean to us?

273
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,640
If it wasn't for you,

274
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,150
we'd all be sent to the inferno.

275
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,380
We'd have to live the same lives
over again.

276
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:13,819
It'd be a neverending cycle.

277
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:17,619
So how could you say that?

278
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:24,359
No, I should go with you.

279
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,130
You can't go anywhere. Ever.

280
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,670
Just stay there.

281
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,240
No. You can't go.

282
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,660
Take care of Sister Kim.

283
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:00,900
Father Kim.

284
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,170
You always did the right thing.

285
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,240
So no matter how much
I got injured while helping you,

286
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,950
I was always happy.

287
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,849
But why are you doing this?

288
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,349
This isn't about
what's right and wrong.

289
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,390
This is something
I must do by myself.

290
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,910
You might not hear this,

291
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,539
but I'll leave a message, Father.

292
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,549
I learned something as a prosecutor.

293
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,950
The evil of this world
has no eyes or ears.

294
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,890
They don't care who the target is.

295
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,230
No matter how you
scream and ask why it's you,

296
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,859
it never answers.

297
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
What I want to tell you is,

298
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:16,269
all these bad things
aren't happening because of you.

299
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,609
They're just happening.

300
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,480
So...

301
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,049
don't blame yourself too much.

302
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,480
Okay?

303
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,720
How could you suddenly change
the location?

304
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,960
You want me to come
to the address you've sent me?

305
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,660
Isn't it too far?

306
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,730
Okay.

307
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,829
This doesn't feel right.

308
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,839
Are we getting our passports
at another location?

309
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,339
Hey.

310
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,170
Gather some men
who are good at fighting.

311
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,640
Are you there?

312
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
Detective?

313
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,579
Are you all right?

314
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,049
Are you there? Answer me.

315
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,720
Dae Young, I got a message
from Father Kim.

316
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,779
Give me that.

317
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,190
Everything will be over soon.

318
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,220
Please come,
and take care of the rest.

319
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,900
Ms. Park, please finish
the rest of the investigation.

320
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,569
And please make sure...

321
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,740
to achieve the Lord's justice.

322
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,390
You made it.

323
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:40,299
I visited her
and brought her myself.

324
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,869
I think this is the best option
to make a deal with you.

325
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,380
Did you bring the passport?

326
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,720
Here.

327
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,220
It's your passport to the abyss.

328
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,930
(Passport)

329
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,730
Take it if you can.

330
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:07,329
You must've
brought yours too, right?

331
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,589
(The Fiery Priest)

332
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,960
We'll never blame you
even if they kill all of us!

333
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,799
So pull yourself together
and fight with confidence!

334
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,430
(I heard your prayers.)

335
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,130
Why must you resign
because of this person?

336
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,099
Let's just stay together
like the old days.

337
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:54,240
You must stay at the church.

338
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,109
(I saw your tears.)

339
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,910
Thanks for coming, my friend.

340
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,880
I hope you reflect on yourself
and come out.

341
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,079
We're working together just like
how we did in the beginning.

342
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
(My Sin)

343
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,250
Good job. You're cool,
Park Kyeong Seon.

344
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,690
(Now, I'll heal you.)

345
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,690
Thank you for leading me.

346
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,259
Thank you for living...

347
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,660
by the Lord's words.
