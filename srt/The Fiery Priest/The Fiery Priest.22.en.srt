1
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,280
He syncs the thief's face
by 90 percent.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,380
The thief was Father Kim.

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,580
What are you doing?

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,589
My ramyeon has gone soggy.

5
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,129
Why on earth did he go to the villa?

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,800
And who was that Bigfoot?

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,539
Who on earth is he?

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,969
I'm so stressed!

9
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:36,909
We'll sing a song from today.

10
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:38,439
Follow after me.

11
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:40,950
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,979
Begin.

13
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,320
A, B, C, D...

14
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,590
- A, B, C, D...
- A, B...

15
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,750
Wrong.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,820
Let's do it again. One more time.

17
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,600
What's up with your eyes?

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,799
I sense danger from your eyes.

19
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,310
Oh, gosh. There must be
something in my eyes.

20
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:20,150
Even if something's in your eyes,
you shouldn't look at me like that.

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,189
Hey!

22
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,219
Who is it?

23
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,700
- Was that you?
- Yes.

24
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,599
Could you let me
have a meal calmly, please?

25
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,239
Gosh, these thugs.

26
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,469
You look lowly.

27
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,239
Lowly?

28
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,510
He knows how to insult people.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,180
He's even good at it.

30
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,719
You...

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,620
I think you should say goodbye
to your scapulas...

32
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,590
because I'm going to crush them.

33
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:00,859
My scapulas?
Bye.

34
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,859
Is that enough?

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,500
I dare you to crush them!

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,669
Step back.

38
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,610
I'm Kim Hoon Seok, and I'm here to
pick you up on Mr. Hwang's behalf.

39
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,150
You look neat.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,349
Get rid of these guys.

41
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,719
You just couldn't wait, could you?

42
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,229
Goodness,
you were already here, Mr. Jang?

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,099
What are you doing in
a Chinese restaurant, Master Ki?

44
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,229
We can get enlightened
through chunjang as well.

45
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,400
Ukha.

46
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,639
Your faces are all ruined.

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,180
Shall we have a drink?
Let's have Baijiu to be enlightened.

48
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,479
- Would you like that?
- Sure.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,379
"Baiju to be enlightened."

50
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,319
Let's go. I'll serve you.

51
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,189
Hey, turn off the lights.

52
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,340
Kim Hae Il,
you haven't changed at all.

53
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,459
Men can succeed...

54
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,500
if they have money, courage,

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,769
and someone to back them up.

56
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,970
What do you have?

57
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,839
I lack all three.

58
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,540
You have the money and the guts.

59
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:32,379
But you don't have
the right support.

60
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,009
That's why you're always
looked down on.

61
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
You're right.

62
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,990
This is your chance to have
the right support.

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,259
Your target is
Congressman Park Won Mu.

64
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,389
Does that mean...

65
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,029
you and the chief of borough
finally made a decision?

66
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,259
Yes.

67
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,029
Get rid of him the same way
you did with Father Lee.

68
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,839
Let's say that after being
interrogated by the prosecutors,

69
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,769
the congressman couldn't take it
and jumped off his building.

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,639
I know I've disappointed you
often lately.

71
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,550
Let's make up,

72
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,019
and start anew.

73
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,189
"Start anew"?

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,529
I'd like that, you dirtbag.

That's not how you pronounce it.

78
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,879
Its pronunciation isn't
important right now.

79
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,689
I've brought some news.

80
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:53,420
That guy told me this
while we were drinking.

81
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,129
There's something
I haven't told you.

82

Our...

83
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,699
If you go to the basement
of Daebum Trading,

84
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,569
if four people... Got it?
If four people stamp their thumbs,

85
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,410
a big door opens up.

86
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,449
And inside,
there's a pile of money this big.

87
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,420
Really?

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,180
I heard him as well.

89
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,149
He said it's an uncountable amount.

90
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,790
Think about it. They all buried
all that money there.

91
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,589
Imagine if they all disappeared.

92
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,259
Whoever...

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,930
gets hold of that money
is the owner.

94
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,000
There's Hwang Cheol Bum.

95
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,439
What if he disappears as well?

96
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,350
If I and my brain full
of enlightenment join hands...

97
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,120
with you and your power,

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,649

Aren't you intrigued?

- Ukha.

If we can unlock this,

102
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,209
we will be able to do
whatever we want.

103
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,110
Right support?

104
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,509
This is the true support
that we need.

105
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,980
- Aren't I right?
- Yes, you are.

106
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,889

about this sooner?

to kill Congressman Park?

do I have to repeat?

That jerk irked me,
so it's all good, don't you think?

You're right.

we'll all be dead meat.

will become a whistle-blower.

168

killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

their backs against Jeong Dong Ja,

Every time he climbs up that fridge,
he doesn't want to come down.

183
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,120
- He'll ferment.
- Listen up.

184
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,730
- Song Sac.
- Yes, Father?

185
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,600
Will you be all right?
You told us about this.

186
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,870
Don't worry.

187
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,879
About what I told you,

188
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,409
I don't...

189
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,379
I don't regret it.

190
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,279
Still, you must be afraid that
they'll do something to you.

191
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,149
To be honest,

192
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,360
I am scared.

193
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,830
But...

194
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,230
if we can catch those jerks
who killed Father Lee,

195
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,299
I'm okay.

196
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,370
Father.

197
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,139
I thought people
who got angry were fools.

198
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,980
But now,
I'm going to show my anger too.

199
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm... I'm going to become a fool.

200
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,990
All right.

201
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,590
Father Lee would've been
proud of you.

202
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,870
Welcome.

203
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,679
Are you going to use this?

204
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,889
I brought dumplings.

205
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,059
You didn't even call me
after what happened last time.

206
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,730
Do you think those dumplings
will make up for it?

207
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,669
I'm sorry, Yo Han.
I was wrong.

208
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Forget it.

209
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm a fool, so be friends
with people who are smart.

210
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:55,710
No, you're not a fool.

211
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,279
You are my only friend.

212
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,980
I love you, Yo Han.

213
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:04,950
Whatever.

214
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,080
Gosh.

215
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,919
How could you get angry
with your one and only friend?

216
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,690
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,029
Give me those dumplings, you punk.

218
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,830
Yo Han...

219
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,870
Have them all, you pig.

220
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,509
Why would you upset me again?
I feel...

221
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,950
- Is it good?
- It is.

222
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,919
That's enough.

223
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,519
Don't cry.

224
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,029
Do we have enough proof
to bring down...

225
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,629
both Park Won Mu and Nam Seok Gu?

226
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,659
Yes, sir. There's more than enough.

227
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,200
Then go to meet Park this evening...

228
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,299
and let him know.

229
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,139
Weren't you going to indict him?

230
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:03,210
Still, we were a family once.

231
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,740
He deserves a chance to repent.

232
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,350
Tell him I won't indict him
if he corrects and kneels...

233
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,879
for what he did to
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office...

234
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,450
and the Ministry of Justice.

235
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,649
Yes, sir.

236
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,289
What should I tell him after that?

237
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,019
That'll be enough for now.

238
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,720
Yes, sir.

239
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,590
Oh, right.

240
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,200
Do understand...

241
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,330
if a mess occurs later on.

242
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,340
"A mess", sir?

243
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,700
It's nothing.

244
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:34,440
You'll find out later.

245
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,610
Yes, sir.

246
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,490
How dare a prosecutor
order me around?

247
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:51,220
I know I'm rude.
That's why I ordered you around.

248
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:53,159
You impudent wench!

249
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,690
Stop swearing and listen.

250
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,899
Recording of your bribing a caddie
who was a victim of abuse.

251
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,070
Black box footage of your sexually
harassing your secretary.

252
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:05,100
Recording of your accepting
illegal campaign fund and so on.

253
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,639
Why do I have
all this precious evidence?

254
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
How odd.

255
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,809
What do you want?

256
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,210
I want to talk to you, sir.

257
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:21,850
(Charges of Solicitation
by Superintendent Nam Seok Gu)

258
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,889
On top of those documents,
we have videos and tape-recordings.

259
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,929
You're not going to disclose these,
are you?

260
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,759
Judging by what you
and Congressman Park did,

261
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,929
it's only right for us
to do exactly that.

262
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,830
Don't you think so?

263
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,139
As long as you
wholeheartedly repent.

264
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,539
I... I didn't do anything.

265
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,610
Congressman Park did them all.

266
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:48,710
How can I wholeheartedly repent?

267
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
First, turn a blind eye
to anything that'll happen...

268
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
today.

269
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,919
Turn off your phone...

270
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,990
and go somewhere quiet.
Perhaps, a sauna.

271
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,680
What? Why is she here?

272
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
All right.

273
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,029
Got it.

274
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,059
- Mr. Lee!
- What?

275
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,970
I just received an anonymous call.

276
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,000
Someone is planning to terrorize
Congressman Park Won Mu!

277
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:19,569
What?

278
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:23,009
They're currently passing
the Gudam Intersection.

279
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,480
What is this?

280
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,339
Are you certain?

281
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,349
- Get ready.
- Sorry?

282
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,779
Get ready.

283
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,619
What does
Chief Prosecutor Kang want?

284
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,019
You know already.

285
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,660
Correct what you did to
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office...

286
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,819
and the Ministry of Justice.

287
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:44,559
And kneel in front of him
and the chief of borough.

288
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,359
What? "Kneel"?

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,630
You're not suffering
from arthritis, are you?

290
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,539
Then you might as well do it.

291
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,700
How dare you?

292
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:04,210
Why isn't
Superintendent Nam answering?

293
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,579
We need to tell Chairman Hwang.

294
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,250
What... What good will siding
with them do for us?

295
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:13,119
If we save the congressman,

296
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:15,789
you will take all the credit.

297
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,430
What importance does that have?

298
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,400
The congressman's safety
is of utmost importance.

299
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,900
Then should I call Chairman Hwang?

300
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't, you punk!

301
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,039
I won't. I won't.

302
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,339
Let's go!

303
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,279
- You're the best!
- You're the super best!

304
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,009
- You're the best!
- Since there's still traffic,

305
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,779
let's take the alley!

306
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,220
Follow our leader!

307
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,819
Let's go!

308
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,519
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

309
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:51,329
What if I refuse?

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,730
If I were you, I wouldn't choose
to go down that path, sir.

311
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,930
What?

312
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,140
Don't you know who I am?

313
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,839
I won't sit still.

314
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,509
I won't go down alone!

315
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,309
- What was that?
- What is this?

316
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,250
That bobbed hair.

317
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,289
Those jerks.

318
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,990
Hurry up.

319
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,390
Oh, my goodness!

320
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:23,329
He must be crazy!

321
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,900
Where are they?

322
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,609
You can call me artist
You can call me idol

323
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,910
Or you can call me anything

324
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,039
I don’t care

325
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,450
- Move out of the way!
- Follow me!

326
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Sir!

327
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,180
Gosh!

328
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,990
- Sir!
- You said, the alley!

329
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,950
- You can't lie down there!
- Why?

330
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,890
- I had no idea.
- Why are we in this mess?

331
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,859
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

332
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,259
- Remove him.
- Okay.

333
00:20:56,259 --> 00:20:57,789
Hey, stop!

334
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,529
You can't do this here.

335
00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:03,329
Oh, my!

336
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,599
Hurry up.

337
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,970
Is he insane?

338
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:12,539
Who are you?

339
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:13,539
- Come out!
- Darn it!

340
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,950
- You dirtbag!
- My goodness!

341
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,549
- Hurry up.
- Let me go!

342
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:23,650
Hey!

343
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,690
- Let me go!
- Hey, hey!

344
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,660
- Are you insane?
- Darn it.

345
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:32,299
- Go home and rest.
- Let me go!

346
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,329
Hey!

347
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,700
Who are you guys?
What are you doing?

348
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,170
Let me go!

349
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,769
Hey, where are you going?

350
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:45,779
Wait.

351
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,380
Was this the mess
he was talking about?

352
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,480
Darn it.

353
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,480
Hey, you!

354
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,390
I recognize those long legs...

355
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:58,819
and that back.

356
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:06,829
Taxi! Taxi!

357
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,440
Sir, that... That one.

358
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,099
Follow that back.

359
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,339
No, follow that bike! Hurry!

360
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,410
Let me go!

361
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,849
Tonight, I will find out
who he is by all means.

362
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,690
Let me go!

363
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,859
Who are you punks?

364
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,329
You. Aren't you Cheol Bum's minion?

365
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:17,829
You're quite the dull one.
Did you just realize that?

366
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,509
- Stamp it.
- I said, let me go!

367
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,410
I'm Park Won Mu,
a former army general!

368
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,609
Won Mu, so what?

369
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,309
You've been discharged, which means
that you're just an old geezer.

370
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,619
How dare you act
all high and mighty?

371
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,490
Did you do it properly?

372
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
Throw him.

373
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,930
What do you mean? Throw me?

374
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,190
Throw me where?

375
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,299
Let me go, you jerks!

376
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,430
It's a great night to check out
the nightscape.

377
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
- Let me go.
- Hey.

378
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,430
Don't press down on his armpits
too hard. They'll bruise.

379
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,670
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:54,569
I'll pay you.

381
00:23:55,069 --> 00:23:56,839
- "Pay"?
- How much do you want?

382
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,380
I'll pay you all more than enough.

383
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
Throw him.

384
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:03,579
Wait.

385
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,849
We didn't throw you.

386
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,150
You jumped, right?

387
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,950
Take off his shoes.

388
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,589
Let me go!

389
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,490
- I'll put them here, sir.
- Good.

390
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,589
Throw him far away.

391
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,799
This isn't right! No!

392
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,599
No!

393
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,599
Let him go.

394
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,910
Who are you?
Are you courier service?

395
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,950
Get out.

396
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,339
How dare you run away?

397
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,279
Gosh.

398
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,849
Gosh, my bone!

399
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,059
- Is this the right place?
- Yes, sir!

400
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,869
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

401
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,099
But Father Kim is
inside the building.

402
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:37,039
It shouldn't be messed up.

403
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,740
Let's go in first.

404
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:40,509
Darn it.

405
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,519
What is it? Okay.

406
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,619
Let's go! The police are here!

407
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:14,440
It's the rooftop of the WM Building
in Gudam-gu.

408
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,779
One man was hit in the head
by an iron pipe,

409
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:18,250
and he's bleeding a lot.

410
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,519
You should hurry. He's unconscious.

411
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,490
What? The police are there?

412
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,059
Okay, you should avoid first.

413
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,430
Darn it.

414
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,599
Didn't I tell you to
keep it confidential?

415
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,960
I did keep it confidential.

416
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,500
Then how did the police find out?

417
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,220
Father.

418
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,990
Father, let's just...

419
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,119
- Okay, sir.
- Let's go.

420
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,430
That way, guys!

421
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,589
- It's that way!
- That way? Let's go!

422
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,990
My goodness.
I'm familiar with these eyes.

423
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,890
You're that guy from that day.

424
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,390
You're the one who
hit my neck that day, right?

425
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,589
It is you!

426
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,079
Put your hands up!

427
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,579
Put your hands up.

428
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,200
Why did he get caught?

429
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,970
I know.

430
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,809
It's my last warning.
Put your hands up!

431
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,809
(The Fiery Priest)

432
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,549
What's this? What's going on?

433
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,450
That guy is the suspect!

434
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:41,750
He was my subordinate
when I was a team manager...

435
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,220
of the Counter-terrorism Unit
at NIS.

436
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,990
Kim Hae Il was the best agent.
He never gives up.

437
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,990
(Father Kim's past is revealed.)

438
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,490
Father Lee's DNA was found
in the blood and hair.

439
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,799
- Shall I go kill them all now?
- Wait a bit longer.

440
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,799
(Use the hidden card!)

441
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,769
You're not good enough
for this job.

442
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:57,170
I agree.

443
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,500
What are you talking about?
You think I can't handle it?

444
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,869
I'm the best veteran detective ever.

445
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,779
How dare you?
