1
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,839
Your skull's going to hurt
a lot today, hip-hop girl.

2
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,560
Stop right there, you sinners!

3
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,430
Go back.

4
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,829
- Chief Prosecutor.
- Don't you know where you belong?

5
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,230
Did you just say you'll do
whatever I tell you to do...

6
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,629
without making any mistakes?

7
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:38,939
Do you even know...

8
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,109
what I'll make you do?

9
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,879
You should know where you belong,

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,780
who you are,

11
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,319
and do whatever needs to be done...

12
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,590
before asking me a favor
or begging me.

13
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,319
Don't you think so?

14
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,290
I'll correct myself, sir.

15
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,719
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,730
I'll go back to Yeongwol.

17
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,240
(Chief Prosecutor Kang Seok Tae)

18
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,949
(Chief Prosecutor, Kang Seok Tae)

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,590
Yes, Ms. Jeong.

20
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:33,860
Pardon?

21
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,759
We have breaking news.

22
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:38,759
The CEO of a food distributor
that’s been selling spoiled foods...

23
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,300
is bribing the head of
Gudam-gu Health Office.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,469
With a big smile on his face,

25
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:46,370
he's accepting the money
from the CEO.

26
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,569
The same attitude was observed from
the health office employees.

27
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,009
(We oppose the bill to record
the activities of pro-Japanese.)

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,080
On top of that,
the food distributor...

29
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,680
hired a group of gangsters
to use force on the police...

30
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,050
and a priest who was
helping the police.

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,180
The sanitary division that conspired
with the food distributor...

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,490
and the borough office
that let them off the hook.

33
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,419
What I witnessed today was
a dishonest act done by...

34
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,360
the officers of Gudam-gu Office.

35
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,659
This was a report from UBS.

36
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,370
What is wrong with you?

37
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,840
How many times did I tell you to
change how you take care of things?

38
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,210
The priest was already determined
when he showed up.

39
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:00,080
Talking things out wouldn't have
worked with him anyway.

40
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,349
How can you still send
your pathetic minions...

41
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,219
to take care of an important deal?

42
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,879
Either you or Director Kim...

43
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,490
should've been the one
who went there!

44
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,090
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

45
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,889
I am so very sorry.

46
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:14,090
No, no.

47
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,759
I'm tired of hearing that excuse.

48
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,060
Making a mistake with taking care
of Father Lee...

49
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
was more than enough.

50
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,620
- Goodness, I'm sorry.
- I'm all done.

51
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,550
- She's all yours.
- Okay.

52
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,759
Are you okay? You were
getting quite a beating earlier.

53
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,959
It wasn't that bad considering
that they had more people.

54
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,199
Thank you for what you did earlier,
Dae Young.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,269
Oh, that?

56
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,180
Hey, it's the least I could do
as your senior.

57
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,649
Is your head okay?

58
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,750
I guess you don't know yet.

59
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,550
My skull is 1.5 times thicker
than a normal person's skull.

60
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,160
It's kind of like I'm wearing
a bulletproof helmet.

61
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,660
Today was the first day...

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,759
that you seemed like a senior
ever since I came here.

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
I guess that's not how
you thought of me until now.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,129
How should I describe it?

65
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,769
You've become strong in spirit,
and there's passion in your eyes.

66
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,939
My eyes are always filled
with passion.

67
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:41,579
I think you changed because
you've been hanging with Father Kim.

68
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,649
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,750
How can you say that even when
you know his nasty temper?

70
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,750
I'm putting up with so much.

71
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:53,089
By the way,
doesn't Father Kim seem like a cop?

72
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,259
He knows everything about our work.

73
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,360
Yes, you're right.
He knows a lot more than he should.

74
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,970
Father Kim,
did you also get injured?

75
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,339
Not at all.

76
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,540
I'm here to see Detective Seo.

77
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,709
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

78
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,149
Father Kim, your hand...

79
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,180
Oh, it's nothing.

80
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:19,949
Are you okay?

81
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,620
Yes, this is nothing.

82
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,959
We are the assailants.

83
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,660
- No, we're the victims.
- We're the victims.

84
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,360
We were going our way,

85
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,269
but the guy in black suddenly
started talking about a combination.

86
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,529
He's not here right now,
but then she starting kicking me,

87
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,699
and he suddenly attacked me
with his head.

88
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:39,399
Is this what cops do?

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,009
Look at what happened to my face.

90
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,439
Gosh, listen to me.

91
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,310
I didn't know it was a bribe.

92
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,410
I thought it was a letter.

93
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,750
- How does that even make sense?
- Why would I even take...

94
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,379
How is this even a bribe?

95
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,420
Detective Koo, I just felt sorry
for making them work so hard.

96
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Exactly.

97
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,290
So I just thought they could
buy themselves some bibimbap.

98
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,459
- Yes, that's exactly what it was.
- Be quiet!

99
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,089
Salute.

100
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,959
Why isn't there any progress?

101
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,329
Why did you arrest everyone?

102
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,800
They were all caught in the act,

103
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,670
so we had no choice
but to arrest everyone.

104
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
Forget it.

105
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,910
Don't even bother
filing for an arrest warrant.

106
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,379
Just let them go first and...

107
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:21,149
You can't let them go.

108
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,819
Why can't I?

109
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,220
I'm the chief
of this police station.

110
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,930
Wait a second.
I'm hearing something from above.

111
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,060
The Lord is trying
to tell me something.

112
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Wait.

113
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,199
From above...

114
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,740
The Lord just told you
to shut your mouth.

115
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
What?

116
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,879
How dare you tell me
to shut my mouth?

117
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,050
No, I didn't say it.

118
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,449
The Lord said it.
I'm just telling you what he said.

119
00:07:58,449 --> 00:07:59,850
How dare you?

120
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,850
Are you mocking me?

121
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,629
Hey, you. What did you say?
You thought it was a letter?

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,730
Are you guys dating?

123
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,500
Did his love for you
make your heart flutter and smile?

124
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,699
Well, I'll show you
some love as well.

125
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,199
Father Kim.

126
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,509
Why did you have to choose
a metal ruler?

127
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:22,910
We have plastic rulers too.

128
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,810
When you hit someone,
it's best to hit them with metal.

129
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,480
Oh, and you.

130
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,289
What kind of expensive bibimbap
do you eat?

131
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,620
You're going to get hit
with the side of the ruler.

132
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,620
Father Kim.

133
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,620
I'll deal with him.

134
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,389
You should deal
with the bobbed hair.

135
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,860
The bobbed hair?

136
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,669
You punk.

137
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,399
I'm not a guy in black.

138
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,669
You're supposed to call me a priest.

139
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,970
- You're dead meat.
- Goodness.

140
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:00,379
How can all of you be so brazen...

141
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,350
when the evidence is so clear?

142
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,779
They're all here.

143
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,019
Right, sir?

144
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:16,529
I'm about to have a stroke.
Massage my neck.

145
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:17,529
Yes, sir.

146
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:20,799
- Where are you going?
- The Gudam-gu office.

147
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,169
That's where the fire is,
so I should go watch the show.

148
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,970
Are you sure you're not going there
to make things worse?

149
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,740
"Then the Lord rained down fire
and burning sulfur..."

150
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,269
"from the sky
on Sodom and Gomorrah."

151
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,639
Genesis 19:24.

152
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,750
Fire and burning sulfur?
Gosh, I have a lot of work to do.

153
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,090
I wonder what he means
by fire and burning sulfur.

154
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,149
They can't just avoid us!

155
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,220
- Let us go inside.
- We need to talk.

156
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
How is this...

157
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,830
All the evidence they have
is just some cash...

158
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,429
and a recording of
what happened at the scene.

159
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:57,570
Yes, but you can't get involved
right now. Do you understand?

160
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,570
- First, let's watch...
- No.

161
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,740
If we give time to the press,

162
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,169
they'll only make things worse
by exaggerating things.

163
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,309
I'm going to take
immediate measures.

164
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:06,710
No, you can't do that.

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,179
They might be prepared
for something else...

166
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,360
I will be very firm in this case.

167
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,059
I will cooperate...

168
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:23,759
with carrying out
a clear and fair investigation.

169
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,860
Were you not aware
of the organized...

170
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,899
and chronic irregularities
of the health office?

171
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,230
The investigation will show whether
it was organized and chronic...

172
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,539
or whether it was just
a one-time crime.

173
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,070
So please refrain from
writing any articles until then.

174
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,340
And I was not aware
of any criminal activities.

175
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,879
What do you plan to do
if the irregularities turn out...

176
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,419
to be organized and chronic?

177
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,720
I will disassemble
the health office...

178
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,019
and establish a more transparent
administration system.

179
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,389
Goodness.

180
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,429
That's it?

181
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,899
I mean, you're the head
of the borough.

182
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,269
Are you really blaming everything
on your employees and the system?

183
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,399
(Weekly Newspaper of Gudam Church)

184
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,669
Do you hold no responsibility?

185
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,240
With what right are you
asking me that question?

186
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,409
Me?

187
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,950
I'm asking as a resident.

188
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,210
Why? Am I not allowed?

189
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:18,980
Okay, then.

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,220
What do I need to do to satisfy you?

191
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,259
That is...

192
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,960
up to you, ma'am.

193
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:29,929
But if you insist on
hearing my opinion,

194
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,629
I think you need
to take responsibility...

195
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,230
on their actions,
not their intentions.

196
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,070
But if you really feel upset
about taking responsibility...

197
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,039
and feel like you didn't do
anything wrong,

198
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,379
you can just blame your employees
for what happened.

199
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,350
But dodging
your responsibility today...

200
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:51,480
doesn't mean you can
do the same tomorrow.

201
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:56,750
Let me make myself clear.

202
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,990
She's about to burst.

203
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,259
- She's about to burst.
- If it turns out...

204
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,059
that the crime was chronic
and organized,

205
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,070
I promise that I will step down
from my position...

206
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,799
as the chief of borough.

(Press Conference Regarding
the Health Office's Bribery)

208
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,039
Was that...

209
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:23,009
an informal comment?

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,019
Ma'am, we should stop.

211
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,490
It was an official
and a formal comment.

212
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,259
Goodness, she just shot herself
in the foot.

213
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,389
Okay, it's official!

214
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,500
You're really going to
step down, right?

215
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,429
That's what I just said
in front of everyone.

216
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Then you'd better get ready
to step down, ma'am.

(Press Conference Regarding
the Health Office's Bribery)

218
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,149
Here's the evidence to prove
the irregularities...

219
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:01,320
of the Gudam-gu Health Office.

220
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,059
This is a copy of a secret ledger
that recorded...

221
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,389
all the bribes that Wangmat Foods
gave to the health office...

222
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,129
for the past three years.

223
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
And just for your information,

224
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:14,929
this is only one-tenth
of the actual copy.

225
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,940
Goodness, why do you have that?

226
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,340
Are you sure it's legitimate?

227
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,570
Would a priest use a fake?

228
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:25,379
The real ledger...

229
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,549
will go to Seoul City Hall's
Audit Commission.

230
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,279
I will deliver it to them myself.

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,389
One more thing!

232
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,759
This is for the reporters present.

233
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
It's a gift.

234
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,450
Okay.

235
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,519
Why did she act so rashly?

236
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,230
Today's midday drink was just...

237
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,740
Why is the sun still up?

238
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,669
It wasn't a midday drink.

239
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,480
It was a morning drink.

240
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,009
Good morning.

241
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,850
I'm drunk.

242
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,320
The thieving scum.

243
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,659
Where to?

244
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,100
The Gudam-gu Health Office's
bribery incident...

245
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,700
even got the priest of
the local church involved.

246
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,840
He played a pivotal role in
bringing the criminals to justice.

247
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,639
- Where shall we go?
- Wait, wait.

248
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,509
Gudam-gu and Chief of Borough
Jeong Dong Ja...

249
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,879
had been known to be
transparent and incorruptible.

250
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,080
The local residents are in shock.

251
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,450
This was Kim Jeong Nam
with RBS News.

252
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,549
Thanks for the update.

253
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,190
Have a nice day.

254
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,590
I looked into the guy
you mentioned yesterday.

255
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:56,759
He's no ordinary guy.

256
00:15:57,059 --> 00:15:59,000
He's a North Korean
under protection,

257
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,029
one of our agents,

258
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:02,429
or he's someone...

259
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,570
whose identity can't be known.

260
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,610
Yes, this is it.

261
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,379
Even my chief can't shun me now.

262
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,850
You scored big.

263
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,179
You're so good at teasing people.

264
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,379
I didn't tease her.

265
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,620
God told me to
reveal her conceitedness.

266
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,659
How did you get your hands on...

267
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,860
Wangmat Foods's secret ledger?

268
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,590
Let's work together.

269
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
There is something you must...

270
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,570
hear for me.

271
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
Then where...

272
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,870
Shall we put it there?

273
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,639
There's a door in the warehouse
that we covered up.

274
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,909
- What?
- We can put the ledger there.

275
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:49,580
Look for a door somewhere.

276
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,580
A hidden door.

277
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,789
A hidden door.

278
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,630
That's it, Song Sac. Get it.

279
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,630
- You get it.
- I'll stand watch.

280
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,000
- No...
- Just get it.

281
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,400
- Go.
- You go.

282
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
(Ledger)

283
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,170
Yo Han and Song Sac?

284
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,980
Come on.

285
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,279
- You knew as well.
- I did?

286
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:22,779
I didn't know.

287
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:25,079
You caught on
as soon as you saw Yo Han.

288
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,019
You pretended you needed to poop
to call Hwang Cheol Bum.

289
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,559
No. Why would I do that?
That's just not right.

290
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,829
You got really stressed out
when I didn't let you go.

291
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,170
If you really needed to poop,
you'd have done so on the roof.

292
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,599
I'm picky where I sleep and poop.

293
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,299
I don't go just anywhere.

294
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,740
At the station in the morning.

295
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,339
You pretended to have
a stomachache...

296
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,769
to contact Hwang Cheol Bum.

297
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:51,940
What?

298
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,009
No, why... How...

299
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,549
Now that's just
unreasonable fishing.

300
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,349
I can barely speak. My goodness.

301
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,119
I'd have beaten you up
if you hadn't saved Detective Seo.

302
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,420
That impulsive good deed
saved your life, okay?

303
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,259
Why is poop your only excuse?

304
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,759
I didn't...

305
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:11,829
He did all the talking
and walked off?

306
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,029
I feel wronged.

307
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,799
That's not true.

308
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Find out by tonight.

309
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:22,569
Who took Wangmat Foods' ledger.

310
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes, sir.

311
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,019
It's gotten worse and I'm cornered.

312
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,250
Okay.

313
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,519
I have important information.

314
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,789
What? That priest?

315
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,359
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

316
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,029
It's from the NIS.

317
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:51,269
He's someone whose identity
no one can know?

318
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,440
Yes.

319
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,009
The Gudam Church priesthood
could be his cover.

320
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,140
Now it's all making sense.

321
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,039
I knew there was
something about him.

322
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,009
That thing about the Pope.

323
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,119
Unless some other power
got involved,

324
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,180
the Vatican?

325
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,789
There's no way
he got a message to them.

326
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,319
That's what I'm saying.

327
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,460
Well done, Prosecutor Park.

328
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,660
Forget about all this.
Come right back.

329
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,799
Don't just stand there. Go.

330
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:20,829
Yes, sir.

331
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,440
Why are you bothering me
so endlessly?

332
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,109
There's something I must tell you.

333
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,109
I'm going out. You have a minute.

334
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,309
It's about Father Kim Hae Il.

335
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,279
- What about him?
- He's...

336
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,549
- He's...
- What about that priest?

337
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,220
He's...

338
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,789
About what he did today.

339
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:53,359
Wangmat Foods and the
Chief of Borough's resignation.

340
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,029
What about it?

341
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,970
I can sort it out.

342
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
You can?

343
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,569
- How?
- Well... I...

344
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:08,309
They say battles and paintings...

345
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:09,950
are best viewed from a distance.

346
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,250
I was at a distance.

347
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,450
And what did you see?

348
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,490
Could I continue
after a glass of water?

349
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,059
It's your last shot.

350
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,130
Go with your initial plan.

351
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,230
Yes, sir.

352
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,069
Your stint in Yeongwol worked.

353
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:33,769
You're all fired up again.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,170
Thank you.

355
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,640
- Let's talk later.
- Yes, sir.

356
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,869
Goodbye.

357
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,480
This wasn't it.

358
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,519
This...

359
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,690
Say hello later.

360
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,220
Bring me everything
on the Wangmat Foods case.

361
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,589
- Okay.
- Okay.

362
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,930
Where's the warrant.

363
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,140
We should get it before dinner.

364
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,009
You got the Chief of Borough
really good.

365
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,839
Thanks to Yo Han and Song Sac.

366
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,309
Just a moment.

367
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,180
When did you two become so chummy?

368
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,819
Since we brought in the thugs.

369
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,420
We should be close.

370
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,819
He's my tutor.

371
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,150
Your tutor? On what?

372
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,089
Will you become a nun?

373
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:28,630
No. I'm learning
all sorts of things.

374
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:31,160
My gosh. What about me then?

375
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,230
If I'm not your tutor,
am I just a stick?

376
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,269
I'll take the original ledger
to City Hall.

377
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,599
Shall I come with you?

378
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,200
- I'll go on my own.
- Take care.

379
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,369
Bye.

380
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,109
Bye.

381
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,880
What was that laugh?

382
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,480
What did that mean?

383
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,150
Today again, I laughed.

384
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,789
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

385
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,759
It started off with
a batch of tainted food.

386
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,029
Yes.

387
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,930
The butterfly effect led to...

388
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,569
Jeong Dong Ja's resignation.

389
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,539
Gosh, this priest is a real tsunami.

390
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,069
He's overly persistent.

391
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,609
The real victim
is the kid in the hospital.

392
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,609
Scumbags who toy around with food...

393
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,279
should all be rounded up...

394
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,450
Shall we kill them all?
Hire a hitman to do the job?

395
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,779
Sorry. I thought about
my own daughter.

396
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:30,390
The head and staff of
the Gudam-gu Health Office,

397
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,990
the sick kid's representatives,

398
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,359
lawyers, Wangmat Foods' people.

399
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,230
Bring them all to
Gudam Police Station.

400
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,299
And cast a reporter who's great
at putting together a story.

401
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:39,900
- Right now.
- Okay, I'm on it.

402
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:55,109
Father.

403
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,519
The ledger.

404
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:07,319
Oh, that.

405
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:09,490
I couldn't see it. Hand it over.

406
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,529
Father.

407
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,230
I'll go to City Hall.

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,029
You?

409
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,329
I'll finish it up.

410
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,470
I got the ledger
and made the copies.

411
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,069
Will you be okay?

412
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,339
I think doing this...

413
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,250
made my heart beat like this.

414
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,279
I think I've done
something really brave.

415
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,880
That's how it works.

416
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,319
You're super scared, but you're
really proud at the same time.

417
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,960
- Then have a safe trip.
- Okay.

418
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:42,829
Brother Yo Han.

419
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,549
What's taking so long
to issue the warrant?

420
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,079
It'll be issued soon.

421
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,650
What would you like to eat?

422
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,019
Could you wait for a little more?

423
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,660
Why should I? I'm starving.

424
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:18,500
Let's have a big dinner.
It's my treat.

425
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,630
Really?

426
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,430
Think of what you want to have.

427
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,700
I'll look up
good restaurants nearby.

428
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,609
Are there any
cost-effective restaurants?

429
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,150
I'll be right back.

430
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,190
Come back quickly.

431
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,589
I won't treat you if you come late.

432
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:51,259
(Warm and trustworthy police
that serve our citizens)

433
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,480
What's with your reactions?

434
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,220
We wondered...

435
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,589
why you were obsessed
with Wangmat Foods.

436
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:24,589
I know it's related to
what happened to Eun Ji,

437
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,200
but I thought investigation on
Father Lee came first.

438
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,569
Defeating Goliath...

439
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,769
was your big picture, Father Kim.

440
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,769
The opponents need to be weakened,

441
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,410
so we can obtain
the information we want.

442
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,680
We didn't know you had
such a great purpose.

443
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,880
You've done great work, Father.

444
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,450
He didn't do a great job.

445
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,079
He could've been in big trouble.

446
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:51,660
You can't beat them too harshly...

447
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,420
and curse at them so much.

448
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,390
That could hurt you...

449
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,230
and damage your mental health.

450
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,130
Oh, right. I heard you
asked this to Father Han.

451
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,529
You asked him
if I got my characters checked...

452
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,039
before I became a priest.

453
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,569
Father Kim.

454
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,579
Father Han.

455
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,180
I just said that for fun.

456
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,289
How can you laugh?

457
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,259
Father Han.

458
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,000
Seriously.

459
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:36,170
So then are we settled...

460
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,640
with Eun Ji's hospital fees?

461
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,309
Yes, we can be indemnified
through trials.

462
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,049
It'll include all the expenses
we've been covering.

463
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,319
Thank you, Lord.

464
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,849
Father Lee would've been
really happy.

465
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,339
Hang in there.

466
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,440
You'll be able to
meet your friends soon.
