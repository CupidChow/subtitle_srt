1
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,030
When I was a kid, there was something
I really wanted to experience.

2
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,784
Blowing out candles on a cake
and having my friends sing to me.

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,744
Really?

4
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,541
When I was in the second grade,
I made my friends come over.

5
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,293
Did Mom buy you a cake?

6
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,171
She went through the fridge

7
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,048
and boiled all the eggs we had.

8
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,344
We lit a candle over five eggs

9
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,095
and my friends sang to me.

10
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,309
Back then, we brushed our teeth with salt
because we didn't have toothpaste.

11
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,647
That was when I knew for sure

12
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:50,443
that our lives were different
from the lives of people on TV.

13
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,155
That we shouldn't desire
the same things that others desire.

14
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,158
What a relief.

15
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,078
We live as well as everyone else now.

16
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,374
Well enough to buy our little sister
a cake on her birthday.

17
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,859
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

18
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,778
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

19
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,197
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

20
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,075
-Happy birthday dear In-hye
-Happy birthday dear In-hye

21
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,703
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

22
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,376
Thanks.

23
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,920
Happy birthday.

24
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,548
Sorry.

25
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,383
Sorry about that.

26
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,262
Happy birthday, In-hye.
You're all grown up.

27
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,952
We're here.

28
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,662
Come in.

29
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,414
Okay. Is the kitchen that way?

30
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,000
No, just put it down anywhere. Over here.

31
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,209
-Sure.
-Here.

32
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,794
-Here.
-Yes.

33
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,089
Gosh.

34
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,676
Girls, this is the owner
of the restaurant where I work.

35
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,888
It's nice to meet you.

36
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,931
-Hello.
-Hello.

37
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,684
Would you like some water?

38
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,353
-I should go.
-Okay.

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,939
Of course.
You must be busy, so you should go.

40
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,274
-Have a good night.
-Thank you.

41
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,610
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

42
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,907
He gave me a box of yeolmu.

43
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,951
I wanted to make kimchi
for In-hye's birthday.

44
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,702
Yeolmu kimchi?

45
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,374
Why couldn't you just buy some?

46
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,167
It's not like it grows on trees.

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,712
I saw him buy you beef last time.

48
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,760
I ate it because it was imported.
I wouldn't have if it were Hanwoo beef.

49
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,683
But Mom, In-hye doesn't eat yeolmu kimchi.

50
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,269
You don't?

51
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:37,193
It's so good with noodles
when you don't have an appetite.

52
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,946
I didn't know you didn't eat it.

53
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,157
I'll make it for you so try it, okay?

54
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:48,538
Mom will make you yummy kimchi

55
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,967
In-hye.

56
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,386
Do you want anything for your birthday?

57
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,515
What if someone were to grant you a wish
regardless of the cost?

58
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,103
A nose job?

59
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,357
But your nose is your best feature.

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,235
That's true.
You have the cutest nose among us.

61
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,154
I don't want a cute nose.

62
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,158
I want a nose
that looks more prominent and noble.

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,287
I thought you wanted
to go on that field trip to Europe?

64
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,705
That's right.

65
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,792
I won't be able to go anyway.

66
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,886
You have to sign up by this week, right?

67
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,140
In-joo.

68
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,309
-Do you like our gift?
-Yes!

69
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,519
-More than a nose job?
-Yes.

70
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,188
Thank you both.

71
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,818
What is wrong with you?

72
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,738
What the…

73
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,993
When I wanted to visit your dad
in the Philippines after his accident,

74
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,996
you said you had no money
and that your cards were maxed out.

75
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,332
Of course, we didn't.

76
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
Five years ago, Dad accrued debts

77
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,089
of 40 million won from a pyramid scheme
and 25 million won from gambling.

78
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,675
Plus, 38 million won from investing in
a sauna and 70 million won from stocks.

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,428
We've been paying them off for four years.

80
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,306
On top of the 800,000 won for rent
and 2,000,000 won for expenses.

81
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,392
Our debt grows
every time we take a breath.

82
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,729
So no, you can't go to the Philippines
because he broke a leg.

83
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,272
Nine, ten.

84
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,108
This is 2.5 million won.

85
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:46,197
Still, it's ridiculous for a high schooler
to go on a field trip to Europe.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,406
Should I not go?

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,575
I wasn't planning to go anyway.

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,080
Mom, In-hye goes to
the best arts high school in the country.

89
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,124
Did we help her get there?

90
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,960
She took the test on her own
and got a full scholarship.

91
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,671
But that's…

92
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,466
I thought she got in as a charity case
for underprivileged kids.

93
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,432
When In-hye started school,

94
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,102
In-kyung and I made a pact.

95
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,105
That even if she can't be
like the other kids,

96
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,107
we'd make sure
she never feels embarrassed.

97
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,946
In-joo, have you ever gone
on a field trip?

98
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,074
What about you, In-kyung?

99
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,123
I couldn't send either of you
on a field trip.

100
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,125
Not to Gyeongju, Busan, or Jeju.

101
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,462
So as a mother,
how can I only let her travel abroad?

102
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,048
If In-hye was getting her parents' support
like other kids,

103
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,552
we could be jealous of
our baby sister like ordinary people.

104
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,014
But even though In-joo and I have
so much debt we need to pay off,

105
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:56,476
we're so happy we can send our sister
on a field trip to Europe.

106
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,065
Stop counting that.

107
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,619
Eat.

108
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,420
I didn't get in as a charity case.

109
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,756
I took the test just like everyone else.

110
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,178
We know.

111
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,139
We all know, but…

112
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,868
Girls,

113
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:42,415
I was deeply resentful
that I couldn't go to the Philippines

114
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,125
when Dad was injured.

115
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,056
Did you know I've never traveled abroad
even at this age?

116
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:16,198
I haven't celebrated my birthday in years.

117
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:25,207
Now, I want to start living for myself
rather than for my children.

118
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,078
In-hye, I'm very sorry.

119
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,580
But you are young,

120
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,583
so you'll have plenty of chances
to travel abroad.

121
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,344
Take care of In-hye.
I'll write when I get there.

122
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,812
By the way, put the yeolmu kimchi
in the fridge after a day.

123
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,783
In-kyung, throw out the kimchi!

124
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,266
Some people should never become mothers.

125
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,893
Sadly, our mom is one of them.

126
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,148
Forget about it.

127
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,191
I've forgotten about it already.

128
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,443
It's fine.

129
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,571
I never thought for a moment
that I could go on the trip.

130
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,334
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

131
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,421
I'm crying because I'm pissed off.

132
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,887
In-hye, you will go on that trip.

133
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,222
We'll get the money together
by this weekend.

134
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,016
Right, In-joo?

135
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,851
Right.

136
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:53,814
Can we do half each?

137
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,777
Please.

138
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,156
Don't do that.

139
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,783
Everything Mom said was true,
so I'm fine with that,

140
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,536
but I hate seeing you two try so hard.

141
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,931
-I met him.
-And?

142
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,140
-Goodbye.
-Okay. Bye.

143
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,602
-He was so hot and buff.
-Oh, my.

144
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,854
-Oh, my goodness.
-I loved it.

145
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,147
Your blind date?

146
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,942
-You heard?
-You should've seen him.

147
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,276
-Goodness.
-His body was perfect.

148
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,153
-Is that all you saw?
-You would've done the same.

149
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,657
-It's really important.
-Guys should be smart.

150
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,369
-Isn't that the same thing?
-Being sexy isn't enough.

151
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,084
Wasn't Waikiki too crowded?

152
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,002
I prefer Kailua Beach.

153
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,004
It has better waves and fewer tourists.

154
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,674
Totally. Kailua is definitely prettier.

155
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,217
-Really?
-Ms. Hwang.

156
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,178
Me?

157
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,639
Do you need to talk to me?

158
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,142
Yes.

159
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,898
By any chance,

160
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,651
may I get paid in advance this month?

161
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
Just partially.

162
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,655
How much?

163
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,658
Just 1.25 million won.

164
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,246
How long have you worked here?

165
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,373
Four years.

166
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,876
And yet, you still don't understand
what your job is?

167
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,544
We deal with money.

168
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,046
What's the most important thing
in this line of work?

169
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,424
Trust, right?

170
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:47,177
How can this company trust
an employee with money when they make

171
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,680
an unreasonable request
for a measly 1.25 million won?

172
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm very sorry, but I'm not asking
for an advance for work I haven't done.

173
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,104
I'm asking for an advance
for the days I've already worked.

174
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,689
Is that too unreasonable?

175
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,109
Ms. Oh, why are you so dense?

176
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:05,487
Don't you see I'm uncomfortable
having a conversation like this at all?

177
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,823
Consider how I would feel,
refusing your request.

178
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,451
How are you so self-centered?

179
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,632
If I were the one refusing the request,
I would've at least asked

180
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,885
what they needed
that 1.25 million won for.

181
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,428
Ju-eun.

182
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,056
What is this?

183
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,682
A souvenir from Hawaii.

184
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,601
Gosh.

185
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,062
-No. You were wrong.
-Thank you.

186
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,481
Why are you bringing up money at work?

187
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,150
You're an outcast.
Why would you show your weakness?

188
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,904
Ms. Hwang,
it's your wedding anniversary, right?

189
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,615
Goodness, you remember
my wedding anniversary?

190
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,575
How could I not?

191
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,036
Your wedding was so beautiful.

192
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,246
You're forcing me to pay for lunch today.

193
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,456
That wasn't my intent.

194
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,083
I think it totally was.

195
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,213
They must've enjoyed their lunch.

196
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,508
They probably laughed
about you asking for 1.25 million won.

197
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,684
I wish I could eat with someone too.

198
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,395
Can't I eat with you?

199
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,814
I told you.

200
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,234
Nothing's more annoying
than fellow outcasts being close.

201
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,115
You're the 13th-floor outcast,
and I'm the 14th-floor outcast.

202
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,825
We're already outcasts.

203
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,618
It'll be worse if we hang out.

204
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,665
Flowers have personalities too.

205
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,960
If you mix too many types together,

206
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,462
they'll get annoyed
with each other and wilt.

207
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,881
Do they affect each other?

208
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,343
Oncidiums are mean and cruel.

209
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,888
Cattleyas are realists.

210
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,476
This one is Princess of Thieves.

211
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,937
It's an outcast.

212
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,106
Even flowers can be outcasts?

213
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,941
It's unimpressive now,

214
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,277
but once it blooms,
it'll be like a true princess.

215
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,113
That must be your favorite.

216
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,994
I wrote down
everything you need to do here.

217
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,787
Refer to it and follow what it says.

218
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,919
Do you come up here early every morning
to water them and clean?

219
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,048
I've always had at least two jobs
ever since I grew up.

220
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,008
I'd clean people's offices before work

221
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,302
and resell items online
that I got from overseas after work.

222
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,180
You're amazing.

223
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:39,349
All the while learning English
and computer skills.

224
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,394
Anyway,

225
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,398
I know I'm an outcast because I'm dense.

226
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,566
Why are you an outcast?

227
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,154
You think that's why you're an outcast?

228
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,199
Is it because I'm bad at my job?

229
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,076
Because I dress funny?

230
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,497
Because guys like me?

231
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:08,378
Bo-yeon went to a prominent university,
and her uncle is a bank president, right?

232
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,214
Hyeon-ji went to an Ivy League school

233
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,882
and her father-in-law is
a government minister.

234
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,050
Ju-eun went to Ewha

235
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,802
and her dad's an exec
at a large corporation.

236
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,555
And then there's you. What about you?

237
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,686
I went to a two-year accounting school,
and my family is poor.

238
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,438
And I'm divorced.

239
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,982
I'm a penniless high school grad.

240
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,111
A reject with no hopes of getting married.

241
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,405
How can you not notice the difference?

242
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,369
I guess it was beyond my control.

243
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,331
I'm relieved for some strange reason.

244
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,378
You never should've asked that woman
for an advance on your pay.

245
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,296
Why not?

246
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,467
People can only identify with others
who are in similar circumstances.

247
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,889
Then what does she feel toward me?

248
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,849
Disgust.

249
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,103
When do you need 1.25 million won by?

250
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,271
This weekend?

251
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,610
You don't have money either.
And you have your father's issue too.

252
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,779
I can dip into my savings.

253
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,534
Thank you so much.

254
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,036
I'll return the favor.

255
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,956
Let me know
if you ever need to borrow money.

256
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:32,045
When my mom passed away,
you were the only one who came from work.

257
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,548
You stayed for two days
until she was laid to rest,

258
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,966
and helped the entire time.

259
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,427
I'll never forget that.

260
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,692
What do the numbers mean?

261
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,903
The day my mom died.

262
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,163
After receiving a complaint
about a barking dog,

263
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,707
the police found a family of four
dead in their home.

264
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,711
They found a suicide note
written by the youngest daughter.

265
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,380
It asked that the finder
take care of the dog.

266
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,217
Next to it was enough dog food
and water for several days.

267
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,762
According to the autopsy,
there was hardly any food found

268
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,474
in the dead family members' stomachs…

269
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,726
Were you crying?

270
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,436
No, sir.

271
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,313
Zoom in.

272
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,575
I think it was an allergic reaction.

273
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:49,623
Why would a reporter get all emotional
when the viewers don't?

274
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,409
I wasn't crying.

275
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,787
I saw cases like this every day
when I visited police stations.

276
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,830
So why would I?

277
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,373
You cried then too.

278
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,042
Over murder, suicide, and child abuse.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,837
You're smart, so why…

280
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,965
Even if I did cry,
it wasn't because I was sad.

281
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,384
It was physiological. Like sneezing.

282
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,429
Your problem is that
you're overly empathetic.

283
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,266
You know Wan-gyu hates it
when people get emotional over the news.

284
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,977
That's why he keeps making you do it
until you get better.

285
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,479
I'll be careful.

286
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,692
Aren't you even bitter
about being treated unfairly?

287
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,779
How long do you plan on
chasing every little incident?

288
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,489
You should find your expertise.

289
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:08,410
I thought I was being treated fairly.

290
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,537
Reporting from the scene is my expertise.

291
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,749
Did you grow up poor?

292
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,293
Sorry?

293
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
You never complain.

-How have you been?

00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,215
What is it?

302
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,593
Why don't you come
and see me this weekend?

303
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,719
Why should I?

304
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,807
I know you said
you never wanted to see me again.

305
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,809
Your mom called.

306
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,894
She said she's never coming back to Korea.

307
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,646
She told me to look after you girls.

308
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,567
You always criticized her
for her lack of judgment,

309
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,444
and you were right.

310
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,947
Why would she ask you to look after us?

311
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,784
In case you need money?

312
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:38,542
Come over at 6:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Have breakfast with me.

00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,218
She's trying to bait you
with a little money again.

316
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:51,805
We know how she manipulates people
with money.

Which do you prefer?

318
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,601
Rich but mean parents

319
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,979
or incompetent but kind parents?

320
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,273
You always talk nonsense.

00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,651
How could someone be incompetent and nice?
Incompetence in itself is bad.

322
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,279
I had

323
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,991
such a tough time living with Great-aunt.

324
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,536
I guess I hate rich and mean people more.

325
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,081
Like them or not,
you've gotten used to a wealthy life.

326
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:23,044
You're the only one in our family who buys
rich people's ice cream like this.

327
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,088
It was buy one, get one free.

328
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,890
I never would've left Great-aunt's house
to come back home.

329
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,308
I would've put up with her.

330
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:41,062
Then I would've been included
in her will by now.

331
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
Hey.

332
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,442
I bet

333
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,028
you wouldn't have lasted a day.

334
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,867
Now, there's only one way.

335
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,161
What?

336
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,748
Marrying a rich man.

337
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,876
You tried that and failed.

338
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,004
He wasn't actually rich.
He was a con artist.

339
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:12,302
I can't believe there are people out there
who would even scam someone like you.

340
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:16,097
I know for sure now
what kind of guy I should avoid.

341
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:19,267
Just wait.
Next time, I'll marry a rich guy

342
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,020
and let you and In-hye
live a life free of debt.

343
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,317
Do you even have a boyfriend?

344
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,487
What about you? Do you?

345
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,489
Do you think I would tell you if I did?

346
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,436
Why do you dress like that?

347
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,649
You told me to dress up.

348
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,901
When else would I wear
something like this?

349
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,405
You know guys
hate clothes like that, right?

350
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,199
So do girls.

351
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,617
I wear these because I like them.

352
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,622
I got a ride last time,
so I didn't know it was this high.

353
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,669
Oh, no.

354
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,713
I only wore them twice.

355
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,257
What do I do?

356
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,721
Size 235mm?

357
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,491
It's so nice here!

358
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,791
My clothes look too cheap, don't they?

359
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,762
Come here.

360
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,114
It looks better
when someone pretty wears it.

361
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:45,288
Put these on.

362
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,875
-What about you?
-I've been here before.

363
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,921
Thanks.

364
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,938
Oh, my gosh. How is this possible?

365
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,857
They're gorgeous and super comfortable.

366
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,442
They're Bruno Zumino.

367
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,070
I got them for myself
for my birthday last year.

368
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,615
Is this real too?

369
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,825
It's a knockoff.

370
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,745
It's nice even if it's fake.

371
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,623
I feel like it's straightening my back.

372
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:33,711
Don't I look effortlessly rich?

373
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,631
I look like I had
a proper upbringing, right?

374
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,930
Look at this.
You're too hunched over here.

375
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,391
You should do some yoga.

376
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,435
Want to go to the studio I go to?

377
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,445
Hello, ma'am.

378
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,886
How much does this cost?

379
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,847
Don't ask about the price.
We're playing rich, remember?

380
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,265
Right.

381
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,440
What do you want to do
if you had a lot of money?

382
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,816
What about you?

383
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,901
Me?

384
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,821
I want to live with my sisters
in an apartment with nice windows.

385
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,032
That's important.

386
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,074
I'd sleep through the night

387
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,786
without a worry in the world
in a place like that.

388
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,539
If I fell asleep worrying about money,

389
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,916
I'd wake up in the middle of the night.

390
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,418
As soon as I wake up,
the worries would sweep over me.

391
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,713
"Where will I get all that money?"

392
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,674
So true.

393
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,802
I'll wake up and open the fridge,

394
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,095
and it'll be packed with food.

395
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,807
"What should I eat?
I'm sick of everything."

396
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,683
Then I'll go to the bathroom,

397
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,102
and it'll be super warm.

398
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,857
But we worry in the winter
about whether or not to wash our hair.

399
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,318
Seriously. That's why I don't wash it.

400
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,323
Isn't there anything you want to do
if you were rich?

401
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,325
I'd do nothing.

402
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,873
I'd cash everything out

403
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,210
and go somewhere
where I can be completely alone.

404
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:43,216
Then I'll remember things I couldn't do
when I was 12 because I was poor.

405
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,801
Piano school.

406
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,553
A birthday party at a pizzeria.

407
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,639
Taking a long drive
in Dad's car on a Sunday.

408
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,520
When we feel like that money is ours,
will we stop wanting those things?

409
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,023
Completely.

410
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:06,739
Thank you.

411
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,329
Hwa-young.

412
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,666
Why does it seem like
those people know you?

413
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,126
I came just once.

414
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,628
With Director Shin
and a guest visiting from London.

415
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,884
Was that why there were rumors
about you and Director Shin?

416
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,344
We worked late together often
around that time too.

417
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,512
Why did you keep quiet?

418
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:33,516
I would've ripped Ms. Hwang's mouth off
for spreading lies like that.

419
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,643
I didn't mind.

420
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,398
They called you a mistress that was
sleeping with a gross married man,

421
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,816
but you didn't mind?

422
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,193
It was Bo-yeon, Hyeon-ji, and Ju-eun.

423
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,653
-They spread the rumor.
-Right.

424
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,614
I was fine because it wasn't true,

425
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:51,117
but I know their true secrets.

426
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,035
What secrets?

427
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,041
Right, before I forget,

428
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,752
I'll send you the 1.25 million won.

429
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,720
TRANSFER FROM JIN HWA-YOUNG
1,250,000 WON

430
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,557
Thank you.

431
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,476
I'll pay you back as soon as I get paid.

432
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,273
You know the accounting software
that I created?

433
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,109
"Bookkeeper from the Future"?

434
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,404
The one you sent
to BookkeepingNet for beta testing?

435
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,866
-You said you'll build a start-up with it.
-Bookkeeping will be gone in the future.

436
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,911
Bo-yeon, Hyeon-ji,
and Ju-eun will all be useless.

437
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,413
-What about you and me?
-We'll get rich with this.

438
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,540
Here.

439
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,252
I need to submit these documents for it.

440
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,673
Please sign them.

441
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,385
Why are they all in English?

442
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,554
I want to register it abroad
while I'm at it.

443
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,270
Sign the places that I marked
on the back page too.

444
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,331
Hello.

445
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,876
Hello.

446
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,795
Do we know each other?

447
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,506
We have the same shoes.

448
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,800
Where did you buy them?

449
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,636
They were a gift.

450
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,057
There are only three pairs in Korea.

451
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,143
I wondered who else bought them.

452
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,499
"Hi, In-kyung."

453
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,168
"Hi, In-kyung."

454
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,419
How have you been?

455
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,341
Why do you look like that?

456
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,804
What do you mean?

457
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,849
I hate it when people look sullen.

458
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,439
I told myself over and over
not to get angry,

459
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,234
but I failed before I even sat down.

460
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,986
I'm no match for you.

461
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:24,455
This is Cheon Sang-hyeok.
He helps me around the house.

462
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,998
She's my great-niece.

463
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,638
He must be a good cook.

464
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,807
The previous housekeeper was
just too brooding.

465
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,850
I couldn't take it.

466
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,603
Haven't you ever thought
that she became that way because of you?

467
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,397
That was why I hired a man this time.

468
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,732
Men are better if they're brooding.

469
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,943
Cheerful men are boring.

470
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,918
How's In-joo?

471
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,295
She's doing well at work.

472
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,213
Does she still keep her nails sharp?

473
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,925
I think so.

474
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,510
How big is the youngest now?

475
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,220
She's in the 11th grade now.

476
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,932
Her paintings got her into
Seran Arts High School.

477
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,185
It would be nice if you met her.

478
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,813
Your mom wouldn't let me,
so I never had a chance to.

479
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,277
She probably couldn't even try
since you always criticized her.

480
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,113
Are you still taking her side
even after she abandoned you?

481
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,991
I always knew she'd do that someday.

482
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,164
I told myself two things
when I was coming here.

483
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,875
The first was to not get angry.

484
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,252
The second was
to not listen to you bad-mouth Mom.

485
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,005
You said she was too flirty,
she was bad luck,

486
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,673
and she'd bleed her husband dry.

487
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,178
I cried behind the curtains a lot as a kid
because you'd always say that.

488
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
But not anymore.

489
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,309
If you bad-mouth Mom again,
I'll get up and leave.

490
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,942
Then let's talk about money.

491
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,277
How much do you need?

492
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,532
I know you're here to ask for money.

493
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,786
Tell me.
How much do you need and for what?

494
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,630
You're right. It's embarrassing,
but I came to borrow money.

495
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:43,010
I want to send In-hye on a school trip.
I'm 1.25 million won short.

496
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:46,055
Send me a copy of your ID
and your bankbook.

497
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:49,100
I'll wire the amount into your account
after deducting the tax.

498
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,687
I'll pay you back over six months.
Is that all right?

499
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,774
No need to pay me back.
We're entering into a service contract.

500
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,236
Come at this hour every weekend
for a month and read the paper to me.

501
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's just say I'm receiving consultation
from a journalist.

502
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:07,994
Like in the past?

503
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,204
Like in the past.

504
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,125
Thank you.

505
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,505
You're done eating, so you should go.

506
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,467
You should get moving
if you've got what you needed.

507
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,635
It's a busy world.

508
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,740
"You should go."

509
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,701
"Go."

510
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,792
I brought your package.

511
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:11,974
Hey.

512
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,854
This came to my house by mistake.

513
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,315
I see. Thanks.

514
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,068
So you were in Korea.

515
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,196
Yes. I came back a few days ago.

516
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:26,989
I see.

517
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,494
-Your great-aunt is seriously…
-What?

518
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,789
I called her yesterday
and said I'd leave this by the door,

519
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,874
and she said to bring it at this time.

520
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,667
I thought she had gone mad.

521
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,586
Sorry.

522
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,423
Let's grab a meal sometime.

523
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,011
Ta-da.

524
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,430
For the trip.

525
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,433
Aren't I cool?

526
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,519
I wish you hadn't.

527
00:39:59,063 --> 00:39:59,897
What?

528
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,608
I don't want you two suffering
because of me.

529
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,654
We're not suffering.

530
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,657
-You're my sister, so--
-If you were me, would you take it?

531
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,454
I see why you might not want to accept it.

532
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,831
But to us,

533
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,751
it's very important that you
go on this field trip and have fun.

534
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,378
It's okay, take it.

535
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,463
Stop it already.

536
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,094
I already told my teacher
that I'm not going.

537
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,095
But…

538
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,763
I have plans.

539
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,445
In-hye!

540
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,947
In-hye!

541
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,663
Come on, get in.

542
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,299
Hey. Wait a second!

543
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,760
Park Seung-ok, who was framed
for espionage in 1987

544
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,971
by the Defense Security Command

545
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,640
and wrongfully served 19 years in prison,

546
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,394
was cleared of all charges
in a retrial after 30 years.

547
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,481
An unexpected guest visited him today.

548
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
I'm sorry for coming so late.

549
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,486
When you were illegally tortured

550
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,362
and framed for espionage,

551
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,783
my father-in-law was the commander
of the Defense Security Command.

552
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,912
I apologize on his behalf.

553
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,539
Candidate Park Jae-sang stated

554
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,625
that he'd get on his knees and apologize

555
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,794
as many times as it took
to appease the victim and his family…

556
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,924
People love this story.

557
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,968
What a sight.

558
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,054
High society's elite attorney,
Park Jae-sang,

559
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:58,474
lowering his head to a poor,
long-term prisoner.

560
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,393
He wants to run for mayor of Seoul, right?

561
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,022
It was wise to become a candidate
for the Civil Party, not the Korean Party.

562
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,441
His father-in-law was a big name
in the government.

563
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,737
To forfeit such a huge political asset
without any hesitation shows conviction.

564
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,782
He realized the trend was
to drop your ideologies.

565
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,785
I question his sincerity.

566
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:21,205
He represented Bobae Savings Bank

567
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,748
as their lawyer a few years ago.

568
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,709
He was in charge of
large corporations at his firm.

569
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,169
That's not shocking.

570
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,338
Bobae Savings Bank got its capital

571
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:31,632
from the military regime
as special treatment.

572
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,468
People may lie,

573
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,844
but money is honest.

574
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,349
Based on big data,
Park Jae-sang will be the mayor of Seoul.

575
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,684
We should prepare for it.

576
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,396
I'll find out what role he played
in the trial.

577
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,939
We should look into that much.

578
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,070
Ma-ri, In-kyung, look into it separately.

579
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,282
This man is intriguing.

580
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
Did you have fun?

581
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,253
I'm glad.

582
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,046
-Hyo-rin, did you have fun too?
-Yes.

583
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,965
We had a great time thanks to you.

584
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,758
Come by again.

585
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,052
Here you go.

586
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,888
Thank you.

587
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,475
In-hye.

588
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,776
Hello, I'm In-hye's sister.

589
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,237
Did you come to pick her up?

590
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,783
I'm sorry.
We kept her too late, didn't we?

591
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,287
I'm the one who's sorry.
My sister stayed so late.

592
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,666
In-hye.

593
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,338
What is this?

594
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,343
It's money.

595
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,304
I hope you don't misunderstand.

596
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,683
I happened to see her paintings
and I loved them.

597
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,518
So I asked her

598
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:10,648
if she could paint
with my daughter, Hyo-rin.

599
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,400
I thought they'd be
a good influence on each other.

600
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,362
The money was for cab fare.

601
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,824
I won't misunderstand.

602
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,701
And we don't need cab fare.

603
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,371
Hyo-rin, come over to our place next time.

604
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,747
Okay.

605
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,209
In-hye has such a dependable sister.

606
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,461
I heard she didn't have a mother.

607
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,300
It must be hard for you.

608
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,929
If I were you, I would've been scared

609
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,140
since In-hye is so talented.

610
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,895
Come over for some tea next time.

611
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,021
We can share notes.

612
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,982
It's okay.

613
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,791
You won't take money from me,

614
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,459
but you will from a friend's mom?

615
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,380
I was happy

616
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,633
when Hyo-rin's mom said she'd pay me.

617
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,679
I was making money purely on my own.

618
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,183
Is that so wrong?

619
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,480
-It's wrong.
-Why?

620
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,191
Because we're not beggars.

621
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,321
There are people who give us things
because we seem poor.

622
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,949
They give us food and their old clothes.

623
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,202
If you take it,
they'll treat you like a beggar.

624
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,328
They'll pity you.

625
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,831
I won't let people think that way
about you too.

626
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,773
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT
RULING

627

PRESIDENT OF BOBAE SAVINGS BANK
COMMITS SUICIDE

628
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,110
What could be more powerful than death?

629
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,238
Money?

630
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,534
Who would buy someone's death with money?

631

WON GI-SEON
SON-IN-LAW PARK JAE-SANG

632
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,998
How coldhearted could they be?

633
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,838
My father-in-law was the commander
of the Defense Security Command.

634
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,008
I apologize on his behalf.

635
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,437
To my secret friend, In-joo.

636
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,609
To be honest,
I'm not worried about the orchids.

637
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:02,110
The problem is you.

638
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:05,572
What if the girls on the 13th floor
harass you while I'm gone?

639
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,662
I'm attaching what I've gathered on them
just in case.

00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,088
Study them. Then no matter what they do,

642
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,506
you'll be able to laugh.

643
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,272
Do you know what the most important thing
for an outcast is?

644
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,148
It's posture.

645
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,234
Don't hunch. Stand tall.

646
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,905
Here's a link to videos that will help you
straighten your shoulders.

647
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,116
PS.

648
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,742
If I'm in Europe for too long,

649
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,078
go to my place and feed my fish for me.

650
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,913
My address is…

651
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,085
May I help you?

652
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:02,087
Are you Ms. Oh In-joo?

653
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,090
Do you know me?

654
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,677
I worked with Ms. Jin Hwa-young
in Europe on a project.

655
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,762
I'm Choi Do-il.

656
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,390
Hello.

657
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,394
We have a meeting soon, so you should go.

658
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,272
A meeting at 7 a.m.?

659
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,399
Take the stairs. Don't take the elevator.

660
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,818
It's best not to run into anyone.

661
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,155
Also…

662
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,533
can I get your number?

663
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,038
-Why?
-I may need to reach you.

664
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,878
Why…

665
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,380
would you need to reach me?

666
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:25,212
I received an email back then
from a nephew of Kim Dal-su,

667
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,381
the bank president who committed suicide.

668
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,551
When the president was on medical parole,
he cried saying he didn't want to die.

669
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,554
But right after he met with his attorney,

670
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,307
he was found dead in the bathroom
with a needle in his arm.

671
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,477
That attorney was Park Jae-sang.

672
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:46,316
So I started investigating him,
and he responded immediately.

673
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,862
That was the first time in my career
as a journalist that I was tailed.

674
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,072
What did you conclude?

675
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,033
He was clean. As clean as a whistle.

676
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,868
I had forgotten about it,

677
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,789
but I learned this after reading
the trial transcript yesterday.

678
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,710
There were 32 people arrested
during the Bobae Savings Bank case,

679
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,878
and four of them committed suicide.

680
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,005
Of the dozens of attorneys
representing them,

681
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,466
only Park Jae-sang
was in charge of all four of them.

682
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,260
Isn't that statistically significant?

683
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,138
What use is that? There's no proof.

684
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,433
Who benefited from these four suicides?

685
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,893
I drew it out.

686
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,189
Simply put,
what happened in the Bobae case was

687
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,484
that the 400 billion won entrusted
by 30,000 people disappeared.

688
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,777
Part of that money,

689
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,863
which equaled 140 billion won,

690
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,116
was transferred to one party.

691
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,579
These four men's deaths erased…

692
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,788
140 BILLION

693
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,123
BOBAE SAVINGS BANK CASE OUTLINE

694
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,082
…all traces of that.

695
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,793
Where did the money go?

696
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,673
The CEO of Wonryeong Industry,
who was planning project financing.

697
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,508
General Won Gi-seon's son

698
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,386
and the older brother
of Park Jae-sang's wife.

699
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,561
You're saying 140 billion went to him?

700
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,315
That's what I saw at least.

701
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,943
How soon can you find out for sure?

702
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,864
I'll dig into the four suicides first.
I'll work as fast as I can.

703
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,702
-You know I was never pleased with you.
-I do.

704
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,663
Only once did I think
you'd become a good journalist.

705
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,249
During Typhoon Catherine.

706
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,876
The other studios pulled out,

707
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:31,171
but you tied yourself with a rope
and covered it all night long.

708
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,927
Do that or don't do it at all.

709
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,012
Understood?

710
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,600
Yes, sir.

711
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,521
My father was a miner.

712
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,024
Life was hard,
so he enlisted during the Vietnam War.

713
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,818
My mother ran away.

714
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,657
When I was a child, I always thought,

715
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,201
"If only I had a wealthy father."

716
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,413
"If only I had a wealthy father too."

717
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,835
Park Jae-sang Foundation
will be the wealthy father

718
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,838
to the youth of Korea
who are discouraged by poverty.

719
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,259
PARK JAE-SANG FOUNDATION

720
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,394
Have you seen the consultant from London?

721
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,187
He's from the Europe office.

722
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,814
Yes. He went to Wharton.

723
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,566
He's really cute.

724
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,984
Really?

725
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,902
I hear he's a jerk though.

726
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,113
-Is he married?
-Who knows?

727
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,239
Oh, my.

728
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,743
Is Ms. Oh In-joo here?

729
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,620
Ms. Oh?

730
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,345
Are you running for mayor of Seoul
with the Civil Party?

731
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,725
I planned to only take questions
regarding the foundation today.

732
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,643
I'll tell you one thing.

733
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,314
I didn't form the foundation
to get into politics.

734
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,442
I formed it to give back
what I've received.

735
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,444
Whether or not I run for mayor,

736
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,529
the Park Jae-sang Foundation will persist.

737
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,076
Yes?

738
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,918
You represented Bobae
in the Bobae Savings Bank Case.

739
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,712
Among the 32 people arrested,

740
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,924
four of the people
you defended committed suicide.

741
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,718
Do you have anything to say about that?

742
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,181
Well, I'm not sure.

743
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,517
I was one of thirteen attorneys

744
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,647
working for the law firm Hwang and Moon,
who had taken on the case.

745
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,148
That is my answer.

746
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,903
It's true that 13 attorneys defended
those 4 defendants,

747
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:03,323
but you were the only one
who worked with all four of them.

748
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,658
Is that a coincidence?

749
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:19,089
What was your name again?

750
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,841
I'm Oh In-kyung with OBN.

751
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,004
Thank you.

752
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,466
Ms. Oh In-kyung with OBN.

753
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,057
The Bobae Savings Bank case
was four years ago.

754
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,977
Why did you suddenly bring it up?

755
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,940
I became a journalist four years ago.

756
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,819
I found out for the first time
when I visited police stations

757
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,530
that so many people commit suicide.

758
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,408
An old father died.

759
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,326
A son who worked at a company died.

760
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,703
A young mother died.

761
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,955
A store-owner lady died.

762
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,836
That winter, there were
too many deaths with similar stories.

763
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,629
Bobae Savings Bank.

764
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,884
People of the working class entrusted
their money to get a little more interest.

765
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,096
How touching.

766
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:57,854
Are those…

767
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:00,940
tears?

768
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,537
Do they know each other?

769
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,789
No clue.

770
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,043
Hwa-young spoke of you from time to time.

771
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,503
"The guest from London."

772
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,922
"The Whartonite." That's you, right?

773
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,466
I think it is.

774
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,472
Did she ever talk about me?

775
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,474
Occasionally.

776
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,559
What did she say?

777
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,525
Oh, my gosh. Seriously.

778
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,820
Look at that sly fox.

779
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,655
I can't stand her.

780
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,783
I hate girls like her.

781
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:52,867
I know, right?

782
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,578
I'll tell you just in case.

783
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,581
I went to a two-year accounting school,

784
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,667
and I'm divorced.

785
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,127
Pardon?

786
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,380
I have a feeling you'll find out soon.

787
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,425
And…

788
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,094
you're the 13th-floor outcast.

789
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,391
-Sorry?
-Hwa-young told me.

790
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,184
That's why you two were friends.

791
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,610
Ms. Oh.

792
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,280
I can't reach Hwa-young.

793
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,740
What do you mean?

794
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,368
She should've returned two days ago.

795
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,789
She would've called if she came back.

796
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,093
Maybe she's tired and sleeping.

797
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,389
Is there any other way to reach her?

798
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,823
SINMU TENEMENT

799
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,398
Hwa-young, are you home?

800
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,276
I came to feed the fish.

801
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,536
Ms. Oh.

802
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,914
-Let me measure your blood alcohol level.
-What?

803
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:04,749
What are you doing?

804
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,460
My colleague is drunk
and disgracing the company.

805
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,003
Do you expect me to do nothing?

806
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:10,755
What's going on?

807
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,633
This is trending right now.

808
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,261
"Oh In-kyung, a reporter,
drunk at a press conference."

809
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,558
Are those tears?

810
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:26,062
Your breathing seems odd.

811
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,648
I smell something too.

812
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,651
Have you been drinking?

813
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:35,947
Is that true?

814
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,457
It is, isn't it?

815
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,885
Stop it. Why are you doing this to me?

816
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,267
I wondered why you used so much mouthwash.

817
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,024
It's tequila.

818
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,402
Move.

819
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,405
Look.

820
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,514
Hwa-young.

821
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm coming in.

822
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:33,559
I'm a penniless high school grad.
A reject with no hopes of getting married.

823
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:38,815
But I wanted to live
with a perfect face at least once.

824
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,403
I don't want to forgive my dad.

825
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,906
If I had more time,

826
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,659
I would've donated all of my money
and left nothing behind.

827
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:10,555
Don't let the company people
come to my funeral.

828
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:20,439
Jin, a woman in her thirties,
took her life on the 17th.

829
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,944
Her home was filled with boxes
of new clothes and shoes.

830
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,321
According to medical records,
she received plastic surgery

831
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:29,282
the day before she died.

832
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:33,786
Her suicide note says she wanted
to live with a perfect face at least once.

833
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:38,040
She said she was traveling a week later,
so I wrote her a medical report.

834
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:42,545
But Jin never showed herself
even after her plastic surgery.

835
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:45,798
She was always very cheerful

836
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,843
and greeted me warmly,

837
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:51,262
so I never knew she had depression.

838
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,847
KANG, CO-WORKER

839
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,016
It's a personality disorder of sorts.

840
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,184
It's when how you want to
be seen by others

841
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,854
differs greatly from your real appearance.

842
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,983
If the difference is too great,
it can lead to things like depression

843
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,860
and addiction to shopping
and plastic surgery.

844
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,822
She must've had severely low self-esteem.

845
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:13,868
What a bunch of nonsense.

846
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:26,964
She always looked scary
because she looked so dark and brooding.

847
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,259
Turns out she was active
on a suicide website for years.

848
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,427
-Suicide website?
-Yes.

849
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,762
This doesn't match.

850
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:33,679
What?

851
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,140
She scares me.

852
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,435
She looks like a ghost. She's so annoying.

853
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,230
Four years ago,

854
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:46,192
when I first started working here,

855
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:50,571
the only person who took time out
to help me was Hwa-young.

856
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:53,741
When I asked her to lunch to thank her,
she told me

857
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,827
I'd become an outcast too
if I ate with her.

858
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,123
Ms. Hwang.

859
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,126
Why did you make her an outcast?

860
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,796
Because she was having an affair?

861
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,805
These are the details of the expenses on
Ms. Hwang Bo-yeon's company credit card.

862
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,224
You watched the musical La Vita
on January 2nd.

863
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,434
On April 3rd, the movie Like a Love Story.

864
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,436
July 5th, you went to La La Land.

865
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,313
August 1st, Jarasum Jazz Festival.

866
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,274
You must've stayed the night.

867
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,610
Right.

868
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,822
Here are the details
for your business trip expenses.

869
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,700
Suncheon Resto Hotel. A double room.

870
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,453
Mr. Shin Dong-hun.

871
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,789
You also went to watch La Vita
on January 2nd

872
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,166
and Like a Love Story on April 3rd.

873
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,752
You went to La La Land on July 5th too.

874
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,880
Oh, my. You also went to Jarasum?

875
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,467
But there's no request
for reimbursement for lodging.

876
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,177
Ms. Oh.

877
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,971
Are you out of your mind?

878
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,265
How dare you make things up?

879
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:02,977
I uploaded what I just read to you
onto our intranet.

880
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,813
You can confirm what I just said there.

881
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,441
ISN'T USING A COMPANY CREDIT CARD
FOR AN AFFAIR EMBEZZLEMENT?

882
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:15,364
And you're the one
who always makes things up.

883
01:07:16,782 --> 01:07:19,744
Did you see Hwa-young
and Director Shin have an affair?

884
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,413
Weren't you just jealous
because she was good at her job?

885
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:25,791
I did see them. I saw them
leave the office together late at night.

886
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,001
They were working late.

887
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,879
-They went to a Michelin Star restaurant.
-To take a guest--

888
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,422
The casino hotel in Gangwon?

889
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,633
They used their vacation days together
to go to Singapore together!

890
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,220
There was an International Orchid Festival
in Singapore.

891
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:44,060
The chairman wanted an orchid
that won the gold medal.

892
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,271
Hwa-young was an expert on orchids.

893
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,775
Ms. Oh In-joo, a word.

894
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,243
I guess you were traumatized

895
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,954
by Ms. Jin's death.

896
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,459
Yes, sir. I was.

897
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:18,969
So was I.

898
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:26,894
That thief was stealing
behind my back for 15 years,

899
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:28,979
but I had no clue.

900
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:33,359
We didn't know she stole 70 billion won
from the Europe office until recently.

901
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,695
No way.

902
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:40,032
Why would someone like her
need 70 billion won?

903
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,452
How could the company not know
70 billion won was missing?

904
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:47,540
If I hadn't studied
all the ledgers by chance,

905
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,833
she'd be in Singapore…

906
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:53,295
enjoying some delicious food right now.

907
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,673
But…

908
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,970
when I cornered her
and said I reported her to the cops,

909
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,305
she left this lame excuse
of a suicide note

910
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,890
and suddenly dropped dead.

911
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,401
It was an elaborate scheme.

912
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,529
We still don't know
how big the actual loss is.

913
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,990
Since this was a slush fund,

914
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,535
we need to look into many things
before reporting it to the police.

915
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:28,205
I hear you were close to that thief.

916
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:31,834
Tell me everything you know.

917
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,920
It'll all get out
once the cops start to investigate.

918
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,630
You're the only one who can help.

919
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,425
You know how Ms. Jin worked
better than anyone.

920
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,760
You're also the only one who knew her

921
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,387
on a personal level.

922
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,522
You're asking me to help you get back

923
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,235
your illegal slush fund, right?

924
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:12,583
I'm sorry,

925
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,419
but I don't want to do
something like that.

926
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,172
I had planned

927
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,259
on quitting today anyway.

928
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,679
I'll pretend I didn't hear any of that.

929
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:51,121
How high can someone from rock bottom go?

930
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,916
What a shame.

931
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,878
I could've shown you
if I had lasted just one more week.

932
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,518
I saw her use mouthwash
several times a day.

933
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:15,187
I think it was five to six times a day.

934
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:19,650
Do you admit
that you have alcohol dependence?

935
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,153
Yes.

936
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:27,992
Will you undergo treatment diligently?

937
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:29,910
Yes.

938
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:36,250
Ms. Oh In-kyung, you degraded the name
and dignity of the OBN newsroom

939
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:39,211
by drinking excessively while on the job.

940
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,463
Thus, you are suspended for a month.

941
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,183
Hello?

942
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,769
Hello, is this Ms. Oh In-joo?

943
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:57,438
Yes, it is.

944
01:11:57,521 --> 01:11:58,897
This is Jayz Yoga.

945
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,027
Ms. Jin Hwa-young transferred
her membership to you.

946
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,903
Come by when you have time.

947
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:22,254
You may use this personal locker
until December 31st.

948
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,674
Yoga uniforms and towels are inside.
Please help yourself.

949
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,509
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

950
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,164
Thanks for everything, In-joo.

951
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:23,041
You were so nice to me.

952
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,713
I hope you and your sisters get to live
in an apartment with nice windows.

953
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,647
What do I have to do?

954
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,566
We are looking for two things.

955
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,860
The 70 billion won that Ms. Jin embezzled

956
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,153
and the slush fund ledger.

957
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:58,071
You sent me an email four years ago.

958
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,616
It was a tip
about Mr. Kim Dal-su's suicide.

959
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,659
Why didn't you report it back then?

960
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:04,119
I waited so long for you to do so.

961
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,246
This is kind of awkward,

962
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,249
but Director Shin only goes
for a certain type of woman.

963
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,668
Women who wear cheap heels.

964
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:14,212
If all of this was Director Shin's plan…

965
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,173
The final step would be…

966
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,424
Just who…

967
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,217
are you?

968
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:25,432
