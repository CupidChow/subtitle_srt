1
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,150
How have you been, Jae-sang?

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,234
It's been a while.

3
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,452
What about you?

4
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,579
You look healthy.

5
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,664
Maybe it's because I've spent
four years at the hospital.

6
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,666
I feel great as if I had a good sleep.

7
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,630
Did you send Ms. Go to kill me?

8
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,466
Let's be frank.
I didn't know what you might do.

9
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,638
Hands up. And stay still.

10
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,321
Mr. Park?

11
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,616
MR. PARK

12
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,742
Ms. Go.

13
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:58,827
It's me, Won Sang-woo.

14
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,495
Mr. Won.

15
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,372
Let me ask for two favors.

16
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,417
Wire a billion dollars
to my bank account in Panama

17
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,919
and prepare 3,000 dollars in cash.

18
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,171
I'm leaving early tomorrow
from Mukho Port.

19
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,006
Easy, right?

20
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,134
I'll go there.

21
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,760
Let's discuss this face-to-face.

22
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,971
Mr. Park.

23
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,890
I'm in a hurry.
You just saw how urgent I am, right?

24
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,562
It'll take about 30 minutes
to bring the cash.

25
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:29,107
The wire will take a couple of hours.
If you lay a hand on him before then…

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,251
You thought this would work?

27
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,503
Did you think
you would make it alive to Panama?

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,172
I should have shot you right away.

29
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,718
I contemplated whether
to go to Panama or kill you.

30
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,387
And I chose Panama.

31
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,431
How foolish of you.

32
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,035
What now, you bastard?

33
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,747
That's the face I wanted to see.

34
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,582
This is you. Your true colors.

35
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,668
You've always wanted to kill me

36
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,795
since the days you used to steal my toys.

37
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,548
You've never made that face
in public, right?

38
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,343
The face of a murderer.

39
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,599
How do you think I came this far?

40
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,232
Do you have any idea
how many I had to kill?

41
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,782
You were simply lucky
to be born into that family.

42
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,910
But I had to prove myself.

43
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,996
That's why I'm here.

44
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,292
You're just like your father.

45
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,920
Under my father's orders,

46
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,005
your father hammered people to death

47
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,465
and ran them over with cars.

48
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,009
He was very obedient

49
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,971
like a loyal dog.

50
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,496
You should have never left the hospital.

51
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,333
Didn't you know
that I'd have to kill you if you did?

52
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,212
I wanted to come out and show everyone

53
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,340
what kind of person you really are.

54
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,844
What kind of person am I?

55
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,352
A thief.

56
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,956
It must've been hard.

57
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,254
You have to tell me that I've done well.

58
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,549
That's all that matters.

59
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,970
Did you think I would tell you otherwise?

60
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,807
This was all

61
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,643
a part of our plan.

62
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,858
There is only one thing left
for you to do now.

63
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:43,986
SLEEPING PILLS

64
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,615
You have to sleep.

65
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,370
Since it will be another busy day
for you tomorrow.

66
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,927
Hyo-rin.

67
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,933
In-joo?

68
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,644
Hyo-rin, where did In-hye go?

69
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,730
I can't reach her
and she isn't in her room.

70
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,524
My mom…

71
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,154
What about your mom?

72
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,406
She said

73
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,367
In-hye ran away to Japan,

74
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:15,828
but I think she took her.

75
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,166
Why?

76
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:24,337
In-hye would never leave me behind
and run away alone.

77
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,880
And Mom is more than capable of…

78
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,007
Hyo-rin.

79
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,884
Where do you think she took her?

80
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,968
Any ideas?

81
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,849
Do you hear that?

82
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,189
Someone is walking up and down the stairs.

83
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,316
My mom

84
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,528
walks up and down the stairs
when she's troubled.

85
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,401
Get up.

86
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,243
Is it time for me to die?

87
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,371
Are you prepared to?

88
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,255
That's what I'd prefer

89
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,174
than to keep living in this place

90
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,885
for 2,922 days.

91
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,471
You'd rather die

92
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,182
than live here?

93
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,185
Please don't tell my sisters and Hyo-rin

94
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,021
that I died.

95
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,068
Tell them I went to an art school
in Russia or the Netherlands.

96
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,071
That I ran away
and kept the money for myself.

97
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,241
If Hyo-rin finds out that you killed me,

98
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,036
she would lose her mind.

99
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,796
I absolutely hate it.

100
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,509
Sorry?

101
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,595
How do you think my life was

102
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,973
during those 2,922 days

103
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,976
that my mom lived here?

104
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,109
I was nine.

105
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,029
Too young to know multiplication.

106
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,239
I needed my mom.

107
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,910
I kept going to school,

108
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,995
my birthday came and went,

109
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,247
Christmas passed by,

110
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,292
and I had my first period.

111
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,089
My father kept sending things
like new clothes, bags,

112
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,716
and shoes to this place.

113
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,428
As if she could leave

114
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,264
as long as she repented.

115
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,395
Why couldn't she leave?

116
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,316
She said that she'd tell
everyone at church

117
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,694
if my father kept killing people.

118
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,660
She wanted to ask God for forgiveness.

119
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,372
She would have kept her word.

120
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,250
But…

121
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,878
whether people died or not,

122
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,881
she should've kept being my mom.

123
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,758
I'm more important

124
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,261
than those people, aren't I?

125
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,514
But despite all that…

126
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,645
things were much better
when she was still alive.

127
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,609
Why did my brother find this

128
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,321
so hard to understand until the end?

129
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,950
All he had to do was apologize

130
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,078
and beg for his life.

131
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,372
He knew he would die.

132
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,124
So why?

133
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,147
Paint this.

134
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,192
You said you wanted to paint, right?

135
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,319
Finish it as soon as possible.

136
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,658
Wait, Ms. Won.

137
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,079
Did something happen today?

138
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,553
Nothing in particular.

139
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,307
Because what happened today
has been happening daily

140
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,768
for the past thousands of days.

141
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,293
Mr. Won isn't around.

142
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,337
I don't see your car either.

143
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
Do you know where he went?

144
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,424
One of my handguns is missing.

145
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,885
He left with a gun?

146
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,011
Without a word?

147
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,272
He ran away.

148
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,483
What do you mean?

149
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,442
Why would he?

150
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,486
He was about to be at the center

151
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,989
of the biggest scandal
this country has seen.

152
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,115
How could he not be afraid?

153
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,745
I don't think that's it.

154
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:34,999
Do you think

155
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,835
he went to kill Park Jae-sang himself?

156
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,214
You're a poor judge of character, Ms. Oh.

157
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,049
Sang-woo can't shoot a gun.

158
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,844
He dropped out of the military academy
because he was too scared to use one.

159
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,806
He is someone
who can't even pick a flower.

160
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,518
You can't do this with the news.

161
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,770
Wars…

162
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,732
are fought using guns.

163
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,347
-In-hye!
-In-joo!

164
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,890
In-hye!

165
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,603
It's all right now. I'm here.

166
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,271
You must have been so scared.

167
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,859
Are you all right?

168
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,571
So this

169
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,865
is the Closed Room.

170
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,909
The Closed Room?

171
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:05,547
RUN AWAY

172
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,430
What is this room?

173
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,062
Let's get out of here.

174
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,360
Let's go, In-hye.

175
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,381
THE BRIGHT FUTURE OF SEOUL

176
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,178
The result of the final poll
will be out soon.

177
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,181
You're at least 20 points ahead
in all the polls.

178
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:01,061
Such a dramatic shift in polls
just before the election is unprecedented.

179
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,647
Did you find out how Sang-woo
escaped from the hospital?

180
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,154
It was Choi Do-il.

181
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,989
He's joined hands with the sisters.

182
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,657
That idiot.

183
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,660
Why did he come back?

184
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:21,874
Maybe he has a thing for Oh In-joo.

185
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,962
Do you think Choi Do-il would risk
his money and his life for some woman?

186
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,047
I suppose not.

187
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,845
He's been seeing Choi Hee-jae.

188
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,889
Sorry?

189
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,599
That's the only explanation.

190
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,226
Ms. An So-yeong is ill, right?

191
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,603
Stage three stomach cancer.

192
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,521
Have her released on parole
and placed in a hospital.

193
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,689
Yes, sir.

194
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,820
Hello, I'm Reporter Oh In-kyung.

195
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,282
I sent you an email regarding a news item
I had been working on before I was fired.

196
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,034
Have you seen it yet?

197
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,495
Yes.

198
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,582
PARK JAE-SANG'S APPROVAL RATING RISES…
CROWDS GATHER IN SUPPORT

199
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,125
Yes, that's right.

200
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,088
He asked his supporters to contribute
to the bright future of Seoul…

201
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,465
Yes, I see.

202
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:16,345
Candidate Park continued to be cordial
as he greeted passersby by reaching out…

203
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,139
You don't have to name me as the source
as long as it gets reported.

204
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,391
If you're interested, I'll send another--

205
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,398
I told you the news
won't be able to help us.

206
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,442
Why do you keep saying that?

207
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,152
You're making her lose spirit.

208
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,908
I'm going to try again, Mr. Choi.

209
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,160
I'll show you what a news report can do.

210
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,205
Citizens did not hold back
in showing support

211
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:47,000
as they shouted "I love you!"
and made finger hearts.

212
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,098
Hyo-rin!

213
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:03,809
Hyo-rin!

214
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,395
Hyo-rin!

215
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,897
Hyo-rin.

216
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,190
Hyo-rin!

217
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,069
Call the chief of security immediately.

218
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,821
Someone took the girls.

219
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,284
How did nobody notice until now
that the girls are gone?

220
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,704
Ma'am, Ms. Oh In-joo is waiting for you.

221
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,018
How dare you come here?

222
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,024
You can be quite ridiculous at times.

223
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,445
I was almost driven insane
when I couldn't reach In-hye.

224
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,740
I thought you'd be worried sick by now.

225
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,742
Did you take Hyo-rin?

226
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,327
Are you here to blackmail me?

227
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,328
Last night,

228
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,998
I came looking for In-hye,
and Hyo-rin followed us.

229
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,750
She looked nervous,

230
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,960
so I was going to send her back
when she calmed down.

231
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,464
But the two of them packed up
and left before dawn,

232
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,673
leaving behind a letter.

233
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,481
MOM

234
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,749
Mom.

235
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,087
Thinking about you had always made me sad

236
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,090
because I could feel
your misery and sorrow

237
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,300
deep inside my heart.

238
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,766
But…

239
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,768
I want to be free from those emotions now.

240
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,939
I just want to live my life.

241
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,454
Two tickets to Fukuoka, please.

242
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,041
Do you have your guardian's consent?

243
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,879
MINOR TRAVEL CONSENT FORM

244
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,673
NAME OF GUARDIAN: WON SANG-A

245
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,091
NAME OF GUARDIAN: OH IN-JOO

246
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,849
That'll be 250,000 won.

247
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,077
When it rains, I'll get wet.

248
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,289
When the wind blows, I'll feel the breeze.

249
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,875
That's how I intend to live.

250
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,210
As an artist.

251
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,347
Don't look for me, Mom.

252
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,309
Nevertheless,

253
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,645
I still love you.

254
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,793
What about In-hye?
Did she leave you a letter?

255
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,003
No.

256
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,422
She left without a word?

257
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,391
I'll contact you when we've settled down.

258
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,726
Oh, my.

259
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,405
You said

260
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,783
a child is the mirror image
of their family.

261
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,288
Why don't we let them live freely
if even for a short while?

262
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,916
It seems like they felt suffocated.

263
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,171
Hyo-rin isn't someone
who can just sleep anywhere.

264
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,381
When she was a baby,

265
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,009
I could never put her down
because she was too sensitive.

266
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,303
She'll be back in a month.

267
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,222
At the very most,
she'll be back in a year.

268
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,099
Or…

269
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:41,438
I'll send someone
to watch over her in secret.

270
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,986
Of all the children I know,

271
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,407
Hyo-rin is the kindest
and the most considerate.

272
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,327
I'm sure she'll live a good life.

273
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,709
Anyway, Ms. Oh.

274
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,545
It probably wasn't easy
for you to come here.

275
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,380
Let's call a truce today.

276
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,968
I'll make up an excuse for her dad.

277
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,429
And since you're here,

278
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,389
let me give you some advice.

279
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,311
Do you trust Choi Do-il?

280
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,107
Oh, my.

281
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,068
You do.

282
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,694
That con man?

283
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,113
Wake up, Ms. Oh.

284
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,659
If I were you, I would immediately
take my reporter sister

285
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,494
and go abroad.

286
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,790
You should be looking after
your money right now.

287
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,636
Did you see the email I sent you?

288
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,390
I have the follow-up reports
and I can explain them to you in person.

289
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,392
I see.

290
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:05,063
But I'm looking for a channel
that can report this before the election.

291
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,066
Let me know if you change your mind.

292
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:08,984
Thanks.

293
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,703
In-kyung.

294
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,122
I'm just asking, okay?

295
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,666
What is it?

296
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,210
If I asked you

297
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,882
to leave everything for a moment
and travel abroad with me,

298
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,925
what will you say?

299
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,473
In-joo.

300
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,226
You can always leave without me.

301
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,981
I can fully support your decision,
just as I hope for In-hye's happiness.

302
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,608
So…

303
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,987
can you do the same for me?

304
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,116
The victims of the savings bank,

305
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,160
the informants who faced sudden deaths,

306
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,495
everyone who took this journey with me,

307
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,414
and…

308
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,751
our great-aunt.

309
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:12,797
I now realize that they have been with me
from a long time ago.

310
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,967
At this moment,

311
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,802
I can't go anywhere.

312
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,098
Sorry.

313
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,642
I shouldn't have brought it up.

314
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,086
In-kyung.

315
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,426
What's wrong?

316
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,133
TYPE, NAME, GAUGE, AMMO

317
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,509
What's this?

318
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,136
If I don't make it home tomorrow,

319
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,096
my truck…

320
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,353
-I refuse.
-I've collected them for 20 years.

321
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,773
From the Vietnam War to the Iraq War.

322
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,859
Handguns, rifles, machine guns,
grenades, incendiary bombs, mortars--

323
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,946
Mr. Choi Hee-jae.

324
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,824
For the last 20 years,

325
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,660
I tried my best to live a life
that doesn't require weapons.

326
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,122
And what pisses me off the most

327
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,375
is when some stranger
acts like he's my father.

328
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,213
Let's not make small talk.

329
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,548
We aren't here to chat.

330
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,561
Your mother tried to kill herself.
She's at Wonryeong Medical Center.

331
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,271
She needs a guardian's consent
for emergency surgery.

332
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,197
911 EMERGENCY RESCUE

333
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,962
It's all your fault.

334
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,007
She bit her tongue so hard
that she almost died due to shock.

335
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,467
Ms. Go almost died from the shock too.

336
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:28,970
How is that my fault?

337
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,972
She refused parole for several years

338
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,892
because she didn't want
to be a burden to you.

339
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,353
But she became scared when she saw Ms. Go.

340
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:41,900
"They're going to take me
to blackmail or coax my son."

341
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:47,113
Your mother is a very strong
and brave woman.

342
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,868
So am I here to be blackmailed or coaxed?

343
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,871
I know you.

344
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,665
I was the one who took you to the States
when you were 12.

345
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,683
The day before you left,

346
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,895
General Won asked you what your wish was

347
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,231
as your orchid was put on the Father Tree.

348
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,025
To live

349
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,986
with my mom later in life.

350
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,323
And…

351
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,288
getting revenge on my father.

352
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,961
Your father was a traitor.

353
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,588
He disobeyed the order to kill
and ran away.

354
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,591
But your mother took on the burden
and became a murderer

355
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,511
to convince us
to let you join Jeongran Society.

356
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,848
Let's not talk about that.

357
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,851
It was only a child's wish.

358
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,731
I had never seen anyone like you.

359
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,402
You studied hard
and continued to rise up the ranks.

360
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,407
You even impressed the Russian mafia,
enough to be called a vicious wolfling.

361
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,660
I was proud of you
as if you were my own son.

362
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,829
So what are you doing now?

363
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,706
Just cut to the chase.

364
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,875
So are you blackmailing me or coaxing me?

365
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,377
It's neither.

366
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,753
I'm giving you a chance.

367
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,089
Anyone can go astray at times.

368
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,468
Have you been meeting your father?

369
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,929
What are you planning with him?

370
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,348
Look at your mother.

371
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,436
She even committed murder for you
and spent half of her life in prison.

372
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,439
She has now bit her tongue
and is hospitalized.

373
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,482
Who will you choose?

374
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:53,406
There's nothing more powerful than a wish
that was left unfulfilled for that long.

375
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,701
I'll make your wish come true.

376
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,413
Bring me your father,
and I'll let you leave with your mother.

377
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,292
She has stage three stomach cancer.

378
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,794
She refuses to be treated,

379
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,213
but you'll be able to save her
if you take her now.

380
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,352
Can you make it so that
we can leave immediately?

381
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,438
And promise never to look for me again.

382
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,023
And keep your hands…

383
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,900
off of my money.

384
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,571
Then I'll tell you my father's plan.

385
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,243
Of course, I can.

386
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,245
I won't look for you.

387
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,790
But you're free to come back anytime.

388
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,502
To be honest,

389
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,046
that money disappoints me.

390
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,050
You're going to leave me
for a mere 70 billion won?

391
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,305
Right, are you going to take Oh In-joo?

392
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,434
Me? Take Oh In-joo?

393
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,188
I'm sure you wrote up a contract
so that you could proceed without her.

394
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,482
I've seen hundreds of contracts you wrote.

395
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,902
I just need a power of attorney.

396
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,695
Then it's over.

397
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,282
I was right. You owe me 500 won.

398
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,662
She said you had feelings for Oh In-joo.

399
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,622
I bet 500 won that you didn't.

400
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,902
We need to move the money to a safe place.

401
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,657
Director Won Sang-a began tracing
your paper company.

402
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,745
I'll personalize the corporate fund
and turn it into assets.

403
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,705
Sign there.

404
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,624
What do I have to sign now?

405
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,212
Good grief.

406
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,339
It's all in English.

407
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,303
Hold on, let me take a look.

408
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,140
I have no idea what it says.

409
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,946
I think she should sign this one.

410
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,699
Yes, it looks like a necessary step.

411
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,041
I took a photo just in case.

412
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,375
Sign it, In-joo.

413
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:09,310
OH IN-JOO

414
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,662
I'll begin by taking the power of attorney
from Oh In-joo, Mr. Park.

415
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,131
Yes, he just got the power of attorney.

416
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,945
The sniper rifles are installed
in three locations.

417
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:03,322
It's so that he has options
for when things don't go as planned.

418
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,618
He will be staying up all night nearby.

419
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,999
He's fully armed
and on full alert right now.

420
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,001
It'll be dangerous to approach him
while he's in position.

421
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,092
Give this to Mr. Lee Yong-gwi
in person, okay?

422
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,808
You must lure him out to a quiet place.

423
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,856
Mr. Choi Hee-jae has been wondering

424
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:40,484
what he'll do with his precious weapons
after he has accomplished his mission.

425
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,868
Mr. Lee Yong-gwi of Vietnam War Survivors

426
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,870
will make him a tempting offer.

427
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,621
Hello?

428
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,125
He'll offer to buy them all
for a great price to use for a good cause.

429
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,849
I should be on the plane by then.

430
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,278
And I will never return.

431
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,744
JONGIL DAILY
VIETNAM WAR SURVIVORS

432
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,584
Is this you, Mr. Lee?

433
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,502
Yes.

434
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,927
It must've been extremely hot.

435
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,637
It was.

436
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,600
But on that day,

437
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,228
I put on a bit of a show.

438
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:46,861
There's Mr. Choi.

439
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,428
Mr. Choi!

440
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,680
Mr. Choi, are you okay?

441
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,973
Mr. Choi.

442
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,684
Please save him!

443
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,108
RECENT CALLS
MR. CHOI DO-IL

444
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,780
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected after the tone.

445
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,582
It went well.
I'll be heading home after the broadcast.

446
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,418
What time will it be on air again?

447
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,378
In about 20 minutes.

448
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,671
It's a live broadcast.

449
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,423
Did you know?

450
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,594
I love your voice
when you've succeeded at something.

451
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,722
I've always loved your voice regardless.

452
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,724
Even more so when you're complimenting me.

453
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,566
It doesn't matter where you are
or whatever you're doing.

454
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,193
You need to call me right away.

455
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,946
Your father is badly hurt.

456
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,963
What's this?

457
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,006
GUEST WAITING ROOM
REPORTER OH IN-KYUNG

458
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,102
It's currently live, sir.
You can't go inside.

459
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,244
We've invited her on short notice.

460
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:04,582
Oh In-kyung, a freelance reporter,
is here with me in the studio.

461
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,959
-Hello.
-Hello.

462
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,170
Please introduce us
to the guest you're here with today.

463
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:16,176
She is Ms. An So-yeong,
who served 24 years in prison

464
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,138
as the culprit
in the 1998 Hongsin-dong murder case.

465
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,184
Her tongue was sutured this morning,

466
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,686
so she's unable to speak.

467
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,230
I'll be speaking on her behalf.

468
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,356
I see.

469
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,611
I'm sure the viewers
are wondering why you two are here

470
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,195
at the studio today.

471
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,240
This was a case

472
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,992
where an ordinary housewife
brutally murdered

473
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,995
a compensation committee's chairman
with a hammer.

474
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,707
We came today to disclose
the real culprit behind this case.

475
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,710
So the real culprit is still at large?

476
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:55,257
We recently found vital evidence
related to this case

477
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,301
and submitted it for DNA testing.

478
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,720
As you can see,
the blood, hair, and tissue

479
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:04,475
found on the head of the hammer
definitely belong to the victim, Yoo.

480
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,186
But what's important is the handle.

481
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,481
The skin tissue left on the wooden handle

482
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,400
was analyzed once again
through a new method called SNP.

483
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,362
And the test result showed

484
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,032
that the skin tissue belonged
to someone other than Ms. An So-yeong.

485
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:24,036
Then who does it belong to?

486
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,249
Mr. Park Il-bok.

487
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,502
The father of Lawyer Park Jae-sang,

488
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,879
the Civil Party's mayoral candidate.

489
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,634
I see.

490
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,220
If this is true,
it'll come as quite a shock.

491
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:46,266
Then why did you not reveal this fact
and spend over 20 years in prison?

492
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,446
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH REPORTER OH IN-KYUNG

493
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,581
"I wasn't the first
or the last person they've used."

494
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,127
"This case was just the beginning."

495
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,843
Just as Ms. Oh said,
did Mr. Park Jae-sang's father…

496
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,094
My gosh, Mr. Choi!

497
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,011
What's going on?

498
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,430
I thought you were hurt.

499
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,266
I am hurt, but…

500
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,434
Grab your things. Let's go.

501
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,699
What's going on?
You owe me an explanation.

502
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,951
We'll talk on the way.
There will be people barging in soon.

503
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,369
Wait…

504
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,414
Could you summarize your story for us?

505
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,709
After the chairman, who was against
the redevelopment, was murdered,

506
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,004
Wonryeong Construction made
over two trillion won

507
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,214
thanks to the redevelopment
of Hongsin-dong.

508
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,342
Could the murder have simply been
a coincidence?

509
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:07,347
And could this have been
Mr. Park's first and only murder?

510
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,854
I'll share the answers to such questions
one by one, starting tomorrow.

511
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,898
That won't happen.
She won't be on tomorrow.

512
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:18,650
We have too many stories for tomorrow,

513
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,612
so we'll invite you back
if we get another chance.

514
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,240
I'll be here as soon as
you give me a call.

515
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,374
How can you make me look like such a fool?

516
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,127
Why did you do this without telling me?

517
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,754
What do you take me for?

518
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,589
Everything happened all at once.

519
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,299
I didn't have the time to tell you.

520
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,927
But in the midst of chaos,

521
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,970
you've managed to pull off
a very important role.

522
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:50,098
What was it?

523
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,102
What important role did I play?

524
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:58,649
My story began the moment you gave me
the evidence of the real culprit.

525
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,612
Your mother, Ms. An So-yeong.

526
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,491
This is where you should go
to find evidence.

527
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,516
I went to get it
as soon as I returned from Singapore.

528
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,650
HAN SEUNG-EOP GENETICS LAB

529
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,402
Then I ran a DNA test on it.

530
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,159
The Hongsin-dong murder case…

531
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,580
This is the DNA test result
from the new evidence.

532
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,925
THE DNA MARKERS ON OBJECT 4
MATCHES OBJECT 7,

533
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,468
MAKING THEM BIOLOGICALLY RELATED

534
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,430
I planned on preparing for a retrial
to blow it up slowly,

535
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,434
but the time came for me
to make a quick decision.

536
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,606
She has stage three stomach cancer.

537
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,190
She refuses to be treated,

538
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,568
but you'll be able to save her
if you take her now.

539
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,488
Can you make it so that
we can leave immediately?

540
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,329
I had to put on a bug
to prove that I wouldn't trick him.

541
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,502
On the power of attorney,

542
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,254
I wrote out our situation
and future plans.

543
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,256
I have no idea what it says.

544
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,977
I think she should sign this one.

545
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,521
Yes, it looks like a necessary step.

546
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:03,732
OH IN-JOO

547
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,364
They are quick-witted and competent.

548
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,865
-Thank you.
-So I knew we'd be able to

549
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,242
file for a retrial
and find a TV station to go on.

550
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,086
But I wondered what I should do
with Mr. Choi.

551
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,798
It would have been best
just to let him die,

552
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,551
but I decided to
put my bet on you, Ms. Oh.

553
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,228
HELLO, I'M CHOI DO-IL,
MR. CHOI HEE-JAE'S SON

554
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,688
WE ARE CURRENTLY BEING FOLLOWED…

555
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:48,443
Sergeant Kim, did you say
your brother runs a hospital?

556
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,363
He accepts fake patients, right?

557
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,366
Vietnam War Survivors
would be able to help us

558
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,326
with the hospital, ambulance, and makeup.

559
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,496
But in order to make it look real,

560
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,998
I needed someone who would believe
that all of it was real.

561
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,589
Is that his daughter?

562
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,650
It would've been dangerous
if you caught wind of it.

563
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,069
You've done well until the end.

564
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,947
I absolutely hate you.

565
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,907
It was an awful thing to put you through.

566
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,452
It was too heartbreaking.

567
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,454
I'm very sorry.

568
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,998
That's even more annoying.

569
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,341
Sir, I didn't know.

570
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,927
The higher-ups organized it
right before we went on air.

571
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,514
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you beforehand.

572
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,478
I don't know how high up they are,

573
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,857
but don't you know this decision could
put an end to this broadcasting station?

574
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,029
Reporting on fake news during an election
is a serious crime.

575
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,114
Mr. Park Jae-sang.

576
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,748
You know that it's all true.

577
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,708
Why are you taking it out on them?

578
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:29,920
There's something I've wondered about you.

579
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:33,006
"Is she in her right mind?"

580
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:36,301
"How much did she have to drink
to blurt out such nonsense?"

581
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,180
Confirm this for me
before the reporters here.

582
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,183
Didn't you admit yourself
to a mental institution a few days ago,

583
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,768
only to escape after a day?

584
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,354
Am I right or wrong?

585
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,064
That was to go undercover
for an interview--

586
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,023
You're right.

587
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,152
Do you finally get what you've done?

588
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,822
You were fooled by a delusional patient.

589
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,699
The election is around the corner,
and you did irreparable damage.

590
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,078
We'll be taking legal action right away.

591
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,081
I'm not delusional.

592
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,292
And you're welcome to take legal action.

593
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:13,046
I can explain the mental institution too.

594
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,674
But I'll do that on the news tomorrow.

595
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,386
I get that you want me
to lose the election,

596
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,181
but you've crossed the line
by accusing my father of murder.

597
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,518
I'm not trying
to make you lose the election.

598
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,187
I'm trying to show them
what kind of person you truly are.

599
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,440
Even if you were elected as mayor today,

600
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,984
I still would've reported this.

601
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,363
People deserve to know who it is
that they elected as mayor.

602
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:40,740
Regardless of who my father actually is,

603
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,494
what does it have to do
with the kind of person I am?

604
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:46,413
In that case,

605
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:50,083
should I have disclosed
that you're also a murderer?

606
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,383
Give it some time.

607
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,887
I work slowly but I always hit my mark.

608
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,098
You should hurry.

609
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,060
You're about to be on the news
as a mentally ill criminal.

610
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,620
He kept nagging me

611
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,623
and told me not to fall asleep
at the hospital

612
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,541
just in case you fall in danger.

613
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,127
I'm sorry.

614
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,588
I'm someone quite important to him.

615
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,633
I'm a walking 70 billion won, so to say.

616
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:41,509
So I told him,

617
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:46,723
"There is no safer place
in this world than by my side."

618
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,810
One second.

619
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,732
What is it?

620
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,858
Police.

621
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,902
We received a report
on illegal firearm possession.

622
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,445
We'll need to conduct a search.

623
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,199
Drop the bag. Hands up.

624
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,224
Take him away.

625
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,145
Mr. Choi…

626
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,239
The police have arrested Choi,
a man in his sixties,

627
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,241
for illegal firearm possession.

628
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,035
Investigations began after a tip-off

629
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,706
that Choi was planning
to assassinate mayoral candidate Park.

630
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,750
Meanwhile, the case sparked controversy
when it was revealed

631
00:54:55,834 --> 00:55:00,547
that a former TV reporter had
allegedly been with Choi until yesterday.

632
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,176
The police will further investigate
the possibility of their collusion--

633
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,140
Only three or four outlets published
articles on the Hongsin-dong murder,

634
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,475
while 14 news outlets,
including TV stations,

635
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,979
reported on the possible involvement
of Oh In-kyung in the assassination.

636
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,230
Things seem positive.

637
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,232
The retrial hasn't reached a verdict,

638
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,277
and evidence can always be tampered with.

639
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,156
You've even gained more supporters
thanks to this incident.

640
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,956
The moment you've all been waiting for.

641
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,251
The man who suddenly appeared
before us like a typhoon

642
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:40,545
and turned our world upside down.

643
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,634
A CANDIDATE WHO LOOKS AFTER THE PEOPLE

644
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,845
PARK JAE-SANG, SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE

645
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,807
Introducing Candidate Park Jae-sang
of the Civil Party!

646
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,813
Park Jae-sang!

647
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:16,915
Thank you.

648
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,210
What is fear?

649
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,920
It's on.

650
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,466
Some people do not want me to be elected.

651
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,637
They use all kinds of underhanded
and revolting ways

652
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,639
to stop me from becoming mayor.

653
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,518
What is it that such people fear?

654
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,605
MAIN POWER ON

655
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:42,690
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

656
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,150
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

657
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,570
PLAY

658
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,160
-Wait, what's that?
-What is that?

659
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,760
What now, you bastard?

660
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,264
That's the face I wanted to see.

661
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,724
This is you. Your true colors.

662
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:21,104
You've always wanted to kill me
since the days you used to steal my toys.

663
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,190
You've never made that face
in public, right?

664
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,985
The face of a murderer.

665
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,195
-What's going on?
-We were hacked.

666
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,655
Turn it off, now!

667
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,115
Turn it off. Hurry.

668
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,957
So this is it.

669
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,129
-The horrendously cold face of a murderer.
-What was that?

670
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:50,133
-They are afraid of my power.
-You've finally seen it too.

671
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:55,096
I thought you were crazy,
but now everyone has finally seen

672
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,265
what only you saw.

673
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,516
I represent change.

674
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,018
I represent innovation.

675
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,020
So this is what the news can do.

676
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,314
I was worried

677
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,357
that I would fail.

678
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,194
I knew you could do it.

679
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,578
You're someone who beats typhoons.

680
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,706
And Park Jae-sang is a typhoon.

681
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:37,972
I am the final wave

682
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,726
in the series of waves
that my father's father created

683
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,520
that arduously marched to shore.

684
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,067
What the…

685
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,236
-What's happening?
-Oh, my goodness.

686
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,701
How do you think I came this far?

687
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,580
Do you have any idea
how many I had to kill?

688
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,626
You were simply lucky
to be born into that family.

689
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,754
But I had to prove myself.

690
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,340
That's why I'm here.

691
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,384
What the hell? Didn't you switch it off?

692
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,970
We did, but there must be
a secondary power source.

693
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:20,640
Cut the cables or cut the power off
in the entire block!

694
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:21,891
Hey, cut the cables.

695
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,435
You're just like your father.

696
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,021
Under my father's orders,

697
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,567
your father hammered people to death
and ran them over with cars.

698
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,152
He was very obedient

699
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,738
like a loyal dog.

700
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,428
You should have never left the hospital.

701
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,972
Didn't you know
that I'd have to kill you if you did?

702
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:03,975
I wanted to come out and show everyone

703
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,394
what kind of person you really are.

704
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,521
What kind of person am I?

705
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,273
A thief.

706
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,776
Hey, pull everything out.

707
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,455
-What was that?
-Explain yourself!

708
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,749
Don't be fooled, everyone!

709
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,750
It's not true!

710
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,044
-Carry on.
-Continue with the program.

711
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,879
The truth will be revealed soon!

712
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,505
Please trust me!

713
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,365
You're here with us once again,

714
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,200
Reporter Oh In-kyung.

715
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,871
Let's watch the footage you've prepared.

716
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:53,543
This is a video of Mr. Won Sang-woo,
Wonryeong Industry's former CEO

717
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,170
and the current CEO of Orchid E&C,

718
01:01:56,713 --> 01:02:00,883
being murdered that was recorded
and stored online three days ago by him.

719
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,387
You're awesome, In-kyung.

720
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,057
We ask about the source
as there may be an ethical issue.

721
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,892
I was acquainted with Mr. Won Sang-woo

722
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,019
while covering
the Bobae Savings Bank incident.

723
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,480
I received an email two days ago

724
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,859
that Mr. Won must have scheduled
to be sent beforehand.

725
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,324
It's me, Won Sang-woo.

726
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,415
This is the only way, Ms. Oh.

727
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:33,875
Trust me.

728
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,670
Even if we kill Park Jae-sang,
will the world really change?

729
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,675
I'll show everyone
the kind of person he really is.

730
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,594
How he kills people.

731
01:02:45,636 --> 01:02:47,180
DOWNLOADING

732
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,316
And why he kills them.

733
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,779
According to Mr. Won Sang-woo,

734
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,240
the bankruptcy of Bobae Savings Bank
had been meticulously orchestrated.

735
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,037
Park Jae-sang intentionally drove
Bobae Savings Bank into bankruptcy

736
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,957
so that he wouldn't have to pay back
the illegal loans of 400 billion won.

737
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,751
And in order to keep this secret,

738
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,546
he made Mr. Kim Dal-su
and four other staff commit suicide.

739
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:26,219
This is what he meant when he said
that he "proved himself" in the video.

740
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,971
I will give a detailed follow-up report
on this incident

741
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:31,933
the next time I'm on air.

742
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,019
That's my sister.

743
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,233
So does that mean you intend
to make another appearance?

744
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:01,212
Today, I'd like to address
the humiliating accusations

745
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:05,967
made by a certain reporter
against Candidate Park Jae-sang's father.

746
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,427
The video shown
during the campaign yesterday

747
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,305
had been fabricated
using deepfake technology.

748
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:14,267
We requested the police
to open an investigation into the matter

749
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,520
and to find the culprit
who hacked the campaign's system.

750
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:21,941
We believe the truth
will be revealed in the near future.

751
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,318
We took an emergency poll.

752
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,905
Only half of the people
believe the video from yesterday.

753
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,908
But this doesn't affect
the voters directly.

754
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:34,912
Although your approval rating is down,
you're still in the lead.

755
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,498
Her claims are completely made up.

756
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:41,252
Candidate Park's father suffered
from a chronic illness after Agent Orange,

757
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:43,754
so he did not have
full control over his body.

758
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,097
The election day has come to an end
after many different issues.

759
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,267
The result of the exit poll
will be announced soon.

760
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:59,270
We have Reporter Jang Ma-ri
at the Civil Party's campaign office.

761
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:00,271
Reporter Jang Ma-ri?

762
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:04,066
Yes, I'm at the Civil Party's
campaign office in Yeouido.

763
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,777
Recently, Park Jae-sang of Civil Party

764
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,655
continued to hold his place
in the lead by a large margin.

765
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,325
But due to a series of issues
he faced before the election,

766
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,036
it is now uncertain
how he will fare in the election.

767
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:17,914
The result of the exit poll
is about to be announced.

768
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:22,209
The results of the exit poll are in.
With a total of 48.4 percent of the votes,

769
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,837
Park Jae-sang of Civil Party
is in first place.

770
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:31,135
With the announcement of the result,
the Civil Party campaign office

771
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:33,054
was flooded with cheers of excitement.

772
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,848
The result shows that Candidate Park
was still in the lead

773
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,142
-with 48.4 percent…
-You've done well.

774
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,937
It's time to start all over again.

775
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,941
His total amount of votes overtakes
that of Candidate Hwang.

776
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:48,653
The two candidates are set apart
with a difference of 26.7 percent.

777
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:50,696
Provided that no further issues await him,

778
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,158
Candidate Park's victory in the election
seems to have been set in stone.

779
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,619
Will the tables end up turning?

780
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,121
Stay tuned and watch
the ballot count until the end.

781
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,316
Thanks to the fervent request
of our viewers,

782
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,985
we invited her back to the studio.

783
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,403
Reporter Oh In-kyung.

784
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:33,239
Any thoughts about the exit poll today?

785
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,449
Well…

786
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,452
We have breaking news.

787
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,579
Let's have a look at the video.

788
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:55,469
CIVIL PARTY CANDIDATE PARK JAE-SANG
COMMITS SUICIDE AT ABANDONED BUILDING

789
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:59,473
Thirty minutes ago,
the police received a report

790
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:02,351
that someone had committed suicide
at an abandoned building.

791
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,229
They have now identified the man
who fell to his death

792
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:06,856
as Candidate Park of the Civil Party.

793
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:10,276
He seems to have thrown himself
to death thirty minutes ago.

794
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,862
THE CHOICE OF SEOUL CITIZENS

795
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:15,740
This question now seems inevitable.

796
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:16,824
Ms. Oh In-kyung.

797
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,247
Candidate Park's suicide…

798
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,876
Do you think it has anything to do
with the video you released yesterday?

799
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,216
Ms. Oh?

800
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:38,721
Well…

801
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:41,807
I…

802
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,743
Ms. Oh seems to be in too much shock.

803
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,912
We'll hear her response
after a short break.

804
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,957
Hello?

805
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,500
Why did you ignore my advice?

806
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,378
I told you I won't just sit around.

807
01:08:56,423 --> 01:09:00,010
You better look forward to
what's going to happen now.

808
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,956
MR. CHOI DO-IL

809
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:35,129
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected after the--

810
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,691
What?

811
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,069
What the…

812
01:10:49,828 --> 01:10:52,498
MOM, THINKING ABOUT YOU
HAD ALWAYS MADE ME SAD…

813
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:16,272
In-hye sent you a package.

814
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,607
As soon as I heard
that Park Jae-sang had died,

815
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:22,278
-the 70 billion disappeared…
-We need to stay alert, In-joo.

816
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,487
Mr. Choi Do-il.

817
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,906
He knows that I unwittingly…

818
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,741
Does that mean I have permission

819
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,953
-to kill Oh In-joo and Oh In-kyung?
-That makes things easier for us.

820
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,415
It means we can just
bury them on the spot.

821
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:37,293
Is there something else
I need to do for you?

822
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,211
If you hurt In-kyung…

823
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,964
If you so much as harm a hair on her head,

824
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,216
I won't hold back!

825
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,305
