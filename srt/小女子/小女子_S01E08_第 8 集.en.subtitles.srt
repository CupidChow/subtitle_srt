1
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,848
I'll give you an important task

2
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,517
to show you that I still trust you.

3
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,776
Get rid of Ms. Oh In-joo.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,280
As quickly and as neatly as you can.

5
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,331
When can you do it by?

6
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,709
I'll get it done by tomorrow.

7
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,587
That quickly?

8
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,256
There might be problems
if we do it here in Korea,

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,175
so I'll deal with her somewhere far off.

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,428
Ms. Oh will voluntarily leave the country
never to return,

11
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,641
and her sisters will have no idea
that she has died.

12
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,392
How does that sound?

13
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,897
Is that possible?

14
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,358
We're going to Singapore for work.

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,946
I like it.

16
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,989
I like it so much

17
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,617
that I'll be disappointed
if it doesn't go as planned.

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,541
If Oh In-joo is still alive
by tomorrow midnight,

19
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,459
you will die.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,672
I can trust you, right?

21
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,427
I received an email from Singapore.

22
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,348
It says that the preview of the auction
was attended by many VIPs

23
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,809
including Ms. Oh In-joo from Korea.

24
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,314
That's…

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,692
Hwa-young.

26
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,569
Is Ms. Jin Hwa-young

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,738
really dead?

28
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,408
Yes.

29
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,119
I saw her dead body with my own eyes.

30
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,414
She's definitely dead.

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,421
We have a problem.

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,507
Rumor has it that the paper company
that I set up under your name

33
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,801
is going to be investigated.

34
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,221
Then what will happen?

35
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,515
They might freeze the accounts.

36
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,641
But the bigger problem is

37
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,729
that the fake Oh In-joo might take
the 70 billion won herself.

38
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,192
Is it really possible…

39
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,780
that Hwa-young is still alive?

40
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,908
I'm on my way to the airport.

41
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,744
I'm going to Singapore to find out.

42
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,205
Are you coming with me or not?

43
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,002
I am.

44
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,010
Open the door.

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,203
I didn't want to hurt you.

47
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,872
But you must understand

48
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,417
that we have a goal
to stand in the highest place together.

49
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,046
But your actions are
getting in the way of our goal.

50
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,966
I had no choice.

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,973
But still, how could you lock me up?

52
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,768
How could you do this to me?

53
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,314
Just until tomorrow.

54
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,318
Take your meds and behave yourself
for just one more night.

55
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,112
And you'll be free tomorrow.

56
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,822
Nobody knows you were locked up.

57
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,075
The PR team covered it up with the photos
and videos they had prepared.

58
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:48,288
Tomorrow, you'll stand before the public
at your most extravagant.

59
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,915
You love being live on TV.

60
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,418
Live?

61
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,300
What should I wear?

62
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,095
I shouldn't look too sexy, right?

63
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,806
It would be nice for people to know

64
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,517
how sexy the woman I'm married to is.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,774
You must promise

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,402
that you'll protect me

67
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,113
no matter what happens.

68
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:27,577
That's a promise that we've had
since I was in middle school.

69
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,162
Didn't you know that?

70
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,962
Why do you think I was at this protest?

71
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,048
Because I was frustrated.

72
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,593
Nobody apologized to us.

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,553
They apologized to Vietnamese civilians

74
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,638
and even to the Viet Cong,

75
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,140
but not to us.

76
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,642
We wanted people to know
how frustrated we were.

77
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:56,355
This was used just for show,
not to cause actual harm.

78
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,441
But look.

79
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,403
A car suddenly drove in.

80
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,239
-Apologize to us!
-Apologize!

81
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,116
Take responsibility!

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,993
-Take responsibility!
-Take responsibility!

83
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,579
It blew up after five seconds.

84
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,674
This is who Choi Hee-jae is.

85
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,305
So Mr. Choi Hee-jae
didn't discuss this with you beforehand--

86
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,142
There's no way he'd do that.
He's a lone wolf.

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,354
At first, nobody knew who he was.

88
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,317
I found out later that he was
a part of that operation in 1967.

89
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,655
The operation that recruited
only the bravest and most agile soldiers.

90
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,032
That secret operation?

91
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,492
In our best battles,

92
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,286
the kill-to-death ratio
for Korean troops was 20:1.

93
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,623
That's twenty Viet Cong killed
for one Korean soldier dead.

94
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,543
But those men had
a kill-to-death ratio of 100:1.

95
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,879
No one thought they'd make it back alive,

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,340
but those men did.

97
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,177
However, they all came back
as different men.

98
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,222
How so?

99
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,765
Some say they were possessed.

100
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,893
Possessed?

101
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,857
By the orchid ghost.

102
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,373
OH IN-JOO

103
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,168
In-joo?

104
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,172
I'm on my way to Singapore, In-kyung.

105
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,548
Right now?

106
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,216
Something urgent came up.

107
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,846
So I was wondering if you could come
to Singapore either today or tomorrow.

108
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,307
What are you suddenly saying?

109
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,311
Then how am I going to cover this case?

110
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,854
How will I finish up the story?

111
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:05,193
You can cover this story any day

112
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,736
as long as you're alive.

113
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,071
I'm just trying to prepare for the worst.

114
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,284
It doesn't have to be right now,
but at least be ready to leave.

115
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,996
And have your emergency phone
charged around the clock.

116
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,831
Pass this on to In-hye too, okay?

117
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,588
This is driving me insane.

118
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,469
There are a total of 12 CCTV cameras here.

119
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,889
None are in the rooms.
Most are installed along the corridors.

120
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,767
This is what gets sent
to the security company.

121
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,275
If you do this, the footage
from the last 30 minutes gets copied.

122
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,533
And this is what
the security company will see.

123
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,289
Did you just hack this?

124
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,253
Does manipulating your own computer
count as hacking?

125
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,484
How do you know all the passcodes?

126
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,696
No one ever bothered to hide them from me.

127
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,742
Panama.

128
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,911
The Virgin Islands.

129
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,581
Switzerland.

130
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,457
Singapore.

131
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,501
These accounts are all yours?

132
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,544
Yes.

133
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,755
I'll be free to use them as I like
after my birthday this year.

134
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,645
Is this where we'll be staying?

135
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,147
It's so beautiful.

136
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,027
The auction will be held here tomorrow
in Vanilla Hall.

137
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,945
I have to go to the office

138
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,281
to see what's going on
and find a countermeasure.

139
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,201
Check in using this
along with your passport.

140
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,163
Aren't you coming with me?

141
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,998
I'll pick you up before the auction.

142
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,792
Get some rest until then.

143
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,783
I wonder what's wrong.

144
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,828
TRANSLATOR

145
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:26,787
LANGUAGE: KOREAN

146
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,112
I do not speak English.
Could you please speak into this?

147
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,284
One second.

148
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,800
I mean, it's not that big of a deal.

149
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,178
Me?

150
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,566
I see.

151
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,038
If the father is a monster,

152
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,332
will the child become one too?

153
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,001
I'm not sure.

154
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,420
Isn't it better to be a monster
than to be ordinary?

155
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,714
I've thought for a long time

156
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,301
that I'm not sure what I'll become
if I live in this house.

157
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,096
Whether you become
a monster or an ordinary girl,

158
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,807
you need to be yourself first.

159
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,684
And to be yourself,

160
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,937
there's only one way.

161
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,233
By escaping from this house.

162
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,719
Mom.

163
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,227
Hyo-rin.

164
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,359
Mom, did it hurt?

165
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
Are you all right?

166
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,156
My baby.

167
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,493
Did you come because you were worried?

168
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,288
You were alone in a closed room.
I thought you might…

169
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,420
I thought you might be lonely.

170
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,715
How thoughtful of you.

171
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,636
I've been well.

172
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,098
It's been a while
since I last ate and slept like this.

173
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,227
I saw the letter you sent to In-joo.

174
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,438
You're taking us to Singapore.

175
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,151
-Right.
-I'm all ready.

176
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,778
I have cash and my foreign bankbooks.

177
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,071
I'll take you there.

178
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,741
When should we leave?

179
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,745
Hyo-rin.

180
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,497
I…

181
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,833
made up with Dad.

182
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,335
What?

183
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,006
He apologized to me.

184
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,091
Tomorrow,

185
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,343
I'll be able to leave this room.

186
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:38,265
I want to trust him since he's your dad.

187
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,351
What do you think?

188
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,146
I wanted…

189
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,359
to protect you, Mom.

190
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,991
That isn't something a child should do.

191
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,162
I should be the one protecting you.

192
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,751
Right, I have a great idea.

193
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,091
Right.

194
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,594
This is all I have.

195
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,492
I appreciate it,

196
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,953
but I don't have any requests
at the moment.

197
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,782
Oh In-joo…

198
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,661
The most important person

199
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,748
in the world.

200
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,264
Did I get any of it wrong?

201
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,857
OH HYE-SEOK

202
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,657
Strictly speaking, Lieutenant Oh Hye-seok
wasn't a part of Jeongran Society.

203
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,493
She took great care of us
after the operation,

204
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,996
but she ended up falling out.

205
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,416
Especially after
the General's wife passed away.

206
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,254
I understand the effort
you're putting into this.

207
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,172
However…

208
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,758
who do you think will believe it?

209
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,220
To be frank,
you're an alcoholic and a stalker

210
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,139
who was dismissed from work.

211
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,058
On top of that, you aren't on TV now.

212
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,518
You'll have to go on ETube.

213
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,520
I have irrefutable evidence

214
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,689
and circumstances that are set in stone.

215
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,941
It'll be perfect with your testimony.

216
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,318
If you'll do the interview--

217
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,196
I need a credible media outlet.

218
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,241
Like the nine o'clock news
that can't be silenced or ignored.

219
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,828
The kind that makes the entire press
report on the story it airs.

220
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,175
DEPARTMENT HEAD, JO WAN-GYU

221
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,218
What is it, In-kyung?

222
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,345
I'm sorry to call so late.

223
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:11,890
It's about the orchid-related deaths
that I mentioned before.

224
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,016
Okay.

225
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:17,187
If I have enough evidence
and a trustworthy witness,

226
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,440
may I report this news
even if it's through another reporter?

227
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,276
No, you need to come and do it yourself.

228
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,736
I'll make an appeal
to the disciplinary committee.

229
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,613
You'll be allowed back.

230
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,740
An exclusive will make things easier.

231
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,242
Are you sure about the witness?

232
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,578
Will you do the interview now?

233
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,710
Come with me.

234
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,630
I have something to show you.

235
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,699
What are you going to do

236
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,368
with all of this?

237
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,621
I went into the mountains 20 years ago

238
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,749
for one reason.

239
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,170
I couldn't make my son
become the son of a murderer.

240
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,632
I also returned for one reason.

241
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
My son.

242
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:33,305
I will not let him become a murderer
or get murdered.

243
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,600
I need a reporter who understands this.

244
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,978
You are planning

245
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,522
to kill Park Jae-sang.

246
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,235
Something that's worthy
of the nine o'clock news will break out.

247
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,031
As soon as that happens,
make sure you get my story out.

248
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,910
I can't do that.

249
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,870
I can't become that kind of a reporter.

250
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,666
Just one shot.
It all must end with one shot.

251
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,004
This may become the biggest story
since the beginning of history.

252
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,632
We can do that with the news.
That one shot you need.

253
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,009
We'll take him down with just one shot.

254
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,469
How?

255
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,721
I have the ledgers of their slush fund.

256
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:18,683
I'll begin by exposing their malpractice,
embezzlement, and slush fund.

257
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,894
Once that goes on the nine o'clock news,

258
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,688
we'll press them
with the stories of their murders.

259
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,858
Let's use the evidence,
the witnesses, and the ledgers

260
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,111
to rewrite our modern history
around Jeongran Society.

261
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,782
You can make your entrance then.

262
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,867
That will be our coup de grâce.

263
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,036
You don't have to become a murderer,

264
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,121
and your son won't have to
live with the fact

265
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,123
that both his parents are murderers.

266
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,924
If something goes even slightly wrong,
we'll resort to my plan.

267
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,009
In front of everyone,

268
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,345
while dozens of cameras are filming,

269
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,098
I'm going to kill Park Jae-Sang

270
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,601
in a way that'll be unforgettable.

271
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,773
So that they will never dare
to rear their head again.

272
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,736
It's a deal.

273
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,363
Then shall we begin the interview?

274
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,811
What?

275
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,544
Mr. Choi.

276
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,386
It seems like people know me.

277
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,574
This is the passcode to Hwa-young's place.

278
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,831
The day her mother passed away.

279
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,506
The last four digits of her phone number.

280
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,780
Well…

281
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,284
Here they are.

282
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,662
-Let's go, In-joo. They were in my pocket.
-Okay.

283
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,006
No way.

284
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,634
If the Oh In-joo of Singapore
looks exactly like you…

285
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,054
What on earth happened?

286
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,558
How can there be someone
who looks exactly like me?

287
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,938
You said

288
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,608
Hwa-young was getting plastic surgery.

289
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,614
I don't think that's possible.

290
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,831
The Oh In-joo of Singapore will be
at the morning auction.

291
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,082
Let's hurry.

292
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,876
Right.

293
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,421
You won't be wearing
what you wore yesterday, right?

294
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,922
I did prepare something.

295
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,465
Okay.

296
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,278
What's all this?

297
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,448
I thought Oh In-joo of Singapore
would wear these.

298
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,702
I'll claim the expenses
because it's for work.

299
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:16,304
INTERNATIONAL ORCHID FESTIVAL

300
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,240
It feels like everyone is staring at me.

301
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,201
It doesn't matter.

302
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,328
You're the real Oh In-joo.

303
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,080
Be confident.

304
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,921
If Hwa-young is alive,
she'll definitely come here.

305
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,883
Try making a bid.

306
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,760
It's Director Won's money anyway.

307
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,039
Keep going. It's okay.

308
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,119
Well…

309
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,455
I received an orchid from a late friend.

310
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,235
I never went to the bathroom.

311
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,905
Hwa-young.

312
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,240
I'm here.

313
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,700
Where are you?

314
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,330
What's going on?

315
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,916
Someone saw a person
who looks exactly like me.

316
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,417
It must be Hwa-young.

317
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,169
The Oh In-joo of Singapore.

318
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,214
In-joo, get it together.

319
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,174
They may be mistaken.

320
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,593
No one looks exactly the same as you.

321
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,816
The phone bidder left you a message.

322
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,078
"Congratulations.
You look like a real princess today."

323
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,163
"I was always curious

324
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,334
how much you would shine when you bloom."

325
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,712
Hwa-young once told me

326
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,298
that you resembled Princess.

327
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,050
Once you bloom,

328
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,969
you'll be more dazzling than anyone.

329
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,472
It's Hwa-young.

330
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,058
It's Hwa-young.

331
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,446
I heard Hyo-rin snuck
into her mom's room last night.

332
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,407
She said they should go
to Singapore together.

333
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,786
How did she do that
without the security team finding out?

334
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,457
Is this something that she could have
come up with on her own?

335
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,212
You didn't make her do this, did you?

336
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,300
Ever since her mom was locked up,

337
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,427
she wasn't in her right mind.

338
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:13,596
Last night,

339
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,139
I barely managed to stop her

340
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,766
from hurting herself
during a panic attack.

341
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,894
If she hadn't met her mom like that,

342
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,021
she'd be at the ER again.

343
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,524
Just remember this.

344
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,195
You two can never run away.

345
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,074
My men in Singapore
are on the move as we speak.

346
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,745
Don't even think about betraying me.

347
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,923
You asked me before.

348
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,719
If I could betray someone who loved me

349
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,263
the most in this world.

350
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,558
I can.

351
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,686
Because the love I received

352
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,315
from my mom, dad, and sisters

353
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:10,069
brought me closer to death.

354
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,239
But now that I'm here,

355
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,949
why is it that I find

356
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,160
Hyo-rin dying?

357
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,916
I hope Hyo-rin becomes someone
who is capable of betrayal.

358
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:24,917
Otherwise…

359
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,212
she might really die.

360
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,550
How much are you willing to bear

361
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,760
if something were to happen to her?

362
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,057
What makes you think
I would bear something like that

363
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,600
when I can bulldoze through it?

364
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,394
It's people like you

365
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,437
who should be worried
about such scenarios.

366
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,942
Anyway…

367
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,986
can't you stay out of our lives?

368
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,863
We won't mind what the adults are up to.

369
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,074
Then nothing

370
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,493
will happen to Hyo-rin.

371
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,629
A strong mayoral candidate,

372
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:14,383
Park Jae-sang of the Civil Party is here
in the studio with us.

373
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:17,219
We prepared a surprise segment.

374
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,596
What is it?

375
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,348
We invited to the studio

376
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,226
someone that Mr. Park values
and loves the most.

377
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,521
Can you guess who it might be?

378
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,273
I'm not sure.

379
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,150
Let's call in our guest together.

380
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,402
-Come on out.
-Come on out.

381
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,181
In-joo won't pick up.

382
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,932
You can tell me. What is it?

383
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,809
Who did she go to Singapore with?

384
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,394
Choi Do-il.

385
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,854
Tell her to be careful of him.

386
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,898
What is it?

387
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,983
Hyo-rin's dad

388
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,653
must be up to something in Singapore.

389
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,072
He knows that she's there.

390
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,791
Hwa-young once said

391
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,126
that I resembled Princess.

392
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,589
She's alive.

393
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:39,301
She's the only one
who would send me such a message.

394
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,636
What if it's Won Sang-woo?

395
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:46,558
He's a well-known orchid enthusiast,
and he was close to Hwa-young.

396
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,855
Hwa-young purchased expensive orchids
as Oh In-joo for many years.

397
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,359
What if Won Sang-woo was behind her?

398
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,320
I guess that's possible.

399
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,409
He loved Princess of Thieves
more than anybody else did.

400
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,452
Let's try to be as reasonable as possible.

401
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,539
To be frank,
I don't think Hwa-young is alive.

402
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,959
But it's a fact
that someone has assumed your identity.

403
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,545
We don't know who that is.

404
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,506
But whether it's Ms. Jin Hwa-young
or Won Sang-woo,

405
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,675
that impersonator has a goal.

406
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:24,096
They're after the 70 billion won
that's under the name, Oh In-joo.

407
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,141
That's why you had to be
at the auction today.

408
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,768
We had to show everyone

409
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,729
who the real Oh In-joo was.

410
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:37,109
That's why you prepared
the dress and the earrings.

411
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,988
People probably pictured Oh In-joo
to look like this.

412
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,619
So what we need to do now is

413
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,247
to withdraw that money
as soon as possible.

414
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,429
It will be dangerous

415
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,848
to manage transactions
using your name in Singapore.

416
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,726
Cash withdrawal is the only way.

417
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,696
It's usually impossible
to withdraw 70 billion in cash over a day.

418
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,751
But we requested that
the account be closed two weeks ago.

419
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,216
We made sure they prepared the cash
through the network of banks.

420
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,852
A total of 70 billion won from 7 banks.

421
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,438
We have to do it in two hours.

422
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,318
We must arrive in Malaysia
before the banks close.

423
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,363
Before anybody begins to suspect us.

424
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,866
What do I have to do?

425
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,494
Leave quick and accurate signatures.

426
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,456
It will cost us 300 million
for every minute wasted starting now.

427
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,750
Keep unnecessary words
and actions to a minimum.

428
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,557
Also…

429
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,685
do not leave my side
under any circumstances.

430
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,896
I'll deal with any problems
that may arise.

431
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,828
What is it? I'm busy right now.

432
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,247
Are you with Choi Do-il?

433
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,585
Yes.

434
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,920
In-hye wanted me to tell you
to be careful of him.

435
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,300
What?

436
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,594
Park Jae-sang is
up to something in Singapore.

437
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,762
Does anything seem suspicious?

438
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,373
MORNING WINDOW
WAITING ROOM

439
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:40,917
Where is your mom?

440
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:42,961
I don't know.

441
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,713
Did she go somewhere?

442
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,215
Didn't you plan this with your mom
to help her escape?

443
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,009
No, she said--

444
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,678
She said what?

445
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,433
That I'm the most precious person to you.

446
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:59,686
She said you would be happy to see me.

447
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,980
That this was like a surprise party.

448
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,835
Look everywhere.

449
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,170
Singapore. Korea.

450
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,089
-Find her by any means.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,758
Wait, I have to talk to you.

452
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,604
You told me

453
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,024
that I'll be safe as long as
that money is under my name.

454
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,446
Once we withdraw all the cash,

455
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,574
how am I supposed to trust you?

456
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,379
Do you know how to shoot a gun?

457
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,840
This one is easy to use.

458
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,763
Just pull the trigger.

459
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,067
You know about my mom.

460
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,362
She's in prison
for killing someone over money.

461
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:17,491
I've been on the run my entire life
to not become a murderer.

462
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,285
That's why I obsess over money.

463
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:25,165
Only a large amount of money
can turn my life around.

464
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,211
Stay right by my side
with the gun pointed at my back.

465
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,254
Then you'll be safe.

466
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,760
It's a good idea not to trust anybody.

467
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:40,680
To be frank, it'd be great
if you'd trust no one but me.

468
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,394
But don't ever trust anyone or anything

469
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,063
except for your gun and cash.

470
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,777
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

471
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,075
How could my mom

472
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,246
leave me behind and leave by herself?

473
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:12,337
How did your dad know everything?

474
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,548
Even the security team didn't know.

475
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,051
And there aren't any
CCTV cameras in the rooms.

476
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,393
I didn't think
you'd make it this far, In-joo.

477
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,814
But that man, Choi Do-il,
is a dangerous person.

478
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,403
You have to get away from him. Right now.

479
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,131
PARK JAE-SANG

480
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,957
Right.

481
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,001
I'm all ready.

482
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:56,918
I have cash…

483
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,142
Once you're done at the last bank…

484
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,571
…the manager will ask to see Choi Do-il
because of a problem.

485
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,754
That's when you come out
through the side door.

486
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,429
A car will be waiting for you outside.

487
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,931
It will take you to my apartment.

488
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,599
The address is…

489
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,504
You can open the doors
with your fingerprints.

490
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,297
We'll talk when we meet.

491
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,466
Always stay alert.

492
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,178
In-joo seems to be
in serious danger, In-kyung.

493
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,179
What do we do?

494
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,056
She's not picking up.

495
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,048
IN-KYUNG

496
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,938
I need to meet Park Jae-sang right now!

497
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,732
I'll give you what you want,
so let me meet him!

498
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,562
In-joo.

499
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:30,316
In-joo, wake up. You need to wake up.

500
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,363
Hwa-young.

501
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,074
Am I dead?

502
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,659
You aren't.

503
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,619
You're fine,

504
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,870
so get up.

505
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,039
You have to run.

506
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,750
No, I'm too exhausted.

507
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,795
I'm too exhausted to run away.

508
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,343
You can move your limbs, right?

509
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,928
Then run with all your strength.

510
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,098
This…

511
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,684
Take this. Crawl if you must.

512
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,603
That?

513
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,980
I don't want it.

514
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,065
It's too heavy.

515
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,027
That almost got me killed.

516
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,194
What are you saying?

517
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,072
Then why did you come here?

518
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,453
I wanted…

519
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,457
to see you.

520
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,418
Even if it was just for once.

521
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:37,383
There was something I wanted to ask you.

522
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,517
Hey.

523
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:48,978
I am…

524
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:50,855
dead.

525
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,192
How can you meet someone who is dead?

526
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,778
You came here to become rich.

527
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,988
So pull it together.

528
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,742
Then we'll go together.

529
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,788
Can't I go with you?

530
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,035
No.

531
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,247
You have to go alone.

532
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:52,208
As far away as possible.

533
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:54,919
As far as you can.

534
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,754
Okay?

535
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,111
Size 235mm?

536
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,379
I had so many questions to ask you.

537
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,595
Why me, Hwa-young?

538
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,148
Why did you give me
such a large amount of money?

539
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,445
Was it me from the start?

540
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:48,491
Is that why we became friends?

541
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,833
How far did you think I'll make it?

542
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:18,521
What should I become with this money?

543
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:41,460
Are you a good person or a bad person?

544
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,515
Hwa-young!

545
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,780
I'm right on time, right?

546
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,533
I was anxious that I might be late.

547
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,330
On the night Hwa-young died…

548
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,543
your mom…

549
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,340
went out in a fur coat.

550
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,732
But when she returned…

551
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:03,204
She wasn't wearing it.

552
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,468
Hwa-young died…

553
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,307
wearing a fur coat.

554
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,219
Why is the room so dark?

555
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,303
It's brooding.

556
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:06,725
So Hwa-young…

557
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:09,520
is dead.

558
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,610
And I…

559
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,114
will also die.

560
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,457
Did you really think she was alive?

561
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,502
How foolish of you.
You even saw her dead body.

562
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:40,676
Why…

563
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,179
was all of this necessary?

564
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:46,056
I told you.

565
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,560
I like secret plays.

566
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:52,354
It's my way of playing with dolls
in this boring world.

567
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,534
In this play, you were the lead.

568
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,177
They're great actors, right?

569
01:10:36,523 --> 01:10:37,942
Did you know?

570
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:39,401
You get surprised so easily.

571
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:42,488
Hwa-young.

572
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:00,089
I love it when you make that face.

573
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,093
You're like a little child
looking for her mom.

574
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,933
Since when…

575
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,688
did I start playing the part of the lead?

576
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,190
From the day I first met you.

577
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,701
The interview was your audition.

578
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:32,913
Hello, my name is Oh In-joo.

579
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,624
I have three years of experience
in accounting.

580
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,335
I'm the eldest of three sisters.

581
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,046
-Ms. Oh In-joo…
-I told you, right?

582
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,924
I liked you
from the first moment I saw you.

583
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,468
A poor girl who seemed so hopeful.

584
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,304
It was touching.

585
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,265
What will happen
if she becomes an outcast?

586
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:58,022
Will she lose her spirit,
get depressed, or be in pain?

587
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:15,039
Hwa-young developed your character.

588
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:18,876
Always keep them near
and check them whenever suspicion arises.

589
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,428
A friend to outcasts.

590
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,472
That was Hwa-young's character.

591
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:35,142
You made her act

592
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,895
in your play too?

593
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,940
Hwa-young is my favorite character.

594
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:46,362
I taught her everything she knew.

595
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:48,405
Then why did you kill her?

596
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:54,328
Whenever I see someone,
I can see their death within them.

597
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,330
Hwa-young seemed perfect for that.

598
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,541
A poor woman who loved luxury items.

599
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,545
A woman who believed her life would change
after a series of plastic surgeries.

600
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:06,173
Someone who died a meaningless death

601
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:08,175
after getting caught embezzling money.

602
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:10,594
That's not who Hwa-young is!

603
01:13:13,514 --> 01:13:15,432
You should be more worried about yourself.

604
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:19,186
You'll be on the front page
of the local papers tomorrow.

605
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:23,232
"A vain Korean woman
who conned others using orchids

606
01:13:23,315 --> 01:13:26,819
loses everything to a man
and jumps off a building."

607
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,656
The articles and your suicide note
have already been written.

608
01:13:31,865 --> 01:13:35,452
There are even people waiting outside

609
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:38,455
to record videos of you falling.

610
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,583
What about In-hye?

611
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:43,919
Is In-hye…

612
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,047
safe?

613
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,591
Don't worry about that.

614
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:52,052
Many live a perfectly good life

615
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,972
even after losing their parents,
let alone a sister.

616
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:58,267
In-hye will soon become one of us.

617
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,769
If something happens to In-hye,

618
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:03,063
Hyo-rin will be too devastated to go on.

619
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,966
This is odd.

620
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,552
How can I be so sleepy

621
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:36,805
in a situation like this?

622
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:40,851
You'll soon lose consciousness.

623
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,604
You had the blue orchid tea.

624
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,983
Three drops of the orchid's solution

625
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,862
can even put a horse to sleep
in just half an hour.

626
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,785
I'll push you off
while you're still conscious

627
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:02,331
so that you can see
the thrilling world you dreamed of

628
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:04,625
before you go.

629
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:20,224
You know it's all your fault, right?

630
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,311
You were born poor,

631
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,439
yet you dared to try so hard

632
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,525
to come up here.

633
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,572
I want to see…

634
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:39,576
my 70 billion won

635
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,413
before I go.

636
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:45,916
Right.

637
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:50,128
You had a tough time bringing it here.

638
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,297
Of course, you can see it one last time.

639
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:58,822
I…

640
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,783
love it when you make that face.

641
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,747
You're like a little child

642
01:17:08,373 --> 01:17:09,791
who lost her toy.

643
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,671
I DIDN’T THINK
YOU’D MAKE IT THIS FAR, IN-JOO

644
01:18:23,156 --> 01:18:25,909
Are members of Jeongran Society
who receive the orchid forced to die

645
01:18:25,992 --> 01:18:28,078
if they do not voluntarily choose death?

646
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,873
After the transaction has been finalized,
it's best if we never meet again.

647
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:35,335
Will I end up hanging myself there?

648
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:37,337
-I told you, didn't I?
-Kill them.

649
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,880
That I like secrets.

650
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,509
What do you think will happen
if Park Jae-sang becomes the mayor?

651
01:18:42,592 --> 01:18:44,261
We need you to testify, sir.

652
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:46,346
We have the support
of someone we can trust.

653
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,598
I came to her house
because I couldn't contact her.

654
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:51,226
The house was a complete mess.
And the parrot…

655
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,854
Then I will say this before I go,
just in case.

656
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,063
If something happens,

657
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,607
please make sure
my sisters receive their share.

658
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,359
Prepare some cash and my ID.

659
01:18:59,443 --> 01:19:02,529
I'll go far away.
I want to live a quiet life.

660
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:04,072
Let me join you…

661
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,825
in killing Park Jae-sang.

662
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:11,913
