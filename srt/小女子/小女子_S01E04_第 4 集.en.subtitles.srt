1
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:57,724
Why did you tell Hyo-rin
to submit your painting as hers?

2
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,435
It was painted by Hyo-rin.

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,480
I was Hyo-rin when I was painting it.

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,025
With her typical expression on my face,

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,153
I used her favorite colors and textures.

6
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,238
That painting is perfect.

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,329
The General knew that I was special.

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,209
That's why he passed down this house
to me instead of Sang-woo.

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,504
I had to make huge sacrifices,

10
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,549
but I overcame them all.

11
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,010
Do you…

12
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,304
want that doll?

13
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,853
Yes.

14
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,480
Then…

15
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,774
can you do it too?

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,319
Can you betray someone

17
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,030
who loves you the most in the world?

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,244
What about you?

19
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,747
What sacrifice did you have to make?

20
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,252
My father's…

21
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,463
death.

22
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,894
As soon as I returned from the States
after my divorce,

23
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,523
I bought a small apartment
with a view of the Han River.

24
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,942
Everyone tried to stop me.

25
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,737
They said I should remarry
with the money I had

26
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,781
instead of buying a house to live alone.

27
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,909
Did you ever regret it?

28
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,373
I believe that people
become rich by choice.

29
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,585
Should I get married or become rich?
I was at a crossroads.

30
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,463
I chose to become rich.

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,995
You could've waited down there.
I would have been right back.

32
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,539
It's okay. I'm glad to be here.

33
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,042
I've always wanted to visit your home.

34
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,585
You're my friend.

35
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,400
I was going to keep this house
and only rent it out.

36
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,152
I didn't want to sell it to anyone.

37
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,196
Are you sure

38
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,783
it's okay to sell it to me?

39
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,079
There's a perfect soul for each home.

40
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,916
If this house chooses to accept you,
I should step away.

41
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,529
Don't open it!

42
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,616
Why not?

43
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,867
It doesn't close.

44
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,100
How do you shower here?

45
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,729
Well…

46
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
Like this.

47
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:17,984
Like this?

48
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,757
You're more likely to succeed
when you live in a good house.

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,718
Because you can put most things behind
once you're home.

50
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,268
-Are these ants?
-Yes.

51
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,521
Sit over there. This is where ants travel.

52
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,536
Capitalism is a psychological game.

53
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,414
There's an emotion
only the wealthy can overcome

54
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,249
while the poor cannot.

55
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,003
What emotion is that?

56
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,380
A sense of loss.

57
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,967
I see.

58
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,386
You must be ready to lose something
to make big money.

59
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,890
Because only those who risk more can win.

60
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,934
You know,

61
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:37,063
even if I lose everything,
I can always start again from scratch

62
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,065
if I have a home like this.

63
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,776
I…

64
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,861
think so too.

65
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:50,284
You can sit here alone
and watch the sunset and nightfall.

66
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,538
You can decide by tomorrow morning, right?

67
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,771
Everything in your home is real.

68
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,732
What about yours? Is everything fake?

69
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,240
It also seems like
your sisters really love you.

70
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,200
That's what pisses me off at times.

71
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,957
You accept love like it's a given.

72
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,835
I'd be much more grateful if I were you.

73
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,004
You know, about love…

74
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,174
Do we have to accept it
if it's given to us?

75
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,926
Can't we just turn it down
if we don't want it?

76
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,179
Can we?

77
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,023
Hey, what will you do about
the window that doesn't close?

78
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,566
We just need to keep the lights off.

79
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
The screen fell out, so bugs will fly in.

80
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,238
We might get a rat though.

81
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,115
A little rat came in last time.

82
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,161
-We should close it right now.
-A rat!

83
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm sleeping over at my friend's tonight.

84
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,431
It's perfect.

85
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,643
I think this house likes me.

86
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:45,107
I never imagined I could own
an apartment unit like this in my life.

87
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,194
So you're going to buy that apartment
with the stolen money?

88
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:51,489
Why do you keep calling it "stolen money"?

89
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,199
It's money I received.

90
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,326
Anyway, you need to see for yourself.

91
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,245
Once you do, you'll understand.

92
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,372
How can I put this?

93
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,460
It feels like I have a reliable guardian
who'll keep me safe no matter what.

94
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,629
No, I'll never understand.

95
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,549
You once said something
along those lines before.

96
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,425
When you brought your husband-to-be.

97
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,095
You said he'll keep you safe
no matter what,

98
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,972
and that he owns an apartment in Seoul.

99
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,016
Hey! How can you compare this with that?

100
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,980
In-kyung, let's start anew here.

101
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,732
I'll get another job
and start learning English too.

102
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,985
And I'll get certified in accounting.

103
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,863
We've been poor for so long.
We deserve to be happy now.

104
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,407
So what about it?

105
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,661
Poverty can bring people down,
but it can also make people stronger.

106
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,788
We overcame everything
to get to where we are.

107
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,206
I'm proud of us.

108
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,750
I'm not giving it all up
over a measly two billion won.

109
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,377
"A measly two billion won"?

110
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,548
You're so full of yourself.

111
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:55,553
Hey, we were in hot water last month
because we didn't have a mere 2.5 million.

112
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,390
We couldn't fix a window,
so it's been stuck for three years.

113
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,558
And our sister…

114
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,313
had to die
without receiving any treatment.

115
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,859
How can you say that about this money?
It can turn our lives around.

116
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,193
"A measly two billion won"?

117
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,697
I'm also heartbroken over our sister.

118
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,324
That's why…

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,076
we have to escape this.

120
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,163
I'll quit drinking
and change my life around starting now.

121
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,205
I can do it.

122
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,711
You fool. There is only one way
for you to live a different life.

123
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,379
What is it?

124
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,966
Not being poor anymore.

125
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,846
I'll bring it all back.

126
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,182
Mom, Dad, In-hye, and you.

127
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,393
I'll make sure we all live
without worrying about money.

128
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,481
In-joo, I'm someone
who reports embezzlement, theft,

129
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,858
and fraud as crimes.

130
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,152
How can I report the news
while living in a house

131
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,737
bought with stolen money?

132
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,780
So what?

133
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,074
Are you going to turn me in
if I buy this unit?

134
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,494
If you really have to,
let's cut ties with each other.

135
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,664
-I cannot accept your decision.
-What?

136
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,291
Don't call me for the time being.
I'm blocking you.

137
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,584
Hey, In-kyung!

138
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,298
She's so full of herself.

139
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,925
BLOCK CONTACT

140
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,855
Do you remember this day?

141
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,650
This patient caused trouble
from early in the morning.

142
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,611
He cried out saying
someone was coming to kill him.

143
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,114
He locked himself in the bathroom
and didn't come out.

144
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,161
When I opened the door and went in,

145
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,498
everything was in a complete mess,
as expected.

146
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,458
People who are in a state of confusion

147
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,628
tend to want to make their surroundings
just as confusing.

148
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,965
First, I prepared the sedatives.

149
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,050
I'm rather quick,

150
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,137
so it takes me less than 30 seconds
to prepare the shot.

151
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,766
-But the patient was already calm.
-The war…

152
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,145
It takes quite a while
for patients to calm down

153
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,313
when they get that much adrenaline.

154
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,524
I thought, "Who's that lawyer?"

155
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,736
"The patient is breathing
and talking almost normally."

156
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,322
Did you hear what he said?

157
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,784
The war isn't over.

158
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,413
"The war isn't over."

159
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,874
The General is waiting.

160
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,127
"The General is waiting."

161
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,424
How high do you think that
someone from rock bottom can rise up to?

162
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,635
To the highest

163
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,888
and the brightest place.

164
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,689
Then the lawyer looked at me,

165
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,984
and I almost screamed.

166
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,486
Why?

167
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,159
Because he looked so cold.

168
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,330
There are men like him
among talented doctors.

169
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,292
People who keep their heart rate under 90
even in the direst situation,

170
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,211
like people who dispose of bombs.

171
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,756
"Do lawyers have to be like that too?"

172
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,633
I remember wondering that.

173
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,889
What is that?

174
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,767
I think the patient
is holding something in his hand.

175
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,729
It's a flower. It's thin and blue.

176
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,773
I think the lawyer gave it to him.

177
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,568
By any chance…

178
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,572
was it this one?

179
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,160
It was.

180
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,429
Doesn't it look like a face?

181
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,684
If you look closely,
it seems like it's looking back at you.

182
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,769
Is that why it's called the ghost orchid?

183
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,983
It's strange that there's a whole book
written about this orchid.

184
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,402
"Joel Fields. Jang Sa-pyeong."

185
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,113
It's even stranger
that someone translated this.

186
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,159
How did you find this book?
You're just as strange.

187
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,997
We played detectives when we were kids.

188
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,541
You were the director
and I was the assistant.

189
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,046
We were meant to take turns each week,
but you forgot.

190
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,299
So I kept being the director,

191
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,800
pretending I had forgotten too.

192
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,469
I didn't forget.

193
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,265
I was afraid you'd stop playing with me
if I asked you to switch.

194
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,742
Where's Hyo-rin?

195
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,417
Let's go on a little date
while Hyo-rin is with her math tutor.

196
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,134
Are you good at keeping secrets?

197
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,969
Yes.

198
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,016
I'd like to ask you to do something
without anyone else knowing.

199
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,354
"An orchid that is also called a ghost."

200
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:43,192
"Among over 30,000 kinds of orchids,
this blue orchid is the most mysterious."

201
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,780
"Many explorers and botanists
searched the jungles of Vietnam

202
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,074
and managed to obtain a few of them,

203
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,493
but they all ended up losing their lives."

204
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,536
"That's why this orchid is also called

205
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,246
the Orchid of Death."

206
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,797
This is my father's secret orchid room.

207
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,675
Why is it a secret?

208
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,387
Apparently, it's illegal to grow
or import this orchid,

209
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,850
since it is both endangered and poisonous.

210
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,109
However,

211
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,572
I think my father wanted to
keep it all to himself.

212
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,035
There's no need to show it
to people who won't appreciate it.

213
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,834
It's so beautiful.

214
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,341
This one looks good.

215
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,762
From now on,

216
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,014
this is your orchid.

217
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,487
Is this for me?

218
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,198
It's for you…

219
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,789
but I'll leave it here.

220
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:06,043
This tree looks after the orchids
so they stay alive.

221
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,434
Do you have a good view of my nose?

222
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,855
Don't you want to draw it?

223
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,150
I do want to draw it.

224
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,987
This will be

225
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,657
our secret portrait.

226
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,701
Something we won't show anyone.

227
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,747
"Even among the natives,

228
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,459
only a few shamans knew where
the orchid's habitat was."

229
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:51,839
"If a layperson came across the orchid,
it could put them in danger."

230
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,187
"When you first encounter the orchid,

231
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,149
you will feel your pain disappear
just by smelling it,

232
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,235
and soon begin to feel pleasantly dizzy."

233
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,739
Then did he use the orchid as a sedative

234
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,700
since Mr. Kim was too agitated?

235
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,205
Since Mr. Kim consciously smelled it
in front of the mirror,

236
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,332
he must also have been aware
of its effects.

237
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,466
"For the extremely sensitive,

238
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,761
the orchid can increase their pulse,
make them feel light-footed,

239
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,100
and at times, even cause hallucinations."

240
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,984
Run. Run faster.

241
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,116
Why is this portrait a secret?

242
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,247
I'm only interested in secretive things.

243
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,541
Knowing what everyone else knows

244
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,710
is no fun.

245
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,880
Isn't it the same for you?

246
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,345
Run. Run faster.

247
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,515
You have to run away. Faster!

248
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,939
Are you all right?

249
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,608
You look pale.

250
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,657
"If you brew the orchid's root as tea,
you can completely lose your senses

251
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,408
and fall into a deep sleep."

252
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,078
"Shamans referred to this moment

253
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,830
as the first step
of the stairs to heaven."

254
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,001
You have to run away. Faster!

255
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,800
"In this state, shamans often come across
the spirits of the deceased."

256
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,014
Why can't you run faster?

257
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,975
Don't stop.

258
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,736
If you don't escape,

259
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,365
you'll die.

260
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,541
In-hye!

261
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,961
In-hye.

262
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,672
In-hye. Wake up.

263
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,056
In-hye!

264
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,350
She's asleep.

265
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,729
All the tests

266
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,564
must have tired her out.

267
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,818
I'm sorry I was so hard to reach.

268
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,738
You must be startled.

269
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:05,657
In-hye.

270
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,161
I'm sorry I came so late.

271
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,204
It must have been really tough.

272
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:16,043
The emergency room said her condition
is ventricular tachycardia,

273
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,878
so I came to this hospital right away.

274
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,631
A doctor here is renowned in the field
of hereditary heart conditions.

275
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,510
Hereditary heart conditions?

276
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:28,972
She's lucky she didn't come in any later.

277
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,726
The ECG shows typical signs
of Luigi's Disease.

278
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,687
She could collapse and die any minute.

279
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,983
She needs a thorough examination
and surgery immediately.

280
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,109
Surgery?

281
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,570
It's called a defibrillator.

282
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,283
We'll place a mechanical device this big
below her skin near the chest.

283
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:52,079
When she suddenly has a heart attack,
it'll deliver an electric shock

284
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,914
to stabilize her heartbeat.

285
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,335
Do you have any family members
who suddenly died due to heart disease?

286
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,462
Your parents or siblings?

287
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,465
Well…

288
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,759
No, Mom.

289
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,554
She's okay now.

290
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,307
She won't die once she gets surgery.

291
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,975
Don't cry and tell me.

292
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,020
We had a younger sister, right?

293
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,526
She suddenly collapsed
and died when she was a baby.

294
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,443
Right?

295
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,197
Since when did you remember that?

296
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,791
She needs surgery as soon as possible.

297
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,127
She could have another episode
any day now.

298
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,922
Our insurance doesn't cover this,
so it costs a lot.

299
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,633
She'll need to keep taking meds.

300
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,845
The device has to be replaced
every few years,

301
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,471
so it'll continue to cost a lot.

302
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,559
Will she manage to live

303
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,061
as long as she gets surgery?

304
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,107
I'll use that money for the surgery.

305
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,237
Our dead sister…

306
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,157
Her name was In-seon.

307
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,619
She had the same condition as In-hye,

308
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,204
and surgery could have saved her.

309
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,039
Even if you refuse,

310
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,083
I will use that money.

311
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,128
I don't care if I go to prison.

312
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,215
And I don't care
if you sever ties with me.

313
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,554
In any case…

314
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,808
she won't die, right?

315
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,199
Raise your hand if you have a question
for Lawyer Park Jae-sang.

316
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,577
Hello, I'm a young man from a poor family.

317
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,871
I do my best to survive,

318
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:02,209
but I end up blaming my poor father
every now and then.

319
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,129
How did you manage to find success
despite your situation?

320
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,217
My father was a veteran
of the Vietnam War.

321
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,426
As a result of Agent Orange,

322
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,511
he developed a skin condition
and a mental illness.

323
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,140
I never had a mother,
so my grandmother raised me.

324
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,601
Many people ask me this.

325
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,772
"How did you manage to rise above
despite your situation?"

326
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,190
How did I get here?

327
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,068
It was easy

328
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:33,114
since my childhood experiences were
much more difficult than anything else.

329
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,869
Since his response came
straight from his life experience,

330
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,455
I feel that it made it
all the more memorable.

331
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,500
Now, the next question.

332
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,093
Are you tailing Ms. Oh In-joo?

333
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,387
I'm just doing a simple background check.

334
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,014
Didn't you cause trouble doing that once?

335
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,019
Ms. Oh is important to us.

336
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,314
One wrong move and something might happen
to that 70 billion won.

337
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,442
Mr. Park said you'd be done for

338
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,695
if you act out of line again.

339
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,289
Wealth and fame are guaranteed…

340
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,082
-Mr. Park.
-Got any good news?

341
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,209
The approval ratings are out.

342
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,044
You're in second place.

343
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,713
It's 2nd place, but more like 1.5.

344
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,632
What's that supposed to mean?

345
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,217
I'm talking about the trend.

346
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,845
A month ago, your rating was 2.3 percent.

347
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,180
You were practically unknown.

348
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,100
Your rating is skyrocketing
among the younger generation,

349
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,312
while your opponent is getting support
from their usuals.

350
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,188
One more move and the tables will turn.

351
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,191
It's about time
we arm ourselves to the teeth,

352
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,652
but that 70 billion is being delayed.

353
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,781
We're on our feet looking for it,
so it's bound to take time.

354
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,700
Can you find the money elsewhere?

355
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,537
Probably not Switzerland,
but Hong Kong or Singapore might do.

356
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,874
Then it's down to this one last move.

357
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:12,213
That documentary you're filming
with the TV station.

358
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,383
It'd be nice
if we could throw in a touching story.

359
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:29,689
What should I do?

360
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,108
I feel so bad.

361
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,283
It wasn't just anemia
or low blood pressure.

362
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,993
It was a terminal illness.

363
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,704
She has a rare genetic disease.

364
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,126
Ms. Go, does In-hye's family have
any money for her treatment?

365
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,296
Didn't you say
Ms. Oh In-joo didn't have any money?

366
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,423
She doesn't.

367
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,551
Honey, can't our foundation
also offer support for her treatment

368
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,845
along with her scholarship?

369
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,682
What will Hyo-rin do if In-hye dies?

370
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,188
A rare genetic disease…

371
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,821
It'll be touching, sir.

372
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,168
In-hye.

373
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,755
In-kyung.

374
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,591
I'm here.

375
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,719
-I was worried.
-About what?

376
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,471
That I might die

377
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,098
while I had you blocked.

378
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,101
In-hye.

379
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,690
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,651
You must have been
so embarrassed that day.

381
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,361
I know

382
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,697
that you love me.

383
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,243
But at times, I despise it.

384
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,788
I'm sorry.

385
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,375
I won't drink anymore.
I'll never do that again.

386
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,171
I wonder why.

387
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,298
I think I might have wanted…

388
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,093
a different kind of love.

389
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,180
Not the kind of love you get
as a little sister

390
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,641
or the kind you get
just because you grew up together.

391
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,105
What kind of love did you want?

392
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,026
The kind you get for being a good painter.

393
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,655
The kind of love you get

394
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,367
because you're a good kid,
have silky hair, or because you're useful.

395
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,536
Love like that.

396
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,337
I was afraid I'd die
before I had the chance

397
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,546
to show people who I am.

398
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,718
I always felt like I was being chased

399
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,596
and like I was going to suddenly die.

400
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,732
In-hye.

401
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,859
I love you

402
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,780
because of your protruding toe,

403
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,700
because you always burped after a meal
since you were a baby,

404
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,205
because the way your breath
and hair smell when you wake up,

405
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,918
and because of your temper
that makes sure you get your revenge

406
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,045
although you never apologize
for your own mistakes.

407
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,798
Those are the reasons why I love you.

408
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,883
There are no other reasons.

409
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,514
I hate that.

410
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,031
Where are you?

411
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,242
Why? I'm busy.

412
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,035
Don't touch the money for a while.

413
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,080
Park Jae-sang is doing
a background check on you.

414
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:16,541
I can't do that.
I have to use it for something.

415
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,210
Can't you give it some time
until I say that it's okay?

416
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,838
Mr. Choi.

417
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,466
Are you worried that this might
affect the deal that we made?

418
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,303
Yes.

419
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,558
Then do whatever you can to stop that.
This is urgent.

420
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,852
Go Su-im is the person
who is coming after you.

421
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,312
She is cunning and brutal.

422
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,439
I'm afraid that you might get…

423
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,191
I'm in the elevator right now.

424
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,359
Let's talk later.

425
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,164
Please, excuse me.

426
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,833
-You can't go in there.
-It'll only be a minute.

427
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,878
You can't just walk in,
that's the locker room!

428
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,839
What's wrong?

429
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,847
My name is Go Su-im.
I work for the Park Jae-sang Foundation.

430
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,016
What is this about?

431
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,186
I'm looking for the two billion won
that Ms. Jin embezzled.

432
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,314
Why would you be asking me about that?

433
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,904
Ms. Jin took the two billion won…

434
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,200
in a perfectly-sized backpack.

435
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,746
That's the bag, isn't it?

436
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,045
Start counting.

437
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,431
Go on.

438
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,143
Excuse me, ma'am.

439
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,647
I'll give you all the money,

440
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,025
so can you lend me just 100 million won?

441
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,821
I'll return the clothes and cash too.

442
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,406
Look at her.

443
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,324
She still doesn't get it, does she?

444
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,745
Listen, the money was ours to begin with.

445
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,455
You're not giving it to us.

446
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,125
I'm also entitled to this money.

447
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,877
How so?

448
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,922
There are a few ways
for someone to get money.

449
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,677
You either work for it,
inherit it, steal it, or just find it.

450
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,849
You stole that money from someone,
and I happened to find it.

451
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:41,811
Finding and keeping it takes
just as much time and effort as stealing.

452
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,898
I kept it in a safe place,
worried about it all day,

453
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,567
and counted it again and again…

454
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,944
What kind of elaborate nonsense is this?

455
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,407
Honestly speaking,
two billion won was too much for me.

456
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,201
I wondered if I could really manage
this amount of money.

457
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,620
Or if my life was even worth
two billion won.

458
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,124
But it's different
when it comes to my sister.

459
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,252
If there's a price tag for people,
In-hye is worth

460
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,463
far more than two billion.

461
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,924
I'll get her treated first,
then pay you back.

462
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,262
My life and soul together should be worth
at least 100 million, right?

463
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,181
She's funny.

464
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,187
Are you a comedian
or do you have a screw loose somewhere?

465
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,024
This intrigues me.

466
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,110
Now I'm curious about how far you would go

467
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,945
for money.

468
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,700
Why don't you find out?

469
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:54,717
We run our mouths for the small things
that are right before our eyes.

470
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,719
That's why I like violence.

471
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,137
Everyone is honest

472
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,056
when they're in the face of violence.

473
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,771
How was that?

474
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,649
I'll hit you nine more times.

475
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,860
After all 10 hits,
I'll lend you 100 million won.

476
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,530
Shout "go" after I hit you
if you think you can continue.

477
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,948
Then I'll hit you again.

478
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,699
But if you stop in the middle,

479
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,160
you'll get nothing,
no matter how many hits you take.

480
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,912
So?

481
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,462
Get up.

482
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,647
Do you get it now? You could die.

483
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,693
Fear spreads the fastest
out of all human emotions.

484
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,155
You're probably racking your brain
for ways to avoid getting beaten.

485
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,246
Do you regret it yet?

486
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,624
The hits will get harder and harder.
And your fear will grow even bigger.

487
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
But it gets harder to give up

488
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,962
because of all the hits you've taken.

489
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,643
Do you get it now?

490
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,938
Isn't now the perfect time to give up?

491
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,717
Let me warn you.
I'm going for your head next.

492
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,094
There's no telling what will happen.

493
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,432
Oh, my. I think it's our day to let loose.

494
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,519
Should we stop?

495
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,064
It would be a hassle
if something bad were to happen.

496
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,651
Your sister will never know
that you gave up on her anyway.

497
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,239
Five more to go.

498
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,577
You asked for it.

499
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,788
I was really going to stop.

500
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,249
What the hell?

501
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,132
What do you think you're doing, Ms. Go?

502
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,968
Damn it.

503
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,928
Weren't you warned that you'd be done for

504
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,972
if you acted out of line again?

505
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,766
This? We were playing a game
under mutual consent.

506
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,852
Was I acting out of line, Ms. Oh?

507
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,272
No, I wanted to do this.

508
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,399
Right? And you want to go on.

509
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,067
Say "go" if you want to go on.

510
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,948
It's a "go" no matter what. We're at five.

511
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,242
I'm fine. I can handle this.

512
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,371
Get yourself together. It's over.

513
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,456
No. Let's continue, Ms. Go.

514
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,583
I can take it. I'm fine.

515
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:17,837
Ms. Go.

516
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,804
Hyo-rin's mother?

517
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,148
Were you trying to kill Ms. Oh?

518
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:39,358
She gave you the money back.

519
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,819
Why would you…

520
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,865
Ms. Oh isn't a bad person.

521
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,117
Don't you dare touch her again.

522
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,744
If there's a problem,

523
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,330
I'll deal with it myself.

524
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,304
It's all right, Ms. Oh.

525
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,581
Isn't this place nice?

526
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,670
It's so nice here!

527
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,107
You must be cold.

528
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,443
I'm fine.

529
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,790
I'm hungry. Let's go.

530
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,420
They're Bruno Zumino.

531
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,339
I got them for myself
for my birthday last year.

532
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,273
I've been here before.

533
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,899
Did Hwa-young bring you here?

534
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,822
Were you two close?

535
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,284
We came here together once a month.

536
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,244
It's my favorite restaurant.

537
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,997
I told her about the yoga class too.

538
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,084
I also gave her
the clothes and the bags I never used.

539
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,421
Does that mean we were close?

540
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,674
I realized that day.

541
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,012
The day you came

542
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,306
in these shoes.

543
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,267
"Ms. Oh must have been
close friends with Hwa-young."

544
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,478
"She must have left
something behind for her."

545
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,772
"Ms. Oh could have taken that money."

546
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,277
I was the one who gave her those shoes.

547
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,155
They were for her birthday last year.

548
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,911
I thought Director Shin
went to the store himself to get them.

549
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:44,335
He bought me a pair for my birthday.

550
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:49,006
I loved them so much
that I got the same pair for Hwa-young.

551
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,551
If anything, he knew
a thing or two about shoes.

552
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:59,600
During my four years with Hwa-young,
she never told me this.

553
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,935
That she had a rich friend.

554
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,520
No.

555
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,689
She didn't even tell me
that she had any close friends.

556
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,247
I found a photo of her with someone else.

557
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,749
The tab wasn't in her file of receipts.

558
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,595
This receipt is from
a day before her birthday.

559
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,265
It cost 4.3 million won for the shoes.

560
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,476
Is this enough to prove we were friends?

561
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,146
The two of us

562
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,108
hit it off in a special way.

563
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,361
We both knew that a secret
should always remain a secret.

564
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,282
Fine.

565
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,326
Let's say it's true.

566
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,956
But why are you telling me this?

567
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,419
The thought of Hwa-young

568
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,213
still makes me upset.

569
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,673
Not about the money.

570
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,718
It was her attitude.
How she suddenly ended up dead.

571
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,052
How should I put this…

572
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,680
Her attitude insulted me.

573
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,937
That's why I was hesitant
on making this offer,

574
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,981
but I want you to work for me, Ms. Oh.

575
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,692
Be my assistant.

576
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,193
Sorry?

577
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:37,406
You'll be in charge of my schedule,
money, and orchids.

578
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,450
There's a lot of menial work to be done.

579
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,537
I get rather lonely
being with someone like Ms. Go.

580
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,332
If this is the job Hwa-young had,

581
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,459
then I have to refuse.

582
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,502
I'm aware that it was dangerous.

583
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,466
Didn't you

584
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:57,968
need money?

585
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,805
I think of this as a kind of profession.

586
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,058
I can't work with just anyone.

587
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,310
It has to be someone I really like.

588
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,733
To tell you the truth,

589
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,820
I don't believe that you
and Hwa-young were friends.

590
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,991
You may have thought so,
but not Hwa-young.

591
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,952
She knew that someone as wealthy as you

592
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,830
could never be friends
with people like us.

593
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,541
She knew that better than anyone.

594
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,387
As long as you don't ask me
to become your friend,

595
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,305
I'm willing to give it a go.

596
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,225
How much will you pay me?

597
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:49,103
I need money
for In-hye's treatment right away.

598
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,566
I'll tell Ms. Go to send you the contract,

599
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,902
along with the non-disclosure agreement.

600
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:01,824
Also, there's a way to get money
for In-hye's treatment.

601
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,619
This is my husband's request.

602
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,455
Excuse me for a second.

603
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,626
Hey, In-kyung. What is it?

604
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,837
In-joo, you have to hurry.
In-hye just had another episode.

605
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,255
What?

606
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:23,595
In-joo.

607
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,472
I'm scared.

608
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,767
It'll go well. Don't worry about it.

609
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,436
It has to go well.

610
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,854
They say I might die.

611
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,397
You won't.

612
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,691
You'll never die.

613
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,570
Once you wake up,
you'll have a healthy heart.

614
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:42,197
The doctor here is the best,
and so is the hospital.

615
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,075
And you're the best too.

616
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,537
Only the patient is allowed in from here.

617
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:49,955
Okay.

618
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,874
Think of it as a nap, okay?

619
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,688
In-joo, what happened to your face?

620
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,733
I must have cried too much.

621
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,865
Did you bring the money?

622
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,956
In-kyung, I'll take care of the money.

623
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,583
You don't need to worry about it.

624
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:40,172
But you might be bothered
by something that might happen later.

625
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,089
Like what?

626
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,968
Just stay put.

627
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,678
Then the money won't be a problem.

628
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,494
Run. Run faster!

629
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,125
If you run fast enough, you can escape.

630
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:19,878
Faster.

631
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,173
I have to run faster.

632
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,016
But…

633
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,896
I can't.

634
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,079
In-hye.

635
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,124
Are you all right?

636
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,084
Mom.

637
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,131
The surgery went well.

638
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,008
You've done well.

639
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,843
Can you call Mom?

640
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,431
Mom?

641
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,731
-Mom.
-In-hye!

642
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,274
You've done well.

643
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,192
When are you coming?

644
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,778
What? I can't go yet.

645
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,405
Even though I'm this sick?

646
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:34,161
It's mango season right now,
so there's too much work.

647
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,954
I'll go see you after I'm done here.

648
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,123
I want to ask you something.

649
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,375
What is it? Go ahead.

650
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,753
Mom, why does it feel like…

651
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,089
I've died once before?

652
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,177
It was night and someone was running
while carrying me on their back.

653
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,014
My heart stopped that night
and it never started beating again.

654
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,933
Why was I called In-seon then?

655
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,436
Well…

656
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,022
One second, In-hye.

657
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,150
I told you this before,
but you told me not to tell anyone.

658
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,707
What on earth did you tell her?

659
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,668
Did you tell her about when In-seon died?

660
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,461
-Well, I was…
-I can't…

661
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,463
Why? When?

662
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,465
That night

663
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,468
when In-seon passed out,

664
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:35,639
your dad was out working
and our phone was cut off.

665
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,724
I carried her on my back to the hospital

666
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,768
even though I knew she was already dead.

667
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,688
Why would you tell her that?
She was just a child!

668
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:46,400
I couldn't talk to anyone,
so I told her when she was just a baby.

669
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,820
That night came back to me
whenever I carried In-hye to sleep.

670
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,408
Fine, so come home soon.

671
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,077
Come and explain that to her.

672
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,414
I can't go right now.
I have to harvest mangoes.

673
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,625
Stop going on about mangoes!
Can't you see In-hye is sick?

674
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,753
I can't bear to see it happen again.

675
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,589
If I go through that again, I might die.

676
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,674
Mom.

677
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,844
In-hye is your daughter.

678
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,054
You're responsible for her.

679
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,308
Dad wasn't in an accident, was he?

680
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,768
He's still gambling, right?

681
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,686
You can't come

682
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,396
because you no longer have
the money or your passport.

683
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,731
Like what happened before.

684
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,276
I didn't know either.

685
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,819
Dad says he's sorry.

686
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,571
We can go once we pay them back,

687
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,030
so let's talk again tomorrow.

688
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,909
Mom, just don't call us.
It'd be better not to see you again.

689
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,703
In-kyung, In-joo. I'm sorry.

690
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,955
-I'm sorry! I'm--
-Sorry, but I'm blocking you for now.

691
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,333
BLOCK CONTACT

692
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:08,982
In-hye.

693
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,692
It must have hurt a lot, right?

694
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,696
Why are you crying?
I'm the one who's sick.

695
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:21,661
I feel so bad for In-hye.

696
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:26,374
Hyo-rin, you don't have to
feel bad for her.

697
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,626
She's amazing.

698
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,753
This surgery is tough even for adults,

699
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,171
but she pulled through.

700
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,506
Right?

701
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,593
Excuse me.

702
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:40,889
What are you all doing?

703
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:45,852
One second.

704
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,523
Can you leave for a moment?
I'll take care of this.

705
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,025
What?

706
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,860
I'll tell you later.

707
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,028
Hurry.

708
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,909
Come on. I'm begging you.

709
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:07,332
I'm grateful for the bravery she showed
in the face of great adversity.

710
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:11,294
It's not easy
to accept something from others,

711
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,214
but thank you for giving us this chance
to lend a helping hand.

712
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,593
Enough is enough.

713
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,470
She needs to recover.

714
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,600
Then we'll interview
a family member and leave.

715
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,893
Yes, I'll--

716
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:28,937
I'll do it.

717
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,272
-Stop it.
-Excuse me.

718
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,485
I'll do it.

719
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,120
Meeting Hyo-rin's mom and dad was

720
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,373
the biggest luck I had in my life.

721
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,085
If it hadn't been for them,
I would have died yesterday.

722
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,255
I've been ill quite often
since I was little,

723
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,424
but I never had a proper examination.

724
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,512
I was able to learn about my illness
and received surgery thanks to them.

725
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,140
Thank you very much.

726
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,101
I feel like I've been born again.

727
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,107
Are we doing that for money?

728
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,525
You said you had two billion.

729
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,113
That was part of a slush fund
for Park Jae-sang Foundation.

730
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,448
I returned it all

731
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,284
and they offered to pay
for the treatment in return.

732
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,995
That was Park Jae-sang's money?

733
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,206
The treatment will cost
over 100 million won.

734
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,627
Can't you just let it slide?
Just turn a blind eye to it.

735
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,837
Let's get one more interview.

736
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,464
Don't you know what he's like?

737
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,592
He paid In-hye for her painting
to send his daughter abroad.

738
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,844
Does In-hye's life have to be
in the hands of someone like him?

739
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,805
You can say that
when you can afford to pay.

740
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,515
You need money for love.

741
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,517
If you don't have the money,
you need to grin and bear it.

742
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,061
I'm always prepared to do so.

743
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:53,480
If not, I wouldn't be any different
from our parents.

744
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,192
They're too busy picking mangoes
to visit their sickly daughter.

745
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,402
Ms. Oh In-kyung.

746
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:09,079
You don't have to stop investigating me
because I paid for In-hye's treatment.

747
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,083
I don't intend on disclosing
that I'm helping your sister.

748
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,043
So don't worry and keep up the good work.

749
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,799
Sure. That was my intention.

750
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:31,059
You're due 95,002,400 won.

751
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,894
How would you like to pay?

752
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,813
Please tell me the account number.

753
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,649
Let me pay for that.

754
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,449
Ma'am, I don't know who you are,

755
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,828
but our foundation will be covering
In-hye's treatment costs.

756
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,870
What do you mean?

757
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,748
I talked to her mother
and told her I'd pay for it.

758
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,750
She's our Great-Aunt.

759
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,671
She heard about In-hye's condition
and offered to pay for her treatment.

760
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,507
Something like this
should be resolved within the family.

761
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,051
Tell everyone to leave.

762
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,012
It was very nice of them,

763
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,472
but they can help other unfortunate kids.

764
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:13,393
Ma'am, In-hye is
a scholarship student at our foundation.

765
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,519
This isn't out of pity.

766
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,355
We'd like to nurture
her extraordinary talent.

767
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,567
Please give us a chance
to sponsor In-hye--

768
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,110
I know you.

769
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,531
Your name is Park Jae-sang, isn't it?

770
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:29,451
Yes.

771
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,494
I knew your father.

772
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,621
Mr. Park Il-bok.

773
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,754
I often went looking for land to buy
with your father back in the day.

774
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,591
Anyway, I'll cover the bill.

775
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,428
Are credit cards okay?

776
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,971
Single payment, please.

777
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,170
Here.

778
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,852
I'll stay at Hyo-rin's for a while
after I'm discharged.

779
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:21,980
But…

780
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,526
why would you go there
when you have your own home?

781
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,696
Hyo-rin's mom asked me to come
so we can prepare for our studies abroad.

782
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,909
You're sick. You can't go to study abroad.

783
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,704
The doctor said I can go
if I prepare well.

784
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,540
Hyo-rin's mom told me not to give up
just because I'm sick.

785
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,502
In-hye, you know
that you're being weird, right?

786
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,296
Do you have to go abroad now?

787
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,089
You can go when you're at university.

788
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,467
I told you we'd do our best
to send you abroad.

789
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,011
Studying abroad isn't just
about the money.

790
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:56,514
I have to eat, dress, and socialize there.

791
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,600
I've never been to a restaurant here,

792
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,685
so how would I know
how to order food there?

793
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,854
I even attended weddings
in my school uniform.

794
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,064
So what should I wear to a birthday party?

795
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,859
I was always taught to run
when a stranger talks to me.

796
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:10,695
So how could I make small talk
with strangers once I'm there?

797
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:15,450
I have so much to learn.

798
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,453
Hyo-rin's mom said she'd teach me.

799
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,334
I have nothing to learn from you two.

800
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,842
And?

801
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,638
Did you decide only to listen to her?

802
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,807
Do the things we say
mean nothing to you now?

803
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,561
If you were in my shoes,
you would do the same.

804
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,272
And Hyo-rin's mom said

805
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:50,360
you'd soon come to that house
and work with her.

806
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,737
What is she saying?

807
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,575
I said I'll work for her
in exchange for In-hye's treatment.

808
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,244
But I don't have to go anymore.

809
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,996
That girl, In-seon.

810
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,792
She told me this every time
she collapsed and died.

811
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,380
That if I don't escape from this family,
someday I'll…

812
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:13,174
wind up dead.

813
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,528
How could she say that?

814
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:38,032
It's as if In-hye became someone else.

815
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,328
In-kyung.

816
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,331
I need to become someone else too.

817
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,918
Come on. You too?

818
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,546
What kind of person will you become?

819
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,762
I have some ledgers.

820
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,975
They're for the slush fund
Director Shin kept for 25 years.

821
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,854
I'll use that to get
the most money out of it.

822
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,689
Much more than two billion won.

823
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,816
I'll buy a house
with a view of the Han River,

824
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,444
and make sure to send In-hye
to study abroad myself.

825
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,698
I wanted to become

826
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,868
someone who can
protect their family with money.

827
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,746
Someone that In-hye
can learn something from.

828
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,791
My goodness, In-joo.

829
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,753
You really have such a ledger?

830
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:34,589
-Yes--
-If that's true, money isn't the problem.

831
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,923
If I look into that ledger,

832
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,927
I'd be able to dig up every single crime
Park Jae-sang's family was involved in.

833
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,805
I'll prepare a report on it,
expose him to the world,

834
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,098
-and end him for--
-Hey!

835
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,478
Don't you know
how to sympathize with others?

836
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,980
I told you I'll send In-hye abroad
with that money,

837
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,107
and all you can think about
is achieving your dream.

838
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,444
How could you be so…

839
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,949
How's In-hye?

840
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,284
She's much better.

841
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,036
Did you contact Mr. Joel Fields?

842
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,871
Yes. We can video call him right away.

843
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,412
"Gyeonggi-do, Musim-gun,

844
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:31,330
Noma…"

845
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,339
This is the address Cheol-seong gave me.

846
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,216
He told me to start investigating here.

847
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,222
26 GIMTAN-RI, NOMA-MYEON
MUSIM-GUN, GYEONGGI-DO

848
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,607
I think

849
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,151
I've gotten over that two billion won.

850
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,821
We're going to make
much more money than that

851
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:04,947
by using that ledger.

852
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,284
Well? What's our next plan?

853
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,244
We won't use the ledger for a while.

854
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,079
Our next plan is…

855
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,792
for you to work under Hyo-rin's mother.

856
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,336
What?

857
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,005
INTERNATIONAL ORCHID SOCIETY

858
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,018
What do you think?

859
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,479
What's all this?

860
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,898
An apartment unit under your name.

861
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,275
It's in Sentosa, Singapore.

862
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,912
This is an English green classic car
that's under your name.

863
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:57,041
I have no idea what you're saying.

864
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,214
This is the business school
you're attending.

865
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,930
This cafe's owner is well-acquainted
with Ms. Oh In-joo from Korea.

866
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,938
Take a close look.

867
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,943
Here's Ms. Oh In-joo,
who lives in Singapore.

868
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,660
This is Hwa-young.

869
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,288
Since three years ago,

870
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:38,207
she's been living in Singapore
under your name.

871
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,502
On the 13th of last month…

872
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,426
…she split up 70 billion won
and deposited it across seven banks.

873
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,304
Of course, she did it
under the name Oh In-joo.

874
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,531
Please sign them.

875
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:13,242
Why are they all in English?

876
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,703
I want to register it abroad
while I'm at it.

877
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,846
I need to go to Singapore right away.

878
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,588
We'll make a wonderful pair.

879
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,340
We will?

880
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,342
I have business to attend to in Singapore.

881
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,760
Can you get it done by tomorrow?

882
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,929
You're my future.

883
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,056
Everyone in this family is insane.

884
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,851
That wacko up there.
It's Hyo-rin's dad, right?

885
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,437
There are scary scenes I keep seeing.

886
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:06,439
I simply began to draw them.

887
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,025
This is Director Oh In-kyung,
who's starting today.

888
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:10,317
Aren't you taking this too far?

889
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,569
That orchid.

890
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,778
They're the same, right?

891
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:13,904
In-joo.

892
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,073
Hyo-rin is gone.

893
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,658
I don't think she left home.

894
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,452
I need to know.

895
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,745
That painting…

896
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,038
Why did you draw it?

897
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:28,335
