1
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,599
The culprit Jin Hwa-young may have died,

2
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,894
but I survived.

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,189
Therefore, Your Honor…

4
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,651
please punish me

5
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,530
and those responsible
for creating that dirty money.

6
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,868
They used Jin Hwa-young
to launder that money

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,829
and killed her in the end

8
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,165
because she stole from them.

9
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,502
Please expose who they are

10
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,836
and bring them to justice.

11
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,642
Is that her?

12
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,812
-Is that Jin Hwa-young?
-That's impossible.

13
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,648
-Is that her?
-No way.

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,108
-What's going on?
-I don't believe this.

15
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,669
I am…

16
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,673
that Jin Hwa-young.

17
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,342
JUDGE

18
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:23,184
Please allow me to testify, Your Honor.

19
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,785
Everything was done…

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,332
by Director Won Sang-a,
who is sitting over there…

21
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,336
and me.

22
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:58,678
Oh In-joo didn't have any motive
to embezzle 72 billion won,

23
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,472
but I did.

24
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,517
I wanted to show

25
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,020
Director Won Sang-a

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,647
and everyone else

27
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,444
what I was capable of
if I set my mind on something.

28
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,781
Won Sang-a used me for over ten years

29
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,408
to accumulate a great fortune

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,162
and was ready to throw me
under the bus if any problem arose.

31
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,290
What else could I have done?

32
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,710
Could I have just stopped?

33
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,629
If I had, I would've been killed

34
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,631
without anyone knowing.

35
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,719
Could I have exposed
Won Sang-a's crimes to the world?

36
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,018
I do not trust the police or the media.

37
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,771
I wanted that woman to experience

38
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,898
exactly what I had.

39
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,735
Won Sang-a would be charged
with embezzlement

40
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,737
if I took the money and left.

41
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,658
All of this has been a part of
my plan for personal revenge.

42
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,992
The defendant, Oh In-joo…

43
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,537
had absolutely nothing to do with this.

44
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,545
In that case, why did you give
Oh In-joo the two billion won?

45
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,633
I wanted her to be happy.

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,929
Why did you store
the 70 billion won in her account?

47
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,641
I needed an account
under someone else's name

48
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,103
that I could use
while I was legally deceased.

49
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,898
If I had to leave that money to someone,

50
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,237
Oh In-joo was the only person
I wanted to give it to.

51
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,576
I believe this question is inevitable.

52
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,997
Then whose body was it
that was found on the scene?

53
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,708
What in the world happened on that day?

54
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,590
That has nothing to do with this trial.

55
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,552
So I will reveal it in due time.

56
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,679
PROSECUTOR

57
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,016
Witness, you may stand.

58
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,643
You may leave.

59
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:25,116
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

60
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,085
The following is the verdict
for the defendant, Oh In-joo.

61
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,340
Regarding her embezzling
70 billion won of the company funds,

62
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,635
of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Economic Crimes

63
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,764
the court acknowledges
that she was unaware of the crime.

64
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
She is not guilty.

65
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,812
-My goodness.
-Oh, my.

66
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,814
However…

67
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,486
she has still taken the two billion won
that Jin Hwa-young embezzled.

68
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,780
According to the Act on Regulation
and Punishment

69
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,907
of Criminal Proceeds Concealment states,

70
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,658
the court sentences her

71
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,703
to a year and six months
with two years of probation.

72
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,561
Whose body was it?

73
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,688
-Did the deceased commit suicide?
-Was it murder?

74
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,816
-Was Director Won involved?
-Why did you return?

75
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,859
-Was the person murdered?
-Who did it?

76
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,277
-Give us a word.
-A word, please.

77
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,654
-Just one word.
-Whose body was it?

78
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,906
-Is everything true?
-Is Director Won involved?

79
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,075
-Say something.
-Is everything you stated true?

80
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,993
-Tell us.
-Did you plan everything?

81
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,037
-Please confirm your statement.
-Say something.

82
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,497
-Anything else to say?
-Was it a suicide?

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,541
-Any comments?
-A word, please.

84
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,209
-Tell us something.
-Say something!

85
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,335
She's over there.

86
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,129
-It's Director Won.
-She's here.

87
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,964
Did you try to kill Ms. Jin?

88
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,173
-Say something.
-Is this true?

89
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,883
What do you think about the ruling?

90
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,260
-Please say something.
-Say something.

91
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,554
-Did you order the embezzlement?
-Is this true?

92
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,809
There must have been a misunderstanding.

93
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,812
I'll cooperate with the investigation

94
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,022
and explain everything.

95
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,333
You went through a lot.

96
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,094
In-joo.

97
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,155
Will this be our last meal
before clearing your great-aunt's house?

98
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,114
Yes.

99
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,449
You should go inside first.

100
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,992
We'll get some groceries.

101
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,837
I'm sorry, In-joo.

102
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,049
Was it all a part of your plan?

103
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,511
Did you befriend me
to take advantage of me?

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,471
Why me?

105
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,014
Because I'm slow-witted?

106
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,517
Because I was an outcast?

107
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,605
When we went to Singapore together…

108
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:34,448
there were so many things
you wanted to buy and do.

109
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:40,413
Ever since my mom died,
I was practically a living corpse.

110
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:46,043
If only I could live in a place like that
as a rich person even just for a day,

111
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,422
then could I die with no regrets.

112
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,091
That's when I thought

113
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,053
that if I ever died and was reborn,

114
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,348
I'd love to live as you.

115
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,186
Someone who relishes
something as simple as a sandwich,

116
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,481
who wishes to live
in a nice house even for a day,

117
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,820
and who wanted to send her sister
to a prestigious school…

118
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,375
Then why didn't you just live
a good life there?

119
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,086
Why did you leave me that two billion won?

120
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,506
How do you think I would have felt
if you died and left me that money?

121
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,593
Did you think I'd be grateful

122
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,388
for the two billion you left me,
even though you were dead?

123
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,348
I would have…

124
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,520
risked my life

125
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,275
if it meant finding out why you died.

126
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,033
I just hoped…

127
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,705
that you'd move into that apartment unit.

128
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,833
I never imagined you'd delve into my death

129
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,877
and get this far.

130
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,885
I only found out
after reading the orchid papers.

131
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,311
The article said
you'd take part in the auction.

132
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,232
There was a photo of someone
wearing the same clothes as I did.

133
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,115
I knew it was Won Sang-a…

134
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,828
and that your life will be in danger.

135
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,500
I never went to the bathroom.

136
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,930
Hwa-young.

137
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
Where are you?

138
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,398
What's going on?

139
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,984
Someone saw a person
who looks exactly like me.

140
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,402
It must be Hwa-young.

141
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,903
The Oh In-joo of Singapore.

142
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,658
In-joo, get it together.
They may be mistaken.

143
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,703
I found you at the auction
and went after you.

144
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,851
But there were others
who were also after you.

145
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,876
So you're saying

146
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,171
you drove in…

147
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,716
between the truck and the car?

148
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,513
You could have died.

149
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,108
I found out much later
that it was Park Jae-sang

150
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,402
who had sent that truck there.

151
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,665
In-joo, you have to run.

152
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,750
Run with all your strength.

153
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,545
Take this. Crawl if you must.

154
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,837
As far away as possible.

155
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,506
As far as you can.

156
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,054
I tried to send you
as far away as possible

157
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,181
because they would never
give up chasing you.

158
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,674
I was in the hospital
until a few days ago.

159
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,804
That's why I only recently heard
what happened to you.

160
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,390
I came too late, didn't I?

161
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,769
I'm sorry.

162
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,230
I thought…

163
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,026
it was all a dream.

164
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,405
A very vivid dream.

165
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,005
In-joo.

166
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,759
Thank you for everything you've done.

167
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:09,718
But from now on,

168
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,554
stay out of my business.

169
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,349
What?

170
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,310
I have a lot to do.

171
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,271
And I must do all of them alone.

172
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,067
Is what you must do…

173
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,112
very dangerous?

174
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,621
MR. CHOI DO-IL

175
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,212
What happened?

176
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,214
I thought you were
at the detention center.

177
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,507
My case was dropped.

178
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,428
There was no evidence
other than the confession I made in court.

179
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,683
You laundered that much money
without leaving any evidence?

180
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,436
Can you fly out tomorrow?

181
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,354
What? To where?

182
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,355
The Netherlands.

183
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,150
I found a lead to In-hye's whereabouts.

184
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,821
You want us to go look for In-hye?

185
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,741
Yes, we should find her
before Won Sang-a does.

186
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,201
But…

187
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,330
why are you doing all this for me?

188
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,375
I don't have the 70 billion won anymore.

189
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,171
It's like a habit of sorts.

190
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,592
Actually, Ms. Jin Hwa-young said
she'd cover our travel expenses.

191
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,616
ORCHID E&C EMBEZZLEMENT CASE
PRESS CONFERENCE

192
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,159
Two years ago,

193
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,078
I met a woman
who had a physique similar to mine

194
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,831
on a website for people
who wanted to commit suicide.

195
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,252
She wanted to die
without anyone finding out,

196
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,507
and wanted to leave behind
a small amount of money for her family.

197
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,008
JIN HWA-YOUNG PRESS CONFERENCE

198
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,179
For two years,
we grew our hair to the same length,

199
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,848
maintained the same weight,

200
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,560
and got tattoos
on identical spots on our bodies.

201
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,357
My initial plan was…

202
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,445
to steal the 70 billion won

203
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,491
before letting it slip to the company.

204
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,370
And make it look as if I committed suicide

205
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,917
because of the emotional pressure

206
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
they had put me under
with continued threats.

207
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,925
But please watch
the CCTV footage of my house

208
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,260
on the day of the incident.

209
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,867
As you can see,

210
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,953
she did not commit suicide.

211
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,457
Won Sang-a broke into my house,

212
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,836
anesthetized the woman
who she thought was me

213
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,796
by injecting her with a syringe,

214
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,882
and hung that woman by the neck

215
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,009
using her own two hands.

216
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,488
Won Sang-a loved to stage
her crimes to her liking.

217
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,703
It was just like what happened
to Yang Hyang-sook 11 years ago.

218
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,546
I already knew the police autopsy report
would have been fabricated.

219
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,636
Because that is
how they have always done it.

220
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,478
I plead with the police
to arrest me immediately

221
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,440
and conduct a thorough investigation
to get to the bottom of this case.

222
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,735
Also…

223
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,113
if you access the homepage
for Bookkeeper from the Future,

224
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,367
you'll be able to download
our accounting software

225
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,578
that is free, intuitive, and easy to use.

226
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,959
If you run the software's executable file
with administrator rights,

227
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,712
you'll be able to find a digital copy
of the slush fund ledger,

228
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,507
which proves the embezzlement

229
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,343
committed by Won Sang-a
and her family for the last 20 years.

No way.

233
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,561
Is it the same as
the ledgers that Park Jae-sang burned?

234
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,855
It's the same.

BOOKKEEPER FROM THE FUTURE

247
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,611
This would be a great place

248
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,907
for the police to start investigating
their embezzlement,

249
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:09,036
tax evasion, and slush funds.

250
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:18,211
Do you think I'll be able
to ride out this storm, Ms. Go?

251
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:24,551
I was wondering
what Mr. Park would have done.

252
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,306
Are you telling me to die right now?

253
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:36,354
While Mr. Park was still alive,
he always worried about you, Director Won.

254
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,982
Have you ever thought about

255
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,986
what you might need to do
if you ended up in a situation like this?

256
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,699
I can't reach Principal Jang.
He said he'd give me the memoir today.

257
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,285
Why would he give you the memoir?

258
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,874
Because I've been covering
Jeongran Society for a long time, and--

259
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,084
I don't trust him.

260
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:42,379
He's only helping you for his benefit.

261
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,381
He could turn on you at any time.

262
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,301
Do you really want to keep meeting
someone who abducted you?

263
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,388
But if it really is the General's memoir,

264
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,015
it will contain everything
I ever wanted to know.

265
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,435
How was Jeongran Society founded?

266
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,771
What happened in Vietnam?

267
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,815
And what on earth is that orchid?

268
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,442
Wait.

269
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,986
Don't you dare try to go alone.

270
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,036
You've made a wise choice.

271
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,874
No one would have been more suited
to care for the General and the orchids

272
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,127
if you were to abruptly disappear.

273
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,548
On top of that,
I am free from your crimes.

274
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,887
I'm the one
who blew the whistle on you after all.

275
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,141
I…

276
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,518
will rebuild Jeongran Society

277
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,731
to become what the General had
envisioned 50 years ago.

278
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,192
It will be dazzling

279
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,319
and magnificent!

280
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:54,034
There's something
I'm dying to know, Mr. Jang.

281
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,619
What is it?

282
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,371
My father told me

283
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:03,460
that Jeongran Society consists
of the top one percent of warriors

284
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,837
who could kill people
without any hesitation.

285
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,341
And that they could overcome anything

286
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:13,094
if they were to become one
in life and death.

287
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,056
Hearing that made my heart race

288
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,642
because he was talking about me.

289
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,519
I always knew

290
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,897
that I was…

291
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,983
in that top one percent.

292
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,781
So why was it…

293
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,455
that I was never given a chance?

294
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,666
What?

295
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,335
My brother took after Mom.

296
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,421
He was a coward
who ran the moment she told him to do so.

297
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,590
But I waited.

298
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,094
Even after my mom had died,

299
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,596
I remained where I stood

300
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,723
not moving an inch.

301
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:04,145
But you chose
the son of our chauffeur over me.

302
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,606
He wasn't a warrior.

303
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,774
He was a businessman

304
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,694
who always weighed the pros
and cons before killing someone.

305
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,488
So why?

306
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,200
Why him and not me?

307
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,494
Because I'm a woman?

308
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,163
Really?

309
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,791
Did you think it was
because you were a woman?

310
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,299
Tell me. I need to hear the answer today.

311
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,926
I spent way too long

312
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,347
contemplating this question.

313
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,226
You…

314
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,856
are only concerned about yourself.

315
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,818
You're unable to make a sacrifice
when the crucial moment comes.

316
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:57,699
Even now, you're supposed to
give your life to save the organization,

317
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,952
but all you're thinking about
is running as far away as possible.

318
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,313
This is odd.

319
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,648
His heart is suddenly beating rapidly.

320
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,233
-Let me call the doctor.
-Please.

321
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,968
There's no need for that.

322
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,179
My father

323
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,265
is just seeing a ghost.

324
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,184
I've added a few drops

325
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,188
of the blue orchid solution
into his nebulizer.

326
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,819
Now that you know, you may leave.

327
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,718
Do you want to know the real reason?

328
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:45,682
The reason why you can
never lead Jeongran Society.

329
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,104
It's because

330
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,149
you're completely insane.

331
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,278
I knew from the very start.

332
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,448
You're a complete maniac

333
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,161
who won't rest until you've destroyed

334
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,789
everything that's within your reach.

335
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,209
I'm right, aren't I?

336
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,735
Don't let anyone in today.

337
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,614
Don't let anyone disturb my father.

338
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,741
Yes, ma'am.

339
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,788
Should I make it so that he killed himself
when the corruption within the foundation

340
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,456
was about to be exposed?

341
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,583
No.

342
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,294
Hang him up somewhere everyone can see

343
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,671
so they'd know it was me who did it.

344
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,549
Make it as humiliating as possible.

345
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,363
Should I put this luggage up?

346
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:24,989
I'll do it.

347
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,377
I was thinking about Hwa-young.

348
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,921
Is it okay for me to leave her here?

349
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,635
I promised her

350
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,055
that I'll make sure
to take you to a safe place.

351
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,392
You have your journey to take,

352
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,769
and she has hers.

353
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:24,924
The bathroom.

354
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,833
Ms. Oh?

355
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,685
Do you need help, sir?

356
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,772
Was there a passenger
who left after using the bathroom?

357
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,940
I'm not sure.

358
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,609
-Did any passenger leave the aircraft?
-No.

359
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,782
We're about to take off, sir!

360
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,638
I sent a message to Oh In-joo.

361
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,641
I asked her to come for you
since you're here.

362
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,355
Do you think she'll come?

363
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,191
She won't.

364
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,403
She's probably left the country by now.

365
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,279
Even if she hasn't left yet,

366
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,408
I told her not to come no matter what.

367
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,456
She went all the way
to Singapore to find you,

368
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,042
knowing that she could have died there.

369
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,879
Perhaps she'll run over
with a flustered look on her face

370
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,592
with the hopes of being able to save you.

371
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,846
How sweet and heartrending would it be

372
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,685
to shatter that hope?

373
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,691
I must really like her.

374
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,404
She won't break down so easily.

375
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,240
Think about it.

376
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,119
The reason your life is in the gutter

377
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,039
is all because of Oh In-joo.

378
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,549
You've reached the police.

379
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,634
I'm being blackmailed with abduction.

380
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,678
The abducted person's name
is Jin Hwa-young.

381
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,804
And the address…

382
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,600
I honestly don't get it.

383
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,062
Why are you so mad at me?

384
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,688
I thought I treated you well.

385
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,357
When my mom died,

386
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,070
you asked me to go to Singapore.

387
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,696
What other choice was there?

388
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,532
The gold medalist that year

389
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,619
was called the most beautiful orchid
of the 21st century.

390
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,497
Do you remember what you said
when I kept silent

391
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,416
all the way on our return trip?

392
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,461
What did I say?

393
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,798
"The living must live on."

394
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,258
"Were you…

395
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,554
that close to your mom?"

396
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,811
Did I say that?

397
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,897
And the next day,

398
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,192
you sent me
your used designer bag and shoes.

399
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,903
They were totally expensive.

400
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,032
"The living must live on."

401
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,831
I dreaded those words.

402
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,874
Didn't you know that death

403
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,545
was something that the living
could experience too?

404
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,842
Not everyone is actually alive.

405
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,973
Anyway, it was then

406
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,225
that I first decided to show you…

407
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,979
how close I was to my mom.

408
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,649
How far I could take everything
if I decided to.

409
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,568
I wanted you to know that.

410
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,118
You and your temper.

411
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,338
WONRYEONG SCHOOL

412
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,064
Mr. Jang, I'm here.

413
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,921
NOTABLE ALUMNI
TRAITOR

414
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,346
Jong-ho--

415
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,430
In-kyung!

416
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,542
In-kyung.

417
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,253
In-kyung!

418
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,349
Thanks.

419
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,481
Thank you for using our service.

420
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,484
Your locker is now open.

421
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,279
Please close the door
after you take your belongings.

422
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,303
JONG-HO

423
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,888
It's me, Choi Do-il.

424
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,849
In-joo can't come to the phone right now.

425
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,891
Where is she?

426
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,148
The gates are open
and no one will be outside to stop you.

427
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,069
All you have to do is come

428
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,323
before I kill Hwa-young.

429
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,832
Right, go ahead
if you want to report me to the police,

430
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,752
if you're still hopeful
that someone might come to your rescue.

431
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,479
Why did you come, you fool?

432
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,773
I told you to stay out of my business.

433
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,575
I'm sure you have
your business to take care of,

434
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,452
but I have my business too.

435
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,705
I just came to take care of something.

436
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,583
Welcome. Just ignore her.

437
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,045
She's too pessimistic.

438
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,050
But did you say you have business here?

439
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,136
What could that be?

440
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,021
I'm going to kill you today.

441
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,197
What's that?

442
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,156
Ladybug.

443
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,534
A grenade for women.

444
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,547
I'm giving this to you
as a token of apology.

445
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,799
What's this?

446
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,219
Everyone should carry
at least one bomb in their life.

447
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,305
What use will I have for this in life?

448
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,474
You might have someone
you really want to kill.

449
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,977
It can also be used to break down a door.

450
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,480
It has a kill radius of 5 meters and
will maim anything within 15 meters.

451
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,150
It goes off five seconds
after you remove its safety pin.

452
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,569
You can run 15 meters in 5 seconds, right?

453
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,780
Run 15 meters in 5 seconds?

454
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,920
Hey, this place is
as good as a bomb shelter.

455
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,298
If that thing were to go off,

456
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,593
all of us will end up dead.

457
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,640
I only expected a 50-50 chance anyway.

458
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,934
Whether all three of us die here

459
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,520
or make it out alive…

460
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,481
it's your call to make.

461
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,658
I already have an ending in mind.

462
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,661
No one will be leaving this room…

463
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,334
alive.

464
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,261
Do you see those sprinklers?

465
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,849
They spray water twice a day,

466
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,604
to keep the air in this room damp
like in the jungle.

467
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,983
I've had the tanks
filled with hydrochloric acid today.

468
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,486
One ton of highly concentrated
hydrochloric acid.

469
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,531
Then Hwa-young will be the first to die.

470
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,535
She'll go blind
and her skin will burn off.

471
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,955
And five minutes after that,

472
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,998
you'll begin to wish

473
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,377
that you could have been
burned to death like Hwa-young.

474
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,796
Hydrochloric acid will fill the air,

475
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,675
melting your lungs
with every breath you take.

476
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:38,639
And if I could watch
the two of you writhe in pain,

477
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,266
all of that would be bearable.

478
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,813
I've been dead
for quite a while now anyway.

479
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,862
I know…

480
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,950
when it is you died.

481
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:01,495
I know why you continue to kill people

482
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:05,624
and eventually want to end your life
in such a painful way.

483
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,714
What are you going on about?

484
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:12,798
Was it an accident?

485
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,843
When you killed your mom, I mean.

486
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,891
I saw the CCTV footage
of you killing someone.

487
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,602
I already know

488
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,896
how you put on an act around the clock.

489
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,026
But what I saw wasn't an act.

490
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,113
You couldn't even breathe
and felt as if you were going to die.

491
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,367
You were just like Hyo-rin.

492
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,246
Did you also feel that way
when your mom died?

493
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,753
The scenes of your murder.

494
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:54,298
I always thought you were recreating
the scene of your mom's death.

495
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,386
You were lying when you told us
that your mom was dead

496
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,472
when you found her, weren't you?

497
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:05,142
You were there with her
right until the moment she died.

498
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,897
You were trying to relive that moment.

499
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,444
That short moment
when your mom was still alive.

500
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,489
It was an accident, wasn't it?

501
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,240
I doubt you meant for her to die.

502
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,078
Were you so sad
as to hope for your own death?

503
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,915
If not, I don't see how someone
could have turned into such a monster.

504
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,708
It's all Mom's fault!

505
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,418
I…

506
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,133
only wanted her to return home.

507
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:43,222
-Let's just go!
-I can't do that, Sang-a.

508
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,473
Why can't you?

509
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,559
I told her to beg my father
for forgiveness

510
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,561
and that she'd be allowed back if she did.

511
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,938
I can't…

512
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:55,401
But she said she couldn't turn a blind eye
to the deaths of those people.

513
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,403
She said she was sorry.

514
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,198
I still don't get it.

515
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,535
If she really was sorry,

516
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,204
she should've done that, right?

517
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,265
She told me to leave the room right away,
saying that everything will be fine

518
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:29,309
and that everything will pass over
after a good night's sleep.

519
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,023
She told me not to tell anyone
that I had been there,

520
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,401
especially Dad.

521
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,783
I was too worried to sleep.

522
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,871
When I went back to that room…

523
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,249
she was…

524
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,517
I took off her bloody clothes

525
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,603
and put her on her best clothes.

526
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,565
I've even put her in her prettiest heels.

527
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:27,367
Were you that heartbroken
over your mom's death?

528
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,828
You didn't even kill her yourself,

529
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,371
so why were you so upset?

530
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,041
I get how grieved you are,

531
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,543
but that still doesn't mean
you can kill other people.

532
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,962
And how dare you compare us?

533
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,173
I never killed anyone.

534
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,009
All I did was pay you back
for what you did to me.

535
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,553
A lost kitten…

536
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,059
You said you were the type
who picks up stray kittens.

537
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,980
You would feed
and give the kitten shelter,

538
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,816
only to abandon it and let it die

539
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,402
when the kitten thinks of you as its mom.

540
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,739
I always wondered why you did that.

541
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,828
You were punishing that little girl.

542
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,958
Because the person
you really wanted to kill

543
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,418
was yourself.

544
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,757
I don't know what you mean.

545
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,552
Anyway, everything is over now.

546
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,764
I'm going to end everything.

547
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,602
You know what?

548
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,604
I invited your sister too.

549
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,523
What?

550
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,441
It's about time she got here.

551
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,824
Yes, Director Won.

552
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,808
In-kyung.

553
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,609
You're in love with Oh In-joo, right?

554
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:27,237
-What?
-Otherwise, why would you even be here?

555
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,579
You shouldn't have done this

556
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,955
if you thought I loved her.

557
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,590
Unfortunately,

558
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,801
I guess the party will go on
with just us three here.

559
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,101
Okay.

560
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,895
Here we go.

561
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,423
It's useless.

562
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,803
I can't believe she's still full of hope.

563
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,853
Hwa-young.

564
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,087
Ms. Won Sang-a,
the director of Wonryeong Art Gallery

565
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,590
and the late Park Jae-sang's wife,
was found dead at her house last night

566
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,051
due to an accident
caused by unknown reasons.

567
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:21,805
Her death was caused by hydrochloric acid

568
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,851
sprayed by the sprinklers
in the indoor garden of her home.

569
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:26,768
The police…

570
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,195
You're…

571
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,990
The principal told me to give you this.

572
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,296
MEMOIRS OF WON GI-SEON
THE BLUE GHOST OF VIETNAM

573
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,172
"The operation was a success."

574
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:01,970
"We destroyed a spy training camp
the CIA set up in North Vietnam

575
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:08,476
and annihilated the remaining agents."

576
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:11,354
"But we had no way to return home."

577
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,443
"After wandering the jungles for a week,

578
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,196
we realized that
the operation only ends when we die."

579
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,660
"We learned that the CIA trained
the minority groups

580
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,203
in Laos and Thailand into spies

581
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,497
and used us
to dispose of them in the end."

582
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,417
"Thus, we weren't supposed
to make it back alive."

583
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,546
"The South Korean government
had already received

584
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,091
a million dollars from the US
as compensation."

585
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,426
"So in a way,

586
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,972
our motherland had sold us out to them."

587
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,102
-"We knew…"
-We knew we wouldn't make it

588
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,437
through that night.

589
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,650
We gave up on finding our way home

590
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,860
and went deeper into the jungle

591
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,655
in search of a place to rest
for the night.

592
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,600
Darn it.

593
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,570
When we climbed up a tree
to avoid the leeches,

594
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:46,449
someone said he was no longer in pain.

595
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,995
Some soldiers even said
they weren't hungry.

596
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,372
Perhaps…

597
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,500
they already died and became ghosts.

598
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,465
Everyone knew we were
going to die that night.

599
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,096
Despite that, we began to feel cheery.

600
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,996
At that moment,
I saw exactly what the future held.

601
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:37,667
We'll return home with these orchids.

602
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,546
Then we won't die.

603
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,932
We'll go back to our motherland,
continue to fight our war,

604
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,143
and live in eternal victory.

605
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,063
Because…

606
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,857
we aren't afraid of death.

607
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,583
But the fact that we were already ghosts

608
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,921
must remain a secret.

609
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,345
Jeongran Society was founded
by a special forces unit

610
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,597
who believed their motherland
had betrayed them.

611
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:37,060
The blue orchid symbolized
their crooked desires,

612
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,479
resentment, and ideology,
which grew and grew,

613
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:43,191
creating this murderous monster
with a hideous heart.

614
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:47,737
In the end, everything burned into ashes.

615
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,281
This made me think.

616
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,203
If I had covered the Vietnam War,
what kind of story would I have written?

617
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,541
I would have described the war,
covered the front lines,

618
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,210
and reported the number of casualties.

619
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,296
But could I have read into
the kind of people who died,

620
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,257
why they ended up in that war,

621
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,096
and the dreams and frustrations
they each held in their hearts?

622
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,693
Are you really not coming?

623
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,988
You said you wanted
to live somewhere like that.

624
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,574
What am I going to do in Greece anyway?

625
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,367
I don't even have 70 billion won anymore.

626
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,623
Will you really live
without a phone or an email?

627
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,001
For a while.

628
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,171
If someone calls
and offers me an easy job,

629
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,173
I'd be tempted to return to my old ways.

630
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,262
I'll be going now.

631
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,640
Stay healthy.

632
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,528
I'll see you again.

633
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,273
Are you doing okay?

634
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,319
Of course.

635
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,447
I've been studying

636
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,990
and reading a lot.

637
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,954
Are you feeling okay?

638
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,206
Yes.

639
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:08,753
There's a gardening program here.

640
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,089
Tending flowers

641
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,884
have been doing wonders
for my body and mind.

642
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,262
Is that so?

643
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,390
That's good.

644
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,776
In-joo.

645
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,947
I really am doing fine.

646
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,497
Maybe it's because of my face,

647
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,294
but everyone is really nice to me.

648
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,297
I don't have to look in a mirror
while I'm here anyway.

649
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:55,133
Twelve years will go by in a flash.

650
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,470
You're right.

651
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,015
When I thought
I'd be sentenced to 20 years,

652
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,435
a 15-year-sentence would've made me happy.

653
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,190
You know what?

654
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,069
Bookkeeper from the Future
is doing pretty great.

655
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,821
Really?

656
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,074
People visit me
from time to time asking me to sell it.

657
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,951
Maybe I should.

658
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,203
It's tough managing it from here.

659
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,499
You can…

660
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:32,003
always make another one later.

661
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,798
You're the director of our company.

662
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,926
I'll give you half once it's sold.

663
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,846
-I'll send it to the account--
-It was you

664
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,767
who made that software.

665
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,022
All I did was let you use my name.

666
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:55,860
You should save up that money
and start a new business later.

667
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,987
Okay?

668
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:31,771
ROOFTOP UNIT

669
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,948
YONGSAN TAX OFFICE

670

RECIPIENT: OH IN-JOO
TITLE: ADVANCE NOTICE OF TAXATION

671
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,801
A tax on a gift I received?

672
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,679
What…

673
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,098
What does this mean?

674
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,229
APPLICANT: OH IN-JOO

OWNER: OH IN-JOO

679
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,168
UNIT 801, APARTMENT 2,
CASTELLO HAN RIVER APARTMENT

680
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,336
There's a perfect soul for each home.

681
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,174
If this house chooses to accept you,
I should step away.

682
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,313
GREAT-AUNT

683
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,111
You know,

684
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,282
even if I lose everything,
I can always start again from scratch

685
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,326
if I have a home like this.

686
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,903
Where do souls live?

687
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:34,161
I always wanted a home
where my soul could live.

688
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,676
The moment I felt like
this house accepted me,

689
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,849
all my problems
seemed to have washed away.

690
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:11,657
From this moment on…

691
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,995
I think I'll become a different person.

692
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,825
Congratulations on receiving
the Today's Reporter award.

693
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,661
I knew you'd win.

694
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,622
You pretty much overshadowed
all the other reporters this year.

695
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,124
Thank you.

696
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,670
I know it wasn't easy for HTN
to give me this opportunity.

697
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:08,047
I could do my best thanks to you.

698
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,424
On the last day
of Park Jae-sang's campaign,

699
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,094
I told him the moment the news ended.

700
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,930
"How long has it been
since we've done news like this?"

701
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,808
Do you know what he said?

702
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:21,060
"Director, it's actually my first time."

703
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,439
I want to thank you as well.

704
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,984
I must have put you in
a difficult position many times,

705
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,486
but you've welcomed me
and helped me remain brave.

706
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,365
Speaking of which…

707
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,660
Don't you think
we should start working together?

708
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:42,415
Reporter Oh In-kyung,
we especially want to have you with us.

709
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,585
I'm respectfully making you
a recruitment offer.

710
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,716
We would never want to
have you as our enemy.

711
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,467
We'd rather have you as our ally.

712
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:57,430
Let's make great news together.

713
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,390
Yes, let's do that.

714
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,809
Cheers.

715
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,191
Eat up.

716
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,779
That's wonderful, In-kyung.

717
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,826
I was worried I might lose contact
with you if I went to the States.

718
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:22,705
It would be great to see you on TV
and hear people talk about you.

719
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:24,874
Right?

720
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,959
But…

721
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,504
-I turned it down.
-Why?

722
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,089
Haven't you waited for this?

723
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,928
I was really happy
as I covered this story.

724
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:42,058
Those were the most exciting days
of my life.

725
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:46,187
I thought it was because I got to cover
a story in any way I liked,

726
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,440
but come to think of it,

727
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,902
I think it was because I was with you.

728
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,408
When did you say you are leaving?

729
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,622
The first week of next month.

730
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,169
Should I come with you?

731
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:13,923
Are you sure?

732
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,511
There are many things I want to study.

733
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:20,304
And…

734
01:08:23,057 --> 01:08:26,352
I want to be with you
wherever it is that I go or return from.

735
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,401
It'd be great if I could live
every day feeling like this.

736
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,949
I kept thinking about what you said.

737
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,911
How you said you couldn't see yourself
in love with anyone else.

738
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,415
I think I feel the same way.

739
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,342
By any chance,

740
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,095
is your heart racing right now?

741
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,097
Me?

742
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,474
You said being with me
made your heart rate drop,

743
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,227
and made your brain produce alpha waves.

744
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:11,438
Yes.

745
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:13,107
I did, but…

746
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,545
I want your heart to race too.

747
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,552
I think it is.

748
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,199
How will you pay the gift tax?

749
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,786
I'll take out a mortgage loan
of 600 million won

750
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,748
and use the rest to help you study abroad.

751
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,500
In-joo.

752
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:17,087
I thought you might end up
taking money from Jong-ho.

753
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:19,256
You may be in love with him now,

754
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:22,676
but what if that changes
once you're out and about in the world?

755
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,678
What?

756
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:26,805
Anyway…

757
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,433
I'll help you study to the end.

758
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:32,436
I've always regretted not
being able to help you study abroad.

759
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,651
I mean, a loan of 600 million
with 5 percent interest?

760
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,778
You'll have to pay back
4.2 million a month.

761
01:10:40,861 --> 01:10:43,489
How will you manage that?
The rates are skyrocketing right now.

762
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:47,243
I think it's more rational
to sell that house, pay the tax,

763
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,286
and move into another house.

764
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,583
Do I seem like a rational person to you?

765
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,627
I'd rather sell my organs

766
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,588
than sell off my lifelong dream.

767
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,553
By the way,

768
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,681
what's wrong with Mom
in our family chat room?

769
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:10,224
Tell me about it.

770
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,603
Their passports were taken away
and they just got them back.

771
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,648
But from now on,
she wants to travel the world with Dad.

772
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,360
I had to muster up all my strength
to ignore that.

773
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,321
I can let everything else slide,

774
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:27,032
but she's constantly
bombarding us with photos.

775
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,459
What do you think?

776
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,420
In-hye will look perfect in this, right?

777
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:41,463
Is she in her right mind?

778
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,009
Does she seriously think
In-hye would wear something like this?

779
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,431
She doesn't know
anything about her daughters.

780
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,017
This is stressing me out.

781
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,693
I wonder if In-hye is doing well.

782
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,449
How could she not call us even once?

783
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,289
I hope she's not skipping her meals.

784
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,499
She's probably okay.

785
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,295
Hi, In-joo, In-kyung.

786
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,600
Today is Hyo-rin's birthday.

787
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,314
So we went to the bank
and withdrew 70 billion won.

788
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,367
Do you have a place to stay?

789
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:36,829
Do you want me to find
a safe place for you?

790
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,914
Thank you.

791
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,792
Why are you offering to help us?

792
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,503
Is there something you want from us?

793
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:50,717
Or do you plan to tell my sister
or Hyo-rin's mom about where we--

794
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,845
Hey, don't be like that.

795
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:54,430
You're right.

796
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,431
I do want something.

797
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,642
You have a bank account in Panama, right?

798
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,727
I'd like to borrow that.

799
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:04,815
It's a corporate account under my name,

800
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,276
so I can't access it before my birthday.

801
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,610
I know.

802
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,821
Is it for a crime?

803
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,246
I want to use it to store
your sister's money.

804
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,916
Are you trying to steal
her sister's money?

805
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,377
Not exactly.

806
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,255
I'm trying to protect it for her.

807
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,426
There might come a time
when we risk losing that money.

808
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,517
And how do you plan to split it up?

809
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:44,688
It sounds like her bank account
will be playing a vital role,

810
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,024
and it's Hyo-rin
who's taking all the risks.

811
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:02,039
BALANCE: 10 BILLION WON

812
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,189
In our poor family…

813
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,859
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

814
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:36,615
…I was a girl who always received a lot.

815
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,702
You have to sign up by this week, right?

816
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:42,996
-Do you like our gift?
-Yes!

817
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:45,165
I was always afraid

818
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:48,085
that I may not be able to
pay any of it back.

819
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,503
Ta-da.

820
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:52,839
I was afraid I'll end up
unworthy of the love you showed me.

821
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,049
I wish you hadn't.

822
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,927
Get some snacks.

823
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:02,099
-I remember everything you two gave me.
-For your friends too.

824
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,310
In-hye, I'm here

825
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,312
-Stop her.
-In-hye, where are you?

826
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,522
How that made me feel…

827
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,235
The times when I was happy,
the times when I was annoyed,

828
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,572
and the times I was in the wrong.

829
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,784
The faces I'll remember
for the rest of my life…

830
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,788
It's those faces I want to paint.

831
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,292
Once they pile up

832
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:31,628
and I feel that I've finally
put on a different face,

833
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,590
I'll return to you.

834
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,810
RESERVATION CONFIRMATION
NAME: OH IN-KYUNG, VISA TYPE: F-1

835
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:53,567
Right, I divided up the money equally.

836
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,334
You loved studying so much that
you wanted to die studying, In-kyung.

837
01:17:12,085 --> 01:17:14,671
It must have been heartbreaking
to give up studying

838
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,089
because we didn't have money.

839
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,551
You can study all you want now.

840
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:21,595
Once you become a great reporter,

841
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:24,139
we'll meet again someday

842
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:27,059
somewhere on this earth.

843
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:37,069
But In-joo,

844
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,906
I want you to have much more.

845
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,790
You gave me your everything,

846
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,085
and this was your money to begin with.

847
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,715
Make sure you buy an apartment.

848
01:18:01,635 --> 01:18:03,637
Not one for our family,

849
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,014
but a place to call your own.

850
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,437
I hope that one day
you'd be able to eat, sleep

851
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:15,148
and work, all for no one but yourself.

852
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,360
That's something

853
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:21,071
that I had always wished for.

854
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,810
BUT THE FACT THAT WE WERE ALREADY GHOSTS
MUST REMAIN A SECRET

855
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:13,303
