1
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,850
What?

2
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,393
The RPM.

3
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,145
What the hell?

4
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,487
Brakes. Brakes, damn it.

5
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,063
This girl, Park Hyo-rin.
Is she your friend?

6
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,898
Is she harassing you?

7
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,566
Are you being bullied?

8
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,362
Did you

9
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,823
get paid for that painting?

10
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,990
Is that it?

11
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,911
I'm going to use that to study abroad.

12
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,706
Hyo-rin's mom promised to send me
to Boston Arts High School with Hyo-rin

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,209
in return for painting
a few pieces for her portfolio.

14
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,632
In-hye. That's a crime.

15
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,678
Da Vinci, Rembrandt, Velázquez…

16
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,012
They all made a living

17
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,807
by painting portraits
of kings, nobles, and even their dogs.

18
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,475
I don't feel ashamed.

19
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,895
You saw my painting.

20
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,939
I put my heart and soul into it.

21
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,859
I imagined that it was Hyo-rin
who was painting it.

22
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,903
The girl who took her first steps
in galleries around Europe.

23
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,447
The girl who's been to the French village
where Van Gogh once lived.

24
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,908
The girl who had ice cream
in front of a fountain

25
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,577
at a cathedral in Italy.

26
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,081
That made things so easy.

27
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,833
I think that's why I won the prize.

28
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,793
I was Park Hyo-rin, not Oh In-hye,
when I painted it.

29
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,295
That's wrong.

30
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,047
You're selling your soul.

31
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,257
In-kyung.

32
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,760
What is a soul made of?

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,016
If I had a soul and Hyo-rin's mom
bought it for a high price,

34
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,934
I'd be flattered.

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,521
Do you know any other way
I could study abroad?

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,950
I got you out, Director Shin.

37
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,328
You're safe now. Don't worry.

38
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,299
EMERGENCY CALL

39
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,512
Hello?

40
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,768
Eun-seo, take this.

41
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,438
It's mushroom porridge.
Eat it while it's warm.

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,532
I'll wait outside. Let's go home together.

43
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,203
IN-HYE

44
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,585
You can head home first. I have plans.

45
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,506
In-hye left a while ago.

46
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,174
She's not here.

47
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,720
Darn it.

48
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,555
Do you know where she went?

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,140
She went to Park Hyo-rin's place.

50
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,227
Park Hyo-rin won a prize,
so she's throwing a party.

51
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,521
Park Hyo-rin?

52
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,982
I didn't know Park Hyo-rin had a friend.

53
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:37,318
Exactly. I can't believe it.
Since when does she have a friend?

54
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,361
I know.

55
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:43,241
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight,
twenty-nine, thirty…

56
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,619
CHOI DO-IL

57
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,294
-Mr. Choi.
-Ms. Oh.

58
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,962
Are you okay?

59
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,797
Why are you answering
Director Shin's phone?

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,758
He had a car accident.

61
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,719
Where are you? I'll come to you.

62
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,000
Excuse me.

63
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
May I see your invitation, please?

64
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,006
Well, I know someone at the party.
Can I just--

65
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
Reporter Oh In-kyung?

66
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,929
This is a private gathering.
You can't enter.

67
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,975
I'm here for a personal reason.
My sister is inside.

68
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,351
What's your sister's name?

69
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,897
Let me bring her to you.

70
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,742
-Wait!
-In-hye!

71
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,702
-I'm here!
-You can't enter! Stop her.

72
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,579
In-hye, where are you?

73
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,830
I told you not to touch me.

74
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,958
-Drag her out.
-In-hye, your sister's here!

75
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,585
In-hye, come out!

76
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,962
-Is she really your sister?
-In-hye, come with me!

77
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,715
-Yes.
-I said, let go of me!

78
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,842
In-hye!

79
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,886
Who is that lady?

80
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,347
-No idea.
-How embarrassing.

81
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,349
What were the guards doing?

82
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,606
IN-KYUNG

83
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,277
The person you are calling is unavailable.

84
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,879
So it's you.

85
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,090
You're way too talented to stay in Korea.

86
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,051
I told you.

87
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:10,012
Everyone in my family
loves your paintings.

88
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,517
Hyo-rin's dad is
especially generous to geniuses.

89
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,519
It makes more sense
to invest in one genius

90
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,314
than to hand out money
to a hundred ordinary people.

91
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:27,405
You know we're putting together
a marvelous plan for you, right?

92
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,411
Thank you.

93
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,955
SOJU

94
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,083
That'll be 1,800 won.

95
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,732
Are you okay?

96
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,525
Are you not hurt?

97
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,324
This is yours, right?

98
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,950
It was found at the scene.

99
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,707
I went to confront…

100
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,335
Director Shin.

101
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,880
I accused him of being responsible
for Hwa-young's death.

102
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,842
He denied it.

103
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,136
And then he said

104
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,974
that there was something else
to be scared of.

105
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,893
That there's someone high up above us.

106
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,939
He drove off after that, but then…

107
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,691
You must've been shocked.

108
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,402
I gave him CPR,

109
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,696
but it didn't help.

110
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,620
Director Shin is dead.

111
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,330
Pull yourself together and listen.

112
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,960
You met him to hand over your projects
after your resignation.

113
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,004
He had an accident on his way back.

114
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,090
That's the story you must stick to.

115
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,841
Can you say it back to me?

116
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,476
You asked me if I was okay
as soon as I answered the phone.

117
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,357
Did you know
that Director Shin had an accident?

118
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,901
It wasn't just an accident, was it?

119
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,529
Will I be causing someone trouble

120
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,449
if I don't lie to the police?

121
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,203
You're already in trouble.

122
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,162
CCTV IN OPERATION

123
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,049
-Try this too.
-In-hye!

124
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,177
-Let's go home together!
-What's her deal?

125
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
There she goes again.

126
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,474
-Oh In-hye! Come out!
-Go check!

127
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,309
Come out!

128
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,810
No way.

129
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,982
In-hye! Please come out!

130
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,404
Shall we go inside?

131
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,240
You should stay away
from any bad influences.

132
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,744
I'm not going home without you!

133
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,999
-Please, come down.
-Come down!

134
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,000
In-hye!

135
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,961
Come out! Please!

136
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,256
What is wrong with her?
I heard that she's a reporter.

137
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,300
Looks like she's had one too many drinks.

138
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,177
Goodness, what a sight.

139
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,142
In-hye! Your painting
was absolutely beautiful!

140
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,521
You must've been devastated
to sell it off!

141
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,066
I'm sorry

142
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,527
for failing to protect you!

143
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,323
When I was in high school,

144
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,367
I hated going home too.

145
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,370
Do you know
why I still came home every day?

146
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,456
It was because you were waiting for me!

147
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,838
You don't have to leave.

148
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,382
If she's bothering you,
I can make her be quiet.

149
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,800
But this is fun.

150
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,260
Just leave her be.

151
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,388
A video of an alcoholic reporter
making a scene.

152
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,682
People will love it.

153
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:09,437
It was just a suspension last time,
but I'm sure she'll get fired this time.

154
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,646
Can't you just stay?

155
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,524
Your sister seems scary.

156
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,067
She's still her sister.

157
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,111
She must feel bad.

158
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,833
-Is that the girl?
-It's her.

159
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,750
Her?

160
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,920
In-hye.

161
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,134
She's coming.

162
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,052
Darn it.

163
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,471
-Gosh!
-Careful!

164
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,681
Don't touch the pole.

165
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,849
Careful!

166
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,059
Move aside!

167
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,942
Gosh, who is it?

168
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,028
It's you, In-hye. My sweet In-hye.

169
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,362
Excuse me.

170
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,032
We got a report.
Let me ask you some questions.

171
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,993
What report? This is my sister.

172
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,786
She's my daughter's friend's sister.

173
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,747
Please let her go.

174
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,129
Mr. Park Jae-sang.

175
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,507
Hyo-rin's father.

176
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,842
You have everything,

177
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,095
so why are you eyeing
the youngest girl of a poor family?

178
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,890
Be quiet. Let's just go.

179
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,603
Let me tell you.

180
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:37,816
She is the person
I love the most in the world.

181
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,654
If you ruin her, I won't sit back.

182
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,573
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth
and make you pay.

183
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,662
-Ms. Go.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,081
It looks like our guest has had
too much to drink.

185
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,375
Have Mr. Yang drive her home.

186
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,459
Forget it.

187
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,631
Wait for me, In-hye!

188
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,679
I got this CCTV footage
from the bank yesterday.

189
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,350
KOOKGA BANK

190
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,812
Hwa-young was managing
about 20 slush fund accounts.

191
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,773
The day before she left for Europe,

192
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,984
she moved the money around
into other accounts

193
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,486
and withdrew two billion won in cash.

194
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,531
Isn't that strange?

195
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,742
She was going to leave Korea for good.

196
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,662
But you can't take that much cash abroad.

197
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,623
That does sound strange.

198
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,208
It was for someone in the country.

199
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,004
Most likely an accomplice.

200
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,965
What do you mean, an accomplice?

201
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,470
I've ruled out her father.

202
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,307
When we offered him 50 million won,

203
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,184
he immediately cremated her
and provided all the information.

204
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,729
What about her other acquaintances?

205
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,691
She has no siblings or relatives.

206
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,819
Her only friend…

207
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,783
was you, Ms. Oh.

208
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,709
How would someone feel
after losing 70 billion won?

209
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,378
They would feel awful, right?

210
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,757
Those people tend to obsess over money.

211
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,675
They'd do anything to get it back.

212
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,429
But luckily, it seems
the stars have aligned for you.

213
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,598
What do you mean?

214
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,600
We'll say Director Shin took it.

215
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,061
Director Shin?

216
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,146
That used to be his MO.

217
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,482
Putting all the blame on a dead person.

218
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,817
Hwa-young's suicide and his accident…

219
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,361
Just leave things as they are.

220
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,363
Let sleeping dogs lie.

221
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,907
Is that a threat?

222
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
It's a favor.

223
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,955
I'm covering for you
with no strings attached.

224
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,123
Why? You're not that kind of person.

225
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,583
Then what kind of person am I?

226
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,337
You only care about money.

227
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,049
That's why you can trust me.

228
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,635
I wouldn't gain anything
by taking the money from you

229
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,261
and giving it to another person.

230
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,269
I told you to check her out thoroughly.

231
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,731
Hyo-rin's future is on the line.
No mistakes are allowed.

232
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,402
I checked her parents, finances,
grades, and friends, but…

233
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,822
You failed to check her siblings.

234
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,410
And her sister happens to be
a loudmouthed reporter.

235
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,577
I'm sorry.

236
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,830
What do we do, Honey?

237
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,666
I think it's rather interesting.

238
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,918
She can't say a word to anyone.

239
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,921
Think about whose life
will be ruined if she did.

240
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,175
And now we know who she loves
the most in the world.

241
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,016
Today was the most
humiliating day of my life.

242
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,644
I don't think I'll be able to forgive you
as long as I live.

243
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,861
I'm blocking you.
I refuse to talk to you anymore.

244
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,635
What should I do, Hwa-young?

245
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,515
If you died an unfair death,
I was determined to bring it to light.

246
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,851
But I'm too scared.

247
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,895
I don't think I can go on.

248
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,318
I'm truly sorry,

249
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,403
but I want to put it all behind me now.

250
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,781
Would that be okay?

251
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,132
Look at you.

252
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,719
You really are a princess.

253
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,481
IN BLOOM

254
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,019
"I drew these from memory."

255
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,148
"Because you brought Princess along
on your last visit,

256
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,233
I was able to hang on a little longer."

257
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,943
"Won Sang-woo."

258
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,615
Won Sang-woo the CEO?

259
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,953
PS, I have a favor to ask you.

260
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,830
When Princess blooms,

261
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,542
will you show it to the CEO,
Mr. Won Sang-woo, in the hospital?

262
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,336
FROM WON SANG-WOO
TO JIN HWA-YOUNG

263
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,633
Just so you know,

264
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,344
he's a fellow outcast.

265
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,348
You can tell him anything.

266
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,832
1 NEW MESSAGE

267
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,548
TODAY WAS THE MOST
HUMILIATING DAY OF MY LIFE…

268
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,974
In-hye! Let's go home together!

269
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:32,773
In-hye! Your painting
was absolutely beautiful!

270
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,484
Housebreaking, property damage,

271
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,154
disturbing the peace, threat, and insult.

272
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,074
Park Jae-sang is willing to file charges

273
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,785
unless we fire Ms. Oh.

274
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:49,414
She has publicly shown hostility
toward Mr. Park multiple times.

275
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,376
She is a threat
to our impartiality as the press.

276
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:56,713
We also risk getting on the wrong side of
the potential mayor of Seoul.

277
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,465
So we should fire her?

278
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,634
Isn't it better to get it over with?

279
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,303
Or Mr. Park will leak the video
and file charges.

280
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,430
They can't.

281
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,390
Why not?

282
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,601
If they do, I'll start talking
about the things I shouldn't.

283
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,147
Did you drink?

284
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,859
-Yes.
-Why?

285
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,987
An alcoholic doesn't need
a reason to drink.

286
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,113
Wait outside, Ma-ri.

287
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,829
By the way, Ma-ri.

288
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,041
How did you get yourself
into Park Jae-sang's party?

289
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,211
It was a private gathering
so reporters weren't allowed in.

290
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,630
His wife invited me.

291
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,756
You know her?

292
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,427
At the meeting last time,
it seemed like you didn't know her.

293
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,262
He will be the next mayor of Seoul.

294
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,431
Eventually, he will run for president.

295
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,476
I made sure I got acquainted with his wife
before he wins the election.

296
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,855
It makes a huge difference
to get a head start.

297
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,651
Are you the one who filmed this video?

298
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,696
-What?
-My sister told me.

299
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,782
She saw someone from my workplace
filming me on her phone.

300
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,744
I hope I'm wrong

301
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,872
but were you the one
who filmed that viral video too?

302
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,832
I recognize the breathing.

303
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,084
-What do you take me for?
-Get out.

304
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,971
CURRENT EVENTS DEPARTMENT
DEPARTMENT HEAD JO WAN-GYU

305
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,390
I know you can be reckless at times,

306
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,226
but I know you're not this stupid.

307
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm sure you had a reason, so explain.

308
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,981
A good reporter

309
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,944
should be able to cover a story even if
it involves a family member, right?

310
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,947
Is your sister involved?

311
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,117
You can fire me.

312
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,620
I don't think I deserve to be a reporter.

313
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,471
ST. BENEDICTUS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

314
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,414
WON SANG-WOO

315
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,260
Thank you.

316
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,975
I heard about Hwa-young.

317
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:56,977
I thought I would

318
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,855
never get to see Princess again.

319
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,275
Do you believe

320
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,695
that Hwa-young killed herself?

321
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,282
Do you believe otherwise?

322
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,242
To tell you the truth,

323
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,953
I believed that Director Shin killed her.

324
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,415
-But…
-He died too.

325
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,836
Sir.

326
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,337
Something's been bothering me.

327
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,346
Hwa-young left me…

328
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
this.

329
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,357
Two billion won in cash.

330
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:49,446
Throughout my life,
I've thought about money a lot.

331
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,324
What would I do
if 100 million won fell into my lap?

332
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,992
I would spend 30 million
to pay off Dad's debt,

333
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,452
and 10 million to buy a car.

334
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,706
I would imagine these things
before falling asleep when I was younger.

335
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,041
So…

336
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,461
when I saw this money, I cried a little.

337
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,880
I was thrilled.

338
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,927
But now,

339
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,679
I'm scared.

340
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,227
What do you think I should do?

341
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,437
I don't want to die because of money.

342
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,816
Should I return it?
Or should I report it to the police?

343
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,197
When I first took over the company,
I was shocked.

344
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,284
I found huge slush funds
being transferred somewhere each year.

345
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,536
I sued my father, the former CEO,

346
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,373
for embezzlement and malpractice.

347
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,625
You sued your father?

348
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,836
He kept pressuring me
to set up more slush funds.

349
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,464
In the end, he got acquitted,

350
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,300
and I was put in a psychiatric hospital.

351
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,888
So nothing will change

352
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,307
even if I report it?

353
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,104
The police will conclude that you pocketed
the money Hwa-young had embezzled

354
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,231
and turned yourself in for it.

355
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,693
The two billion won will go to
those who orchestrated the embezzlement.

356
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,611
Do you want that?

357
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,410
They're all a bunch of thieves.

358
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:21,997
You deserve this money
just as much as they do.

359
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,457
Just take it and protect it.

360
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:28,795
I guess

361
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,631
that's what you said

362
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,633
to Hwa-young as well.

363
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,847
She was a brave person.

364
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,975
She completely understood

365
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,062
that rich people risk their capital
while poor people must risk their lives.

366
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,483
I…

367
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,278
still don't understand it.

368
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:59,326
Does this money make you anxious?

369
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,994
Yes.

370
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,704
Spend it.

371
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,415
Sorry?

372
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,793
Money is transient,
so it makes you anxious.

373
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,296
Turn it into things
that can't be taken away.

374
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,465
What did you want to buy
if you had the money?

375
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,593
Well…

376
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,638
A winter coat.

377
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,017
Winter clothes are a status symbol.

378
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,770
In summer, your clothes
don't really show how poor you are.

379
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,064
But winter clothes are expensive.

380
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:30,982
A winter coat is a must.

381
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,735
So that we can look forward to winter.

382
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,320
What else?

383
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,656
What could change your life
for the better?

384
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,744
An apartment.

385
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,483
This is what they're after right now.

386
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,068
Take them with you.

387
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,112
What are these?

388
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,696
Slush fund ledgers.

389
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,867
Director Shin knew those people very well.

390
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,579
He was thoroughly prepared
for the worst-case scenario.

391
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,790
This could have

392
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,751
saved Hwa-young's life.

393
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,548
Why are you

394
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,758
so nice to me?

395
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:46,224
Hwa-young once told me
that you resembled Princess.

396
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,352
What?

397
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,564
You may not look like much now,

398
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,735
but once you bloom,
you'll be more dazzling than anyone.

399
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,576
Let's say that I'm curious
to see you in bloom.

400
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,923
Who is it?

401
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,343
I'm Choi Do-il, sir. Please open the door.

402
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,309
I'm a bit occupied.
Can you come back later?

403
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,060
It's urgent, sir.

404
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,980
Please open the door.

405
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,128
Send me a picture of your winter coat.

406
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,929
I hope you're not telling me
to leave through here--

407
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,347
Do come back when you bloom.

408
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,433
And be sure to buy an apartment.

409
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,645
Sir…

410
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,791
I'm coming in.

411
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,888
THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO

412
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,064
For heaven's sake,
Edmond Dantès just managed to escape.

413
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,025
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for something urgently.

414
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,572
This was found in Director Shin's bag.

415
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,076
A sample copy of the slush fund ledgers.

416
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,121
I think he was going to make a deal
with the prosecution.

417
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,414
I'm looking for the original.

418
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,540
His dashcam footage revealed

419
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,625
that this was the last place
he visited before his death.

420
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:20,920
Is that right?

421
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,381
Search all you want.

422
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,383
Excuse me.

423
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,599
Jeez.

424
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,837
-Thank you.
-This tree here…

425
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,508
I planted it with my father-in-law
when Hyo-rin was born.

426
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:53,096
What do you think General Won Gi-seon,
your father-in-law, would have said

427
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,681
about your political career?

428
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,850
You're taking the opposite path
from him in terms of ideology.

429
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,105
"Is that what you think?"

430
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,566
"By the way,
what should we have for dinner?"

431
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,904
Something like that.

432
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:14,033
He never imposed his ideas on anyone.

433
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,082
I'm in charge of grilling.

434
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,667
It's always been a man's job

435
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,088
since tens of thousands of years ago
when men hunted to feed their families.

436
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,383
Let's see here.

437
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,178
Here you go.

438
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,059
-It's good.
-It is?

439
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,229
I just can't take this away from him

440
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:48,443
because of his pride as the provider
and the guardian of this family.

441
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,822
That must be why he went into politics.

442
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,283
To feed as many people as he can.

443
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,451
Here you go, Hyo-rin.

444
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,751
How would you rate your dad?

445
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,127
I'd give him 100 out of 100.

446
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,339
But as a husband, he would get a 200.

447
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,176
I think he loves my mom
more than he loves me.

448
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,055
If you're jealous, marry a man like me.

449
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,435
You're Hyo-rin's best friend, right?

450
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,064
How do you feel
when you see Hyo-rin's parents?

451
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,992
They make me want to become a grown-up.

452
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,913
I've never felt that way before.

453
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,918
She calls my mom Ariadne.

454
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,547
During cast drawing, she said
Ariadne had the same nose as my mom's.

455
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,426
Thanks, In-hye.

456
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,888
That's so sweet of you.

457
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,223
Dig in, In-hye.

458
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,768
Eat up.

459
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,025
It's good, right?

460
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,403
It tastes even better
if you dip it in the sauce.

461
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,112
Won Sang-woo fell short of his father,
General Won Gi-seon's expectations.

462
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,948
He lost a power struggle
with his brother-in-law, Park Jae-sang,

463
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,908
and ended up in the psychiatric hospital.

464
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,493
I see.

465
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,873
Are the ledgers in there?

466
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,667
How did you know?

467
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,462
-Mr. Won made a clever move.
-What?

468
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,299
What would he enjoy more
than you going after Mr. Park

469
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,466
with those ledgers?

470
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,886
He'll get his revenge
without lifting a finger.

471
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,305
Of course, you could die
during the process.

472
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,266
But why should he care?
It doesn't concern him.

473
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,064
Anyway, how did you end up there?

474
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,901
Was Mr. Won involved in
Hwa-young's embezzlement?

475
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,612
Mr. Choi.

476
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,697
You came here to find the ledgers, right?

477
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,157
Yes.

478
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,992
And you just did.

479
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,910
I did.

480
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,871
You also know I took the two billion won.

481
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,624
Yes.

482
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,796
Let's strike a deal. Once and for all.

483
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,965
I won't ask for much.

484
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,718
Two billion won and my safety.

485
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,763
But you must guarantee
my safety at all costs.

486
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,391
Director Shin was a thorough person.

487
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,560
For 25 years, since his days
at Wonryeong Construction,

488
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,106
he should have recorded how, where,
and how many slush funds were set up.

489
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,150
That for only two billion won?

490
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,948
Then what am I supposed to do?

491
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,116
Just wait.
It's not time to strike a deal yet.

492
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,703
As the election approaches,
the ledgers will become more valuable.

493
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,498
You probably can't negotiate it yourself.

494
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,167
Let's split it fifty-fifty.

495
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:40,883
Are you suggesting that we team up?

496
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,970
I promise to get the most money
out of the ledgers.

497
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,388
That's my expertise.

498
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,099
Look, Mr. Choi Do-il.

499
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,060
I already told you
what I think of you, didn't I?

500
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:53,980
Yes. You think I'm someone
who only cares about money.

501
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,023
To be honest,

502
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,068
I suspect that you had something to do
with Director Shin's death.

503
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,905
I'm even terrified
to be in the same car as you.

504
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,574
So how can I possibly team up with you?

505
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,552
That day

506
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,139
when I became friends with Hwa-young
at a small cafe in Geneva,

507
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,516
she told me many things.

508
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,270
Everything from her mother
to the Bookkeeper from the Future.

509
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,691
She even told you about that?

510
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,902
I can't stop thinking,

511
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,364
"If only she had asked me
to work with her that day."

512
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,075
Where are you investing your money?

513
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,453
I've been designing
this software for years.

514
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,538
Hwa-young had a great plan.

515
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,999
But she couldn't implement it alone.

516
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,250
THE TRANSFER OF CAPITAL

517
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,501
If she had me,

518
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,129
she wouldn't have died.

519
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,137
What if you betray me?

520
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,932
I'd end up like Hwa-young
or Director Shin.

521
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,936
Do you have your ID?

522
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,564
Yes.

523
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,024
I'll drop you off at a bank.

524
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,860
Rent a safe deposit box
and store the ledgers there.

525
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,320
They won't be able to harm you

526
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,280
since you'll be the only one
who can access it.

527
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,532
But don't deposit the cash.

528
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,660
You may as well be advertising
that you have it.

529
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,543
Have I ever told you what I think of you?

530
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,339
No.

531
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,552
You're a small storm, Ms. Oh.

532
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,098
No matter where you go,
you change the flow of the air,

533
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,891
although you don't seem to notice it.

534
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,560
But you can't do this alone.

535
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:58,687
To play this game,

536
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,898
you'll need me.

537
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,535
Let's split it sixty-forty.

538
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,995
And the two billion is mine.

539
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,500
I get sixty, okay?

540
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,142
Your sister blocked you,
and you're on the verge of getting fired?

541
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,059
Yes.

542
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,522
Do you know that I'm an ETuber?

543
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,526
Are you suggesting I become one too?

544
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,155
When you lose your job,
you're bound to go on ETube.

545
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,698
Check it out when you're bored.

546
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,117
What is it about?

547
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,618
The charm of produce?

548
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,040
THE CHARM OF YEOLMU

549
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,128
YEOLMU LOVES
A COOL AND SUNNY CLIMATE

550
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,965
YEOLMU IS SPROUTING

551
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,717
THE SPROUTS NEED PRUNING

552
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:16,098
LOOK AT THESE HEALTHY LEAVES

553
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,100
They're lovely.

554
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:22,104
It grew into healthy yeolmu
with just some water and sunlight.

555
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,647
You like yeolmu kimchi, right?

556
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,900
Take some with you later.

557
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,359
Nice.

558
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,029
But my mom isn't here to make me some.

559
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,072
I can make them for you.

560
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,157
Seriously?

561
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,287
How did you even think of doing this?

562
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,207
During a rough patch in the States,

563
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,584
I stumbled upon an ETube video.

564
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,211
And it somehow cheered me up.

565
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,754
That's why I started it.

566
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,297
What video was it?

567
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,759
What is it? Show me.

568
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,599
Typhoon Catherine is sweeping
over the Korean Peninsula,

569
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,850
causing serious damage.

570
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,270
Let's hear from Reporter Oh In-kyung
about the situation out there.

571
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,271
Reporter Oh.

572
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,106
It randomly showed up on my feed.

573
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,026
I swear I didn't look up
your name regularly.

574
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:13,405
I'm reporting from Jeollanam-do, which was
severely hit by Typhoon Catherine.

575
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,910
The continuous strong wind
makes it hard for me to even stand still.

576
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:21,956
I'm having the wind at my back
to report more smoothly,

577
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,958
but let me face the wind for a second

578
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,544
to show you just how strong the storm is.

579
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,586
MAXIMUM WIND SPEED OF 25 METERS PER SECOND

580
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,463
When the wind is at its worst…

581
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,966
RAINFALL OF OVER 30 MILLIMETERS PER HOUR

582
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,510
…I can't even keep my balance.

583
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,387
I will keep you updated on the latest

584
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,349
from the most affected areas.

585
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:44,103
I'm Oh In-kyung with OBN
from Jeollanam-do.

586
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,025
KIM CHEOL-SEONG, NEPHEW OF KIM DAL-SU

587
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,155
Hello?

588
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,242
Hello, my name is Kim Hui-seong.

589
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,411
I'm the late Kim Cheol-seong's
younger brother.

590
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,956
To my brother,

591
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,750
Uncle Dal-su was like a father.

592
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,921
He taught him how to read
and sent him to school.

593
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,799
He ran over whenever he got in trouble.

594
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,677
So that's why your brother
looked after your uncle.

595
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,886
It's funny.

596
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,265
His real sons didn't even care.

597
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:26,478
Anyway, my brother couldn't accept
that Uncle Dal-su killed himself

598
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:29,815
and kept watching the CCTV footage
from the day of his death.

599
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,651
Was there anything suspicious?

600
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,736
Not at all.

601
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,113
We fought over it a lot.

602
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,200
He obsessed over it like a madman
when it was clearly a suicide.

603
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:49,126
This was in my brother's pocket
on the day of his accident.

604
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,215
The CCTV footage?

605
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,967
I think he wanted to give it to you.

606
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,604
He was afraid someone was coming
after him while he was at the hospital.

607
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,689
That's why they put up security cameras.

608
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,526
That day, he locked himself up
in the bathroom for hours.

609
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,654
He cried saying
he would die if he came out.

610
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,698
Then his attorney came.

611
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,869
Is that Park Jae-sang?

612
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,378
As soon as Park Jae-sang arrived,
he started to behave.

613
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,631
He even went to sleep.

614
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,679
He pretended to be asleep.

615
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:42,971
He suddenly got up,

616
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,183
went into the bathroom with a syringe,
and didn't come out.

617
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:50,312
Thirty minutes later,
a nurse found him dead

618
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,314
with a narcotic analgesic in his arm.

619
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,318
That's scary.

620
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,990
It's obviously a suicide, no doubt.

621
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,410
But Mr. Kim watched this
over and over again

622
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,662
as if he could prove
that it was murder by doing so.

623
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,958
I wonder what he saw in this footage.

624
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,169
Hold on.

625
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,880
What is that? In front of the mirror.

626
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,510
-The syringe?
-No, in his other hand.

627
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,892
He's smelling something.

628
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,771
Did something get on his hand?

629
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,481
No, there's something in his hand.

630
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,401
Something small and blue.

631
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,945
Off to the academy?

632
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,413
Get some snacks.

633
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,040
For your friends too.

634
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,463
-In-joo.
-Yes?

635
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,717
I'm going to study abroad in Boston.

636
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,305
-What?
-I'm leaving on the 24th of next month.

637
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:51,808
What did you say?

638
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,686
Next month?

639
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes.

640
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,315
Hey.

641
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,692
Try making a little more sense.

642
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,653
What are you talking about?

643
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,950
Hyo-rin is going to
Boston Arts High School next semester.

644
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,161
Her mom was supposed to go with her,

645
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,080
but she can't because of the election.

646
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:18,460
The problem is
Hyo-rin can't sleep or eat alone.

647
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,338
-That's why I'm going with her.
-Why would you?

648
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,298
Are you her maid?

649
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,218
Tell them you're not going.

650
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,887
I'll be the one
sending you to study abroad.

651
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,347
How?

652
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,516
By doing back-breaking work?

653
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,434
Through another crazy marriage?

654
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,144
How would that make me feel?

655
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,021
Whether I break my back or get married,

656
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,356
I'll take care of it!

657
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,320
Nothing in this world is free.

658
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,823
If you owe someone
beyond what you can pay off,

659
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,867
God knows what
you'll have to give in return later.

660
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,161
I'd much rather live as a maid
in Hyo-rin's house

661
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,498
than live like you two in this house.

662
00:47:58,959 --> 00:47:59,960
What?

663
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,425
I made up my mind when Mom took off
with my field trip money.

664
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,510
That I'll do anything

665
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,554
to get out of here.

666
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,768
Nothing in this world is free, In-joo.

667
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:20,772
If you break your back to send me abroad,
how am I supposed to pay you back?

668
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,358
You'd already be crippled by then.

669
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,327
Mom already submitted her consent
to the school.

670
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,204
After all, you're not my mom.

671
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,825
Did you really make this?

672
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,578
No way. It's so good.

673
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,415
Let me tag along next time, In-kyung.

674
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,210
Where?

675
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,878
If Mr. Kim's death was a murder

676
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,964
and the bank president's death is fishy,
this is too dangerous.

677
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,968
Take me with you next time you go out
to cover the story. I'll drive.

678
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,514
I'm a reporter.
It's my job to cover these stories.

679
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,849
I've seen the scene of the accident.

680
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,186
Now that I've seen it,
I can't send you out there alone.

681
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,271
Aren't you busy?

682
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,692
Did you study hard abroad
just to become my driver?

683
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:47,776
Get a job.

684
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,695
Your grandpa is worried about you.

685
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:52,698
He's very ill.

686
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,158
That's why I want to be with him

687
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,035
so I can make good food for him

688
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,162
and so that we can nag each other.

689
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,377
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

690
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,505
When he passes away,

691
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:11,800
I'll be all alone.

692
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,720
That's why I can't leave you in danger.

693
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,653
What is this?

694
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,156
What a peculiar-looking flower.

695
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,285
I found it at the scene
of Mr. Kim's accident.

696
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,162
I think it's a very rare orchid.

697
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,959
It looked like it was dying,
so I decided to dry it.

698
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:49,504
Hold on.

699
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,630
Hold still.

700
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,433
It's a flower.

701
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,478
He's smelling a flower.

702
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,773
They look similar.

703
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,734
It's small and blue.

704
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,071
Could it be the same orchid?

705
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,636
You must be awfully worried

706
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,348
to send your only child
to the States alone.

707
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,603
I adore my baby sister, In-hye, too.

708
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,398
In-kyung and I grew up poor
and had to walk on eggshells.

709
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,777
But I didn't want In-hye
to go through that.

710
00:51:55,904 --> 00:52:02,077
In-hye is the most mature
and confident 18-year-old I've ever seen.

711
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,664
I heard that you paid for
her studies abroad.

712
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,472
For her to be confident in any situation,
she should pay for things herself.

713
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,437
May I ask your name?

714
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,649
It's Oh In-joo.

715
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,192
I like you, Ms. Oh.

716
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,736
I liked you from the first time we met.

717
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:41,366
I think it's because I could feel
how much you care about your sister.

718
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,202
But you know what?

719
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,538
You're mistaken about something.

720
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,541
I didn't pay for her studies.

721
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,711
My husband runs a scholarship foundation.

722
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,923
It helps talented
yet financially disadvantaged children.

723
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,676
Children like In-hye.

724
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:04,264
In-hye won a scholarship
through its official screening process.

725
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,688
Have you seen In-hye's paintings?

726
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,484
This is the portfolio she sent to Boston.

727
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,288
Her paintings are brilliant for sure,

728
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,540
but how do they make you feel?

729
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,918
They're dark.

730
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,629
They make you want to cry.

731
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,091
She's almost at her breaking point.

732
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,930
I once asked her,

733
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,182
"In-hye."

734
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,726
"What troubles you so much?"

735
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,401
Why are you lying there alone
in the dark forest?

736
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,573
That's not me.

737
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,453
It's my sister.

738
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,122
My dying sister.

739
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,340
After talking to you today,

740
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:24,719
I finally understand the reason why
In-hye paints her sister that way.

741
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,057
It must have been hard to prepare
this much money so quickly.

742
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,728
Do you always go to
such lengths for In-hye?

743
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:37,816
A child is the mirror image
of their family.

744
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,609
In In-hye's eyes,

745
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,196
I can see the reflection
of her struggling sister.

746
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,244
Was In-hye sick last year?

747
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,831
She suddenly collapsed
and was hospitalized.

748
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,710
They said it was
because her muscles tensed up,

749
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,586
but she couldn't get a diagnosis.

750
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,717
She said it was tough for her back then.

751
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,846
Because she became
a burden to her sisters.

752
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,473
Don't try too hard.

753
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,893
You're a young woman
with your whole life ahead of you.

754
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,271
You're not In-hye's mom.

755
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:33,872
Ms. Go.

756
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:39,711
You told me In-hye skipped the field trip
because her family couldn't afford it.

757
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:45,091
But her sister just showed up
in extremely expensive shoes

758
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,719
and offered me 70 million won
in cash for her tuition.

759
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,889
I'm curious where her sister

760
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,391
managed to find all that money.

761
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,078
It's bound to show up.

762
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,040
I think it's an epiphytic orchid
that absorbs

763
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,625
water and nutrients from the air.

764
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,835
But I can't find the exact species.

765
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,215
Breathe in.

766
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:27,634
Breathe out.

767
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,815
Sink down deeper.

768
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,976
Mommy! The baby isn't breathing!

769
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,160
One step deeper.

770
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,840
Deep down, you'll find yourself.

771
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,843
Find your hidden self.

772
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,638
What's wrong with the baby, Mommy?

773
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,104
Is the baby dead?

774
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:06,816
I found it.

775
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:17,285
"Epipogium aphyllum, an orchid that
resembles blue smoke hanging in the air,

776
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,329
is also known as the Ghost of Vietnam."

777
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,666
"After being brought into the US
by soldiers during the Vietnam War,

778
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,921
it is reported to have failed to breed,
leaving only a handful of offspring…"

779
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,781
-I can do it.
-It's fine.

780
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,783
Can you close the trunk?

781
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,539
-I said I'll carry it.
-It's fine.

782
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:16,928
What?

783
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,151
What's this?

784
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,445
Your dead colleague.

785
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,324
Does this money
have anything to do with her?

786
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,619
Yes.

787
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,789
I can't allow this.

788
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,541
This is stealing.

789
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,546
What is stealing?

790
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,675
Is taking dirty money
that belongs to no one

791
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:39,385
stealing as well?

792
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,762
Isn't that obvious?

793
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:42,221
She killed herself.

794
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,931
You could end up dead.

795
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,518
When we were little,

796
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,356
when Dad's print shop went under,

797
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,316
we packed up in the middle of the night

798
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,986
and ran away from our apartment, remember?

799
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,573
How we drove to a polytunnel
in a truck together?

800
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,618
We had a younger sibling back then.

801
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,870
You mean In-hye?

802
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,873
No, not In-hye.

803
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,626
It was a girl, two or three years old.

804
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,169
What?

805
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:16,589
She had been in and out
of consciousness for days.

806
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,634
Then she suddenly didn't wake up.

807
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,096
The doctor said it was too late.

808
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,514
Because we didn't have money…

809
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,350
Because we were on the run,

810
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,436
she died without receiving any treatment.

811
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,148
I don't know any of this.

812
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,695
I don't remember anything.

813
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,156
You were six and I was eight.

814
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,243
After she died,

815
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,123
Mom lost her mind
and Dad started drinking.

816
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,251
You were sent to Great-Aunt's.

817
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,546
I stayed with Mom and Dad
because of school.

818
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,468
And we never talked about it.

819
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,644
This is what was carved
into my heart back then.

820
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:17,358
"You die if you don't have money."

821
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,570
I hoped that Dad

822
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:25,032
would bring some money home
even if he had to steal

823
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,161
so that we could eat, live,

824
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,414
and survive.

825
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,877
People die when they're poor.

826
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,468
I don't remember.

827
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:45,553
I…

828
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:48,723
don't remember anything.

829
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:51,642
If we had had this money,

830
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:54,145
I wouldn't have married that con artist.

831
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:56,147
You would have studied what you wanted to.

832
01:02:56,647 --> 01:03:00,902
In-hye would have become
a talented, cheerful high schooler.

833
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,445
And that little girl

834
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,739
would still be alive.

835
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,576
I wonder what her name was.

836
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,541
I don't mind being poor.

837
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,503
It's how I've always been.

838
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,425
But I don't want to become a thief
because I'm poor.

839
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,510
That would mean…

840
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:28,221
that I lost.

841
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,265
When I was with our great-aunt…

842
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,311
When I was the only poor kid in my class,

843
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,271
I was treated as a thief many times

844
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,273
even though I never stole anything.

845
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,737
I'd rather die than become a thief.

846
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,659
If you intend to take this money,

847
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,994
I'll turn you in.

848
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,374
Go ahead.

849
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,920
I'll spend this money and go to prison.

850
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,380
In-joo.

851
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:05,383
In-hye knows about our dead sister.

852
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:10,096
It happened before she was even born,
so I wonder how.

853
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:12,640
I thought…

854
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,935
you might have told her.

855
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,636
Goodbye, ma'am.

856
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:58,436
There were some things
I couldn't understand.

857
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,022
Why do I drink?

858
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:07,028
Why did Dad look so sad when he drank?

859
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:11,616
Why did I always choke up
when reporting certain stories?

860
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:18,372
Just why was In-hye so dear to me?

861
01:05:25,963 --> 01:05:27,715
Thank you. Goodbye.

862
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,401
The story that I searched
the whole world for was…

863
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,866
the story of my poor family.

864
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,340
It's egg liqueur. It's my favorite.

865
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:13,094
I asked for it
so I can hear you out patiently,

866
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,512
so relax and tell me.

867
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,724
I have

868
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,644
two billion won in cash.

869
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:26,524
The money isn't illegal
but it isn't so legal either.

870
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,944
Just know that I didn't harm anyone
in the process of acquiring it.

871
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,324
I want to buy an apartment in Seoul.

872
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,828
With three bedrooms
for each of us sisters.

873
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,081
About 25 to 30 pyeong.

874
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,753
I'm sure you understand

875
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,548
that you can't buy an apartment
just because you have cash.

876
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,593
I need to talk to my legal team,
so it'll take a while.

877
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,220
It might not work out.

878
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,263
No.

879
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,099
You have to make it work.

880
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,517
As soon as you can.

881
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,687
Is there a reason why
I have to do this for you?

882
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,025
Your guilt.

883
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,486
You'll feel less guilty.

884
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:15,948
You refused to lend any money to my dad

885
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,659
when his print shop went under
during the Asian Financial Crisis.

886
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,954
I don't feel guilty over such things.

887
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,082
I never invest in businesses
that are bound to fail.

888
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,419
That's why I didn't give you
a cash gift for your wedding.

889
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,051
When my family lived in a polytunnel
after Dad's business failed,

890
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,635
the baby…

891
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,890
You came to the hospital
when the baby died.

892
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,394
You cried and said
we should've told you about the baby.

893
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,563
You've always hated kids.

894
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:50,649
When I visited you,
you gave me money to play outside.

895
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,903
You said you couldn't stand
the sound of children whining.

896
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:59,450
But you took in In-kyung soon after.

897
01:07:59,533 --> 01:08:01,368
"Doesn't In-kyung's voice bother her?"

898
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,412
That's what crossed my mind then,

899
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,539
but now I understand.

900
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,669
You couldn't have done that
if you hadn't felt guilty.

901
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,381
As you near the end of your life,
a sense of guilt must be creeping in.

902
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,259
That's why you called In-kyung here.

903
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,595
You were trying to lessen the guilt
by giving her money.

904
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:22,014
But you know what?

905
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:26,310
If you help me buy an apartment,
everything will be solved.

906
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,271
The three of us will live
in that apartment.

907
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,442
We'll live carefree lives
as if we had always lived there.

908
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:39,573
I think you're right.

909
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,953
Maybe that will cure
my persistent insomnia.

910
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,539
But just so you know,

911
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:50,960
I didn't hate all children.
It was you I hated.

912
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,547
Why?

913
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,216
As a kid, you smiled a lot.

914
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,344
You smiled at everyone
you made eye contact with.

915
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:01,929
I hated that.

916
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:05,182
When you're young and adorable,
people smile back at you.

917
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,435
But once you grow up,
the world slaps you in the face in return.

918
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:14,191
But I can see that you've learned
that much over the years.

919
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:20,948
I've been through a lot.

920
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,706
I'll look into the apartment tomorrow.

921
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:32,501
Leave your ID, seal, and seal certificate

922
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,587
with my legal team when you have time.

923
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,464
They'll try to figure something out.

924
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,050
Thank you.

925
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,929
You'll be able to sleep well now.

926
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,639
Your digestion will improve too.

927
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,698
Ariadne.

928
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:57,021
The General got them
on his business trip to the UK.

929
01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:00,190
The doll house was for Hyo-rin's mom,

930
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,901
and the tin soldiers
were for Hyo-rin's uncle.

931
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,114
Hyo-rin's uncle, Won Sang-woo,
wouldn't let me play with the soldiers

932
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,158
except when he was bored.

933
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,161
Twelve soldiers make up the platoon.

934
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:13,746
One day, one of the soldiers,

935
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,497
perhaps a sergeant, went missing,

936
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,833
and he turned the house upside down.

937
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,378
And he couldn't find it?

938
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:25,841
Because I threw it away.

939
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,431
Are you two childhood friends?

940
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:39,229
Sang-woo was the General's son,
and I was his driver's son.

941
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,192
Back then,
everything in this house looked amazing.

942
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,444
The soap that smelled funny,

943
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:49,448
the hand towels, the fruit forks,
and even the nail clippers…

944
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,037
I would shove them in my pocket
and throw them away on my way home.

945
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,539
Why did you do that?

946
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,460
I was upset
that I didn't belong in this house.

947
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,754
I wanted to live here.

948
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,842
Now you do.

949
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:16,558
On his next business trip,
the General bought me the same soldiers.

950
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,478
He knew all along that I was the thief.

951
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:23,023
I stopped stealing.
Instead, I tried to show him…

952
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,860
what I was good at

953
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,904
and how loyal I was.

954
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:32,199
To prove that I fit in with his family
better than Sang-woo.

955
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:38,414
Why did you tell Hyo-rin
to submit your painting as hers?

956
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:42,000
It was painted by Hyo-rin.

957
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,087
I was Hyo-rin when I was painting it.

958
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,674
With her typical expression on my face,

959
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,218
I used her favorite colors

960
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:53,846
and textures.

961
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,807
That painting is perfect.

962
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,190
The General knew that I was special.

963
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:10,112
That's why he passed down this house
to me instead of Sang-woo.

964
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:13,574
I had to make huge sacrifices,

965
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,578
but I overcame them all.

966
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:21,832
Do you…

967
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,168
want that doll?

968
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:34,720
Yes.

969
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:36,680
Then…

970
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,099
can you do it too?

971
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,649
Can you betray someone

972
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,319
who loves you the most in the world?

973
01:15:49,336 --> 01:15:50,504
I have some ledgers.

974
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:53,382
I'll use that to get
the most money out of it.

975
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:56,176
You can decide by tomorrow morning, right?

976
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,512
The war isn't over.

977
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,556
Someone from rock bottom…

978
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,307
Doesn't it look like a face?

979
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,934
Is that why it's called the ghost orchid?

980
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:05,894
From now on, this is your orchid.

981
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,688
I know you.

982
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,190
Your name is Park Jae-sang, isn't it?

983
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:13,610
Now I'm curious about
how far you would go for money.

984
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,988
If you don't have the money,
you need to grin and bear it.

985
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:17,573
I'm always prepared to do so.

986
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,491
Ms. Oh is important to us.

987
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,244
One wrong move and something might happen
to that 70 billion won.

988
01:16:22,327 --> 01:16:23,745
Be my assistant.

989
01:16:24,621 --> 01:16:26,623
I want you to work for me, Ms. Oh.

990
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:34,131
