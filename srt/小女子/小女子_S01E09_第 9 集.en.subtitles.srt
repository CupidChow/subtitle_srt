1
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,431
I want to see…

2
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,142
my 70 billion won

3
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,437
before I go.

4
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,981
Right.

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,152
You had a tough time bringing it here.

6
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,321
Of course, you can see it one last time.

7
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,021
I…

8
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,732
love it when you make that face.

9
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,737
You're like a little child

10
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,698
who lost her toy.

11
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,664
I was having so much fun
until just a moment ago.

12
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,877
Did you think I'd be that stupid?

13
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,296
Did you seriously think that I'd believe

14
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,632
Hwa-young was alive?

15
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,634
Yes.

16
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,026
To think that you could
do something with that thing…

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,862
You really must be stupid.

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,034
No matter what you do,
this story will end with your death.

19
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,245
If I die,

20
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,957
how are you going to find
the 70 billion won?

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,626
That chump change
doesn't mean anything to me.

22
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,469
Do you think this is about money?

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,805
I'm an artist.

24
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,641
I'll just imagine that I filmed
a 70-billion-won blockbuster.

25
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,329
Did you do it?

26
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,790
Well…

27
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,835
I got bored while waiting.

28
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,213
Don't you know that you could get fined
just for littering in Singapore?

29
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,136
Whatever.

30
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,241
Are you here for the money?

31
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,201
Too bad. It's not here.

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,787
I have a good idea.

33
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,715
You two fought over the money.

34
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,969
Then she ended up shooting you

35
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,263
and jumped to her death.

36
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,140
It's a nice ending, wouldn't you say?

37
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:32,146
You saved me the trouble
of searching for our dirty rat.

38
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,776
I'm not here for the money.

39
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,699
Honey, stop.

40
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,492
What the hell?

41
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,703
Your phone was off.

42
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,997
So I'm only here to pass you this call.

43
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,499
Why do you keep butting in?

44
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,834
You're so annoying!

45
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,336
You promised not to cause a fuss
until the election was over.

46
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,713
This won't cause a fuss.

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,215
My preparations were thorough.

48
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,342
Everything will wrap up nicely.

49
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,969
I can't give up on this one!

50
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,220
You can,

51
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,764
since your entire fortune is on the line.

52
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,725
What fortune?

53
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,270
Hello.

54
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,688
This is reporter Oh In-kyung.

55
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,819
I've secured the ledgers
of the slush funds managed by your family.

56
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,572
I stayed up all night going through them.

57
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,283
I knew it'd be a lot,

58
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,785
but I didn't expect to see
numbers in the trillions.

59
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,996
Who do you think you are?

60
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,998
How dare you do this to me?

61
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,668
Honey, can't you just kill her?

62
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,714
I've made sure that the ledgers
will be revealed if I die.

63
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,885
This is an exclusive that could turn
the entire country upside down,

64
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
so it wasn't easy for me either

65
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,307
since I had to choose between this
and my sister's life.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,518
I'm getting the shorter end of the stick,
but let's make a deal.

67
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,896
The ledgers for my sister.

68
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,274
No. Don't do it, In-kyung.

69
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,818
Be quiet before I change my mind, In-joo.

70
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,241
I absolutely hate them!

71
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,711
CHOI DO-IL

72
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,511
Director Shin Hyeon-min,
who wrote these ledgers,

73
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,722
was the first among us to fall from grace.

74
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,810
More than 3 trillion won
was embezzled over 25 years.

75
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,187
You're talking as if he did this alone.

76
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,357
This proves that you were all in on it.

77
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,945
We don't call those
who save money for our organization

78
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,404
as having "fallen from grace."

79
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,406
People who "fall from grace" are those

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,700
who fail to give up their lives
when the need arises.

81
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,580
Director Shin's fear of death
got him into gambling.

82
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,461
His father was a strong soldier
who saved a general's life in the war.

83
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,549
But his son was a weak man
for some reason.

84
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,676
By "organization,"

85
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,636
do you mean Jeongran Society?

86
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:13,349
Are members of Jeongran Society
who receive the orchid forced to die

87
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,934
if they do not voluntarily choose death?

88
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,187
Do you know

89
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,398
that I deeply respect you, Ms. Oh?

90
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,359
I've met countless reporters
throughout my political career,

91
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,321
but none of them
have made me nervous like you do.

92
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,159
I'll take that as a yes.

93
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:36,164
Have you ever wondered

94
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,665
why you're still alive?

95
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,212
Are you asking me if I know why
you people haven't killed me yet?

96
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,883
You can never harm me.

97
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,511
The savings bank case ended
with you being fired,

98
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,973
and your question about my real estate
only made me more popular.

99
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,725
One might even think

100
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,810
that you're working for me.

101
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,022
Wait and see.

102
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,774
The day will come when I'll be reporting

103
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,402
about Jeongran Society
on the nine o'clock news.

104
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,072
When you were a trainee,

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,701
you were famous among the victims
in the savings bank case.

106
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,786
For doing such an earnest job

107
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,539
when you knew
the story wouldn't make the news.

108
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,836
That's why you got so many tip-offs.

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,509
So I asked the desk

110
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,094
if it was okay to leave you be.

111
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,888
Here's what they said.

112
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,392
"It's better to keep her here
for us to see how far she gets."

113
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,481
You're not talking about

114
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,400
Department Head Jo Wan-gyu, are you?

115
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:53,533
Typhoons, fires, family suicides…

116
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,536
Have you ever wondered
why they made you report

117
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,413
only those kinds of stories?

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,042
What Mr. Jo said was interesting.

119
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:06,295
"She should have given up by now,

120
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,257
but she's so tenacious
because she grew up poor."

121
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,896
I don't need the broadcasting station.

122
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,941
There are other ways.

123
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,068
That's right.

124
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,699
But…

125
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,410
without these ledgers,

126
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,998
who would believe your story?

127
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,960
No one has believed you so far…

128
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,257
and no one ever will.

129
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,201
Mr. Choi.

130
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,206
Hwa-young…

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,959
is dead.

132
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,839
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,594
You must have been startled

134
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,262
after I ran away with the money.

135
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,641
It's my fault.

136
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,185
I should have considered
all the possibilities.

137
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,854
I never expected you to betray me.

138
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,440
I thought you trusted me.

139
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,361
It's not that I didn't trust you.

140
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,698
It's just that…

141
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,202
I wanted to see Hwa-young so badly.

142
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,256
I was going to split the money later.

143
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,263
But where's the money?

144
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,724
And what are those bricks?

145
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,480
The 70 billion won…

146
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,584
is at MacPherson Station,

147
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,962
in locker number six.

148
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:10,229
Mrs. Foster brought me those bricks.

149
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,902
This is the key to the locker.

150
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,656
I'm giving you this
because I completely trust you.

151
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,659
I think

152
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,662
I might pass out soon.

153
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,748
If I die like this…

154
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,459
You won't.

155
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,377
But still…

156
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,047
If I never wake up,

157
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,550
please make sure

158
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,386
my sisters receive their share.

159
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,891
I beg of you.

160
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,748
Park Jae-sang told me something about you,

161
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,875
but I don't believe him.
It has to be a lie.

162
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,467
By any chance,
do you know about Jeongran Society?

163
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,227
You're the one who taught me
what it meant to be a reporter.

164
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,271
You taught me how to gather information
and how to write articles.

165
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,232
You told me not to give in to anyone

166
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,067
since we pursue the truth.

167
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,111
You said we had nothing to fear
except for history and the public.

168
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,822
After I got fired from HTN,

169
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,741
I managed to get by for three years.

170
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,119
But I came to a dead end
when my wife got sick.

171
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,413
A cousin of mine drove a tow truck.

172
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,749
I followed him around for months to learn.

173
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,543
Guess how that turned out.

174
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,713
There were many days
when I couldn't get any work.

175
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,423
That's when

176
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,301
our CEO came to me asking,

177
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,430
"Shouldn't you keep working
as a reporter?"

178
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,685
That's when I received an orchid

179
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,604
and met General Won Gi-seon.

180
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,609
The pledge was simple.

181
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,865
"I entrust my life and death
to Jeongran Society."

182
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,702
"It shall remain confidential
unless otherwise authorized."

183
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,081
As long as I stayed loyal
to Jeongran Society,

184
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,792
I was able to enjoy
full freedom as a reporter.

185
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,169
I was given the discretion to report

186
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,046
according to my conscience.

187
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,841
"Conscience"?

188
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,803
You rejected all my stories
about the savings bank victims repeatedly

189
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,431
saying it wasn't newsworthy.

190
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,933
When I was known as a troublemaker,

191
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,310
you tried to make me give up

192
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,896
by making me cover typhoons,
fires, and family suicides,

193
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,398
knowing that they were my weaknesses.

194
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,858
You're right.

195
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,235
I tried to make you give up.

196
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:07,948
So that you'd understand
that there are other paths in this world.

197
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,661
Did you do that to get me to join

198
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,080
Jeongran Society?

199
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,765
When I hung my orchid on the Father Tree,

200
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,936
I felt free for the first time.

201
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
Those from poor families will understand

202
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,443
that only children with wealthy parents
can play around freely.

203
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,406
How would things have been
if you had a father who could support you?

204
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,160
You would've made your name
as a brilliant young reporter.

205
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,244
I wanted

206
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,747
to give you a father like that.

207
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,332
Someone who could raise you--

208
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,042
I don't need a father like that!

209
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,545
In fact, I don't need a father at all.

210
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,507
Being a reporter is nothing.

211
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,343
Who says I'd go that far
to become a reporter?

212
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,261
If I were you,

213
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,973
I would have done anything
to become a tow truck driver.

214
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,643
If I couldn't,
I could have driven something else.

215
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,146
Everyone needs a father like that.

216
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,484
A world where you can go
from the lowest to the highest place

217
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,070
regardless of who your parents are.

218
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,824
That's a world
that is truly equal and just.

219
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,081
If Park Jae-sang becomes
the mayor of Seoul and then the president,

220
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,460
everyone can be
a part of Jeongran Society.

221
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,177
You must have lost your mind.

222
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,057
I had no idea this was who you were.

223
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,895
I was even ready to go
to the depths of hell if you told me to.

224
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,314
You'll find out soon

225
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,526
how big

226
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,446
and how powerful we are.

227
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,615
Ma-ri will become the mayor's spokesperson

228
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,659
and someone will have to
fill her position.

229
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,994
Think about it.

230
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,207
Don't you want to be able to cover
all the stories you want as a reporter?

231
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:27,046
Or you can keep your head down
and live a quiet life.

232
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,424
If you don't, you'll die.

233
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,926
And your death is going to be meaningless.

234
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:42,728
How…

235
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,273
am I supposed to go on

236
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,318
now that I know
what kind of person my mom is?

237
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,248
There's something I promised myself…

238
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,126
when my mom

239
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,296
took off with the money for my field trip.

240
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,634
"I'm going to live without my mom."

241
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,638
Let's run away, In-hye.

242
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,391
Let's go far away and never come back.

243
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,354
Then let's leave right away
before anyone finds out.

244
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,189
Right now?

245
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,276
Tomorrow after school.

246
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,445
We'll come up with a plan until then.

247
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,161
We'll tell the academy
that we're practicing for our play.

248
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,373
Then no one will notice
that we're gone until 11 p.m.

249
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,625
And we'll have to land
in another country before then.

250
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,339
How about we go to Japan

251
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,383
and hide near a hot spring
in the countryside?

252
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,888
We'll go to Tokyo
and take a train to Hokkaido.

253
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,682
From there, we'll enter Russia.

254
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,476
The Rubens Room at the Hermitage Museum…

255
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,853
While we sit there,

256
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,397
we'll be able to forget
that we have no moms.

257
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,985
After that, let's take a ferry to Finland.

258
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,572
We'll spend the summer
in a small cabin in the woods

259
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,781
like the Moomins.

260
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,659
We'll pick raspberries and blueberries

261
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,703
and sell our paintings at the market.

262
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,998
Can we really do that?

263
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,916
It sounds like a dream.

264
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,060
He turned out to be such a scary person.

265
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,399
It was my lifelong wish
to have him compliment me just once.

266
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,909
What was I doing all this time?

267
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,661
And for whom?

268
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,081
What kind of news did I want to report?

269
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,250
In-kyung.

270
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,587
Do you want to go to the States with me?

271
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,504
What?

272
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,882
My grandpa's test results came out
and he's fine.

273
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,426
And he's nagging me to go get my degree.

274
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,678
You wanted to study too, right?

275
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,559
What is that supposed to mean?

276
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,394
Is this

277
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,481
something similar to what you said before?

278
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,776
I want you to put
Jeongran Society behind you.

279
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,819
You've done enough

280
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,863
and it's too dangerous.

281
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,990
I want you to move on with your life.

282
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,120
It seems

283
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,915
that everything is so easy for you.

284
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,377
When there's trouble,
you can always go to the States.

285
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,340
But this seems to be
the only place I can live in.

286
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,842
So I'm going to stay here until the end
and solve all my problems.

287
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,603
Back then,

288
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,981
when we were 24,

289
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,734
I really wanted to study abroad.

290
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,860
It was my dream.

291
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,447
But you said you were going abroad
not because you wanted to study,

292
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,617
but because you had nothing better to do.

293
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,288
You also said that if I married you,
I could come with you.

294
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,582
And that we should study together
with your father's money.

295
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,963
Do you know how much
I hated you for saying that?

296
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,965
I stopped talking to you for years

297
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:43,218
because I couldn't tell you
how miserable that made me feel.

298
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,347
"Everything comes easily
when you have money."

299
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,974
"Life must be like a game to him."

300
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,064
Back then, I was young
and made it sound like a joke.

301
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,734
But I should have been more clear

302
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,029
and said that I really liked you.

303
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,283
And that I wanted to marry you
because I couldn't see myself

304
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,953
in love with anyone else.

305
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,545
You must have been mistaken.

306
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:22,090
We went through a lot together
at an early age.

307
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,552
Like your mother passing away
and your father getting remarried.

308
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,181
The way you felt about me
was what psychologists call "attachment."

309
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,768
And biologists call it "imprinting."

310
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,104
But that's different from romance.

311
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,190
It's much closer to kinship.

312
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,445
What is romance anyway?

313
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,990
Doesn't marriage make two people a family?

314
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:51,620
For me…

315
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,872
When I'm with you,

316
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,500
my brain produces alpha waves.

317
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,420
The peaceful waves you get
when you're meditating or resting.

318
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,256
Romance is meant to be
exciting and thrilling.

319
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,258
It increases your heart rate.

320
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,453
In-joo was right.

321
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,957
I should have been the one
to draw the line.

322
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,755
Let's call it a day.

323
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,924
Do you think you couldn't go abroad then
because of money?

324
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,636
It was because of your family.

325
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,014
I wanted to take you someplace far away.

326
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,184
I wanted to see
who you'd become in a different world.

327
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,979
You can do that now.

328
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:02,065
You can let go of your guilt now.

329
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,118
That's what I wanted to tell you today.

330
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,670
You were right, sir.

331
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,381
I can't do this

332
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,092
through the news.

333
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,553
What happened?

334
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,723
I handed over the ledgers
to Park Jae-sang.

335
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,183
And now,

336
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,352
I have nothing.

337
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,314
That's good.

338
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,483
Once I kill Park Jae-sang,

339
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,487
you can tell the world my story.

340
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,493
Let me join you

341
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,620
in killing Park Jae-sang.

342
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,272
YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK
BUT YOU'RE ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS…

343
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,050
Oh, my gosh!

344
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,385
What are you doing?

345
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,970
Why were you watching me sleep?

346
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,430
In case you might die.

347
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,106
I slept so well.

348
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,379
I put the money in a paper company
under your name.

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,590
You're the CEO and I'm the director.

350
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,260
We'll fly over to Greece today
and split the money sixty-forty there.

351
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,389
A broker found a place
where you can stay temporarily.

352
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,725
It's a consulting company that I trust.

353
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,811
They'll help you settle
when your sisters arrive.

354
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,358
This accountant will get in touch
with you about your assets.

355
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,318
I've made a plan for you

356
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,820
so you can live off your assets
without losing a cent.

357
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,412
Are you going somewhere, Mr. Choi?

358
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,000
You're talking as if
we'll never meet again.

359
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,545
Director Won Sang-a gets bored easily.

360
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,882
Once she gets back to Korea
and finds a new goal,

361
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,009
she'll forget all about you.

362
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,553
But she'll never forget about me.

363
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,641
Things are much more complicated
between me and those people.

364
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,143
After the transaction has been finalized,

365
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,937
it's best if we never meet again.

366
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
It's for your own safety.

367
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
Well…

368
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,579
I thought we could stay in touch
through social media.

369
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,385
Mom!

370
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,391
Where have you been?

371
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,519
Dad scolded me
when he found out you were gone.

372
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,397
I'm sorry, Hyo-rin.

373
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,024
Did I put you through too much trouble?

374
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,279
Have you been well, In-hye?

375
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,489
Yes.

376
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,117
To make it up to you,
I brought a ton of gifts.

377
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,326
Gifts?

378
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,798
You know I attend
the Orchid Festival every year.

379
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,177
I was going to skip it this year
because of the election,

380
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,596
but then I realized

381
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,557
that I didn't want to
give up living my life

382
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,934
just because your dad became a politician.

383
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,437
What did you do there?

384
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,190
I had my eyes on this particular orchid,

385
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,776
but I failed to get it in the end.

386
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,570
I don't regret it though.

387
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,990
I've been forcing a smile
in front of cameras every day.

388
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,575
But while I was there,

389
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,161
I felt alive.

390
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,459
I get what you mean.
I'm practicing for a play these days,

391
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,419
and I feel something like that.

392
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,462
Really?

393
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,298
What role do you play?

394
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,051
A serial killer.

395
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,719
What?

396
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,018
I wouldn't call Macbeth a serial killer.

397
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,355
I mean, a few people can be killed
for one to become king.

398
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,565
Is that so?

399
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,279
Honey.

400
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,490
You must be tired from the flight.

401
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,868
I got some sleep.

402
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,537
Have you been outside?

403
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,831
I came home from Garak Market to see you.

404
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,334
I heard you were joining my visit
to the children's hospital.

405
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,752
You can rest if you're tired.

406
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,879
Why would I be tired?

407
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,130
I can make it.

408
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,025
She brought gifts?

409
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,194
That makes me sick.

410
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,281
I've always wondered

411
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,992
why everything felt so fake at home.

412
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,994
But it turns out
everything really is fake.

413
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,120
All of it.

414
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,874
That was some stellar acting back there.

415
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,794
I pushed myself
because I didn't want to lose.

416
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,424
Do you have all the cash,
bankbooks, and bonds with you?

417
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,341
Yes.

418
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,012
Can you keep them for me?

419
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,347
You know how forgetful I can be.

420
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,686
You have to leave in seven minutes, sir.

421
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,980
You're leaving already?

422
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,734
-Come with me for a second.
-Why?

423
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,152
I have something to show you.

424
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
What is it?

425
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,292
Five minutes, sir!

426
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,586
Five minutes is enough, right?

427
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,525
I've been thinking about you
the entire time.

428
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,029
You promised to protect me no matter what.

429
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,781
How far

430
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,824
can you go for me?

431
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,576
I can do anything for you.

432
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,161
I'll prove it to you.

433
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,245
You know that, right?

434
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,747
That reporter.

435
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,791
Kill her.

436
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm going to.

437
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,377
I have a plan.

438
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,045
Just kill her now.

439
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,547
Don't hesitate.

440
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,967
I was humiliated.

441
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:54,097
Are you okay with your wife
living in humiliation?

442
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,432
Can't you do that much for me?

443
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,644
I can. I will.

444
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,947
Get rid of Reporter Oh In-kyung today.

445
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,948
Today?

446
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,994
I thought you wanted to wait
until the election was over.

447
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,037
I want it done before I get off work.

448
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,498
Yes, sir.

449
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,173
Jong-ho, what is it?

450
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,841
In-kyung is gone.

451
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,217
What do you mean?

452
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,389
I came to her house
because I couldn't contact her.

453
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,099
The house was a complete mess.

454
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,018
There are footprints everywhere,

455
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,020
and the parrot…

456
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,277
Did you call the police?

457
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,906
They said she's not been gone for long,
so I can't report her missing.

458
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,241
But they said the fire station
can track her phone

459
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,368
if a family member requested it in person.

460
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,870
When can you come?

461
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:44,373
Even if I leave right away,
it'll take at least seven hours.

462
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,502
Could you visit
the emergency centers around Seoul

463
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,047
and see if In-kyung is
among the car accident patients?

464
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,800
Also, tell the Han River patrol
what she looks like.

465
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,887
In-joo.

466
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,974
You don't think anything bad
happened to her, do you?

467
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,812
Can you wait for a moment

468
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,605
until I come up with a plan?

469
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,981
No, I can't.

470
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,983
I'm grateful for the offer,

471
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,443
but I'm going back to Korea.

472
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,071
It's my fault if something happens to her.

473
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,073
You're in danger too.

474
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,533
We need a plan before we go.

475
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,120
It's because I can't come with you.

476
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:26,999
Mr. Choi.

477
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,336
What happens to the money if I die?

478
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,590
When the CEO dies,

479
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,593
as the director,
I will be in charge of the money

480
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,345
under commercial law.

481
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,141
Then I will say this before I go,
just in case.

482
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,102
Among all the people I've met in my life,

483
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,437
you've been the kindest to me.

484
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,899
So I'm putting my trust in you.

485
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,067
If something happens,

486
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,736
please make sure
my sisters receive their share.

487
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,821
Okay?

488
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,744
How is't with me,

489
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,913
when every noise appalls me?

490
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,501
What hands are here?
Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.

491
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,549
Will all great Neptune's ocean
wash this blood clean from my hand?

492
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,802
No, this my hand will rather

493
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,888
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,
making the green one red.

494
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,777
No, this my hand will rather

495
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,155
the multitudinous seas incarnadine,
making the green one red.

496
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,283
Lady Macbeth?

497
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,953
In-hye, it's your turn to appear on stage.

498
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,540
Ma'am, I haven't seen In-hye
for a while now.

499
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,043
Where did she go?

500
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,629
Did she go home early today?

501
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,131
Try calling her.

502
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,726
Her phone is off.

503
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,322
What happened?

504
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,531
Hyo-rin, are you okay?

505
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,617
Hyo-rin!

506
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,667
We'll go to Tokyo
and take a train to Hokkaido.

507
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,045
From there, we'll enter Russia.

508
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,840
The Rubens Room at the Hermitage Museum…

509
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,676
While we sit there,

510
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,970
we'll be able to forget
that we have no moms.

511
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,891
Tell me, Hyo-rin.

512
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,101
What happened?

513
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:55,022
The Immigration Office said
that In-hye left for Japan today at 4 p.m.

514
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,399
Did you know about this?

515
00:37:57,149 --> 00:38:00,820
Your bankbooks, bonds,
and cash are gone from your safe.

516
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,698
In-hye took them, didn't she?

517
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,746
If you don't tell me,

518
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,373
I'll have to call the police.

519
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,294
Is that okay?

520
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,173
I gave them to her.

521
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,509
What?

522
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,136
I told her to go far away

523
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,596
and see all the paintings
that she wanted to see.

524
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,600
But you two were planning
to study abroad together.

525
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,520
Why would she leave so far away

526
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,773
alone with all that money?

527
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,816
Well…

528
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,903
I've been to countless galleries
around the world since I was young.

529
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:47,283
But In-hye has never been abroad.

530
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,201
That's why I told her to go.

531
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,246
She'll be back in a few days.

532
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,042
In a few days?

533
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,002
We'll hear from her soon.

534
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,797
So please…

535
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,470
don't call the police.

536
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:42,463
"The room that I locked myself up in
a long time ago."

537
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,423
"I can never…

538
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,218
leave this room."

539
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,649
RUN AWAY

540
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,995
You're up already.

541
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,505
Have this if you get hungry.

542
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,854
What did you tell Hyo-rin?

543
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,697
That you left alone for Japan.

544
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,741
I couldn't tell her

545
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,619
that I kidnapped you from school, could I?

546
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,163
Did she cry?

547
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,712
How long will it take for her to forget?

548
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,716
Why?

549
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,801
Do you think

550
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,595
you won't be able to leave this room?

551
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,100
It was 2,922 days.

552
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,396
How did that person manage

553
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,524
to live that long in a place like this?

554
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,407
How do you know about that?

555
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,216
I saw it in your album.

556
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,719
She was cut out of every picture.

557
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,686
She's your mother, right?

558
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,939
There are so many pictures of her.

559
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,234
She was so close to you.

560
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,992
No one knew

561
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,329
that my mom once lived here.

562
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,625
You'll end up

563
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,461
just like her.

564
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,054
I told you, didn't I?

565
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,181
That I like secrets.

566
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,149
"Closed room."

567
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,325
Will I end up…

568
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,204
hanging myself there?

569
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,419
I'd love to paint that scene.

570
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,438
She couldn't have run away from home.

571
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,482
The security cables happened to be cut off

572
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,275
and the CCTV cameras were turned off.

573
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,530
No ordinary person
would kill a parrot like this.

574
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:02,658
She was definitely kidnapped
by a professional.

575
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,992
Look.

576
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,204
People are not kidnapped that easily.

577
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,583
Does the missing person have a boyfriend?

578
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,001
Well…

579
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,712
I'm not her boyfriend.

580
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,095
-Ms. Oh In-kyung's phone has been tracked.
-Let's see.

581
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,515
Her phone was last used
somewhere in Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do.

582
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,934
Does she know anyone there?

583
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,436
No.

584
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,980
Let's see.

585
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,693
"St. Benedictus Psychiatric Hospital"?

586
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,948
ST. BENEDICTUS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

587
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,623
Hello?

588
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,169
Hello, I'm calling from
St. Benedictus Psychiatric Hospital.

589
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,920
Is this Ms. Oh In-joo's guardian?

590
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,839
I'm Oh In-joo.

591
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,048
You are?

592
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,258
Where are you?

593
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,344
You suddenly disappeared
from the hospital, so I was worried.

594
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,596
Me?

595
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,268
Yes, it's her.

596
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,352
That's my sister.

597
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,689
She came to the hospital alone, right?

598
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,066
And she checked in as Oh In-joo?

599
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,402
Yes, she said
she wanted to be hospitalized.

600
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,163
That's ridiculous.

601
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,957
Why would she want to be admitted
to a psychiatric hospital?

602
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,170
She wanted to be treated
for her alcoholism.

603
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,506
Then where on earth is she now?

604
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,842
How can a patient just disappear
from a hospital?

605
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,644
You're on the right track,

606
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:56,271
but you're asking
the wrong questions, Ms. Oh In-kyung.

607
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,442
Instead of asking
how much Park Il-bok's land was worth,

608
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,444
you should have asked why he had it.

609
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,490
Did you know that most of
Park Il-bok's land that you found

610
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:10,285
profited greatly through
the City Development Project?

611
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,203
REPLY

612
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,997
Thank you for your email.

613
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:14,998
Who are you?

614
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,751
Could I talk to you in person?

615
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,554
DANTÈS

616
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,430
Thank you for your email.

617
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,682
My name is Won Sang-woo.

618
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,602
I'm General Won Gi-seon's son
and Director Won Sang-a's brother.

619
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,564
I'm in a place
where no one can enter or leave.

620
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,149
I wrote everything in my previous email.

621
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,193
I hope this helps you cover the story.

622
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,363
This is my last chance. I want to take it.

623
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,950
If he testifies in public,
it will have a tremendous impact.

624
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,577
He is General Won Gi-seon's son

625
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,328
and Wonryeong Industry's former CEO.

626
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,622
He is also at the center
of the Bobae Savings Bank case.

627
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,790
Is Sang-woo

628
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,459
at St. Benedictus Psychiatric Hospital?

629
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,878
How did you know?

630
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,339
I know that hospital well.

631
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,218
I oversaw its construction when it was
called the Seonjin Welfare Center.

632
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,013
I was also the supervisor
when it became a hospital in 1998.

633
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,600
Give me a second.

634
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:25,569
The first three are the plumbing plans
for Seonjin Welfare Center.

635
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:29,781
The next three are the air duct plans
for St. Benedictus Psychiatric Hospital.

636
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,703
Because of the floor area ratio,

637
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,664
we added new floors to the building
with the original pipes intact.

638
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:42,294
Back then, every air duct in the building
was connected at the center.

639
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,600
The central ventilation system is
installed in the kitchen.

640
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,895
Think of it as a terminal
to all the vents in the building.

641
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,774
And there is a duct
big enough to fit a person.

642
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,071
Have you ever received guerrilla training?

643
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,197
No.

644
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,033
Are you athletic?

645
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:14,618
No.

646
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,455
Can you stay in dark
and dirty places for a long time?

647
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:22,167
That, I can do.

648
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,203
This is no ordinary psychiatric hospital.

649
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,288
What?

650
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,168
It says that it was remodeled
from the Seonjin Welfare Center in 1998.

651
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:10,507
In the 1980s, the Seonjin Welfare Center
illegally confined and enslaved

652
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,094
vagrants, street vendors, alcoholics,
and even ordinary people.

653
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,304
Director Sim Jae-seung,
a member of Jeongran Society

654
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,266
died in a car accident
after being exposed in 2004.

655
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:24,312
In-kyung might be locked up
somewhere in here.

656
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,274
How else would you explain
those footprints and the dead parrot?

657
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,234
Jong-ho.

658
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,654
I believe In-kyung entered
this place on purpose.

659
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,197
Why?

660
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,449
Why would she do that?

661
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,618
To see someone here.

662
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,816
Did you sleep well?

663
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,655
The new meds are doing wonders for me.

664
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,949
I slept soundly through the night.

665
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,204
Then let's keep you
on the same meds for now.

666
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,163
See you tomorrow.

667
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,247
Thank you.

668
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,144
Mr. Won Sang-woo.

669
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,981
I'm Reporter Oh In-kyung.

670
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,196
What's going on?

671
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,781
I'm sorry to show up like this.

672
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,452
Could you open the vent
using that screwdriver?

673
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,721
Why go to such lengths to see me?

674
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,558
I really wanted to ask you something.

675
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,351
And I also had something to tell you.

676
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,939
I was told you were tenacious
when it comes to doing the right thing.

677
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,733
I'm sorry?

678
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,237
That's what someone told me about you.

679
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,656
Anyway, go ahead.

680
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,536
I believed you were at the center
of the Bobae Savings Bank case.

681
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,538
You were in charge
of financing the project

682
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,457
and pocketed the 140 billion won
that was borrowed illegally.

683
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,668
But why are you locked up in here?

684
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:57,382
What do you think is at the core
of the Bobae Savings Bank case?

685
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,218
Business-government collusion?

686
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,220
Corruption in issuing permits?

687
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,264
Non-performing loans?

688
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,184
The worst thing about this case is

689
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:12,063
that they ran the bank to the ground
when they failed to receive a permit

690
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:17,110
and their business came to a halt
despite their incessant lobbying.

691
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,281
So the bank run wasn't caused
by non-performing loans?

692
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:24,409
They made the bank go under on purpose?

693
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,537
When a bank goes bankrupt,
the loans don't have to be paid back.

694
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,748
The government, insurance companies,
and account holders

695
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,416
are there to cover the damages.

696
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,419
I ended up here

697
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,504
while trying to expose that.

698
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,052
Why do you think they want
their own as the mayor of Seoul

699
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,220
and also as the president?

700
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,556
It's because they learned

701
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,100
that permits are at the core
of every business venture.

702
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,979
What do you think will happen
if Park Jae-sang becomes the mayor?

703
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,106
Keep your eye on the projects he approves,

704
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,692
and the owners of the land
involved in those projects.

705
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:02,697
You were focused on
how much Park Il-bok's land was worth,

706
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,408
but the real question is
what became of the lands he owned

707
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,744
and what they will become in the future.

708
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,463
We need you to testify, sir.

709
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,008
Who would believe what a lunatic says?

710
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,718
I'll back you up with proof.

711
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,514
I'll look into the evidence,
the circumstances, and the witnesses.

712
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,475
I believe the truth is bound to come out.

713
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,894
All you have to do
is testify with courage.

714
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,815
How will I even leave this place?

715
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,943
Even if I did,
I'll become a target right away.

716
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,653
I'm here to get you out.

717
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,780
I'll keep you safe outside.

718
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,366
We have the support
of someone we can trust.

719
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,137
How could you not have
recognized Oh In-kyung in the first place?

720
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,847
She slipped by using her sister's name.

721
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,641
It's Mr. Park's biggest concern.

722
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,853
If we fail to catch her here,
we will both face a grim future.

723
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,146
I'm sorry, ma'am.

724
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,773
We will end up in a very dark place.

725
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,614
In-kyung hasn't been caught yet.
She's safe for now.

726
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,826
I can't let someone like her
catch my sister.

727
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,619
We have to stop her.

728
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,580
How?

729
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,165
By any means necessary.

730
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,208
Have you checked up on the VIP?

731
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,169
Yes, his doctor saw him ten minutes ago.

732
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,838
He slept well and is doing fine.

733
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,441
What's that?

734
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,401
It's the fire alarm.

735
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:08,031
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

736
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,407
UNLOCK

737
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:11,618
What?

738
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,414
-Security! Follow me!
-Yes, sir.

739
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,253
Tell them to get that woman.

740
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,089
Yes, ma'am.

741
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,053
In-kyung, run! It's In-joo!

742
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,806
A dangerous woman is here!
She's here to get you!

743
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,977
In-joo.

744
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:39,813
In-joo.

745
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,648
Run, In-kyung! Hurry!

746
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,214
Let's go to the rooftop.

747
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,563
Damn it.

748
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,334
-Open up!
-In-joo!

749
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,547
Ms. Go, I believe I owe you something.

750
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,757
How many strikes did I take?

751
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,635
Four?

752
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,095
It was five!

753
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,435
I'm a bookkeeper, so I can't stand it
when the numbers don't add up.

754
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,775
I lost my two billion won
after getting hit five times.

755
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,030
I didn't think
I'd ever get to pay you back.

756
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,950
Do you think you'll be able
to deal with the consequences?

757
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,994
My men will be here any minute.

758
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,621
What do you plan on doing?

759
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,289
If I'm going to die soon,

760
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,958
I'll hit you five times before I do.

761
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,048
I think I finally get what you told me.

762
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:35,553
You said that everyone is honest
when they're faced with violence.

763
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,016
Damn it.

764
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,809
Hey!

765
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,770
What are you doing?

766
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,647
Let go of me!

767
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,815
-Stay away or I'll drop her!
-Hey!

768
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,150
In-joo, call the police.

769
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,070
Hold on a second.

770
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,826
-Get her!
-Wait!

771
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,789
Fine. Let go of me!

772
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,499
The VIP is gone.

773
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,717
They were trying to distract me.

774
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:18,429
Lock them in the basement
until we find the VIP.

775
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,370
Are you okay?

776
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,039
Yes, I'm fine.

777
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:51,462
That way.

778
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,630
Okay.

779
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,612
My sister was at the hospital.

780
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,196
I need to go get her.

781
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,617
I sent someone there just in case.

782
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,168
ST. BENEDICTUS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

783
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:33,564
What's going on?

784
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,124
Let's get out of here.

785
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,383
Why are you here?

786
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,721
I tried my best to come up with a plan.

787
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:06,514
But I couldn't, so I just came.

788
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,007
In-joo!

789
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,512
You crazy little…

790
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:48,931
I almost died because of you.

791
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,727
What happened to you?

792
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,437
It's nothing.

793
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,777
Are you all right?

794
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,448
Are you not hurt?

795
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,910
You're hurt.

796
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:11,829
Hey…

797
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,632
Mr. Won, have you been well?

798
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,010
Yes, what about you?

799
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,679
I never sent you
a picture of my winter coat, did I?

800
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,223
Oh, right.

801
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,517
I'll show it to you now.

802
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,144
In-kyung.

803
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,563
I won't ask you for anything else.

804
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,065
Peace…

805
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,985
Peace is all I ask for.

806
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,846
PARK JAE-SANG'S RALLY LOCATION

807
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,308
In three days,

808
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:18,521
Park Jae-sang will be holding
a large rally somewhere in Seoul.

809
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,607
I'm planning to be ready by then.

810
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,780
Do you have to kill him?

811
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:31,117
If we don't, none of us will be able
to carry on a normal life anymore.

812
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,122
But the situation has changed.

813
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,084
Mr. Won Sang-woo is here.

814
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:41,961
If we reveal the truth

815
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,047
behind Park Jae-sang and the savings bank
in the next three days--

816
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,175
Didn't you say yesterday that you
couldn't do this through the news?

817
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,137
That was when I was about to give up.

818
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,432
But I'd no longer
be a reporter if I did that.

819
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,893
I'm going to use the news.

820
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,186
Okay, I get it.

821
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,187
Then you're out.

822
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,440
Everyone having second thoughts
is free to go.

823
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,483
I was going to do this alone anyway.

824
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,078
In-kyung.

825
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:17,914
In-hye…

826
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,207
Have you tried to reach her?

827
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,626
No.

828
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,881
I think we have to go and bring her.

829
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:28,674
I'll go.

830
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,345
Let's ask someone in Park Jae-sang's house
to see what's going on.

831
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,429
I'll come with you.

832
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:36,098
Be careful, In-joo. I'll call you.

833
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:50,905
How could you lose that sneaky reporter
and let Sang-woo…

834
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,368
out into the world?

835
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,453
I'm truly sorry, sir.

836
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:02,541
I'm genuinely curious.

837
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,087
How in the world
could you let that happen?

838
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,465
It was careless of me.

839
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,051
I'll do a better job from now on.

840
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,028
Hello?

841
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,240
It's Sang-woo.

842
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:43,749
Where are you now?

843
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:54,218
I never wanted this.

844
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,763
I never planned to join them
in the first place.

845
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,724
You know me.

846
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,143
I'm not someone
who can stand under the spotlight.

847
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,312
I'll come to you. Tell me where you are.

848
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,442
I want compensation
for the time I've spent inside.

849
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:12,695
Prepare some cash and my ID.

850
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,572
I'll go far away.

851
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,741
I want to live a quiet life.

852
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,493
You can do that much, right?

853
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,537
Don't worry.

854
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,247
I'll make sure you have enough.

855
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,749
Just tell me where you are.

856
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:31,172
Do you remember the food stall by the sea?

857
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,883
The place where I picked you up

858
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,760
when you failed to get into university?

859
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,596
You called and said you'd kill yourself.

860
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,140
Please come alone.

861
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:42,767
Don't tell Sang-a anything.

862
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:46,604
Let's have some soju together
one last time.

863
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,816
I'll be there in two hours.

864
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,778
Don't think about doing anything stupid
and keep in touch.

865
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:34,026
What?

866
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,778
Go look for him.

867
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,444
How have you been, Jae-sang?

868
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:18,487
It's been a while.

869
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,342
Do you think he went
to kill Park Jae-sang himself?

870
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:25,387
Please don't tell my sisters
and Hyo-rin that I died.

871
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,347
Are you prepared to?

872
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:28,098
We need to move the money to a safe place.

873
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,642
Sign there.

874
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,187
Let me give you some advice.
Do you trust Choi Do-il?

875
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,856
It doesn't matter where you are
or whatever you're doing.

876
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,943
-You need to call me right away.
-Hyo-rin!

877
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,153
Can you make it so that
we can leave immediately?

878
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,656
Why don't we let them live freely
if even for a short while?

879
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,075
You can't do this with the news.

880
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,828
Wars are fought using guns.

881
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:54,917
