1
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,695
It's my fault.

2
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,181
If only…

3
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,769
I hadn't gone after that money.

4
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,189
If only I hadn't brought back that orchid.

5
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,402
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,574
Why is it your fault
that this happened to Great-Aunt?

7
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,382
In-joo!

8
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,176
Wake up, In-joo!

9
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,707
DECEASED: OH HYE-SEOK
CHIEF MOURNER: OH IN-KYUNG

10
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,880
I heard she saw everything.

11
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,548
She's been silent ever since.

12
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,675
Completely? She won't say anything at all?

13
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,719
That's why the investigation is slow.

14
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,971
The only witness won't talk.

15
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,349
Could she have been
involved in her death in any way?

16
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,226
Could it be because of the inheritance?

17
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,096
I knew Chairwoman Oh.

18
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,141
I knew her personally.

19
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,562
When I was little,
she used to come over often.

20
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,192
She was our family nurse.

21
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:59,155
She's the one who was by my side

22
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,449
on the day my mother passed away.

23
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,080
I used to call her "Syringe Lady."

24
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,464
Why did you give me that orchid?

25
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,424
You said it would show me

26
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,928
what I really wanted.

27
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:32,605
I had a nightmare.

28
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,857
I was terrified,

29
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,736
so I went to check on my great-aunt.

30
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,115
The next thing I knew,

31
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,409
I was crying

32
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,536
with my bleeding great-aunt in my arms.

33
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,875
Why did you give that to me?

34
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,544
Did my great-aunt die

35
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,672
because of that orchid?

36
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,722
I was only in high school

37
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,182
when I found my mother dead.

38
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:13,146
I had no idea what I was supposed to do.

39
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,773
If it wasn't for Syringe Lady,

40
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
I would have fallen apart.

41
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,029
What did my great-aunt…

42
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,823
do to help you?

43
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,203
She told me to close the door to the room.

44
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,753
She said if I could neither understand
nor accept what I saw,

45
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,131
I should just keep the door closed

46
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,883
and move on with my life.

47
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,844
And when the day comes

48
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,305
that I can finally understand
what happened,

49
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,391
I can reopen that door in my heart.

50
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,021
"Don't let this overwhelm you."

51
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,109
"Whatever this is,

52
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,819
your life matters more."

53
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,447
If it weren't for her advice,

54
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,284
I don't think I would've managed…

55
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,579
to live this life.

56
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,044
And I'd like to tell you the same thing.

57
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,880
If Chairwoman Oh were alive,

58
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,633
she would have done so herself.

59
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,429
The Chairwoman's death
has nothing to do with that orchid.

60
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,681
Believe me.

61
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,476
The orchid was just supposed to be

62
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,062
a token of our friendship.

63
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,442
When did you open that door again?

64
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,448
I never did.

65
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm still…

66
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,579
living my life as I did then.

67
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,793
But that's not the kind of person I am.

68
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:03,798
I'll never close that door.

69
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,427
I won't stop until I find an explanation.

70
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,012
And until then…

71
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,518
I won't even trust you,
Director Won Sang-a.

72
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,444
The deceased left behind a home,

73
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,114
land, forests, buildings,
stocks, bonds, and cash among others.

74
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,451
All in all, they're worth
about 28 billion won in total.

75
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,830
Regarding her home
and the stocks to her company,

76
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,166
she chose her great-niece,
Ms. Oh In-kyung…

77
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,004
as the sole inheritor.

78
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,755
As for the rest of the assets,

79
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,968
she wanted them to be equally distributed
among the other family members.

80
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,516
Moving on to her liabilities.

81
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,143
Here's the list.

82
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,021
A mortgage of 12 billion won.

83
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,567
Secured loans and mortgage trusts
of 19.5 billion won.

84
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,777
Hold on, her liabilities…

85
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,780
That's more than
the total worth of her assets.

86
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,533
Including bonds, her liabilities are
estimated to be 36 billion won.

87
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,826
That's ridiculous.

88
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,621
So basically, all she had was debt.

89
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,914
Let me have a look.

90
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,337
In this case, the fastest and simplest way
would be to disclaim--

91
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,047
-I'll disclaim the inheritance.
-I see.

92
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,673
I'll disclaim the inheritance too.

93
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,014
But that means the debt can be transferred
to the other inheritors.

94
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,309
If one of you accepts the inheritance
under the benefit of inventory--

95
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,521
We've already disclaimed the inheritance,
so count us out.

96
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,481
I'll do it.

97
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,818
I believe that's what the deceased
would have wanted as well.

98
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,822
If you allow me,
I'll take care of the rest.

99
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,704
Aunt Hye-seok was always fond of In-kyung,
wasn't she?

100
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,791
In-kyung was always such a smart girl.

101
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,559
How long have you been here?

102
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,063
Who did it?

103
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,108
I don't know.

104
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,114
You warned me that night,
saying I would be in danger.

105
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,659
That's how you could be there
before anyone else.

106
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,579
You knew something was going to happen,
didn't you?

107
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,375
Now that I think of it,
you were never startled by any of this.

108
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,919
Don't play dumb.

109
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,338
We both know that's bullshit.

110
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm sincerely sorry about your loss.

111
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,052
But I really didn't know.

112
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,222
To tell you the truth,
I'm just as startled as you are.

113
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,898
Tell me who did it
or I won't go to Singapore.

114
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:12,862
Will you call this a minor inconvenience
and tell me to put up with it?

115
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,865
I already made plans
for when you decided not to go.

116
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,451
You don't have to push yourself.

117
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,582
Be upset with me

118
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,876
for once.

119
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,545
Don't you see that I'm upset with you?

120
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,131
Let's split ninety-ten. No, hundred-zero.

121
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,215
You can take it all.

122
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,885
I'll give you all that money,

123
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,304
so find who killed my great-aunt.

124
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,184
Find out who killed Hwa-young
and my great-aunt.

125
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,227
Once they're behind bars,

126
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,438
the money is all yours.

127
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,779
I have a week
before I fly out to Singapore.

128
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,989
I won't be able to find
the culprit by then.

129
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,157
Even if I did,

130
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,493
we might not be able to secure
any solid evidence.

131
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,287
And even if we do find evidence,

132
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,289
the money will still be split sixty-forty

133
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,541
just as we promised before.

134
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,961
I promised to keep you safe

135
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,922
until I leave for Singapore, remember?

136
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,178
Are you saying

137
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,640
that you'll look into who the culprit is?

138
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,850
I'm telling you to be ready

139
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,144
to leave for Singapore anytime.

140
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,115
I was going to put off grieving for her
for the time being.

141
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,491
Because there's a lot to do.

142
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,205
I wanted to cry after finding out
why Great-Aunt died.

143
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
But this was too much.

144
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,670
She went bankrupt because of me.

145
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,547
It's not your fault.

146
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,881
It's Park Jae-sang's fault.

147
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:01,387
To Great-Aunt,
her company was like her child.

148
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:07,518
Seeing her business fail would have been
more painful to her than dying.

149
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:12,606
She wanted me to take over her company
and keep it prosperous for a long time.

150
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,403
That was why she raised me.

151
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,407
How will I make up for this?

152
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,243
You don't need to.
You didn't do anything wrong.

153
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,288
It's not sadness I feel.

154
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,959
It's pain.

155
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,128
It hurts so much.

156
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,297
In-kyung.

157
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,342
If anyone should be held responsible,
it should be me, not you.

158
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,763
I'll take care of everything from here.

159
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:48,559
So don't let this hold you back
and get on with your life.

160
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,539
"Hi, In-kyung."

161
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,551
Here are the passwords
to her bank accounts.

162
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,679
These are the house keys.

163
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,098
This is for the sedan,

164
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,934
and this is for the SUV.

165
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,696
What is this for?

166
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,328
She didn't mention anything about that.

167
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:06,845
IN-KYUNG'S ROOM

168
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,550
I know you hate
this kind of stuff, Great-Aunt.

169
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
I do too, but I'm writing it anyway.

170
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,228
Thank you for raising me.

171
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,102
Hey, In-joo.

172
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,438
In-kyung, turn on the news.

173
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,982
The person who killed Great-Aunt
turned himself in.

174
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,401
To Pyeongchang-dong, please.

175
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,821
-Mr. Cheon Sang-hyeok!
-Wait!

176
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,574
-Why did you kill her?
-Anything to say to her family?

177
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,869
It's wrong to kill someone,

178
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,080
but I had a good reason.

179
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,250
If you check out my ETube channel,
The Sinking Real Estate Market,

180
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,045
it'll show you why I did what I did.

181
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm sure you'll understand
once you see it.

182
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,841
What's that bastard going on about?

183
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,926
Damn it!

184
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,095
I don't believe this.

185
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,848
He was in charge of
Great-Aunt's meals for years.

186
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,058
Mr. Cheon Sang-hyeok.

187
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:22,189
Chairwoman Oh Hye-seok said
the real estate market would never crash.

188
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,109
But I ended up going broke.

189
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,612
For the past few years,
I've prepared for this day

190
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,073
through physical and mental training.

191
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,616
Today…

192
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,328
I will punish the demoness
of the real estate world.

193
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:41,125
Did he start working for her
with the intention of harming her?

194
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,879
Did he prepare her meals for two years
because he wanted to kill her?

195
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,884
Cheon Sang-hyeok was well-known
in the housing market pessimist forums.

196
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,221
Someone could have hired him
to kill Great-Aunt.

197
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,269
By the way,

198
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,646
tell me.

199
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,650
What was that orchid
that we found next to Great-Aunt?

200
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,111
Why did you say
that it was your fault that she died?

201
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,780
Is there anything else you know
about her death?

202
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,075
Hyo-rin's mother

203
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,786
gave it to me that day

204
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,957
when she asked me
to launder her money in Singapore.

205
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,251
What?

206
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,669
She said

207
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,756
I could join their group
if I received the orchid.

208
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,341
It's called Jeongran Society.

209
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,344
"Jeongran Society"?

210
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,979
Did you see it?

211
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,522
Cheon Sang-hyeok's video? I did.

212
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,982
Did you watch it to the end?

213
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,076
The Most High understands me.

214
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
Goodbye then.

215
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,419
That's an orchid.

216
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,673
He must have brought
that orchid to the scene.

217
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,226
How dare you do this to my men?

218
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,979
That dump truck accident
was obviously your doing.

219
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,483
They need 12 weeks in the hospital
and over 8 months of rehab.

220
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,819
One's a newlywed
and one recently became a dad!

221
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,863
Can't I do this much

222
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,407
when I've covered for you all this time?

223
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,037
I warned you to leave Ms. Oh In-joo alone.

224
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,706
And I did. I have nothing to do with that.

225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,917
Then find out what happened.

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,627
I haven't even started yet.

227
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,463
I've secured the transaction history

228
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,424
of your closest acquaintances
and their families.

229
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,012
You know how cold-blooded Mr. Park is
when it comes to money.

230
00:18:59,096 --> 00:18:59,972
Why you…

231
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,683
Listen, you crazy bastard.

232
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,853
I guess camaraderie
doesn't mean a thing to a traitor's son.

233
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,606
What would Mr. Park and your men say

234
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:14,319
when they find out that you pocketed
the money for the green fund?

235
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,281
Camaraderie aside,

236
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,658
they'll think you've
stabbed them in the back.

237
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,539
So go and find out right now.

238
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,542
Or it could be you

239
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,003
who needs to be in rehab next.

240
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
It has to be here somewhere.

241
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,270
Could he have taken it back?

242
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,398
What if someone took it?

243
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,443
There's a hidden room.

244
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,294
Someone cleaned out the safe.

245
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,133
I wonder what was stored in here.

246
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,220
Maybe that's why she was killed.

247
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,606
I found it.

248
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,030
So it was because of this orchid.

249
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,117
Not the orchid that I brought.

250
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,457
How can a mere plant be this scary?

251
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,790
In-joo. I'm…

252
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,130
determined to get this story out.

253
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,424
About Jeongran Society.

254
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,343
And about the secret of the Blue Orchid.

255
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,305
People are dying or getting killed
next to the orchid.

256
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,558
Who are they? Why did they die?

257
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,644
How are they connected?

258
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,855
And who was it

259
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,066
that killed our great-aunt?

260
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,111
If I don't get this story out,

261
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,363
I might be the one to die next.

262
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,241
Will people believe you?

263
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,993
It seems farfetched
to bring the orchid into this.

264
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,079
We don't have
any decisive evidence either.

265
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,288
In-kyung.

266
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,292
I have 70 billion won in Singapore.

267
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,752
You have seven million in Singapore?

268
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,254
It's 70 billion.

269
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,256
Is it Hwa-young's money?

270
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,509
It's in an account
under my name in Singapore.

271
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,929
I'm the only person
who can withdraw it now,

272
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,848
so it's mine.

273
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,475
I'm going there to get it in a week.

274
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,686
I know you wouldn't like it,

275
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:02,691
but that money will help us
find a safe place for us sisters

276
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,484
after you publish that story.

277
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,487
We should go to Singapore with In-hye.

278
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,865
Then I'll give you the ledgers.

279
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,993
Write a perfect story using that

280
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,412
and bring them all down.

281
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,455
What do you say?

282
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,876
What about me?

283
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,628
Won't I be in danger too?

284
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,098
Deal.

285
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,361
SEOUL MAYORAL PRIMARY ELECTION
RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT

286
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,364
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

287
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,492
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

288
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,746
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

289
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,790
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

290
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,837
Dear party members

291
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,547
and the great citizens of Seoul,

292
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,968
who was my enemy in this election?

293
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:15,889
It was none other than myself.

294
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,391
Who am I?

295
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,851
A serial killer.

296
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,188
The son of a miner. A breadwinner.

297
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,397
A lawyer who fought

298
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,192
for pneumoconiosis patients
and Agent Orange victims.

299
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:32,364
-I, Park Jae-sang, will fight for Seoul.
-Doesn't that sound familiar?

300
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,367
-It does.
-I will stop at nothing.

301
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,873
-Who is our enemy in this war?
-Who was my enemy in this election?

302
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,460
-It is ourselves.
-It was none other than myself.

303
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,629
Who were we
before we came to the battlefield?

304
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:48,797
Who am I?

305
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,840
The sentences have the same structure.

306
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,634
-…factory workers.
-Shoe repairers!

307
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,135
-Miners!
-Farmers!

308
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,971
-Carpenters!
-Sailors!

309
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,014
Hold on a second.

310
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,100
I think I just saw Great-Aunt.

311
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,227
Was she ever in Vietnam?

312
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,286
My father breathed on his own?

313
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,040
We had the TV on because we thought
the General would like it.

314
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,501
And right at this part of the speech…

315
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,461
Who am I?

316
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,754
The son of a miner.

317
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,172
PARK WINS PRIMARIES WITH 42.5% OF VOTES

318
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,173
A breadwinner.

319
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,800
A lawyer who fought

320
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,428
for pneumoconiosis patients
and Agent Orange victims.

321
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,430
He breathed on his own
for about 20 minutes.

322
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,308
It's unlikely that he'll fully
recover his consciousness,

323
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,851
but this is quite encouraging.

324
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,980
He's been listening to us.

325
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,524
He's doing his best
to come back to this world.

326
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,988
Father, you told me this
on the day of our marriage.

327
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,866
"From now on, I'm your father."

328
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,328
You breathed on your own
after I won the primaries.

329
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,747
So please wake up when I become the mayor.

330
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,042
Being the mayor won't cut it.

331
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,336
You'd need to become the president.

332
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,672
He'll survive until then, right?

333
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,383
We'll make sure he does.

334
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,678
-Let's keep that on.
-We will.

335
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,221
The General seems to like it.

336
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,184
He has to keep listening to that?

337
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,895
Until you become the president?

338
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,857
Fine, I'll try to make it happen
as soon as possible.

339
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,161
Did you attend
Chairwoman Oh's funeral yesterday?

340
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,412
Yes.

341
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,249
We were supposed to visit
the disability center.

342
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,752
I was worried when you canceled
because of a headache.

343
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,047
But I did have a headache.

344
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,299
Can't you see?

345
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,593
Look how far I've come for you.

346
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,930
Defeating my enemies
and making new friends along the way.

347
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,808
I wanted to become a man worthy of you.

348
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,228
So please help me out a little.

349
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,106
The only reason you married me

350
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,818
was that I was the daughter of a general.

351
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,362
You thought even a driver's son

352
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,907
could become the president
if they married me.

353
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,575
That's not true.

354
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,704
I didn't marry you
to become the president.

355
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,874
I want to become the president
because I love you.

356
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,758
You've always been my dream.

357
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,762
And you're more beautiful now
than when you married me at 25.

358
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,557
I can't do this alone.

359
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,394
We achieved our first victory today.

360
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,020
Tonight…

361
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,648
I really need you.

362
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,942
You're the only one who can help me.

363
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,532
Please.

364
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,618
Can you not touch me
at a moment like this?

365
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,376
When am I allowed to touch you then?

366
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,797
Sometimes…

367
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,717
you remind me of your father.

368
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,471
You're so persistent…

369
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,266
and repulsive.

370
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,379
Sorry.

371
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:01,925
Did I wake you up?

372
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,888
What's that noise?

373
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,389
My parents are fighting again.

374
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,487
Damn it!

375
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,782
-Let go of me!
-What's wrong?

376
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,617
-Let go!
-Let's go inside.

377
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,870
Leave me alone! Let go of me!

378
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,997
Please, leave me alone!

379
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:33,915
Let go!

380
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,126
I said, let go!

381
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,597
Let's go there.

382
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,850
Where we couldn't go before.

383
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,868
Are you sure this is it?

384
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:52,952
Yes.

385
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,830
I'm sure this is where I saw it.

386
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,467
Great-Aunt fought as an American.

387
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,279
"Lieutenant Oh Hye-seok."

388
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,657
She was discharged in 1970.

389
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,243
Did these people meet in the Vietnam War?

390
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,536
KIM DAL-SU

391
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,579
DISCHARGED IN 1970

392
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,749
All of them fought in the Vietnam War,
but in different units.

393
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,796
Then how did they meet each other?

394
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,547
KIM JEONG-GU, GANG DU-HAN,
PARK IL-BOK, LEE IL-HWA, JEONG GU-MYEON

395
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,343
At the hospital.

396
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,187
Twelve. There are twelve of them.

397
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,940
That's General Won Gi-seon.

398
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,358
This is an American field hospital.

399
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,860
Why were Korean soldiers there?

400
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,119
Young Ariadne looks so different
from how she looks now.

401
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,705
How so?

402
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,707
She looks cheerful, childlike,

403
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,126
and somewhat kind.

404
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,048
Does my mom look mean now?

405
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,180
I wonder what happened.

406
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,731
What's this?

407
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,900
Someone has been cut out.

408
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,113
Here too.

409
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,866
And here.

410
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,081
Who could it be?

411
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,758
JEONGRAN SOCIETY

412
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,551
GO JU-WON, PARK IL-BOK

413
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,265
Long ago, during the Vietnam War,

414
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,311
there was a nurse
and a platoon consisting of 12 soldiers.

415
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,398
When they returned to Korea,
they started to die one by one

416
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,527
as if they had fallen
while fighting an invisible war.

417
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,989
And…

418
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,159
since our great-aunt has passed away…

419
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,250
Apart from General Won Gi-seon,
the only survivor is…

420
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,298
Choi Hee-jae, who went missing in 1998.

421
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,343
CHOI HEE-JAE

422
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,471
I need to talk to him.

423
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,808
How will you find someone
who went missing?

424
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,647
You know what?

425
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,733
After he went missing,
his son inherited his land,

426
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,860
and the son's name is Choi Do-il.

427
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,323
Could it be the Choi Do-il we know?

428
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,118
They were born in the same year.

429
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,663
What?

430
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,957
CHOI DO-IL
123-1, HONGSIN-DONG, GWANAK-GU, SEOUL

431
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,044
Let's go meet Choi Do-il's mother first

432
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,296
since we know where she is for sure.

433
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,056
This is it.

434
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,600
I used to play with this as a kid.

435
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
It really does look exactly the same.

436
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,399
CLOSED ROOM

437
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,026
"Closed room."

438
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,074
Come to think of it…

439
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,494
there's no door.

440
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,399
I told the housekeeper
to take the day off.

441
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,151
I canceled all my morning plans too.

442
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,947
There's something I need to tell you.

443
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:27,954
Your mom

444
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,872
is sick.

445
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,291
She has a terrible headache.

446
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,168
She'll stay in her room for a while.

447
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,505
Her doctor said she shouldn't see anyone

448
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,131
until she gets better.

449
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,301
Will Mom be staying

450
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,097
in a closed room all by herself?

451
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,723
She'll get better in a few days.

452
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:48,975
We should help her out.

453
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,352
How do we do that?

454
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,188
By enjoying each day that's given to us.

455
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,822
In-hye.

456
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,865
Can you help Hyo-rin?

457
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,243
I'd really appreciate it if you did.

458
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,695
Who are you two?

459
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,991
What is it you want to tell me
about my son?

460
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,243
Are you trying to blackmail me?

461
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,369
No, we aren't.

462
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,163
We're not here to make a deal either.

463
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,582
I don't like to exaggerate.

464
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,959
I'm here to tell you the facts.

465
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,127
Go ahead.

466
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,714
Can I start by talking about you?

467
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,508
It'll naturally lead to your son.

468
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,762
Keep it short or I'll get bored.

469
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,311
The murder of Hongsin-dong Resident
Compensation Committee's chairman.

470
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,397
On August 9, 1998, at 9 p.m.,

471
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,900
a man in his seventies was murdered

472
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,361
in the Hongsin-dong
Redevelopment Association office.

473
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,865
He was struck three times in the head
from behind with a hammer

474
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,200
and died instantly.

475
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:34,413
You hid in the mountains all night
and were arrested the next morning.

476
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,540
The weapon was found at the scene.

477
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,834
Because your confession
matched the evidence,

478
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
and because the murder was
brutal and premeditated,

479
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,880
you received a 30-year sentence.

480
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:45,925
And why are you bringing this up?

481
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,968
What I find strange about this

482
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,389
is that you're not someone who is capable
of taking another person's life.

483
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,809
Do you not know?

484
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,019
All murderers were once ordinary people.

485
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,564
Most female murderers choose
poisoning or suffocation.

486
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,943
They prefer to suffocate sleeping victims
with a pillow or a plastic bag.

487
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,736
Then what if I'm upset

488
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,365
but can't find any poison
or a pillow nearby?

489
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,827
What if the hammer was all I had?

490
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,664
No one had ever seen that hammer
in the office before.

491
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:17,790
The police also found

492
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:21,001
a receipt showing that you had bought
the hammer a month earlier.

493
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,503
It was premeditated.

494
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:27,091
And this is what I find the most puzzling.

495
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,593
All premeditated crimes have a purpose.

496
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,178
But look what happened.

497
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,513
The redevelopment sped up,

498
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,598
but you've been in prison
for over 20 years.

499
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,517
I didn't think I'd get caught.

500
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,394
That's ridiculous.

501
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,564
Young people don't seem to understand

502
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,608
that life doesn't always go as planned.

503
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,528
I've racked my brain over and over

504
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,239
to find a way to clear up my suspicion.

505
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,201
And there's only one explanation
that makes sense to me.

506
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,955
You were acting your part in a show
that was set in Hongsin-dong.

507
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,166
And someone was running the show
from behind the curtains.

508
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:07,256
"When you get to
the top floor of the parking lot,

509
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,300
make sure there isn't anyone around."

510
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:15,181
"Then call the office
and see if anyone answers."

511
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,641
You moved there
only three months before the murder.

512
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,020
Your neighbors testified that they heard
hammering sounds for a month.

513
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,819
Were you practicing?

514
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,781
Everyone makes mistakes
during their first murder,

515
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,825
but the scene was way too clean.

516
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,121
Your son, who happened to be
sleeping over at his friend's that day,

517
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,166
received a scholarship
to study in the States a few months later.

518
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,960
If this is why you're here,
I don't want to hear it.

519
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,712
-You're wasting my--
-Your son…

520
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,674
I heard he never visited you in prison.

521
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,428
I told him not to.

522
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,390
He will be in danger

523
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,519
in the near future.

524
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,521
What are you saying?

525
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,358
Ledgers containing records
of a slush fund will be exposed.

526
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,068
Two people have died already.

527
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,532
The bookkeeper who managed the ledgers
for the last 25 years

528
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,866
and the accounting manager.

529
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:20,204
Who do you think will be framed
and killed next?

530
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,648
Just so you know,

531
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,277
your son is currently
the accounting manager.

532
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,821
And the person in charge of the ledgers

533
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,906
is me.

534
00:42:57,324 --> 00:43:00,369
Do you now understand
why we insisted on meeting you?

535
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:03,956
So?

536
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,042
What's your plan?

537
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,920
We'll expose Jeongran Society

538
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,381
to the world.

539
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,425
That's impossible.

540
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,051
It's possible if you help us.

541
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,930
If you do that,

542
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,808
you'll end up dead too.

543
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,019
All these years,

544
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,064
you've refused to meet anyone.

545
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,860
I think that's because
you regret what you did

546
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,820
and have been living in remorse.

547
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,782
But what made it possible for you

548
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,826
to endure all those years?

549
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,163
If something were to happen to your son…

550
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:14,443
Since then, I've seen my son just once.

551
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,321
It was while I was in custody.

552
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,616
He kept asking me the same question.

553
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,036
But…

554
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,374
I couldn't give him an answer.

555
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,043
Because…

556
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,214
I couldn't lie to him.

557
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,634
I have wondered for over 20 years

558
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,136
whether he never came to see me

559
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:45,474
because I didn't answer his question.

560
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,152
Please tell Do-il this.

561
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,241
My answer to his question is…

562
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,496
"no."

563
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,836
Tell him that if he wants
to find the evidence,

564
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,463
he should start at Baramjae

565
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,300
and head northeast by 23 degrees

566
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,719
for one kilometer.

567
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,139
I'm certain

568
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,433
that he'll know what I mean.

569
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:40,904
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

570
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:45,409
-Park Jae-sang!
-Park Jae-sang!

571
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,838
Oh In-joo and Oh In-kyung
visited An So-yeong

572
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,883
at the Cheongju Correctional Center
for Women an hour ago.

573
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,886
-What?
-Should I get rid of them?

574
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,599
They're not the problem.

575
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,935
Have your best men tail Choi Do-il.

576
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,189
Yes, sir.

577
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,372
I went to see your mother.

578
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,876
Who?

579
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,213
Your mother, Ms. An So-yeong.

580
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,260
What the hell are you up to?

581
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,596
She asked me to tell you

582
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,517
that her answer to your question
from 20 years ago

583
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,936
is "no."

584
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,439
And this is where you should go

585
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,150
to find evidence.

586
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,448
Forget about Singapore.

587
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,867
Our deal is off.

588
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,954
Don't contact me ever again.

589
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,623
Before my great-aunt passed away,

590
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,629
I asked her about Park Il-bok.

591
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,884
You know something, don't you?

592
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,053
Is it about Park Jae-sang's father?

593
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,848
That man wouldn't have let you
come to his house

594
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,059
just to share his childhood memories.

595
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,354
There are other secrets, right?

596
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,150
Park Il-bok was a very tidy man.

597
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,779
He hated seeing anyone needlessly suffer.

598
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,531
For that reason,

599
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,284
he helped many people.

600
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,254
This is all I can tell you
about Park Il-bok.

601
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,216
The scene of the Hongsin-dong murder

602
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,636
is said to have been unusually clean.

603
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,389
The victim did not needlessly suffer

604
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,891
and he died instantly.

605
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,318
Here's my plan.

606
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,779
Once I withdraw 70 billion won
in Singapore,

607
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,450
my sister will publish her story
about Jeongran Society

608
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,285
along with the slush fund ledgers.

609
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,745
There will be no negotiations.

610
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:38,248
And I won't turn a blind eye
to Hwa-young's death either.

611
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,378
You can get your revenge too.

612
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,632
The real culprit
is Park Jae-sang's father, Park Il-bok.

613
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,508
Once we reveal the evidence,

614
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,261
Park Jae-sang's political career
will be over.

615
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:01,271
I've always been curious as to why
people would want to take revenge

616
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,609
when there is a safer,
more dignified alternative.

617
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,862
So why would they put themselves at risk?

618
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,280
I don't get it…

619
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,368
but I'll give you this.

620
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:21,583
Cheon Sang-hyeok's ex-wife and daughter
will move into a new apartment next month.

621
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,210
You can find the details in there.

622
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,297
I'm giving it to you because I don't care
about your safety anymore.

623
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,758
From now on,

624
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,302
your life will be in danger.

625
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,099
I…

626
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,854
had my life on the line from the start.

627
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,316
I've been risking my life,
galloping on a horse.

628
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:48,193
And I still believe

629
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,781
that my horse can jump over the fence.

630
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,622
Call me.

631
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,000
We weren't the only ones following him.

632
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,593
It's from a graduation exhibit

633
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,262
for Stage Art Design majors
at the New York School of Theater.

634
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,180
The artist is Won Sang-a.

635
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,891
It was made in 1995.

636
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,646
That's way before Hwa-young died.

637
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:21,615
Why did my mom
make something this terrifying?

638
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:32,876
"The room that I locked myself up in
a long time ago."

639
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,044
"I can never…

640
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,797
leave this room."

641
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,303
What if…

642
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,765
my mom dies like this?

643
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,142
She's locked up in the room right now.

644
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,102
She won't die

645
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,646
because we know about this now.

646
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,813
We have to stop her.

647
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,149
I'm scared.

648
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,794
IN-HYE

649
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,385
It's Won Sang-a.

650
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:08,430
I'm locked up.

651
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,648
My husband is very dangerous right now.

652
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,698
I'll escape from this place
no matter what.

653
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:30,076
Go to Singapore
and prepare some cash for me.

654
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,454
I'll join you with the kids soon.

655
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,760
This building had been abandoned for years
until I bought it recently.

656
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,068
This building will be demolished soon.

657
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,155
It's safer to rebuild from scratch
after everything's been demolished.

658
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,283
I wanted to show it to you
before that happened.

659
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,327
What for?

660
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,997
I was hoping you could imagine
how this run-down building

661
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,583
will be replaced
by something much more magnificent.

662
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:06,297
I'm not smart enough
to understand what you mean.

663
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:12,303
I'll never hurt Hyo-rin or her mother
under any circumstances.

664
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,390
I can give up everything
for the two of them.

665
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:20,395
And you can also be a part of our family
if you decide that's what you want.

666
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:26,025
But you must understand that two buildings
can't be built in the same place.

667
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,654
The old building must be
completely demolished.

668
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,658
Only then can we build
something much more beautiful.

669
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,956
Many things will happen
in the next few days.

670
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:44,043
I'm curious to see
how well you will endure them.

671
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,704
Anyone home?

672
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,092
Sir, we're lost.
Could you please give us directions?

673
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,890
Go 800m east and you'll come to a fence.

674
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:41,559
You'll find yourselves back on the trail
if you follow it.

675
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,611
Come here, sweetie.

676
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,795
In-kyung!

677
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,766
In-kyung, are you okay?

678
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,011
VIETNAM WAR CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE

679
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,972
You must be a Vietnam War veteran.

680
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,224
-Don't touch that.
-I'm sorry.

681
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,034
VIETNAM WAR SURVIVORS
MANAGER LEE YONG-GWI

682
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,828
It's done.

683
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:25,747
Thank you.

684
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,335
Could we have some tea together?

685
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,796
Don't ever come near this place again.

686
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,006
Mr. Choi Hee-jae.

687
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,802
My name is Oh In-kyung.

688
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,304
I'm a freelancer now,

689
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,391
but I used to be a reporter at OBN.

690
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,401
I'm covering a story about General Won
and Jeongran Society.

691
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,196
I don't think this story
should remain untold.

692
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,989
Is there anything you can tell us?

693
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,159
I'll make sure
you remain completely anonymous.

694
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,164
That dog might have rabies.

695
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:12,377
Who knows what it's infected with,
given how much it roams about?

696
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,213
If I were you,
I'd get some medicine right away.

697
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,757
If you end up with tetanus,
you might lose your arm.

698
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,474
Leave immediately.

699
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,435
If I had known,
I wouldn't have even treated you.

700
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,110
We should go.

701
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,794
But still, how could you
let that dog bite you?

702
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,630
If I hadn't, we wouldn't have even
made it inside that house.

703
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,716
Did you get everything?

704
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,844
You must be out of your mind.

705
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:05,388
I wanted to show him
what kind of reporter I am.

706
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,723
Wait and see.

707
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:07,640
He'll call me.

708
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,143
I'll take you to the nearest hospital.

709
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,353
You could die of sepsis.

710
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,524
Do you know how we report typhoons?

711
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,444
You go to the very center of it.

712
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,363
Close to the sea if possible,
so you get the waves on camera.

713
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,908
Do you know what it feels like
when you're standing there?

714
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,327
You feel like you can win.

715
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,998
You feel like you can beat the typhoon
and survive to the end.

716
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,083
That's why I had a rope tied around me.

717
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:36,169
Because I didn't want people
to drag me away,

718
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,795
not knowing that I can win.

719
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,089
What if you died?

720
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,844
Some years,
I only felt alive during typhoons.

721
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,638
After a certain point,
they stopped giving me any stories

722
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,600
other than car accidents,
assault cases, and fires.

723
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,979
Instead, I wanted to cover
more important stories.

724
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,732
The ones that went deeper
and made much more noise.

725
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,985
Stories that could turn
people's lives upside down.

726
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,029
Seriously.

727
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,865
One day, you'll be the death of me.

728
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,451
Hold on.

729
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,162
VIETNAM WAR SURVIVORS
MANAGER LEE YONG-GWI

730
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,497
I think we found something.

731
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,759
In-joo.

732
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,100
Listen carefully, In-hye.

733
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,019
I'm about to tell you
something really important.

734
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,231
I'm leaving for Singapore in a few days.

735
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,776
You and In-kyung have to come too,
and we might not come back.

736
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:49,075
This is the phone you'll use then.

737
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,786
I withdrew as much cash as I could
just in case.

738
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:54,413
What about Hyo-rin and her mom?

739
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,916
They'll come too.

740
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,751
We'll go there and wait for them.

741
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,212
I don't know what you're saying.

742
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,047
I'll talk to In-kyung later.

743
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,926
Hey, the door's locked.

744
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,720
-Darn it. Who locked it?
-Stay here, I'll get the key.

745
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,561
It's your birthday today, right?

746
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,478
Is it?

747
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,147
I didn't know what to get you.

748
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,239
But I thought you'd want this the most.

749
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,411
I'm off.

750
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,849
I loved counting money
since I was a child.

751
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,520
I counted money in my head for fun.

752
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,359
When it was a lot of money,
I'd convert it into amounts of food.

753
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,037
A hundred red bean buns.
A hundred bowls of jjajangmyeon.

754
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,540
That was the only I could know
how much all that money was worth.

755
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,883
I'll remember this day.

756
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,553
This will be my last birthday
while being poor.

757
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,975
The day I bought
everything I had ever wanted.

758
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,516
Why did you put a tail on me?

759
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,185
Are you unable to trust me

760
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,437
because my father was a traitor?

761
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,983
Is there anyone I trusted more than you?

762
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,118
It's my father's address.

763
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,203
I know you've been looking for him.

764
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:41,288
Whatever you do with him,

765
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,748
I won't interfere.

766
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:01,809
He was a born hunter.

767
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,061
A born soldier.

768
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:09,734
Not many soldiers can actually
kill the enemy without hesitation.

769
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,320
Only about two percent of them.

770
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:18,034
Choi Hee-jae was one of the rare snipers
who could pull the trigger

771
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,453
while looking the target right in the eye.

772
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,791
It was once rumored

773
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,462
that there was a Special Forces unit
made up of only men like him.

774
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:37,678
And that the US Army trained them
to carry out special operations.

775
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,325
VAULT 1084
ENTER PASSWORD

776
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,577
My goodness! Mr. Choi.

777
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:10,873
What's with that outfit?

778
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,169
It's my birthday today.

779
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,966
I know people hate it,

780
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,553
but this is what I wanted to wear
when I was 12.

781
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:29,433
Because girls who dressed like this
had birthday parties.

782
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,687
I don't care if you laugh at me.

783
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,231
I wore it with confidence.

784
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:40,444
I'm a woman
who has 70 billion won in Singapore.

785
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,285
I'll give you an important task

786
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,330
to show you that I still trust you.

787
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:00,256
Get rid of Ms. Oh In-joo.

788
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:07,054
As quickly and as neatly as you can.

789
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:16,438
I received an email from Singapore.

790
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,570
It's all in English.

791
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,365
It's an article about
the preview of the IOF.

792
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:29,994
It says that the preview of the auction
was attended by many VIPs

793
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,621
including Ms. Oh In-joo from Korea.

794
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:49,346
That's…

795
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,391
Hwa-young.

796
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,020
Is Ms. Jin Hwa-young

797
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,772
really dead?

798
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,485
Yes.

799
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,238
I saw her dead body with my own eyes.

800
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,408
She's definitely dead.

801
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,999
We have a problem.

802
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:20,461
Rumor has it that the paper company
that I set up under your name

803
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:22,379
is going to be investigated.

804
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:27,092
Then what will happen?

805
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:29,678
They might freeze the accounts.

806
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:30,971
But the bigger problem is

807
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,684
that the fake Oh In-joo might take
the 70 billion won herself.

808
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,025
Is it really possible…

809
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,947
that Hwa-young is still alive?

810
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,200
I'm on my way to the airport.

811
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,619
I'm going to Singapore to find out.

812
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:04,963
Are you coming with me or not?

813
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:19,812
I am.

814
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,149
Someone saw a person
who looks exactly like me.

815
01:14:05,232 --> 01:14:07,443
No one looks exactly the same as you.

816
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:10,863
You must promise that you'll protect me

817
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,156
no matter what happens.

818
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,907
These accounts are all yours?

819
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,077
My men in Singapore
are on the move as we speak.

820
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,580
Don't even think about betraying me.

821
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:23,500
I'm going to kill Park Jae-sang
in front of everyone.

822
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,836
We can do that with the news.
That one shot you need.

823
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,297
In-joo seems to be in serious danger.

824
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,756
What do we do?

825
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,884
Don't ever trust anyone or anything

826
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,427
except for your gun and cash.

827
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:38,515
