1
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,890
How is this even possible?

2
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,684
How could Hwa-young have done all this
under my name?

3
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,313
Did you ever give your passport to her?

4
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,278
We went on a trip together
to Singapore four years ago.

5
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,740
It was soon after her mother passed away.

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,700
She booked the flights and hotels.

7
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,368
That would be when it started.

8
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,041
Are you saying

9
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,628
that I own this house
and this car in Singapore?

10
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,754
Yes.

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,799
I want to go there now.

12
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,800
You can't.

13
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,470
-Why not?
-Many people have their eyes on you.

14
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,807
It would seem fishy
if you suddenly visited Singapore.

15
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,768
Then what do I do?

16
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,522
The International Orchid Festival
will be held in Singapore soon.

17
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:50,068
Hyo-rin's mother buys and sells
orchids there every year to launder money.

18
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,403
It used to be
Hwa-young and Director Shin's job.

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,072
With both of them gone now,

20
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,032
she'll ask me for help.

21
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,868
I'm going on a business trip
to Singapore soon.

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,954
I'll tell her

23
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,581
that I can't do it because I'm too busy

24
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,292
unless there's someone who can help me.

25
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
And that's going to be me?

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,756
That will be our chance.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,882
There won't be another.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,884
That's why

29
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,679
you must work for Hyo-rin's mother.

30
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,182
It won't be easy.

31
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,892
She's picky and sensitive.

32
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,064
Show her that you're capable
of laundering money for her.

33
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,528
How will I do that?

34
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,865
Show that you're willing to risk your life

35
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
to protect someone else's money.

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,456
Who in their right mind would do that?

37
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,149
Ms. Oh.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,484
Isn't that In-joo?

39
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:15,069
What?

40
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,864
She's with a guy?

41
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,450
I didn't know she was seeing someone.

42
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,785
Wait, he's…

43
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,038
You know him?

44
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,878
He was famous at UPenn.

45
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,131
He was a genius who went to Wharton
but had no friends.

46
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,634
A suspicious limo would pick him up
from time to time.

47
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,094
He joined a Russian investment company
after graduating.

48
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,181
I heard that he became
a money laundering expert there.

49
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,058
What?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,435
Out of all the men in the world…

51
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,354
Maybe he quit money laundering.

52
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,983
Isn't In-joo beautiful?

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,738
But she always chooses
the wrong man to date.

54
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,365
A money laundering expert?

55
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,493
Over my dead body.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,245
-Bye.
-Hey!

57
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,628
Brother-in-law?

58
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,796
Oh, my.

59
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,926
I mistook you for her ex-husband
whom she divorced four years ago.

61
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,596
What on earth are you talking about?

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,889
They don't look alike at all.

63
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,892
I mean, he even has the same German car.

64
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,606
That's right. You've always had a thing
for men who drive German cars.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,692
That's why I got this car.

66
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,364
Can you leave now?

67
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,993
I'm sorry.
My sister's acting strange today.

68
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't worry.

69
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,620
I hope you're okay.

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,665
You probably dated her
without knowing she was divorced.

71
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,042
She told me on our first date.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,337
She also told me a little about you.

73
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,798
That you're a heavy drinker.

74
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,884
Oh, did I?

75
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,638
You did?

76
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,267
I'll get going now.

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,477
I'll call you, In-joo.

78
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,562
Okay.

79
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,484
Hey, have you lost your mind?

80
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,570
What was that poor acting about?

81
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,656
Do you know what kind of person he is?

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,533
He's a money laundering expert.

83
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,743
He's dangerous.

84
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,204
Says who?

85
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,165
-Jong-ho.
-What?

86
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,126
Are you hanging out with him?

87
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,628
That's not right.
You know he has feelings for you.

88
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,798
I'd cut him off
unless you're going to go out with him.

89
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,259
Look who's talking.
Be careful who you date.

90
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,970
An ordinary man wouldn't make a living
by laundering money.

91
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,014
We met for business.

92
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,640
Because I'm working for Hyo-rin's mother.

93
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,642
What? You're going to work for her?

94
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,561
Are you out of your mind?

95
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:56,230
In-hye is moving into that house.
I have to do something.

96
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,942
Since Hyo-rin's mother is busy,
I'll have to look after the kids.

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,195
I'll take good care of them.

98
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,449
Gosh, seriously.

99
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,419
I can't believe it.

100
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,296
Somewhere in this world,

101
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,840
someone lived this extravagant life
under my name.

102
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,219
How did you clean in the morning

103
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,597
and take English classes in the evening
when you had all this?

104
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,183
How did you manage to die…

105
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,728
leaving all this behind?

106
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,814
And why did you

107
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,066
choose me?

108
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,670
This is so good.

109
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,672
If they sold this near our work,

110
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,006
I'd eat it every day.

111
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,989
What's wrong?

112
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,242
It's my mom.

113
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,291
If we had taken the trip
just a month earlier,

114
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,378
she would have been able to have this.

115
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,548
But she passed away without knowing

116
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,592
that kaya toast exists.

117
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,262
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:54,098
You were supposed to come here
with your mom.

119
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,268
I was enjoying myself too much.
I should have been more considerate.

120
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,895
What are you talking about?

121
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,398
I'm glad that you're enjoying the food.

122
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,333
What's wrong, In-joo?

123
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,377
After I got divorced,

124
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,091
I didn't think anything good
would ever happen to me again.

125
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,262
Having good food and watching the sunset…

126
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,057
I didn't think

127
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,602
I would get to do
something like this again.

128
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,821
If even for 15 minutes…

129
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,701
If I could be with my mom
and enjoy kaya toast together,

130
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,538
I'd die with no regrets.

131
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,629
Fifteen minutes is too short for me.

132
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:11,384
If only I could live in a place like that
as a rich person even just for a day,

133
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,637
then could I die with no regrets.

134
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,490
Goodness.

135
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,409
It was me.

136
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,412
I'm the one who said

137
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,499
that I'd die without regrets
if I could live in a place like that.

138
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,306
I'll do my best, Hwa-young.

139
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,683
No matter how tough things get,

140
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,729
I'll try to finish what you started.

141
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,230
Hey!

142
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,857
Over here!

143
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,318
Did someone clean this room?

144
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,445
Everything is gone from the floor!

145
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,656
I told the new housekeeper not to do that.

146
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,034
My green button-down dress is gone!

147
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,119
It was over there.

148
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,416
I can't go to Singapore without it

149
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,126
and I have to leave right away!

150
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,012
Is this the one you're looking for?

151
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,681
Yes, it's this one.

152
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,017
She must have hung it there
after dry-cleaning it.

153
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,436
Fire her.

154
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,230
If my clothes are on the floor,
they are there for a reason.

155
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,982
Who gave her permission to hang it?

156
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,233
I will, ma'am.

157
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,449
You have sharp eyes, Ms. Oh.

158
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,119
I get that sometimes.

159
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,040
Can you prepare two cups of coffee?

160
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,709
In thermoses, so we can have them to go.

161
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,613
Get in. I'm in a hurry,
so let's talk on the way.

162
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,949
Okay.

163
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,091
I have business to attend to in Singapore.

164
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,803
A friend is opening a department store
and said I simply must come.

165
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,763
I see.

166
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,099
I'm not worried about the housework,

167
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,768
but the problem is my husband.

168
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,605
He's been too busy,
so I haven't been able to tell him.

169
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,941
I'm thinking of calling him
from Singapore.

170
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,735
Will he get angry?

171
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,988
That's fine with me,

172
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,657
but when he gets angry,

173
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,659
Hyo-rin gets scared.

174
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:27,538
She may have trouble breathing
or sleeping.

175
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,957
Then what should I do?

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,585
If she starts to hyperventilate,

177
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,128
give her this.

178
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,591
Before bed, give her these.

179
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,930
If she has a panic attack
and says she feels like she's dying…

180
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,057
Could she die?

181
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,851
No, she won't.

182
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,312
Just give her two of these.

183
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,984
"She won't die."

184
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,362
You know that
artists are sensitive, right?

185
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,159
She's gotten a lot more stable
since she met a smart friend like In-hye.

186
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,161
I'm so grateful.

187
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,997
But just in case,

188
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,167
could you stay the night?

189
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
Me?

190
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:18,964
Will that be okay?

191
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,426
I may ask you to do this
from time to time.

192
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,179
I'm not comfortable leaving her alone.

193
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,558
Sure thing.

194
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,312
Now that I'm working for you,

195
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,897
I'll do as much as I can.

196
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,319
I want Hyo-rin to find out
as late as possible that I'm in Singapore.

197
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,740
This morning, she was excited
that the documentary would air today.

198
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,117
I'll be back in a couple of days,

199
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,036
so I want her to stay in a good mood.

200
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,996
Don't worry.

201
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm relieved thanks to you.

202
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,627
Bye now.

203
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,129
Sorry?

204
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,466
I'll see you off at the airport.

205
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,676
I need rest.

206
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,345
I'm starting to have a headache
after packing all morning.

207
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,139
Take a cab back.

208
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,699
A lost kitten.

209
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,538
That was my first impression of In-hye.

210
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,873
Try this too.

211
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,500
There you go.

212
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,214
I could see that she was thirsty for love.

213
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,466
In-hye.

214
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,260
It must have hurt a lot, right?

215
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,265
Why are you crying?
I'm the one who's sick.

216
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,561
I feel so bad for In-hye.

217
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,148
Hyo-rin, you don't have to
feel bad for her.

218
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,858
She's amazing.

219
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,735
This surgery is tough even for adults,

220
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,028
but she pulled through.

221
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,239
In-hye is moving into
Hyo-rin's house today.

222
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,198
Here we are.

223
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,910
There is a room for In-hye
in Hyo-rin's house now.

224
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,369
IN-HYE HAS HER OWN ROOM NOW

225
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,374
Welcome, In-hye.

226
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,792
This is your room.

227
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,588
What if I can give her
the love that she needs?

228
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,506
That would be perfect.

229
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,719
Even as a child,
I would often take in stray cats.

230
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,845
What do you think?

231
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,263
Do you like it?

232
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,432
I love it.

233
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,187
I've never had my own room before.

234
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,065
What would be more thrilling than

235
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,442
-to have one's own room?
-Look at my face.

236
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:49,448
In-hye has never had
her own room in her life…

237
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,242
Hyo-rin, did you know
that your mom went to Singapore?

238
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,415
I didn't.

239
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,334
Did she go to Singapore?

240
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,169
You didn't know either?

241
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,421
I'm sorry, sir.

242
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,506
I was aware of it.

243
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,260
What are you doing here, Ms. Oh In-joo?

244
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,931
Hyo-rin's mother asked me
to take care of the kids.

245
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,688
I have a soft spot
for the ladies in my family.

246
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,899
Both for my daughter and my wife.

247
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,881
Hyo-rin, what's wrong?

248
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,966
Are you okay?

249
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,760
I'll get you some water.

250
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,354
Call your mom.
Ask her when she'll be back.

251
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,958
Ms. Oh In-joo.

252
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,334
Can we have a word?

253
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,928
Why did my wife go to Singapore?

254
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,851
She said her friend was opening
a department store.

255
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,394
A friend's department store?

256
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,173
PRINT

257
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,723
Should I tell Hyo-rin…

258
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,650
that you apologized?

259
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,318
Sure.

260
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:23,495
Sir.

261
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,623
She attended the opening of
the Glory Department Store in Singapore.

262
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,959
Can you bring her back by tomorrow?

263
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:31,962
Yes, sir.

264
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,609
In-joo.

265
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,403
What did you give her to make her stupid?

266
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,447
I gave her
what her mom told me to give her.

267
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,785
Hyo-rin.

268
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,329
Are you okay?

269
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,874
You know you won't die, right?

270
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,667
I'm fine.

271
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,131
This is a breathing technique
that I came up with.

272
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,344
It's all about…

273
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,139
breathing rhythmically.

274
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,022
Your dad apologized.

275
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,440
He wants to talk tomorrow.

276
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,151
As if. He didn't seem sorry at all.

277
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,782
I'll sleep in your room with you tonight.

278
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,575
Tell me if you need sleeping pills.

279
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,911
I'm really fine.

280
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,539
If I wasn't, I'd be in the ER right now.

281
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,251
I love going to the ER.

282
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,128
But today,

283
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,091
I think I'll be okay
because you two are with me.

284
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,367
Everyone in this family is insane.

285
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,828
Not a single person here
is in their right mind.

286
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,165
The one Director Shin talked about.
That wacko up there.

287
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,667
It's Hyo-rin's dad, right?

288
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,795
There are security cameras here.

289
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,425
So I'm right.

290
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,761
Why didn't you tell me?

291
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,222
As soon as he finds out
that we took the 70 billion won,

292
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,558
that wacko will kill us both.

293
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,436
Calm down.

294
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,520
Here's my plan.

295
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,190
I've set up a paper company
under your name.

296
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,485
Once I go to Singapore,
I'll transfer the 70 billion won there.

297
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,031
Hide in a safe place
while I negotiate using the ledgers.

298
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,453
So you'll hand over the ledgers
in exchange for 70 billion won?

299
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,539
-That's right.
-I don't think that'll work.

300
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,668
I've taken into account
how violent Park Jae-sang can be.

301
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,713
He never harms anything
that's important to him.

302
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:23,175
He came out into the world
after years of preparation.

303
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,385
He'll let us keep the 70 billion won.

304
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,971
His dream is worth more than that.

305
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,571
This is Andros, an island in Greece.

306
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,241
It's where shipping magnates
have their weekend homes.

307
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,494
I'll buy a house
that looks over the Aegean Sea.

308
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,038
This is Mazatlán.

309
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,499
It's where Mexican drug lords
spend their vacations.

310
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,752
These are the safest places in the world

311
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,421
as long as you have a few good friends.

312
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,677
Are you planning to live there, Mr. Choi?

313
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,724
Have you ever wished to be born again?

314
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,023
All the time.

315
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:22,943
Every day.

316
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,238
A new identity and a new face.

317
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,491
You can move every season

318
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,576
from one safe house to another.

319
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,539
We'll split the money
sixty-forty like we agreed.

320
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,459
I'm not sure.

321
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,878
I have my sisters.

322
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,633
You don't trust me?

323
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,097
No.

324
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,976
You were the biggest risk.

325
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,561
Why?

326
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,271
Why can't you trust me?

327
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,191
An ordinary person wouldn't make a living
by laundering money.

328
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,611
A money launderer

329
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,490
must risk their life
to protect other people's money.

330
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,493
To me, you're someone else's money.

331
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,995
Someone else's 70 billion won.

332
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,248
Can't you trust how far I'll go

333
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,458
to protect you?

334
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,926
I'll try to trust you.

335
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,179
Like I trust a friend.

336
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,140
Maybe not that.

337
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,309
Like I trust a bank or a door lock.

338
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
Ms. Oh.

339
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,443
Imagine you're on a horse,
galloping through a field.

340
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,863
You see a tall fence up ahead.

341
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,241
You don't know whether or not

342
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,493
your horse can jump over it.

343
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,705
But you have no choice
but to trust the horse

344
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,207
because it's already galloping.

345
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,336
Most importantly, if you don't trust it,

346
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,838
the horse won't be able to jump over it.

347
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,258
Imagine that I'm the horse.

348
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,262
A horse.

349
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,348
Okay.

350
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,852
I get it. Anyway, it's sixty-forty.

351
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,771
And I get sixty, right?

352
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,165
In-hye.

353
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,626
Yes?

354
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,585
I've…

355
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,089
made up my mind.

356
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,966
What do you mean?

357
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,260
You don't have to mooch off
this family anymore.

358
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm taking you out of here.

359
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,764
Why?

360
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,224
I'm doing well here.

361
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,810
I paint better,

362
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,395
the food is good,

363
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,980
and everyone is nice to me.

364
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,566
I don't mean coming back to our house.

365
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,026
What?

366
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,028
Have a look.

367
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,072
Let's live somewhere like this.

368
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,826
Look.

369
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,245
It's like a painting everywhere you look.

370
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,330
Imagine how well you'd paint here.

371
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,915
You'll have good food every day.

372
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,793
I'm sure In-kyung will definitely be
against the idea,

373
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,837
so if you and I settle there first--

374
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,921
Count me out too.

375
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,965
I'm not a sea person.

376
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,968
That's not the point.

377
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,469
I should go and study English.

378
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,264
I'm going abroad next month.

379
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,524
That brat.

380
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,300
I've always been

381
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:18,386
scared and lonely since I'm an only child.

382
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,389
On days when Mom and Dad fought,

383
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,267
I had trouble breathing
and felt as if I'd die.

384
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,772
So I used to cut my arms and legs
to calm down.

385
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,609
That's why Mom gives me those pills.

386
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,069
So I won't hurt myself.

387
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,585
It's just as lonely
even if you have siblings.

388
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,465
So I found a solution as a kid.

389
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,438
There are scary scenes I keep seeing.

390
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,565
I simply began to draw them.

391
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,027
"How did the blood flow?"

392
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,447
"The skin was bluish gray."

393
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,784
When I kept painting those scenes,

394
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,786
I wasn't scared anymore.

395
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,289
You're incredible.

396
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,126
You can do it too.

397
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,424
What scares you the most?

398
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,567
PILSEOK DEVELOPMENT CO., LTD

399
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,881
It was tough recruiting her.

400
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,841
This is Director Oh In-kyung

401
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,885
who's starting today.

402
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,899
What do you mean, I'm a director?

403
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,067
I thought I was here temporarily to learn.

404
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,198
DIRECTOR OH IN-KYUNG

405
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,491
This is your office.

406
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,537
This will make things clearer
for everyone, including yourself,

407
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,041
that I've put my company's future
on your shoulders.

408
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,376
Why would you do that?

409
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,670
I'm burdened by my own future alone.

410
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:02,008
Didn't you say you'd do anything
if I paid for In-hye's hospital bills?

411
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,928
But you didn't tell me to quit my job.

412
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,806
I'm going back to work
as soon as I'm reinstated.

413
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,058
Are you still not fired yet?

414
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,227
I thought you were.

415
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,145
I am on the verge of being fired,

416
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,897
but I'm determined to hang on.

417
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,485
I'm golf buddies with the CEO of OBN.

418
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:24,030
Shall I ask him for a favor
to see if you'll be fired or not?

419
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,490
Great-Aunt.

420
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,492
You begged me on your knees.

421
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,828
You said you'd even sell your soul.

422
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,455
So you want me to quit being a reporter

423
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,166
and enter the real estate industry
that I have no interest in?

424
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,085
I was glad to witness your growth.

425
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,631
You swallowed your pride
and asked for help.

426
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,633
I know how hard that can be.

427
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,096
That's how we change our lives for good.

428
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,473
That was also

429
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,893
how I started living my life long ago.

430
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,816
You kneeled down in front of someone?

431
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,192
Of course.

432
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,070
Sae-rom.

433
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,245
I've put together
all the information you may need.

434
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,914
Please let me know
if you need anything else.

435
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,588
Mr. Choi.

436
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,174
My men showed me something strange.

437
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,761
You and Ms. Oh

438
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,723
were having a secret rendezvous.

439
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,270
I've already told them.

440
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,149
"Even though Ms. Oh
pocketed two billion won,

441
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,859
she's still important to us."

442
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,986
"She has something to do
with the 70 billion."

443
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,448
"It's impossible
that Mr. Choi joined hands with her."

444
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,618
But I don't know
what you two talked about.

445
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,622
Can you tell me
what your conversation was about?

446
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,465
I've always made sure not to mix
business with pleasure until now.

447
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,801
But we're not dating, I swear.

448
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,851
A fling, perhaps?

449
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,363
BALANCE SHEET

450
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,743
LIABILITIES

451
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,437
Did you eat?

452
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,357
I've reviewed three years' worth
of financial statements.

453
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,442
The liabilities ratio is dangerously high.

454
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,237
One might think you're going bankrupt
if it was any other company.

455
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,906
Don't worry about that.

456
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,533
I have everything under control.

457
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,827
I see many empty desks.

458
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,705
Did you downsize the staff
to get the fixed costs down?

459
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,206
You're barely paying taxes,

460
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,709
so why buy the properties
scheduled for redevelopment?

461
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,462
You've reviewed
three years' worth of statements,

462
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,423
but I have 30 years' worth in my head.

463
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,010
If our financial statement is
at its worst now,

464
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,178
I'll be even richer in five years.

465
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,974
I couldn't resist buying those properties.

466
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,268
They're like a jackpot.

467
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,522
A jackpot we'll be winning in 20 years.

468
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,150
That's why I need you.

469
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:50,737
I want this company
to still be going strong even in 20 years.

470
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,370
By the way,
you said that you used to look for land

471
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,456
with Mr. Park Il-bok,
Mr. Park Jae-sang's father.

472
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,167
Can I find the information on that here?

473
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,320
Happy now?

474
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,322
How was your flight?

475
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,911
Was this really necessary?

476
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,457
Just tell me one thing.

477
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,959
Why did you go to Singapore?

478
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,590
I bought that black taffeta dress

479
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,258
over two months ago,

480
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,843
but I had no chance to wear it.

481
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,303
I couldn't wear it in Seoul

482
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,639
because I was afraid
my rashness and immoderation

483
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,557
would cause you to lose the election.

484
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,477
The opening of Nathan's department store

485
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,020
was the perfect opportunity.

486
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,438
You're lying.

487
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,526
You're well aware
that I don't care what you wear

488
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,903
or what people say about you.

489
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,864
Why did you really go there?

490
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,788
I had more than 30 appointments
just last week.

491
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,835
I was surrounded by people
who glance at what I wear

492
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,337
and wait for me to make a mistake.

493
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,424
The election is two months away.

494
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,844
The primaries begin next week.

495
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,512
When can I rest?

496
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,182
When and where
can I let my hair down and have fun?

497
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,810
You can do that anytime and anywhere.

498
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,479
It's just that you chose not to do that.

499
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,940
You want to become the mayor's wife

500
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,900
and eventually the First Lady.

501
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,360
That's why you married me.

502
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,320
Just tell me the truth.

503
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,780
What did you do there?

504
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,036
I drank champagne, went shopping,

505
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,999
and flirted a little
with healthy young men.

506
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,793
I felt alive
for the first time in forever.

507
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,337
Can't I do that much?

508
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,009
I don't understand you.

509
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,052
Why would you lie to me?

510
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,681
Something did happen, right?

511
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,648
You really don't seem to understand.

512
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,901
I never lie to you.

513
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,531
Why would anyone bother lying
to their manservant?

514
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,425
Stop it!

515
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,510
I said, stop!

516
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,054
Stop it right now!

517
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,018
Stop it!

518
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,603
Stop!

519
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,355
Stop!

520
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,041
Mom, where are you going?

521
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:41,884
Hyo-rin.

522
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,846
I have to step out for a second.

523
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,431
When will you be back?

524
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,937
Everything will be
back to normal tomorrow.

525
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:54,897
You know that, right?

526
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,733
Don't worry.

527
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,318
Take your pills and go to bed.

528
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,427
Are these all CCTV cameras?

529
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,724
Didn't my mom look so sad?

530
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,562
But there's nothing I can do for her.

531
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,232
I'm not capable of protecting her.

532
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,327
Mr. Park, you recently apologized to a man
who had been framed for espionage

533
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,996
on behalf of your father-in-law.

534
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,957
Your father-in-law, General Won Gi-seon,
was the commander of

535
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,959
the Defense Security Command
back in the 70s.

536
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,962
It is known that General Won Gi-seon

537
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,673
was not directly involved in the framing.

538
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,092
So why did he feel responsible
for the incident?

539
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:10,222
Also, does the General share
the same sentiment with you?

540
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,682
As you may know,

541
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,435
my father-in-law has been
in a coma for years.

542
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,229
He said this to me before he collapsed.

543
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,397
SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE DEBATE

544
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,818
"Would there be a way for me
to apologize to the victims myself?"

545
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,822
"I would like to be a stepping stone
for the new generation to the future."

546
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,618
Of course, I couldn't
fully understand how he felt.

547
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,623
But as I knew what kind of views
he always had,

548
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,960
I felt obliged to express his views
on his behalf.

549
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,069
You're amazing.

550
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,531
This is what you've been hiding
behind those innocent eyes.

551
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,639
Art warns us about the future.

552
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,810
It's always a step ahead,
looking into the future.

553
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,978
Just like Seoul.

554
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,399
We are always a step ahead
in changing the pavement in Seoul.

555
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,570
I'd like to express
my gratitude and admiration

556
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,238
to all the participating artists.

557
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,199
And most importantly,
to the host of this exhibition,

558
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,702
Director Won Sang-a.

559
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,128
You're my future. You know that, right?

560
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,461
On the flight home yesterday,

561
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,297
the pinot noir was so good
that I finished the whole bottle.

562
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,425
I'm still a bit hungover.

563
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,434
What should we do?
Do you want to change into my blouse?

564
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,534
WONRYEONG SCHOOL

565
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,077
26 NOMA-GIL

566
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,213
You're a director with Gardening TV?

567
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:33,259
I'm Director Ha Jong-ho
of The Private Lives of Plants.

568
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,469
GARDENING TV
DIRECTOR HA JONG-HO

569
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,845
And this is my cameraperson.

570
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,602
And you're here to cover the Blue Orchid?

571
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:49,400
I've been expecting this day to come.

572
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,527
Please follow me.

573
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,619
The Blue Orchid is globally rare.

574
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:04,540
But the one we have is the most beautiful.

575
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:08,919
We can say that
it is the queen of orchids.

576
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,170
Is that right?

577
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,299
But that's a little-known fact

578
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,801
since I've been keeping it a secret.

579
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:19,555
Still, I can't keep it a secret forever.

580
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,933
Please film everything you need.

581
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,519
The timing couldn't be better.

582
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,194
Orchid expert Mr. Joel Fields suspected

583
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,406
that you succeeded in
artificially cultivating them here.

584
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,367
Nonsense.

585
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,328
That would be impossible.

586
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,374
The seeds that fell on that old tree
just happened to have sprouted.

587
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,630
How did you get your hands
on this rare species in the first place?

588
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,300
This school was established 40 years ago.

589
00:43:56,383 --> 00:44:01,013
General Won Gi-seon, the founder,
gifted it to me back then.

590
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,559
Do you mean the former commander
of the Defense Security Command--

591
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,312
Someone as young as you knows
about the General?

592
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:17,321
He was a hidden hero of the Vietnam War.

593
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:21,367
He found the orchid during an operation

594
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,661
and brought it into Korea himself.

595
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,887
This is it.

596
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,599
We'll make a wonderful pair.

597
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,019
We will?

598
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,065
Look at me.

599
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,441
How do I look?

600
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,779
You look beautiful,

601
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,656
sexy, and…

602
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,492
Perhaps, a ditzy and extravagant woman.

603
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,330
That's why I need a shadow
that looks like you.

604
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,250
Someone who is pretty
but doesn't seem to care for such things.

605
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,544
A young woman who is smart and efficient.

606
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,632
I don't think I'm that kind of person.

607
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:28,016
That's why I'm saying
I'm going to guide you to be one.

608
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,149
You're charming.

609
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,694
With a bit of a touch-up,
you'll look absolutely elegant.

610
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,196
From now on, only wear what I give you.

611
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,158
I want my assistant

612
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,493
to reflect her inner dignity.

613
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,833
I'm flattered by your kind words,

614
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:57,296
but I don't think the dress you're wearing

615
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,840
reflects your inner dignity at all.

616
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,345
This?

617
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,222
This is my sense of humor.

618
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,520
Describe my husband
with words that come to your mind.

619
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,985
He's extremely competent,

620
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,237
successful--

621
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,697
Full of himself, isn't he?

622
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,201
That's why I look like this.

623
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,205
People find it amusing if I look ditzy.

624
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,665
It also makes my husband
look especially smart.

625
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:36,251
You know I love to live lavishly.

626
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,670
It's to prove my husband's success.

627
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,965
A princess would never marry
an incompetent man.

628
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:47,137
Self-deprecation is
the highest form of humor.

629
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,849
It's a lesson I learned
at the New York School of Theater.

630
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,313
Who is our enemy in this war?

631
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,067
It is ourselves.

632
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,488
Who were we
before we came to the battlefield?

633
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,450
We were construction laborers,
factory workers…

634
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,701
-Shoe repairers!
-Carpenters!

635
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,286
-Miners!
-Farmers!

636
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,539
Carpenters, miners, sailors…

637
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,499
We worked for our country

638
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,418
from the very bottom rung of society.

639
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,088
To get to a higher and brighter place,

640
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,300
we fought as fiercely as we could
on this battlefield!

641
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,596
WON GI-SEON MEMORIAL HALL

642
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,267
Let us pledge everything
as warriors for our country…

643
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,897
General Won was the greatest hero
of the Vietnam War,

644
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,983
but not many Koreans know that.

645
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,360
Isn't that interesting?

646
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,322
He and the Blue Orchid
have that in common.

647
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,783
But it's time that the Korean people

648
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,536
learned more about the General.

649
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,704
JEONGNAN PRIMARY SCHOOL

650
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,080
FROM THE LOWEST AND THE DARKEST
TO THE HIGHEST AND THE BRIGHTEST

651
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:59,126
After he returned to his motherland,
he did many things.

652
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,755
He built new houses in demolished villages

653
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,425
and established facilities for vagrants.

654
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,135
In the late 70s,

655
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,512
he began to build schools

656
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:12,514
for children in need.

657
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,935
This is the last
of the six schools that he built.

658
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,195
Myeong-jun.

659
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,658
What do you study for?

660
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,244
If I study hard,

661
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:38,707
I can reach the highest place,
even if I'm from the lowest place.

662
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,136
FROM THE LOWEST AND THE DARKEST
TO THE HIGHEST AND THE BRIGHTEST

663
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,223
We knew so little about people like this.

664
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,273
NOTABLE ALUMNI

665
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,574
OBN NEWS REPORTER JANG MA-RI

666
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:34,096
I can provide you with
all the information you need.

667
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,890
Please make a good show for us.

668
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,600
-Sure.
-Yes.

669
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:45,357
KOREAN SOLDIERS IN THE VIETNAM WAR
ALL ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR

670
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,255
Damn it.

671
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,398
Hurry.

672
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,193
Wait!

673
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,381
Where to, ma'am?

674
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,507
Straight ahead for now.

675
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,509
Are we being followed?

676
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,554
I usually let it slide,

677
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,347
but it's getting on my nerves today.

678
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,726
I mean my husband
treating me like a child.

679
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,314
He must be very concerned about you.

680
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,860
He can't stand to see me
having fun with other people.

681
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,866
Do you know

682
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,118
where Hwa-young's place is?

683
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,598
Was it there?

684
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,478
Through that gap below,

685
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:51,066
I saw her feet in heels hanging in midair.

686
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,531
You must have been so shocked.

687
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,783
Right?

688
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,618
To be honest…

689
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,455
I still can't believe it

690
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,709
even though I saw it with my own eyes.

691
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,808
I feel the same way.

692
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,187
I keep thinking about Hwa-young.

693
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:33,859
Even though she took off with my money…

694
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,238
I believe

695
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:42,367
that there were moments
when we were real friends.

696
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,329
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able
to bear the sadness.

697
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,281
Why do you dislike me?

698
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,034
Because I'm self-centered?

699
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:27,078
Because I try to take In-hye away?

700
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,666
I don't dislike you anymore.

701
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,084
Really?

702
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,338
If I think about it,
there were moments I should thank you for.

703
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,216
You recognized In-hye's artistic talent

704
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,968
and you took her to the hospital.

705
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,513
Honestly, I may have believed
it was okay for me to hate you

706
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,683
since you already had everything

707
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,894
that anyone could ask for.

708
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,605
Do you think

709
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,858
that I have everything?

710
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,862
I…

711
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,616
failed at what I wanted to do the most.

712
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,618
You did?

713
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,788
I wanted to be an actress

714
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:11,748
with all my heart.

715
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,876
But…

716
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,087
I couldn't act in front of other people.

717
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,215
People said all kinds of things.

718
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:23,510
That I was lousy,
landed roles through connections,

719
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,428
and had only looks.

720
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,432
In the end, I retired as an actress.

721
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,517
And I decided…

722
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,938
to act in secret.

723
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,606
Sorry?

724
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,069
I'm acting around the clock now

725
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,405
as Park Jae-sang's beloved wife.

726
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,449
That's the only role I'm good at playing.

727
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,122
You fooled me completely.

728
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:56,876
My husband and I are brilliant actors.

729
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,588
When we act out our roles perfectly
as each other's spouses,

730
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,091
we feel something similar to love.

731
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:07,262
I'm the one who cast him in the role.

732
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,681
Because I wanted to be the First Lady.

733
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,934
One day, I happened to see
his face from the side

734
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,146
and thought he looked like a president.

735
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,568
At times…

736
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,280
I wanted to be honest.

737
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:31,286
So I told Hwa-young everything.

738
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,752
I'll be straight with you, ma'am.

739
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,555
Hyo-rin's dad did this
in front of Hyo-rin.

740
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,851
Also, the scars on your body…

741
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,519
Are you sure you don't need help?

742
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,730
I can help you.

743
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,742
Every man who tries to court
a general's daughter

744
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,161
is ambitious.

745
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,332
Hyo-rin's dad was
the most ambitious of them all.

746
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,751
That means

747
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,295
he has a large hole in his heart.

748
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:26,591
But he'd never hurt Hyo-rin

749
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:28,510
because he sincerely loves her.

750
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,555
So I've come to terms with it.

751
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,890
If I don't,

752
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,811
I'd have to give up on the only role

753
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,772
I'm good at playing.

754
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,455
Hyo-rin's mother seems to be

755
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,584
someone to feel sorry for,
rather than someone who is crazy.

756
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,922
Looks like she displayed
her acting skills.

757
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,383
What?

758
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,885
That's not who Director Won is.

759
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,471
She probably did that to win your trust.

760
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,224
Why?

761
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,976
With Hwa-young dead,

762
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,979
she must need another Jin Hwa-young.

763
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,523
She needs a person
who can do dangerous work for her.

764
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,899
That can't be true.

765
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,902
It looked real.

766
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,321
How could anyone fake something like that?

767
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,614
What did she do?

768
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,784
She seemed like an abused…

769
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,413
I mean…

770
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,208
Everyone has something they want to hide,

771
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,086
so I shouldn't talk about it, but…

772
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,131
Your biggest charm…

773
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,926
is that you take things at face value.

774
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,806
And people like us love that.

775
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,185
Hyo-rin's mother will ask you
to go to Singapore soon.

776
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,692
I really believed
that we were becoming friends.

777
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,116
In-joo, there's something
you should know about Choi Do-il.

778
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,335
On January 12, 2012,

779
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,837
an SUV fell off a cliff

780
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,215
along a coastal road in Mazatlán, Mexico.

781
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,717
The local press suspected SUA.

782
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,262
The driver, a Korean man in his twenties,
was rescued.

783
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,306
The body of the passenger,
a Korean-American woman,

784
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,308
couldn't be found due to bad weather.

785
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,354
It's Choi Do-il.

786
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:49,442
I've seen him
with his girlfriend on campus.

787
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,196
But after one summer, she was gone.

788
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,239
Rumor had it

789
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,242
that a Russian money laundering group
didn't like her.

790
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,370
Are you saying
that Mr. Choi faked a car accident

791
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,747
to kill his girlfriend?

792
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,833
It doesn't end there.

793
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:14,175
On August 9, 1998,
a resident who was in conflict

794
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,970
with the redevelopment committee
over compensation

795
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,389
swung a hammer and killed the chairperson.

796
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,849
Was it Mr. Choi who swung the hammer?

797
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,476
His mother did.

798
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,186
He was 12 years old then.

799
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,272
Hey, this is unfair.

800
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,773
He was just 12 years old.

801
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,110
He shouldn't be criticized
for what his mother did.

802
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,363
Right after that incident,

803
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:37,198
that 12-year-old boy
was sent to the US to study

804
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,159
through the scholarship foundation run
by General Won Gi-seon.

805
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,037
Wonryeong Construction
was in charge of the redevelopment,

806
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,123
and it's closely related to General Won.

807
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,207
MURDER OVER REDEVELOPMENT COMPENSATION

808
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,837
You.

809
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,590
Why are you digging this up
and telling me all this?

810
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:57,677
Perhaps he really had a car accident
with his girlfriend.

811
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,472
How could you accuse him of murder
when you don't even know him that well?

812
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,105
Do you like him?

813
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:10,815
What are you talking about?

814
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,944
-I'll be back.
-Sit, Jong-ho! I don't like him.

815
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,781
I'm your sister.

816
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,284
I'm always the first
to find out how you feel.

817
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,329
So?

818
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,039
What am I feeling now?

819
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,832
I beg you.

820
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,751
Stay away from that man.

821
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,171
I clearly saw the way you looked at him.

822
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,798
It won't end well.

823
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,758
I mean it.

824
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,348
To me,

825
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,558
he's just money.

826
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,102
You know how much I love money.

827
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,896
I think of him as money.

828
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:55,693
Does he have something to do
with the ledgers?

829
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:03,117
It was his idea to use the ledgers
to strike a deal with Park Jae-sang,

830
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:04,661
wasn't it?

831
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:13,711
Did he promise to make you rich?

832
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,089
He even drove his girlfriend
to death over money.

833
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,384
-And you want him to make you rich?
-Be quiet.

834
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,760
The ledgers are mine.

835
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,680
No matter what I do with them,
it's none of your business.

836
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,186
Can't you two just go out already?

837
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,479
I'm sick of this.

838
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,025
In-joo.

839
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,485
You should stop seeing him.

840
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,153
There's something off about him.

841
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,080
Hold on.

842
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,790
That orchid.

843
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,504
It's the same as the one I saw
at Hwa-young's place.

844
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,968
I also found a similar orchid
at the scene of Director Shin's accident.

845
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,262
That's impossible.

846
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,347
It's supposed to be a very rare species.

847
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,143
It's even called the queen of orchids.

848
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,146
No, they're the same.

849
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,063
Gosh.

850
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,024
Have a look.

851
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,778
It's the same one, right?

852
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:31,789
They're the same, right?

853
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,791
They are.

854
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,503
I told you so.

855
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,517
Great-Aunt!

856
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,898
Great-Aunt.

857
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:57,940
What brings you here?

858
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,820
I'm having lunch with a friend.

859
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:06,073
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

860
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,450
I'll see you later.

861
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,755
Do you now understand
how rare this orchid is?

862
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,382
You can't find them anymore,
even in Vietnam.

863
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,010
Excessive deforestation
destroyed its habitat.

864
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,596
But this rare orchid was found

865
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,307
at all these scenes of fatal accidents.

866
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,892
Isn't that strange?

867
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,435
And all these accidents

868
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,230
are related to Park Jae-sang's family
to some extent.

869
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,317
That sounds hard to believe.

870
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,153
I know. Unless there's a huge conspiracy…

871
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,866
Don't take this the wrong way.

872
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,451
Have you been drinking?

873
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:53,621
-Look.
-With a story like this,

874
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,540
I need to make sure
that you're mentally sound.

875
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:59,001
I'll also need to double-check
all the evidence and witnesses.

876
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,837
I'm ready.

877
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,588
Let's start quickly, on one condition.

878
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,926
I want to keep this from Ms. Jang--

879
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:12,849
Yes?

880
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,937
Reporter Oh In-kyung?

881
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,441
Understood.

882
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:28,906
The personnel committee decided
to dismiss you this morning.

883
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,118
Dismiss me?

884
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:33,202
Hold on.

885
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,663
I'll find out what happened.

886
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,209
Did I just get fired?

887
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:46,716
In-joo, Hyo-rin forgot her phone at home.
Can you bring it to the academy?

888
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,217
Where is it?

889
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,110
Great-Aunt!

890
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,197
Are you home?

891
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,532
Why aren't you picking up?

892
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,912
In-kyung, she isn't feeling well.
Come back tomorrow.

893
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,081
I need to talk to you.

894
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,217
Aren't you taking this too far?

895
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:14,011
Let's talk later, In-kyung.

896
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:16,555
Did you tell my CEO to fire me?

897
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:21,978
Hold on a second.

898
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,317
I never did such a thing.

899
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,574
Tell me, Hyo-rin.

900
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,160
What is that painting? What did you paint?

901
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,287
Was it something you saw or heard?

902
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,373
Something you saw
on the news or in a photo?

903
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:45,584
I don't know.

904
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:49,672
How can you not know?
You painted it yourself.

905
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:50,965
I need to know.

906
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,010
I'm not leaving until you tell me.

907
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,099
What's with you?
She says she doesn't know.

908
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,976
I'm the one who told her to paint it.

909
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,146
What are you saying?

910
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,106
You told her to what?

911
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,066
A scene that scares her the most.

912
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,445
A scene that she can't tell anyone about
but keeps seeing.

913
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,864
I told her to paint it
so she can overcome her fear.

914
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,296
Hyo-rin.

915
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:35,259
I've seen that scene in real life.

916
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,928
I found a friend of mine,

917
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,139
dead in her room, looking just like that.

918
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,224
I need to know.

919
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,810
That painting…

920
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,978
Why did you draw it?

921
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,148
Was that…

922
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,692
your friend's room?

923
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,028
When was that?

924
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:59,075
Let's begin the Q&A session
with the reporters.

925
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,328
First up is Reporter Cha Seung-hyeon

926
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,996
with HTN.

927
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,122
I'm Reporter Cha Seung-hyeon--

928
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,459
I have a question for Mr. Park Jae-sang.

929
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:11,045
Please wait for your turn, Reporter Oh.

930
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,381
I was dismissed from OBN today,

931
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:16,717
so my turn won't ever come
starting tomorrow.

932
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,095
I need to ask you this question right now.

933
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,930
CIVIL PARTY, PARK JAE-SANG

934
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:24,433
You answered a question about your father
on Discussion of Youth recently.

935
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,143
-Turn off her mic.
-That he was a Vietnam War veteran,

936
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,229
that he was affected by Agent Orange,

937
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,231
and that you had a difficult childhood.

938
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,108
But according to what I found out,

939
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,069
your late father, Mr. Park Il-bok…

940
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,331
Forestland in 1982.

941
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,041
A vacant lot in 1985.

942
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,502
A building in Daechi-dong in 1988.

943
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,337
An apartment in Dongjak-gu in 1992.

944
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,047
Your late father owned

945
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,049
buildings worth 4.98 billion won

946
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,385
and land worth 3.05 billion won.

947
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:03,055
He owned real estate worth
about eight billion won in total.

948
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,350
Any comment on this, Mr. Park?

949
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,603
PARK JAE-SANG,
CIVIL PARTY SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE

950
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,874
In-joo.

951
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,337
Hyo-rin is gone.

952
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,755
But I don't think she left home.

953
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,090
Have you looked everywhere?

954
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,009
Is she hiding somewhere?

955
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,510
I hope nothing bad happened.

956
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:46,265
Hyo-rin!

957
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,186
Hyo-rin!

958
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,270
Hyo-rin!

959
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,317
Hyo-rin!

960
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,114
Hyo-rin!

961
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,422
There she is.

962
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,465
In the parking lot.

963
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,217
Where?

964
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,594
In the car.
I can see the light from her phone.

965
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:33,229
Hyo-rin!

966
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,357
Hyo-rin!

967
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,655
Wake up. Are you okay?

968
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,614
In-joo.

969
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,450
My gosh.

970
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:51,580
It's the dashcam footage
from the 17th of last month.

971
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:06,887
That's the day when Hwa-young died.

972
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,728
Hyo-rin, just a second.

973
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,458
This is the way to Hwa-young's place.

974
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,991
That day…

975
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,788
Hyo-rin's dad went to Hwa-young's place.

976
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,364
Dad left home without even looking at me.

977
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,490
My friend died.

978
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,784
What makes you so sure
that she was murdered?

979
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:35,744
What did you bring with you?

980
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:36,912
What is it that you want?

981
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:39,706
The scent of the orchid
reminded you of that scene.

982
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:42,126
It must be somewhere in your head.

983
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,253
What's your relationship
with those people, Great-Aunt?

984
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:46,547
To make sure Hwa-young's death
wasn't in vain…

985
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:49,716
Do you know something about the orchid?

986
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,510
In-hye!

987
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:53,011
Holding on to this can be dangerous.

988
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,224
All of the deaths are connected
by this orchid.

989
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:03,439
