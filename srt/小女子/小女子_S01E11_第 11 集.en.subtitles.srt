1
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm at the Civil Party's
campaign office in Yeouido.

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,438
The result of the exit poll
is about to be announced.

3
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,315
With a total of 48.4 percent of the votes,

4
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,901
Park Jae-sang of Civil Party
is in first place.

5
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,989
With the announcement of the result,

6
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
-the Civil Party campaign office
-You've done well.

7
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,534
was flooded with cheers of excitement.

8
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,036
It's time to start all over again.

9
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,707
The result shows that Candidate Park
was still in the lead with 48.4 percent.

10
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,045
His total amount of votes overtakes
that of Candidate Hwang,

11
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,631
which stands at 21.7 percent.

12
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,259
The two candidates are set apart
with a difference of 26.7 percent.

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,428
Provided that no further issues await him…

14
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,900
I know why you married me.

15
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:41,327
You knew I could die for you anytime

16
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,788
without hesitation.

17
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,381
I'll get going now.

18
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,552
Stay a little longer.

19
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,054
I'm not

20
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,724
done eating yet.

21
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,192
But why did you marry me?

22
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,364
I wouldn't have died for you.

23
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,059
Ms. Won.

24
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,855
In-hye sent you a package.

25
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,755
Because when I was 12,

26
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,301
my dream was to live with you
in this house.

27
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,597
I dreamed of marrying you,

28
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,058
becoming the owner of this house,

29
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,978
and having everything in the world.

30
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,438
Then you should've made it happen

31
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,024
at any cost.

32
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,944
Because you failed,

33
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,447
my father and I

34
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,991
are in danger now.

35
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,504
You and the General will be safe.

36
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,475
As I said,

37
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,812
I would do anything to protect you.

38
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:04,030
Even if I had to jump
from the highest place in the world.

39
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,891
Did you call for me, ma'am?

40
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,606
Ms. Go.

41
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,316
Who am I?

42
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,277
You are Director Won Sang-a,

43
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,572
Mr. Park Jae-sang's wife.

44
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,908
I'm my father's daughter.

45
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,619
And now,

46
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,621
I'm his sole remaining heir.

47
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,208
You were good to Hyo-rin's dad.

48
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,585
Do you not hate me?

49
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,296
I've encountered
countless deaths in my life,

50
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,216
but no other death

51
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,970
has demonstrated our faith
better than Mr. Park's death.

52
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,474
He gave up rising to the top
to save everyone else.

53
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,397
If you're uncomfortable having me around
because I worked for Mr. Park,

54
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,152
please do whatever you see fit.

55
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,738
You're cut out for this job.

56
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,200
Not many people are
as cruel and mean as you are.

57
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,330
I'm going to give you wings.

58
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,166
From now on,

59
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,626
we don't need to keep up appearances.

60
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,045
In that case,

61
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,507
does that mean I have permission

62
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,677
to kill Oh In-joo and Oh In-kyung?

63
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,637
I know

64
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,514
that you want to kill them.

65
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,683
But if you kill them now,

66
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,060
it'll be obvious that I'm behind it.

67
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,063
Let's toy with them for the time being

68
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,398
and wait for our chance.

69
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,486
Don't worry.

70
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,696
I promise it'll be entertaining.

71
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,293
What?

72
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,969
Ms. Oh In-joo! You're in there, right?

73
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,223
It's the police.

74
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,142
Ms. Oh In-joo!

75
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,187
RESTRICTED CALLER ID

76
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,734
Open the door or we'll enter by force.

77
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,448
Ms. Oh In-joo!

78
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,535
In-joo.

79
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,663
In-kyung, what should I do?
The cops are here.

80
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,791
What are you talking about?

81
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,084
They must be here for me.

82
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,294
They're calling my name. What should I do?

83
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,381
Just stay still.
They might not be real cops.

84
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,507
I'll be right there.

85
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,802
They're forcing the door open.

86
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,928
They're trying to come in.

87
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,389
Calm down and stay on the phone with me.

88
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,598
Can you buy some time?

89
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,602
They're here.

90
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,980
But the thing is,

91
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,357
I don't have the money with me.

92
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,234
Choi Do-il took it all.

93
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Ms. Oh In-joo.

94
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,113
You are Ms. Oh In-joo, right?

95
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,449
You're under arrest.

96
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,368
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,995
-You have the right to explain yourself.
-In-joo!

98
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,372
-You have the right to an attorney, okay?
-Don't tell them anything.

99
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,748
-I'll come to the station.
-Take her.

100
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:43,666
Yes, sir.

101
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,168
-Don't worry too much, okay?
-Wait a second.

102
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,253
Wait, I…

103
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,616
I have no idea what's going on.

104
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,787
As soon as I heard
that Park Jae-sang had died,

105
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,163
the 70 billion disappeared,

106
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,375
and the cops stormed in.

107
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,586
I might have to take all the blame

108
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,005
when I don't even have the money anymore.

109
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,258
I should never have trusted Choi Do-il.

110
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,556
Choi Do-il was in a serious car accident
on the way to the airport.

111
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,393
But I can't seem to find
which hospital he was taken to.

112
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,437
What?

113
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,315
Then does that mean

114
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,027
that he didn't betray me
and lost the money to someone else?

115
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,491
Hyo-rin's mom said

116
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,870
I should look forward to
what was going to happen.

117
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,541
She's probably just getting started.

118
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,501
But In-kyung…

119
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,422
Can you find out whether Choi Do-il

120
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,215
survived the accident?

121
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,135
I think I'll keep worrying about him.

122
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:23,284
PARK JAE-SANG
FROM THE MIRYANG CLAN

123
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,373
On the 10th of last month,
Jin, a bookkeeper in her thirties,

124
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,501
withdrew two billion won from the bank.

125
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,880
A few days later,
she committed suicide at home

126
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,965
disheartened by her circumstances.

127
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,469
A woman is seen leaving
the yoga studio where Jin was a member,

128
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,888
carrying a backpack containing Jin's cash.

129
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,683
She is Oh, a bookkeeper
who worked at the same company as Jin.

130
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,895
Everyone knew that the two of them
were close.

131
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,065
But for some reason,
they pretended otherwise in public.

132
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,775
As if they were scheming something.

133
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,236
At Ms. Jin's funeral,

134
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,489
while everyone else was
crying and grieving,

135
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,408
Ms. Oh didn't shed a single tear.

136
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,245
-I thought she was a heartless person.
-Yes.

137
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,580
It seems like
all she thinks about is money.

138
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:56,043
One day, she showed up
with an extremely expensive bag.

139
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,462
It creeped me out.

140
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,673
She was still wearing faux leather shoes.

141
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,762
The residents of this apartment complex
are some of the wealthiest in Singapore.

142
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,391
The ninth floor belongs to
a Korean national named Oh.

143
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:15,396
Why did Jin take her life
when she owned this luxurious apartment?

144
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,733
Ms. Oh acted really strange
after Ms. Jin died.

145
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,237
She even blamed Ms. Jin's death on us
out of nowhere.

146
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,573
Come to think of it,

147
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,658
she must have done that
because she felt guilty.

148
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,870
Who do you think benefited the most
from her death?

149
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,749
I suspect that Ms. Oh was
somehow involved in Ms. Jin's death.

150
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,167
-I agree.
-That's not enough.

151
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,379
We need more than mere suspicion.

152
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,465
We need people to be certain
that Oh In-joo killed Jin Hwa-young.

153
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,760
It will begin with just a suspicion.

154
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,470
But by the time the trial is over,

155
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,265
I'll make sure that she is seen
as the devil incarnate.

156
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,894
It wasn't like she had
another job waiting for her.

157
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,687
But she seemed confident--

158
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,068
Here's the story I need.

159
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,488
I want to show that my husband's death
had been planned out

160
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:10,200
and that it was the sisters Oh In-joo
and Oh In-kyung who were behind it.

161
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,289
They used my brother to set their trap
because they were after our money.

162
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,125
Isn't that the truth though?

163
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,836
That's what I believed from the beginning.

164
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,216
Mr. Won Sang-woo being there with a gun
was a trap to begin with, wasn't it?

165
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
The only problem is,

166
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,096
I don't have enough strength

167
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,223
to push this story by myself.

168
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,938
Ms. Jang.

169
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,067
You were a great liar
even when you were young.

170
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
You didn't seem to feel an ounce of guilt.

171
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,863
That's your strength.

172
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,283
How would you like to be an anchor?

173
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,122
Me? An anchor?

174
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,124
I know you want to rise up high.

175
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,837
The lengths that you went to prove
that you weren't just another reporter…

176
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,342
My husband didn't jump
from that building to die.

177
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,928
It was to guide those at the bottom

178
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,848
to the highest of places.

179
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,145
That's what Jeongran Society is all about.

180
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,196
You'll be sentenced to at least 20 years.

181
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,325
A 20-year sentence?

182
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,662
All I did was take some cash
from the locker

183
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,082
and withdraw money
from an account under my name.

184
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,375
Twenty years for that?

185
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,836
I'll be 50 by the time I'm done.

186
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,631
What you're claiming would count
as concealment of criminal profits.

187
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,133
That'll be about…

188
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,134
maybe seven years?

189
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,137
I even returned
most of that two billion won.

190
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,557
Someone took the 70 billion won,
and I have nothing left of it.

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,308
A crime is established

192
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,603
as soon as the criminal act is completed.

193
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,148
The court doesn't care

194
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,942
whether or not you returned
the money later

195
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,862
or how the money was distributed
among the criminals.

196
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,118
Ice cream.

197
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:24,168
Lip gloss, a hairbrush,
a pair of slippers, a car air freshener…

198
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,171
A winter coat.

199
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:29,673
I only wore it briefly
and ended up returning it.

200
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,800
That's all I did with the money.

201
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,471
If the court accepts
your claim to concealment,

202
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,181
you'll be sentenced to seven years.

203
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,683
But the prosecution indicted you
for embezzlement,

204
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,980
which means that you violated
The Act on the Aggravated Punishment

205
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,690
of Specific Economic Crimes.

206
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,235
I admit that I intended
to take that money.

207
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,697
But none of that is true.

208
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,783
I didn't deliberately embezzle the money.

209
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,203
I can't plead guilty
to something I didn't do!

210
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,954
The case we're dealing with

211
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,831
is under the public spotlight.

212
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,375
I've never seen a case this big

213
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,044
over the ten years
I've been a public defender.

214
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,090
The people are all riled up.

215
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,007
Do you know why?

216
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,177
If the average annual salary
in Korea is 40 million won,

217
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:19,348
that means you pocketed
17,500 years' worth of the average wage.

218
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,309
It's called a "judicial sentiment."

219
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:27,022
The law often serves
to soothe the people's nerves.

220
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,612
Just admit to the charges
and aim to get your sentence reduced.

221
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,783
Seriously.

222
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,452
This is driving me crazy.

223
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:45,457
Do you admit that you signed
these papers yourself, Ms. Oh?

224
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,294
WITNESS

225
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,629
Yes, I did.

226
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,007
But since I don't speak English--

227
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,802
And this house and this car
were registered under your name.

228
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,471
Am I correct?

229
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,764
JUDGE

230
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,600
You're correct,

231
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,018
but I didn't buy them--

232
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,771
You withdrew the money
from the bank yourself, correct?

233
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,821
Yes.

234
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,660
This company develops
software for bookkeepers.

235
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,162
Bookkeeper from the Future.

236
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,914
CEO Jin Hwa-young, Director Oh In-joo…

237
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,502
Is this correct?

238
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,465
I just let her use my name.

239
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,267
Ms. Jin Hwa-young,
who put that backpack in her locker…

240
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,476
By any chance,

241
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,645
is that her?

242
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,236
That is her.

243
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,239
And a few days later,

244
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,783
Ms. Oh In-joo came
and left with that backpack.

245
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,911
That's her, right?

246
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,996
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

247
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,291
Yes, that's correct.

248
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,752
I rest my case.

249
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,006
The court will be in recess
for ten minutes.

250
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,595
She was the director?

251
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,389
She must be out of her mind. Unbelievable.

252
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,604
I guess it's all true.

253
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,149
I did it all.

254
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,192
Deliberately.

255
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,278
I told you.

256
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:39,988
There's no way out.

257
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,743
Mr. Choi Do-il.

258
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,411
What if he testifies for me?

259
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:51,208
He knows that I unwittingly
accepted that money.

260
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,626
Mr. Choi Do-il?

261
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,088
He's going to testify

262
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,757
on the prosecution's side
in the next trial.

263
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,639
On the prosecution's side?

264
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,599
Yes.

265
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,897
-Here she comes.
-Quickly, take pictures.

266
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,316
-Keep taking pictures.
-That's her.

267
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,905
Do you deny the charges?

268
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,075
Please give us a comment on
your alleged murder to pocket 70 billion.

269
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,953
-Please say something!
-Is it true that you embezzled the money?

270
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,414
Is it really true?
Did you really not know anything?

271
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,224
What are you looking for?

272
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,810
You've been at it frantically
like you've seen a ghost.

273
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,150
BOBAE SAVINGS BANK VICTIMS
EMERGENCY MEETING

274
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,029
I found her.

275
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,407
I've met Ms. Jin Hwa-young before.

276
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,451
What?

277
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,621
At the Bobae Savings Bank
victims' meeting held in 2018.

278
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,125
As the representative of the victims,

279
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,585
I plead you.

280
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,890
I saved up 200 million won

281
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,517
and gave it to my mother,

282
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,812
so she could buy an apartment.

283
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,690
To make the most of that money,

284
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,358
she put it in the savings bank.

285
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,070
I had no idea

286
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,572
until I had to make a down payment

287
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,408
for the apartment
a month after the bank went under.

288
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,332
I couldn't reach my mother all day.

289
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,420
Then the police…

290
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,012
If I hadn't given her that money…

291
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,809
The money I saved up for her…

292
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,648
That money was evil.

293
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:24,736
I only knew her by her online ID
but I recognized her at the trial.

294
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,447
She left quite an impression on me.

295
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,699
"That money was evil."

296
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,952
Her words resonated with many people.

297
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,123
So she stole 70 billion won
just four years

298
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,624
after calling money evil?

299
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,173
Maybe money wasn't what she was after.

300
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,009
CURRENT EVENTS DEPARTMENT
REPORTER OH IN-KYUNG

301
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,351
BOBAE SAVINGS BANK VICTIMS
EMERGENCY MEETING

302
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,228
Excuse me, Ms. Oh.

303
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,399
Yes?

304
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,152
Someone I know wants
to give you a tip-off.

305
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:09,447
It's about the death of
Bobae Savings Bank's President Kim Dal-su.

306
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,283
Is that right?

307
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,954
He is Mr. Kim's nephew,
and his name is Kim Cheol-seong.

308
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,499
I gave him your email address

309
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,335
and told him that you would be interested.

310
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,012
Are you the nephew of Mr. Kim Dal-su?

311
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,723
You sent me an email four years ago.

312
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,395
I remember it now.

313
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,690
It was Ms. Jin who introduced
me to Mr. Kim Cheol-seong.

314
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,026
No way.

315
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,988
You mean 1022?

316
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,033
She was active for about three months.

317
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,663
But she seemed a little different
from the other victims.

318
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:04,628
The biggest concern for most victims
was getting their money back.

319
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,880
But for her…

320
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,757
People believe

321
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,551
that they have free will.

322
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,597
But the truth is
that we're controlled by money.

323
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,099
If we were cut in half,

324
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,354
we'd find ourselves infested
by a money-hungry centipede.

325
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,150
What do you think we must do

326
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,403
to live as humanely as possible

327
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,114
free from money's influence?

328
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,117
She was planning revenge.

329
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,122
In-kyung.

330
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,086
I think I'm the one who introduced you

331
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,673
to Hwa-young.

332
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,092
What?

333
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,439
-On the northbound Jungbu Expressway…
-Thirty…

334
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,941
Ms. Oh.

335
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,401
Hey.

336
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,735
What is it?

337
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,449
Could you attend
the burial tomorrow on my behalf?

338
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,619
What do you mean?

339
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,415
I think I have to go on a business trip
to Singapore tomorrow.

340
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,127
But your mother just passed away.

341
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,962
How can you go on a business trip?

342
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,466
There's some business
only I can take care of.

343
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,592
Moving on.

344
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,553
-Recently…
-Please.

345
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,805
My father will deal with most of it.

346
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,016
Just send her off on my behalf.

347
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:44,686
This is a report on
the Bobae Savings Bank case.

348
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,229
If I don't go tomorrow,

349
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,275
I'll have to make up for the loss
that I'll be causing the company.

350
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,738
That's ridiculous.

351
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,323
Reporter Oh In-kyung?

352
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,827
I'm at the Bobae Savings Bank
victims' meeting right now.

353
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,204
The amount that the victims deposited

354
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,957
ranges from a million won
to billions of won.

355
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,418
-That's In-kyung.
-The total is expected to be astronomical.

356
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,962
-Under the Depositor Protection Act,
-Do you know her?

357
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,298
the deposit insurance covers
up to 50 million won.

358
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,299
She's my sister.

359
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,967
Any amount that exceeds
the limit will be lost.

360
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,220
-She was always a top student.
-The victims are demanding…

361
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,472
If I were her,

362
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,892
I would have become an accountant
or a patent attorney and made a fortune.

363
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,311
But she has a strong sense of justice.

364
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,690
She's tenacious
when it comes to doing the right thing.

365
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,858
It's incredible.

366
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,611
The prosecution will begin
an intensive investigation.

367
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,905
-To prove the charges…
-She is?

368
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:41,826
It must also have been Hwa-young
who told Mr. Won Sang-woo about me.

369
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,954
That I'm tenacious
when it comes to doing the right thing.

370
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,753
What kind of life have I been living?

371
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,549
I've been a puppet in Won Sang-a's play.

372
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,637
I got dragged
into Hwa-young's revenge plot,

373
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,763
and wound up here.

374
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,352
It's as if I'm some money-hungry centipede
being controlled by 70 billion won.

375
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,231
In-kyung.

376
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,359
I don't think
I should keep living this way.

377
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,821
I can't rot in prison for 20 years
without a fight.

378
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,867
I want to do what I can from here.

379
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,287
Like what?

380
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,082
Let's prove that it was Won Sang-a

381
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,459
who killed Hwa-young.

382
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,088
Let's put that woman behind bars too.

383
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,298
How? We don't have any evidence.

384
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,679
The Closed Room.

385
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:47,809
There's a room in Hyo-rin's house.

386
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,644
It's sealed off without any windows.

387
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,647
That's where Won Sang-a's mother died.

388
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,942
When I stepped inside that room,

389
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,903
I noticed that it felt similar
to Hwa-young's room,

390
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,491
as well as the room

391
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,869
where Yang Hyang-sook died
eleven years ago.

392
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:11,207
You'll find some pictures of the room
in my cloud storage.

393
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,088
Won Sang-a said
that she likes secret plays.

394
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,215
A play where she kills off
the characters she creates

395
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,301
against the backdrop
she's created for them.

396
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,345
Like she's playing with dolls.

397
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:30,477
Hwa-young was found dead
in a fur coat and red heels.

398
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:35,940
She was completely naked
with a fur coat over her body.

399
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,693
-Also, she was wearing heels.
-It was the same with Yang Hyang-sook.

400
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,405
Then Won Sang-a's mother too?

401
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,248
In-hye told me

402
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,211
that in the attic, she saw a doll house
that looked just like that room.

403
00:29:56,294 --> 00:30:00,381
It was Won Sang-a's graduation project
while she studied theater in New York.

404
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,051
The doll in that house…

405
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,971
was also wearing a fur coat and red heels.

406
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,150
Let's start from there.

407
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,497
Hello, sir.

408
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,581
What do you want?

409
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,042
Are you Ms. Jin Hwa-young's father?

410
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,213
I'm Oh In-kyung, a freelance reporter.

411
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,965
I have nothing to tell you.

412
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,050
Please just answer one question.

413
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,011
The late Ms. Jin was found dead
wearing a fur coat.

414
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,555
Do you still have it with you?

415
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:50,723
Why would I?

416
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,394
I burned it because it was bad luck.

417
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,397
You burned it?

418
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,943
If you show up here again,
I'll call the police.

419
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,321
SUHYEON SUPERMARKET

420
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,705
I found it.

421
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,374
Nothing can get past my radar.

422
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:18,751
-What did you find?
-That fur coat.

423
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,921
It was sold in an online market
a week after Ms. Jin's death.

424
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,217
LUXURIOUS FUR COAT
2,500,000 WON

425
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,554
That's Ms. Jin's father's
phone number, right?

426
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,683
He sold what his daughter wore
when she died?

427
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,185
Trust me. I'll find the coat for you.

428
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,396
The buyer left a comment here.

429
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,522
CAN I TRY IT ON FIRST?

430
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:44,903
HELLO, I'M MESSAGING YOU
REGARDING THE FUR COAT YOU BOUGHT…

431
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,327
I'm sure that many of you were shocked

432
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,621
by Seoul mayoral candidate
Park Jae-sang's death.

433
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:57,457
It is said that this video,
which was released by a reporter,

434
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,667
was to have caused his death.

435
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,795
Reporter Jang Ma-ri has investigated
the video in question.

436
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,009
First, I'd like to bring your attention
to the dashcam footage that we secured.

437
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,556
Candidate Park Jae-sang
is sitting on a bench,

438
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,309
and Orchid E&C's CEO Won Sang-woo
approaches him.

439
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,146
Isn't that a gun?

440
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,230
It is.

441
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,902
It seems that Candidate Park's murder
may have been in self-defense.

442
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,279
Four years ago,
CEO Won developed a mental illness

443
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,657
and was hospitalized
in a closed psychiatric ward.

444
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,242
If Mr. Won intended
to regain control of his company

445
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,037
by murdering Candidate Park,
who was now its de-facto owner,

446
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,581
it's enough to be considered self-defense.

447
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,834
Then why did this reporter
release this video clip to the public

448
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,546
when it was doctored to make it look
as if Candidate Park was in the wrong?

449
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,925
-For money.
-Money?

450
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,804
I've recently reported on Jin,
a bookkeeper at Orchid E&C,

451
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,722
who committed suicide

452
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,184
after leaving 72 billion won behind
for her colleague Oh.

453
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:03,314
It was revealed that Jin had helped
Mr. Won embezzle funds for years

454
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,441
as his right-hand woman.

455
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:10,321
And Oh is the sister of the reporter
who released this video clip.

456
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,867
OBN exclusively found out
that Jin was in league with the reporter

457
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,662
for four years.

458
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,455
Let's watch the clip.

459
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,376
It's true that the two of them met
through our group.

460
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:27,880
Rumor had it that Ms. Jin was spending
an enormous amount of money

461
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:32,677
to lobby that reporter
to cover the savings bank case.

462
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,263
Those thieving bitches.

463
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,348
I'm sure that it was Oh
who killed everyone.

464
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,517
I knew it from the start.

465
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,146
The things people do
when they go mad for money.

466
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,815
-What a filthy world we live in.
-Goodness.

467
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,984
Jeez, I don't even feel like drinking.

468
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,652
-Damn it.
-Drink up.

469
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,374
I was amazed by your leadership.

470
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,461
Everyone was panicking
right after Jae-sang died,

471
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,505
but things settled down so quickly.

472
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,718
You'll play a bigger part
with us from now on.

473
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,512
You're the last surviving member

474
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,848
of my father's unit
from the Vietnam War now.

475
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,976
What would you have me do?

476
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,272
I would like you to handle
the Park Jae-sang Foundation,

477
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,274
although it'll need a new name
from now on.

478
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,778
It is Jeongran Society's
most important project.

479
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,654
It was also

480
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,866
my late husband's favorite project.

481
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,913
I'm the one who fostered
all the children of Jeongran Society.

482
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,247
I've always dreamed of

483
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,375
leading a scholarship foundation.

484
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,714
I have a discerning eye
for gifted children.

485
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,759
Thank you.

486
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,804
My father would be glad too.

487
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
-But Mr. Jang…
-Yes?

488
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,981
I'm not fine at all.

489
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,444
My husband is dead,
and my child has run away.

490
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,073
And I'm relying on medicine
to get through each day.

491
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,076
I just don't understand.

492
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,870
As the General's daughter,

493
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,833
how much longer will I have to
endure this kind of pain?

494
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,627
Is there something else

495
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,172
I need to do for you?

496
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,552
Reporter Oh In-kyung.

497
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,515
I would like you
to handle that reporter as well.

498
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,937
My father always said

499
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,732
that you were
the most formidable member of his unit

500
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,944
and that's why people never disobeyed you.

501
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,781
I heard that you received
special training from the CIA

502
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,661
on how to inflict all kinds of pain
that human beings can experience.

503
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,751
I've now forgotten how to torture people.

504
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,212
Just this once.

505
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,259
A mere reporter destroyed my entire life.

506
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,888
I don't think I'll ever be happy again…

507
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,975
unless she suffers greater pain

508
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,270
than the one I'm in.

509
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,902
But Sang-a,

510
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,113
let me ask you one thing.

511
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,116
Is it true…

512
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,454
that Jae-sang killed Sang-woo?

513
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,541
As you know,

514
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
my brother was insane.

515
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,007
He judged us by worldly standards

516
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,176
just like my mom did.

517
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,777
My father

518
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,947
bestowed the most beautiful Blue Orchid

519
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,491
upon Wonryeong School.

520
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,121
It's because the place
where our children grow

521
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,124
is the heart of Jeongran Society.

522
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,465
From now on,

523
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,634
your spot

524
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,844
will be up here.

525
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,768
Do you like it?

526
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,547
How could you lie
through your teeth like that?

527
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,590
And I thought you were still a reporter.

528
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:22,758
Why are you here?

529
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,552
Did you think I'd apologize to you?

530
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,430
I was curious what face you'd make
when you saw me.

531
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,433
I know you put on that cocky look
whenever you feel guilty.

532
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,936
As a trainee, I looked up to you
because you didn't bat an eyelash.

533
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,355
I admired your professionalism
and indifference.

534
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,114
Stop playing dumb.

535
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,534
You're saying you looked up to me
when I openly despised you?

536
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,745
You make it sound so real.

537
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,623
Why did you despise me so much?

538
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,959
Because you never complained.

539
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,669
It made me look mean.

540
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,840
You would come to work full of hope,
knowing you'd be scolded all day long.

541
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,176
You would shed tears
at other people's pain.

542
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,054
That's no way for a reporter to act.
A sense of justice?

543
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,847
Reporters aren't activists.

544
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,640
Also, you seemed to be happy

545
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,143
even though you were poor.

546
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:21,734
The April 1997 edition
of the Wonryeong Foundation newsletter

547
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,446
ran a story about Jang Ma-ri,
a kid who received scholarship that month,

548
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,908
along with a picture of her run-down house
where she lived with her grandfather.

549
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,494
It was when I saw that photo

550
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:34,663
that I understood why you wanted
to make it big so desperately.

551
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,088
Hey.

552
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,965
Be straight with me.

553
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,387
Did you really not know
that your sister stole that money?

554
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,138
You live with her.

555
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,558
I've always wanted to unmask you.

556
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,396
If you pursued justice,
you should've reported your sister.

557
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,440
If you pursued the truth,
you should've covered the story.

558
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,776
You feigned ignorance
and expressed your disproval

559
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,403
all the while you let her off.

560
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,407
That's who you are.

561
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,952
You're just as greedy as anyone else
behind that mask.

562
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:16,122
Just like how your desk drawer
is full of empty liquor bottles.

563
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,626
Of course I'm greedy.

564
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,588
I ended up here while pursuing
the truth behind that 70 billion won.

565
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,425
I would never sink so low

566
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:31,053
as to be blinded by greed
and lie to the public like you did.

567
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,140
I told a lie?

568
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,684
That story was my version of the truth.

569
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,062
You have your own version of the truth,

570
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,814
and I have my own.

571
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,608
Your truth was pitted against mine,

572
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,819
and mine ended up winning today.

573
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,658
Where did she go?

574
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,458
FAVORITES

575
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,542
IN-KYUNG
CALLING…

576
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,382
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected after the--

577
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,238
Have you been well?

578
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,908
Why are you here?

579
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,750
I was curious.

580
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,466
But still, who buys
every single color of lip gloss?

581
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,859
"Jeongran Society is in the hands
of Won Sang-a now."

582
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,112
"She is out of her mind."

583
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,284
JEONGRAN SOCIETY IS IN THE HANDS
OF WON SANG-A NOW

584
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,494
"How much insanity

585
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,789
will we witness from now on?"

586
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,256
What did you do

587
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,508
to my sister?

588
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:20,931
Her analysis and prediction
are pretty accurate.

589
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:26,270
But I wonder if she also could tell
that she'd die by my hands.

590
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,110
If you hurt In-kyung…

591
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,655
I won't sit back.

592
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,951
If you so much as harm a hair on her head…

593
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,412
Then what?

594
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,497
I won't hold back!

595
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,793
Even if it means the death of me!

596
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,674
Both my brother and my husband are dead,

597
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,761
and my only child has run away.

598
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,513
So why shouldn't your sister die?

599
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,393
I heard your parents are
in the Philippines.

600
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,063
That makes things easier for us.

601
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,566
It means we can just
bury them on the spot.

602
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,818
And…

603
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,987
there's In-hye.

604
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,116
What should I do with her?

605
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,162
I would probably feel bad,

606
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,289
but what can I do?

607
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,168
If I don't take it out on her,
I might die from the frustration.

608
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:09,206
So why did you go after
that 70 billion won?

609
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:12,042
Did you only think
about 70 billion won's worth of happiness?

610
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,462
You overlooked how much
the pain would be worth.

611
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,426
Leave my sisters alone!

612
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,931
Just kill me instead!

613
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,725
You still have to pay back my 70 billion.

614
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,187
You'll suffer the pain
that's worth exactly 70 billion won.

615
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,942
You'll keep hearing bad news
while you're in prison.

616
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,361
There'll be nothing you can do about it.

617
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,947
Your days will be long.

618
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,660
And I'll make sure you stay alive
for the next 20 years.

619
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,707
No! You can't do this!

620
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,542
No!

621
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,039
Could you give me a call
when you find her?

622
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,209
All right, give me your number.

623
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,294
Okay.

624
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,714
-Here you go.
-I'll give you a call.

625
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,090
-Thank you.
-Sure.

626
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,174
Thank you, sir.

627
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,440
Darn it.

628
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,040
NOTABLE ALUMNI
WONRYEONG UNIVERSITY

629
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,302
I watched Gardening TV every day

630
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,597
in the hopes of seeing the Blue Orchid.

631
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,725
So many thoughts crossed my mind.

632
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,646
"Maybe that orchid wasn't as beautiful
as I remembered."

633
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,982
"Did my hospitality fall short?"

634
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,279
Only after seeing you
on the nine o'clock news did I realize

635
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,323
that I had been fooled.

636
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,494
Did I ever tell you
that I received training from the CIA?

637
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:19,748
I learned how physically
and mentally fragile humans are

638
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,249
while I was there.

639
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,420
They believed that people had souls.

640
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,549
They teach you how to
destroy someone's soul completely.

641
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,845
But I refrain from resorting to torturing

642
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,808
because torturing ends up
eating away at my soul as well.

643
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,310
But there is one thing

644
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,438
that I cannot tolerate.

645
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,944
An insult against the General!

646
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,833
I told you about the General

647
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,751
and handed over the valuable information

648
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,838
because I liked the look in your eyes.

649
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,925
But you turned out to be a spy.

650
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,230
All rise.

651
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,791
You may be seated.

652
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,554
What are your responsibilities at work?

653
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,974
I manage the overseas assets
of Wonryeong Group.

654
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:04,144
Then when did you find out
about Jin Hwa-young's embezzlement?

655
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,146
It was right after her suicide.

656
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,399
Then you worked with
the defendant, Oh In-joo,

657
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:13,570
who was close to Jin Hwa-young,
to find the embezzled money.

658
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,529
Correct.

659
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:19,034
How did you find out that the defendant
had 70 billion won under her name?

660
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,953
She asked me for help.

661
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,582
She asked me to help her withdraw
her 70 billion won in Singapore.

662
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,959
Liar.

663
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:33,548
Are you aware that this testimony
may subject you to criminal punishment?

664
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,550
Yes, I am.

665
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:39,971
But you still agreed to testify
to reveal the truth behind

666
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,598
the embezzled 70 billion won.

667
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,100
That's correct.

668
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,978
In that case,
you must be deeply sincere right now.

669
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,397
I have no reason to lie.

670
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,692
I rest my case.

671
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,243
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

672
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,203
Why did the defendant, Oh In-joo,

673
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:08,375
ask you to withdraw her 70 billion won?

674
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,294
She was afraid.

675
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,671
Pardon?

676
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:17,759
After she learned that Jin Hwa-young used
her account to store illegitimate funds,

677
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,846
she dreaded the consequences.

678
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,098
That's why she urged me to
withdraw the money

679
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,183
as soon as possible.

680
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,144
But you transferred the money
back to Yeni Enterprise,

681
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,274
a paper company in the Virgin Islands.

682
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:34,359
Isn't that also under Oh In-joo's name?

683
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,361
That's right.

684
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:41,116
But after the 70 billion won
was laundered at Yeni Enterprise,

685
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,827
it was ultimately transferred
to HS Holdings,

686
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,496
a paper company in Panama.

687
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,831
HS Holdings?

688
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,916
Whose name is that under?

689
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,128
Director Won Sang-a.

690
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,023
I brought the transaction records
of HS Holdings,

691
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,566
a paper company in Panama,

692
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,028
that Director Won has used
to keep her slush funds for over a decade.

693
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:22,824
Objection. It is uncertain
that this evidence was lawfully collected.

694
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:27,412
Witness, where did you get that evidence?

695
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:31,541
It is my job to manage bank accounts
using transaction records

696
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,585
lawfully issued by banks.

697
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,897
You can see that the 70 billion
was transferred to HS holdings

698
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,525
where Director Won is the director.

699
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,532
Then are you claiming

700
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,535
that the defendant, Oh In-joo, was unaware

701
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,955
that the 70 billion won had been embezzled

702
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,041
and rather withdrew the money

703
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,877
to avoid being involved
in the embezzlement?

704
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,174
We never share such confidential tasks

705
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:23,593
with a low-level employee like Oh In-joo.

706
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,430
The reason Jin Hwa-young targeted her

707
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:32,227
was that she was someone naive
and financially illiterate enough

708
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,729
to sign anything
while being oblivious to its purpose,

709
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,898
allowing Ms. Jin to open
new accounts under a false name.

710
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:41,861
When the culprits Jin Hwa-young
and Shin Hyeon-min suddenly died,

711
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,948
Oh In-joo became scared and returned

712
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,575
the two billion she had
and even risked losing her job.

713
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,704
She also withdrew 70 billion won
and insisted that I take it.

714
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,914
And that's how

715
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,376
this case became known to the public.

716
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,130
Are you aware
that this testimony may subject you

717
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:05,301
to criminal punishment for engaging
in the organized embezzlement

718
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,430
and establishment of slush funds
at Orchid E&C?

719
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,518
Yes, I am.

720
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,853
In that case,

721
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,813
you must definitely be telling the truth.

722
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:17,772
Thank you.

723
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,630
My guess is one year in the first trial
and probation in the second trial.

724
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,399
What do you think of
Mr. Choi's testimony in court?

725
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,360
He claimed that you ordered him
to launder the money for you.

726
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,821
Did you know of HS Holdings
that Mr. Choi mentioned?

727
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,324
Where is the 70 billion won now?

728
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,410
-Is what he said true?
-Give us a comment!

729
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,455
-Please say something!
-Step back!

730
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,088
None of this makes sense.

731
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:27,133
Did you really not know
that Choi Do-il sent you the money?

732
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,968
Do you know how many accounts I have?

733
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,012
I don't even know
what that account is for.

734
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:34,015
He might have fabricated it.

735
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,600
I'll go and check.

736
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:41,856
But if what he said is true,
I wonder why he sent you that money.

737
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,566
He could have kept it.

738
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,070
You don't think…

739
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,615
he would dare give up 70 billion
for a woman he's in a fling with, do you?

740
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,284
What nonsense is that?
You're getting on my nerves!

741
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:55,578
I'm sorry, ma'am.

742
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,588
Hello?

743
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,340
Yes.

744
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,219
I see.

745
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,737
What was that?

746
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,739
Do you think I'm an idiot?

747
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,659
Being financially illiterate
doesn't mean you're an idiot.

748
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,786
You disappeared without a word,

749
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,039
then you showed up out of nowhere
and put on a show.

750
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,916
This is you treating me like an idiot.

751
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,379
I'm sorry. Something came up.

752
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,591
I mean, you're capable of doing anything.

753
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,051
Was it so hard for you

754
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,179
to let me know that you're safe?

755
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,139
You ignored my calls
and ignored my messages.

756
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:59,142
I tried to send someone,
but you were in solitary confinement.

757
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,953
Time's up.

758
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,052
Mr. Choi Do-il.

759
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,929
You're under arrest

760
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,723
for violating the Act on the Aggravated
Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes.

761
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,935
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

762
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,116
I don't think you need to worry.

763
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,037
One, a criminal's testimony
isn't that credible.

764
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,790
Two, his father is Choi Hee-jae.

765
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:08,127
Three, you don't know how that money
ended up in your account.

766
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:13,258
Four, you could donate all of that money
to the foundation to prove your story.

767
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,010
The entire amount?

768
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,054
That will show everyone
how sincere you are

769
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,264
and resolve the situation.

770
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,933
Ms. Jang.

771
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,520
-I think you should see this.
-HTN recently reported

772
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:29,107
on the suspicions surrounding
the Hongsin-dong murder case.

773
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,278
-I think you should watch HTN News.
-Many people would remember this case.

774
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,905
Reporter Oh In-kyung,
who recently appeared on our show

775
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,450
to reveal the truth
of the Hongsin-dong murder case,

776
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:43,871
is here in the studio again
to reveal another truth.

777
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,291
Thank you for coming back.

778
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:50,003
Reporter Oh, what story
do you have for us today?

779
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,546
Many people were shocked

780
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,507
when Jin, a bookkeeper at Orchid E&C,
committed suicide

781
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,176
after embezzling 70 billion won.

782
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,597
It is suspected that Director Won Sang-a,
the late Mr. Park's wife,

783
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,557
was involved in her death.

784
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,641
I see.

785
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,559
JANG SA-PYEONG

786
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,978
Here's the CCTV footage
from Director Won's bedroom,

787
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,772
an hour before
Jin's estimated time of death.

788
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,487
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected--

789
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:19,365
Director Won leaves
her home in a fur coat.

790
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:24,078
Two and a half hours later,
she returns home without her coat.

791
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:29,792
Jin was found dead wearing a fur coat
similar to Director Won's.

792
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,257
This is the fur coat
Jin was found wearing when she died.

793
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,427
It is from a designer brand
and costs tens of millions of won.

794
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,096
Only eight of them were sold in Korea.

795
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,059
Since it is made of natural fur,

796
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,436
its colors are one of a kind.

797
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:51,356
I see. And they look like the same coat.

798
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,192
That's not all.

799
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:58,321
There was another bookkeeper
who committed suicide in a fur coat.

800
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,824
Yang, who was under investigation
for embezzling 5.2 billion won,

801
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,993
was an employee at Wonryeong Construction,

802
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,371
the company that preceded Orchid E&C.

803
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,048
This is Director Won's graduation project

804
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,051
from her time studying at
the New York School of Theater.

805
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:23,596
It's called Closed Room.

806
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,850
You can see that it also features
a doll in a fur coat.

807
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:33,981
They are all different situations
with striking similarities.

808
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:36,609
I admit that the events are
too similar to be ignored,

809
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,488
but is this enough to prove
that Director Won

810
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,865
was directly involved in these deaths?

811
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:47,578
These three deaths have
another thing in common.

812
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,748
The Blue Orchid was found
at all three crime sites.

813
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:54,335
It is a globally rare species.

814
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,718
In order to learn
the meaning behind these orchids

815
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,970
that were found on the scene,

816
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,514
we invited an expert to the studio.

817
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,310
Let me introduce Mr. Jang Sa-pyeong,
a world-class expert on the Blue Orchid

818
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,187
and the principal of Wonryeong School.

819
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,815
Hello.

820
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,817
My name is Jang Sa-pyeong.

821
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,780
I heard that the Blue Orchid is so rare
that only two of them were reported

822
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,657
to remain in the world.

823
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:27,952
The Blue Orchid is also known
as the lost orchid.

824
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:32,165
It has become extinct in Vietnam,
where it originated from.

825
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,916
I own one of them

826
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,502
and have gifted the other
to my acquaintance in the US.

827
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,964
That makes only two of them
under official record.

828
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,299
That's extremely rare.

829
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:48,264
Then how do you explain
the orchids found on the scene?

830
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,476
The survival of the Blue Orchid
is completely controlled by

831
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:55,688
the mold and microorganisms
that grow on a specific species of tree.

832
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,608
Once it leaves the tree, it dies.

833
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,526
However, a long time ago,

834
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,653
one such tree was brought in from Vietnam

835
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,198
and had since been kept secretly.

836
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,993
The only place in the world
where that tree can grow…

837
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:10,828
That is

838
01:03:11,412 --> 01:03:13,164
the home of

839
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:17,418
Director Won Sang-a
and the late Mr. Park Jae-sang.

840
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,888
And you turned out to be a spy.

841
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,647
Tell me.

842
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,065
What was your goal?

843
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,905
Miners, farmers,

844
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,825
sailors, shoe repairers,

845
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,285
day laborers, bellboys…

846
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:55,122
Those were the only type of people
the General recruited.

847
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,084
Those who were just as capable

848
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,670
but were in the lowest place.

849
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:03,506
People who were exceptionally loyal

850
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,342
and willing to sacrifice themselves
for a greater cause.

851
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,889
FROM THE LOWEST AND DARKEST PLACE
TO THE HIGHEST AND BRIGHTEST PLACE

852
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,141
We were called "rice grains."

853
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,519
When the General formed a unit

854
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,814
made up of us rice grains,

855
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,192
he told us,

856
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,864
"We are stronger than anyone."

857
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:32,743
"Our strength comes from the fact
that no one knows about us."

858
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:37,665
"We are going to secretly infiltrate
Korean society like ghosts."

859
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,417
"Before we know it,

860
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,669
we will have everything."

861
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:46,048
"That's how we're going to be
the greatest and the strongest."

862
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,636
You were different
from the other members of the unit.

863
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,306
Because you were
an elementary school teacher.

864
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,609
When you live in an impoverished area,

865
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:08,571
you can witness
even the brightest children wither.

866
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,826
The General promised
to foster those children with care.

867
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:17,872
I provided children for Jeongran Society.

868
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,916
OBN NEWS REPORTER JANG MA-RI

869
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:27,590
Those children now lead this society
in their respective fields.

870
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:33,429
To have these children grow up
and spread the General's spirit…

871
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,641
That was my dream.

872
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:42,146
Today's youth will surely welcome
the General's spirit with open arms.

873
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,400
But Park Jae-sang

874
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,028
betrayed your dream.

875
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,781
He accumulated wealth and murdered people

876
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,824
for his own glory and interest.

877
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:59,121
And Director Won murders people
to keep herself entertained.

878
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:01,791
How dare they kill the General's son?

879
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,294
That is unforgivable.

880
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:07,630
You're the only person

881
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,675
who can put things straight.

882
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,054
You're the only remaining successor
of the General's spirit.

883
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,180
Of course!

884
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:20,559
That's why the General
left his memoir to me.

885
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,771
Memoir?

886
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,357
I raised all those children myself.

887
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,942
It was my duty to correct them

888
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,736
if they steered off course

889
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,364
in the name of Jeongran Society.

890
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,951
Here, we have a photo.

891
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,997
It is reported that there are only two
surviving Blue Orchids in the world.

892
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,917
But here you can see
hundreds of them hanging from a tree.

893
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,129
So is this Director Won Sang-a's home?

894
01:06:48,212 --> 01:06:50,047
Yes, that's right.

895
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:54,927
If Blue Orchids were found
at the scene of the murder,

896
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,846
they must have come

897
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:02,351
from Director Won Sang-a's home.

898
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,562
If that's true,

899
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,899
an urgent police investigation
seems necessary.

900
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,021
Did you trust me this time too?

901
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,106
I honestly thought

902
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:52,359
I had really lost you this time.

903
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,201
I'm sorry.

904
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,120
I should have held onto you better.

905
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,915
I'll never lose you again.

906
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:15,174
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
EMERGENCY ESCORT

907
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,384
Is it true that you weren't involved
in the embezzlement?

908
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,678
Were you unaware of Won Sang-a
and Jin Hwa-young's embezzlement?

909
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,931
Are you trying to put all the blame
on the late Jin Hwa-young?

910
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,224
Are you going to keep denying the charges?

911
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:26,143
Please, tell us whether you had
prior knowledge of their crime.

912
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,479
-Give us a comment!
-Do you have anything to say?

913
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:29,897
Did you know about it?

914
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,277
The final trial will determine

915
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,988
whether Oh was actively involved
in the embezzlement

916
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,075
or if she was just an innocent victim.

917
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,997
When I saw the two billion won
for the first time,

918
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:51,335
it seemed as if the money was shining.

919
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,588
WITNESS

920
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:59,093
As a person who obsesses over
supermarket reward points,

921
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,765
I couldn't bring myself
to ignore that money.

922
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:09,603
If I had ignored it,
I would have felt guilty.

923
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,483
I know that many people are
suspicious of me.

924
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,529
They think Hwa-young must have left me
a large amount of money

925
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:20,906
for a reason.

926
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,536
They believe that
I was involved in the embezzlement

927
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,997
or given that money as a reward.

928
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,377
I wondered as well

929
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,630
why she did that.

930
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:40,968
But then it dawned on me.

931
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,391
The…

932
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,936
The moment I saw that money…

933
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,108
I felt that I had found it

934
01:09:57,401 --> 01:10:00,529
as compensation for the poverty
I had experienced all my life.

935
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,948
The thrill and greed

936
01:10:03,824 --> 01:10:05,242
that I felt…

937
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,662
as I counted that money.

938
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,418
I felt that Hwa-young must have
felt the same way.

939
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,090
I think that's why
she left the money to me.

940
01:10:21,133 --> 01:10:22,927
Because we were alike.

941
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:26,347
Your Honor.

942
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,849
Please punish me

943
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,144
for the thrill and the greed
I had indulged in.

944
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:36,065
I now understand that it was wrong of me
to feel those emotions.

945
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,736
Because of that money,

946
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,530
I almost lost my life,

947
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,701
and I lost and almost ended up losing…

948
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:51,997
the people I love.

949
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,001
I also understand…

950
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,631
that the money would in no way
make up for the poverty I've been in.

951
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,510
And now…

952
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,681
I value my life

953
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,017
much more than
I value that 70 billion won.

954
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,439
The culprit Jin Hwa-young may have died.

955
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,068
But I survived.

956
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:24,280
Therefore, Your Honor,

957
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,282
please punish me

958
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,619
and those responsible
for creating that dirty money.

959
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:34,373
They used Jin Hwa-young
to launder that money

960
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,418
and killed her in the end

961
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,628
because she stole from them.

962
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,048
Please expose who they are

963
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,383
and bring them to justice.

964
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,927
-Is that Jin Hwa-young?
-That's impossible.

965
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,680
-Is that her?
-No way.

966
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:37,162
