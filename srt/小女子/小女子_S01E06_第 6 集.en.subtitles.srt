1
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,505
That day,

2
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,343
Hyo-rin's dad went to Hwa-young's place.

3
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,105
Do you still drink?

4
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,275
This is the most sober I've been
since high school.

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,527
All thanks to you.

6
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,820
How old are you again?

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,446
Twenty-nine.

8
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,116
The prime of your life will be at age 29.

9
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,618
I heard that you got fired.

10
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,497
Buckle up. It's all downhill from here.

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,583
And do see a psychiatrist.

12
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,795
By the way, Ma-ri.

13
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,466
You've received a scholarship
from Won Gi-seon since middle school.

14
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,343
Why didn't you mention that?

15
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,764
First off, you should quit
the election program.

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,267
If this gets out later,
you'll be in trouble.

17
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,186
Why would I be?

18
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,480
I got a scholarship
for getting good grades.

19
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,691
Is that bad?

20
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,158
That day, the sky was dark,
and the weather suddenly turned cold.

21
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,953
When I came home,
my mom and dad were fighting.

22
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,635
Dad left home without even looking at me.

23
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,525
He took my late grandfather's car.

24
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,070
It was odd.
I had never seen him do that before.

25
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,034
Mom?

26
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,832
Mom.

27
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,417
I was anxious.

28
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,587
It seemed like
both Mom and Dad would never return.

29
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,675
That's why I cut myself.

30
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,394
Wait just a moment, okay?

31
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,862
I clearly remember.

32
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,032
The weather and the air of that day.

33
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,914
Did you know Hwa-young died

34
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,666
on that day?

35
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,087
I don't even know who she is.

36
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,257
How can you draw something
you've never seen?

37
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,466
Maybe you saw a photo.

38
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,884
I didn't.

39
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,344
But this scene…

40
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,640
It wasn't my first time seeing it.

41
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,684
What?

42
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,893
For a long time,

43
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,896
that scene would randomly
come into my mind.

44
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,403
Just as the wind would carry
an unfamiliar scent.

45
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,613
It was faint.

46
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,953
But on that day,
it came clearer than usual.

47
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:04,721
So are you saying you saw that scene
even before Hwa-young died?

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,848
The orchid.

49
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,726
The orchid?

50
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,477
There's a secret orchid room here.

51
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,939
It's used to keep
illegal poisonous orchids.

52
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,108
I also saw something as I painted there.

53
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,029
I saw the death of that girl, In-seon.

54
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,907
So the orchid works as a hallucinogen?

55
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
Does it help see the future?

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,495
Some say you can see ghosts
if you smell it for a long time.

57
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,310
Does that orchid look like this?

58
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,611
I think so. What about you?

59
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,158
In-joo.

60
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,243
You're a lousy artist.

61
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,872
But, In-joo…

62
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,750
I don't think my dad killed her

63
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,795
just because he went there.

64
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,422
Also…

65
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,842
this dashcam footage is mine.

66
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,345
If you take it without my permission,

67
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,682
I'll kill myself.

68
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,986
Don't worry, Hyo-rin.
I understand how you feel.

69
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,365
If I need that video,
I'll make sure I get your permission.

70
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,538
It's been a tough night.

71
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,421
So let's take these and go to sleep.

72
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:16,644
Mr. Park, is it true that your father
owned real estate worth eight billion won?

73
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,105
Did you lie
about your unfortunate background?

74
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,731
Did you inherit the real estate?

75
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,693
-Do you plan on disclosing your assets?
-Please say something!

76
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,987
-Say something!
-Any words?

77
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,530
-What's your take?
-Is this true?

78
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,157
-Where is it now?
-Mr. Park!

79
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:33,327
The father of Park Jae-sang,
a candidate for the mayor of Seoul,

80
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,414
has been suspected
of illegal accumulation of wealth.

81
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:41,252
A reporter raised the suspicion
on a TV debate program this evening.

82
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,712
Park's father,

83
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,465
who's known as a Vietnam War veteran
and a victim of Agent Orange,

84
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,926
supposedly owned illegal real estate
worth eight billion won.

85
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,096
However, Park's camp did not
provide any explanation,

86
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,723
raising more suspicions.

87
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:55,600
Next story.

88
00:07:55,683 --> 00:08:00,146
Gojin Social Welfare Foundation located
in Chungcheongbuk-do has received

89
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,149
a total of 200 million won
of anonymous donations…

90
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,317
Where are you?

91
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,527
If it's true,
why didn't you cover it exclusively?

92
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,196
-Yes, why?
-Why were you fired?

93
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,447
I'm busy right now.

94
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,532
-Just say something.
-I'll call you later, Great-Aunt.

95
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,367
-Please give us a response.
-Don't hang up, In-kyung.

96
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,597
This is a certified copy of the register
for the mentioned real estate.

97
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,608
CERTIFIED COPY OF THE REGISTER

98
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,486
Feel free to report this however you like.

99
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,616
But I was dismissed by OBN as of today.

100
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,577
So do not make a mistake
when you disclose the source.

101
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,871
-Why were you fired?
-Is Park Jae-sang involved?

102
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,415
-Was there external pressure?
-Just give me an answer.

103
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,501
-Come on.
-Why were you fired?

104
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,711
-How did you know?
-What happened?

105
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,381
What do you think you're doing?

106
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,842
Did you hide it?

107
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,219
Is this why you gave her
the sleeping pills?

108
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,596
To steal that footage?

109
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,766
Hyo-rin has the right to hide it.
This concerns her dad.

110
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,268
My friend died.

111
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,771
You're covering up a murder case.
Don't you get what's more important?

112
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,107
What makes you so sure
that she was murdered?

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,861
Are the rich always assailants,
whereas the poor are victims?

114
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,825
That is nothing but
a self-centered delusion of the poor.

115
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,622
How can you…

116
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,003
Starting with
the eight o'clock news on TUBS,

117
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:32,590
every cable and online news outlet
is pumping out articles.

118
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,091
What should we do?

119
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,636
No one will hear my refutation now.

120
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,639
Give them a few days
until they're satisfied.

121
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:41,932
I'll catch up on my sleep.

122
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,435
The primaries are in five days.

123
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,228
Are you sure?

124
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,328
That brat.

125
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,672
Hello.

126
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,927
What brings you here?

127
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,390
I've always had high expectations of you.

128
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,185
I wonder why you're here today.

129
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,190
Did they follow me here?

130
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,651
You were headed somewhere
with a face that shouted out trouble.

131
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,986
Busted, right?

132
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,531
What is it today?

133
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,119
You have something there.

134
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,372
What did you bring with you?

135
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,417
Get your hands off me!

136
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,421
Oh, no.

137
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,886
My gosh. If a single fish dies,
you'll have to take responsibility!

138
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,514
She asked me to take care of them
before she died.

139
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,099
My goodness.

140
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,897
I'm sorry, Hwa-young.

141
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,070
What are you doing? Get some water.

142
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,280
Oh, sure.

143
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,744
Goodness.

144
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,213
How does it feel to have a father
who is a murderer?

145
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,633
It feels bad. Very bad.

146
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,011
Even worse than a father who is poor?

147
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,516
It's not that bad.

148
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,935
But it could get worse
depending on the situation.

149
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,021
If he gets arrested

150
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,941
or if the world finds out.

151
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,043
Hyo-rin.

152
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,128
Yes?

153
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,090
No matter what happens,

154
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,054
don't let the fact that
your dad is a murderer eat your life away.

155
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,182
Okay.

156
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,060
Then what should I do?

157
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,647
First off, don't trust anybody,

158
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,693
as if you and I are
the only ones in this world.

159
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,324
And we need to think.

160
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,454
Let's think.

161
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,854
Come in.

162
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,572
Mr. Park.

163
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,953
I said I don't want to see anyone today.

164
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,914
My great-aunt wants to meet you.

165
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,374
She has something to tell you.

166
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,960
I have nothing to discuss with her.

167
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,758
She told me to pass this on to you.

168
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,010
Once you see it,
you'll want to talk to her.

169
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,931
This was the day

170
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,393
when your father bought his first car.

171
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,229
He was thrilled like a child that day,

172
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,149
even though he rarely smiled.

173
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,652
He knew everything about cars,

174
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,405
so he'd fix broken ones easily.

175
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,284
But when he became ill,
he never went to a hospital.

176
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
He hated associating with people.

177
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,290
That's why I came.

178
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,376
I was the only one he trusted.

179
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,629
Syringe Lady.

180
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,757
You also gave me a shot when I got sick.

181
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,261
I always knew you would make it big.

182
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,513
Such a bright little child.

183
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,515
What is it that you want?

184
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,147
Ever since I ran into you at the hospital,

185
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,816
my business began to face difficulties.

186
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,320
Contracts canceled, loans declined,

187
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:55,074
intermediate payments and balances unpaid,
and lawsuits opened.

188
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,202
And don't you feign ignorance.

189
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,331
I couldn't figure out who you were,
so I did a little poking around

190
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,792
to see how you would react.

191
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,212
I'm here to negotiate.

192
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,090
This time, In-kyung was in the wrong.

193
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,635
She's acting like that
because she's clueless.

194
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,137
Let's call it even now.

195
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,933
You and I both need to live.
Otherwise, we'll both die.

196
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,435
At this age,

197
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,979
there's nothing I'm afraid of.

198
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,528
What I still don't understand is this.

199
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,072
If you were a close associate
of this family,

200
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,783
you couldn't have
parted ways with them alive.

201
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,201
How did you manage to do it?

202
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,831
And why do I not know anything about you?

203
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,418
You don't know anything about me

204
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,630
because I was closer to the General
than you were to him.

205
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,133
I'm still alive to this day

206
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,552
because the General
wanted to keep me alive.

207
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,556
Because I'm the one who saved his life.

208
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Right.

209
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,981
Did you know?

210
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,652
Your father called me
the day before he passed away.

211
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,114
Why?

212
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,159
He asked me to bring him
a strong antidiarrheal drug.

213
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,663
He had bowel problems when he got nervous.

214
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,333
That's how I knew

215
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,128
that there would be trouble soon.

216
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,799
But I didn't think he would pass away.

217
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,521
He didn't want to be found
in soiled pants.

218
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,275
That was utterly unnecessary.

219
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,320
Ms. Go is already dying to get rid of you.

220
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,242
Park Jae-sang was the one
who killed Hwa-young.

221
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,787
I saw dashcam footage of him
visiting her place that night.

222
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,082
And? It's not like you didn't know
the kind of person Park Jae-sang is.

223
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,750
Why do you act shocked?

224
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,880
Think rationally.
That can't be used as evidence of murder.

225
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,091
You can't do a thing with that.

226
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:02,261
I saw something in the video.
I wanted to check something.

227
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,012
Can't I do that much?

228
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,847
Once I leave for Singapore,

229
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:11,228
what happened on the day of her death
will be covered up forever.

230
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,817
What did you check?

231
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,571
The town elder.

232
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,449
I wasn't home that day,

233
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:27,077
-so I didn't see anything.
-He said he wasn't home that day.

234
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,872
Someone stole it a few days ago.
Just the dashcam.

235
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,167
Someone came
and destroyed all the evidence.

236
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,211
I wanted to know who that was.

237
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,215
I wanted to see who comes running over
when I go to Hwa-young's place.

238
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,597
Did you think it could have been me?

239
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,349
Is that why you didn't tell me?

240
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,646
To be honest,

241
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:59,693
I've been scared of you
ever since I saw this.

242
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,822
You said you could do anything for money,

243
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,785
but I didn't think you would
sacrifice your girlfriend for business.

244
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,463
When I asked Mazatlán's local paper
to release this article,

245
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,383
I hoped people would believe
that Ms. Hwang Bo-ra was dead.

246
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,679
But now that you say you believed it,

247
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,599
why am I rather disappointed?

248
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,456
Is this…

249
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,710
Ms. Hwang Bo-ra?

250
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,337
She seems happy, right?

251
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,090
I check in to see if she's doing well.

252
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,051
I changed her identity
and helped her escape forever.

253
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,637
She was my first client.

254
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,771
Are you free later today?

255
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,440
I'd like to go somewhere with you.

256
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,285
I received a question
from a reporter yesterday,

257
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,496
asking if it was true

258
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,166
that my father had owned real estate
worth around eight billion won.

259
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,712
My response is as follows.

260
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,511
It's true.

261
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,306
However, there were a few things
the reporter missed.

262
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,979
His assets before he passed in 2013
didn't amount to 8 billion won.

263
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,648
They amounted to
a total of 20 billion won.

264
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,403
This is my father in 2013.

265
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,242
He was a private chauffeur of 40 years
for General Won Gi-seon,

266
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,453
raising his only son
in a one-room residence.

267
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,707
Things didn't change
even after he passed away,

268
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,042
leaving 20 billion won of real estate.

269
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,045
I did not know anything about his assets.

270
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,091
Can you imagine how shocked I was

271
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,676
as I settled his assets?

272
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,096
Then it came to my mind.

273
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:37,934
My father-in-law, General Won Gi-seon,
who suffered a stroke that year,

274
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:41,730
could have been keeping his assets
under my father's name.

275
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,440
We investigated,

276
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,067
and it was true.

277
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,614
My wife and I had a long discussion.

278
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,949
The faults of our fathers.

279
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,703
This long, dark,
and distorted relationship.

280
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,830
Can we expose this to the world

281
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,041
and apologize?

282
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,044
I'm ashamed to say

283
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,087
that we couldn't.

284
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,632
My father passed away,

285
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,926
and my father-in-law is in bed
due to a coma.

286
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,386
As their children,
we couldn't expose them.

287
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,138
"FOUND TO BE FATHER-IN-LAW'S ASSETS"

288
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,348
Looking back at it now,

289
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,725
although it would have been
excruciatingly painful…

290
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,143
What's she doing there?

291
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,520
…I should have asked for forgiveness.

292
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,983
However, we decided to use

293
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,070
every single penny to open up a new era.

294
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,907
My wife and I operate
a total of four foundations,

295
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,325
worth a total of 38 billion won.

296
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,079
During a given year,
we provide scholarships to 1,000 students.

297
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,580
PARK JAE-SANG FOUNDATION

298
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,832
LIST OF SCHOLARSHIP STUDENTS

299
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,835
Kim Yu-taek, mathematician.
Seol Min-su, space engineer.

300
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,922
Park Chang-il, pianist.
Moon Do-hyeong, architect.

301
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,717
Kang Chan-hui, swimmer.
Kim Hyeok, taekwondo athlete.

302
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,721
And countless people on
the list of scholarship students continue

303
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,183
to bring honor to Park Jae-sang Foundation
since the Wonryeong Foundation days.

304
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,743
Ex-reporter Oh In-kyung, who exposed
the suspicion of your father's assets,

305
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,203
has a sister who received support

306
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,833
from your foundation through scholarships
and medical treatment.

307
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,126
Is this true?

308
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,969
I have no comment on that.

309
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,270
"THE MONEY WILL BE USED AS SCHOLARSHIP"

310
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:49,899
The key business of our foundation is
to support our future talents.

311
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,236
The four scholarship foundations
each have a specialty…

312
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,031
What's going on?
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

313
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,908
You could've given me a heads-up.

314
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,457
Ms. Oh, did you ever think about why
you have the 70 billion in your account?

315
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,375
How would I know?

316
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,336
It was his campaign fund.

317
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,631
The fund was to come in from abroad
at the time of his campaign,

318
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,133
but Hwa-young snatched it.

319
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,679
I'm going to Singapore soon
because the election is going well.

320
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,140
Our 70-billion deal with the ledger
would only work

321
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,309
as long as his election goes well.

322
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,937
We can only make the deal
if the damage that ledger can cause

323
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,481
is larger than 70 billion won.

324
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,488
So to get that 70 billion won,

325
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,199
I should keep my mouth shut

326
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,578
about Hwa-young's death and my sisters?

327
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,041
I would put it this way.

328
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,544
To make sure Hwa-young's death
wasn't in vain,

329
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,215
the only thing you can do
is finish what she started.

330
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,054
In order to do that, you should put up
with small inconveniences.

331
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,515
Gosh.

332
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,810
Money must really be
the only thing you care about.

333
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,813
I told you so.

334
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,359
"WILL GLADLY ACCEPT
CRITICISMS AND CONCERNS"

335
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,736
Great-Aunt.

336
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,863
Go and get In-kyung right now.

337
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,076
In-hye.

338
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,413
In-hye!

339
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,218
In-hye.

340
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,321
Didn't you know he established
the foundation with that money?

341
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,322
Didn't you do your research?

342
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,491
Did you agree to your sister accepting
the scholarship?

343
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,327
Do you approve of the foundation
established with borrowed-name assets?

344
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,704
If you don't,
will you return the scholarship?

345
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,248
-What's your plan?
-Why didn't you research further?

346
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,886
This is the end.

347
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,974
Once you accept your defeat,
they won't mess with you anymore.

348
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,229
If you can swallow humiliation,
it's good for you.

349
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,524
You can stay crouched for the moment,
then rise back up.

350
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,319
If I hadn't exposed it in a rush,
I would have figured out

351
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,280
that the real estate was used
to fund the foundation.

352
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,157
It's all right.

353
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,868
People forget easily.

354
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,453
But you know…

355
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:37,335
I got Park Il-bok's property registration
from the archives of your company.

356
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:54,269
I found the files going back to the 70s
when you were in real estate speculation.

357
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,354
Mr. Park's properties

358
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,983
were bought and sold with you at his side.

359
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,701
What's your relationship
with those people, Great-Aunt?

360
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,162
You know who they are, don't you?

361
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,792
Please tell me.

362
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,674
They are people who can ruin

363
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,051
the company I've built for years
in one fell swoop.

364
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,390
They are people who can make you three
disappear off the face of the earth.

365
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,186
They are the people who are everywhere
from the lowest to the highest places.

366
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,355
So I can't tell you.

367
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,066
I must protect my company,

368
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,154
and I do not want to see you
fall in danger.

369
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,159
Then tell me just one thing.

370
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,163
How did you become rich?

371
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,249
How did every piece of land you bought
in the 70s and 80s

372
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,877
end up with apartment complexes, roads,

373
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,712
and industrial complexes?

374
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,090
Those were the good days.

375
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,510
I had adequate information,
and I happened to have money.

376
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,597
I was always a step ahead
of everyone else.

377
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,683
In 1988,

378
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,602
there was an interesting article

379
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,313
on the land you bought
with Mr. Park Il-bok in Seocho-dong.

380
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,860
"Go Ju-won, a military officer
under investigation for land speculation

381
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,364
by using inside information from
the Ministry of National Defense, died."

382
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,408
"On the first, the prosecution said
that Go died in a car accident

383
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,744
while returning home
from his questioning."

384
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,289
"Go obtained information that
over 20,000 pyeong of the military zone

385
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,541
in Seocho-dong, Seoul,
will be made available to civilians."

386
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,670
"He then passed this information
to eight acquaintances."

387
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,762
If a Korean could go back 50 years
in a time machine,

388
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,225
what do you think they'd do first?

389
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,436
Buy land in Gangnam.

390
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:05,358
I believe anyone in their sound mind

391
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,652
would have done as I have.

392
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,740
Was I fired from my job

393
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,368
because of you?

394
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:21,082
I only wanted you to stay alive.

395
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,716
I wanted to like you.

396
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,718
When I saw shooting stars,

397
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,095
I held up a candle during boot camp

398
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,390
and wished on a star
that you wouldn't be a bad person.

399
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,851
-But you always--
-I was born in Korea

400
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,061
in the 40s as a woman.

401
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,814
I never got educated,
was married against my will,

402
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,941
and even ended up a divorcée.

403
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,279
If I wanted to complain about my life,
I could've done so and more.

404
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,951
But I figured that's just how life was.

405
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:02,081
If I hadn't been "a bad person"
just as your tiny head wished,

406
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,625
I would be dead already.

407
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,885
Anyway, this is the only thing
I want to say to you.

408
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,764
You need to stop here.

409
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,558
Otherwise, my company will go down.

410
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,477
Do you understand?

411
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,400
You two should stay here for a while.

412
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,529
I'll tell my security company
to give you top-notch security.

413
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:37,283
I don't have many days to live.
So at least let me sleep in peace.

414
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,708
In-kyung.

415
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,591
In-kyung!

416
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,970
Do you think so too?

417
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,764
That I should be the one to stop?

418
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,558
You know what those people did.

419
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,393
Your friend died like that.

420
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,937
I know, In-kyung.

421
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,607
I understand you better than anyone.

422
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,818
But I'm also your sister.

423
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,611
I worry about you more than anyone.

424
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,113
She has a point.

425
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,199
Let's tread a little carefully.

426
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,701
Let's stop for a while,
see how things go and--

427
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,953
That's really weird.

428
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,540
The In-joo I know

429
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,626
isn't someone who treads carefully.

430
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,931
Yesterday evening,
Park Jae-sang of the Civil Party,

431
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,474
a preliminary candidate
for the mayor of Seoul,

432
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,978
disclosed that the foundation
was found using his father's slush fund.

433
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:52,066
After this, many citizens lined up
to donate to Park Jae-sang Foundation.

434
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,526
I could relate to it.

435
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,654
Back in my day, everyone lived like that.

436
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,531
That's why I want to give more.

437
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,616
You began to lead by over five percent

438
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,786
in preference, awareness,
and approval ratings.

439
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,787
He'll make it.

440
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
The situation seems the most ideal.

441
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:10,793
The leader doesn't call for the masses.
It's the masses who call for a leader.

442
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,381
Go to Singapore within the month.
We'll need lots of cash.

443
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,842
Yes, sir.

444
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,803
I'm grateful for Ms. Oh In-kyung.

445
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,724
Thanks to her, he rose up dramatically.

446
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,810
He broke through in great timing,
garnering favorable attention.

447
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,771
She's the best among our resources.

448
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,065
She has done so much for us thus far.

449
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,776
It's time for her to make her exit.

450
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,570
I've prepared a few scenarios.

451
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,948
She's an alcoholic,
so it's easy to come up with a story.

452
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,325
Even if she slips and falls,

453
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,577
I just need to increase
her blood alcohol level.

454
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,912
Okay.

455
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,623
Oh, right.

456
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,293
Ms. Oh In-kyung is a problem,
but I'm concerned about Ms. Oh In-joo too.

457
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,671
Shouldn't we eliminate someone
who is potentially dangerous?

458
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,591
What about Ms. Oh In-joo?

459
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,469
Two nights ago,
she went to Jin Hwa-young's place

460
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,012
and showed suspicious behavior.

461
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,514
What did she do?

462
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:10,770
She suddenly brought out a fishbowl…

463
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
That's not what's important.

464
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,238
The biggest problem is
that she's unpredictable.

465
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:25,368
Are you saying we should do away with her
because of some fish?

466
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,705
Ms. Oh works for me.

467
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,499
I'll deal with her.

468
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,005
I'm in charge of her.

469
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
I work with her regarding Ms. Jin.

470
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,885
I'll make sure she doesn't cause trouble.

471
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,013
Okay, then.

472
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,016
You'll manage.

473
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,478
Then it's settled.

474
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,742
However, there were a few things
the reporter missed.

475
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,163
His assets before he passed in 2013
didn't amount to 8 billion won.

476
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,041
They amounted to
a total of 20 billion won.

477
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,084
PARK'S FATHER'S REAL ESTATE
WORTH 20 BILLION WON

478
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,508
"Gyeonggi-do, Palcheon-si,

479
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,554
Seo-gu, 72 Sam-dong."

480
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,098
"Gyeonggi-do."

481
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,684
"Musim-gun."

482
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,477
"Noma-myeon."

483
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,896
"Gimtan-ri…"

484
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,904
Go to 26 Gimtan-ri, Noma-myeon,
Musim-gun, Gyeonggi-do.

485
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,781
Begin your coverage from there.

486
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,140
CHAIRWOMAN OH HYE-SEOK

487
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,503
The Chairwoman told me
to shred the old files.

488
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,715
I'm good at simple tasks.

489
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,718
I just need to finish
the ones from the safe.

490
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,429
Wait!

491
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,682
What is it, Director Oh?

492
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,358
Yes, okay.

493
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,987
You're lying about
being in a fling with her.

494
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,781
I'm not an idiot who'd believe that.

495
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,286
Is Ms. Won involved?

496
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,956
Are the three of you
creating a slush fund?

497
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,542
You are.

498
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,710
I knew things were suspicious
with Jin Hwa-young too.

499
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,214
Why do you think I'm lying?

500
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,553
It's ridiculous enough
to picture you dating someone,

501
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,471
but if you were actually seeing someone,

502
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,974
it would be an heiress who has
around 70 billion won to her name.

503
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,226
The only thing you care about is money.

504
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,353
You wouldn't date a poor divorcée.

505
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,315
You have such great insight, Ms. Go.

506
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,483
This is a warning.

507
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,736
Even if Ms. Won is involved,
if this harms Mr. Park,

508
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,155
I won't condone this.

509
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,533
Tell Ms. Oh In-joo to watch out.

510
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,539
I didn't tell Mr. Park

511
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,833
about your recent mishap.

512
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,002
He may have really gotten rid of you.

513
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,797
One piece of advice.

514
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,384
If you do that again,
I won't condone it either.

515
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,180
He shouldn't get into politics
with some thug.

516
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,104
A polling organization

517
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,025
announced the current approval rating
for Seoul mayoral candidates.

518
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:30,029
Park Jae-sang's ratings rose
by 16 percent to 40.5 percent,

519
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:34,575
taking the lead by five percent
against Assemblyman Han.

520
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,453
It's an unprecedented change.

521
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,956
You're right. After the recent issue
with Candidate Park,

522
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,461
the party expected his ratings to drop.

523
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,255
But when they began to rise,
the support for Candidate Park…

524
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
This is my father.

525
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,594
Hello, sir.

526
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,680
I came to show him the news.

527
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,267
That the son of a chauffeur he picked up

528
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:03,771
is about to become a mayoral candidate.

529
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,733
I see.

530
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,862
Ms. Oh, I need you to go
to Singapore next week.

531
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,948
Sorry?

532
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,283
I wanted to be
at the Orchid Festival this year.

533
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:20,079
SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE
APPROVAL RATINGS

534
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,705
I was right, wasn't I?

535
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,249
He'll really make it.

536
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:28,587
Can you go on my behalf?

537
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,175
Is this something Hwa-young used to do?

538
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:39,640
Before my father collapsed,
all he gave me was

539
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,684
the orchids.

540
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,353
Why did he leave me only these?

541
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,106
He loved me the most in this world.

542
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,276
It seemed completely absurd.

543
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:56,323
I realized as I bought and sold orchids
in Singapore every year

544
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,660
that this held infinite possibilities.

545
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,540
People usually evade taxes, embezzle,
and launder money through artworks.

546
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,001
But artworks draw attention.

547
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,045
You must register the piece
and report the transaction.

548
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,882
But the shape and size of orchids change,

549
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,218
and personal trades are concealed.

550
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,597
I always made my bids
anonymously over the phone.

551
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,100
Hwa-young went to the auction for me.

552
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,438
The International Orchid Society
in Singapore

553
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,732
shared similar interests with us.

554
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,902
We raised the highest bid
by several times over many years.

555
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,946
Now, the top one percent
of the world's wealthiest people

556
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,532
fly over to Singapore
to invest in orchids.

557
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,452
Hwa-young and I started it.

558
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:49,460
That's how Hwa-young
became used to large amounts of money.

559
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:57,009
She was intoxicated with the process.
She must have felt omnipotent.

560
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,845
Money tends to do that to people.

561
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,519
I still don't get it.

562
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,315
Hwa-young betrayed you like that,

563
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,859
so why would you entrust me with this?

564
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,113
Hwa-young and you are very different.

565
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:22,409
Hwa-young didn't have anyone,
but you have your sisters.

566
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,497
If you have someone you love,
you can't do anything that reckless.

567
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,794
Hwa-young changed
after her mother passed away.

568
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,885
What was your childhood dream?

569
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,267
Marrying a rich man.

570
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,147
One of your sisters is a reporter,

571
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,441
and the other wants to be a painter.

572
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,986
But you wanted to become rich
through someone else's money?

573
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,784
I wasn't good at anything.

574
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,995
I was just popular with men.

575
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,468
Take this.

576
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,316
This is…

577
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,653
An orchid called Blue Ghost.

578
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,783
Open the lid and keep it by your bed
when you go to sleep.

579
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,035
It'll bloom…

580
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,538
tonight.

581
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,127
This orchid has power.

582
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,796
If you smell it all night,

583
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,301
you'll be able to see
what you really want.

584
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,099
Let's talk again
once we can both be honest.

585
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,064
By the way, I don't believe what you said.

586
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,442
If you could,

587
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,986
I'm sure you'd also want to
make it on your own.

588
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,115
If that's the case,
you'll have to go to Singapore.

589
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,162
What can I gain if I go there?

590
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,708
Ten percent of what you make there.

591
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,544
And some extra.

592
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,342
It doesn't sound like enough
to make me rich.

593
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:48,472
My husband will become the president
after his term as the mayor of Seoul.

594
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:52,643
Do you think it was my dream
to marry a powerful man?

595
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:56,271
Is that why I do volunteer work
making kimchi and delivering briquettes?

596
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,024
I have a plan of my own.

597
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,861
There's an amazing privilege

598
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,489
that comes with the mayorship of Seoul.

599
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,701
If you do a good job in Singapore,

600
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,037
I'll put this orchid

601
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,998
on the Father Tree.

602
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,461
"The Father Tree"?

603
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,298
This orchid cannot live long
away from the Father Tree.

604
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,093
That's the only place where it can get

605
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,471
the microorganisms
and mold it needs to survive.

606
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,641
That means

607
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:37,020
we'll be looking after
the orchid of your dreams.

608
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,524
And that you're with us, Ms. Oh.

609
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,527
"Us"?

610
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,030
The International Orchid Society.

611
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,616
Or simply,

612
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:51,910
"Jeongran Society,"

613
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,622
as we like to call ourselves.

614
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,438
DIRECTOR OH IN-KYUNG

615
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,643
MARCH 5TH, 1973, JEONGRAN SOCIETY

616
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,814
MARCH 5TH, 1973, JEONGRAN SOCIETY

617
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,692
"Jeongran Society."

618
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,238
Hyo-rin.

619
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,325
Yes?

620
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,118
In my opinion,

621
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,955
something will definitely happen
in the future.

622
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,167
Something will surely happen.

623
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,379
That's why we must be ready.

624
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,051
What do you think will happen?

625
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,017
Close your eyes and take a breath.

626
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,144
A deep breath.

627
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,946
Can you smell the orchids?

628
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,615
Yes.

629
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,826
Breathe even deeper.

630
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,289
Deep into your lungs.

631
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,294
And focus.

632
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,968
Where did you see it?

633
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,803
What?

634
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,974
The woman who hung herself in red heels.

635
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,773
-I don't know.
-Hyo-rin, you need to focus.

636
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,568
The scent of the orchid
reminded you of that scene.

637
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,070
It must be somewhere in your head.

638
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,072
You must find the way that leads to it.

639
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,782
You're the only one who can do it.

640
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,785
You have to remember why it popped up,

641
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,371
and what actually happened.

642
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,123
That way, we'll have power.

643
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,223
Mr. Choi.

644
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,557
Can we meet for a second?

645
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,184
I'm tired.

646
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,268
It won't take long.

647
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,854
I got off work and came home.

648
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,189
Let's talk tomorrow.

649
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,385
Ms. Oh.

650
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,559
Did you follow me?

651
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,769
Did Hyo-rin's mother
tell you to go to Singapore?

652
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,606
What did you tell her?

653
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,360
I said I'll think about it.

654
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,321
Give me that.

655
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,407
Goodness. Why?

656
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,576
It's mine. Why should I give it to you?

657
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:52,252
Do you know something about the orchid?

658
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,880
Holding onto this can be dangerous.

659
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,551
I won't do everything

660
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,263
as you say, Mr. Choi.

661
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,057
Even if it's just for a night,
I still want to think about it.

662
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,185
I want to know what I really want.

663
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,984
CERTIFIED COPY OF THE REGISTER

664
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,545
Total area…

665
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,673
is 130,000 pyeong.

666
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,511
WONRYEONG SCHOOL

667
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,305
Wonryeong School is
the only building here.

668
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,270
Former owners are…

669
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:16,980
OWNERS

670
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,774
"Won Gi-seon. Park Il-bok."

671
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,818
"Go Ju-won. Kim Dal-su."

672
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,403
KIM DAL-SU

673
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,320
Wait.

674
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,407
Kim Dal-su?

675
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,035
Bobae Savings Bank.

676
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,506
Jong-ho. I'm sorry, but can you come over?

677
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,176
I found something weird.

678
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:56,644
Great-Aunt.

679
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,730
Yes?

680
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,440
I have something to tell you.

681
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,704
Sang-hyeok, we'll have
two glasses of egg liqueur.

682
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,506
Go ahead.

683
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,383
You said

684
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,886
we choose to be rich.

685
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,805
But Great-Aunt,

686
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,891
how did you choose to be rich

687
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,186
as you watched people die?

688
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,942
What's going on?

689
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:45,485
CERTIFIED COPY OF THE REGISTER

690
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,112
These are co-owners

691
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,864
of the 130,000 pyeong land.

692
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:56,287
General Won Gi-seon.
Park Jae-sang's father, Park Il-bok.

693
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,039
The principal of Wonryeong School,
Jang Sa-pyeong.

694
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,668
Go Ju-won, a military officer.
Kim Dal-su of Bobae Savings Bank.

695
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,379
Lastly…

696
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,548
my great-aunt.

697
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:11,094
How are these people connected?

698
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,266
There's a photo of them together.

699
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:23,148
There's a date.
I think it's when they bought this land.

700
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,236
MARCH 5TH, 1973, JEONGRAN SOCIETY

701
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,324
No.

702
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,952
Park Jae-sang is too dangerous.

703
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,371
But you said so yourself.

704
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,957
I have to put myself at risk
to make big money.

705
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:44,544
How can I become rich
without this much risk?

706
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:46,921
Seventy billion won is too big.

707
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,216
In order to handle that,
you must abandon the life you've lived

708
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,010
and become a completely different person.

709
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,221
-Can you do that?
-Why not?

710
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,474
It's not like I have anything in my life.

711
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,184
I can lose it any day.

712
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,769
There's nothing more frightening

713
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,397
than being born poor
and staying poor until the end.

714
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,859
Then what's the problem?

715
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:10,904
I…

716
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,906
saw everything.

717
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,701
I saw Hwa-young's death

718
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,245
and Park Jae-sang visiting her.

719
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,206
After witnessing all that,

720
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,166
I can't live with seeing that man

721
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,877
become the mayor of Seoul
and the president.

722
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,712
You said it yourself.

723
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,256
It's a matter of choice.

724
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,800
You can't help it
if you want the 70 billion.

725
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,677
But is that really the case?

726
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,306
Can't we just take down
those people all at once?

727
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,686
What do you mean?

728
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,064
You know something, don't you?

729
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,858
Is it about Park Jae-sang's father?

730
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,903
That man wouldn't have let you
come to his house

731
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,113
just to share his childhood memories.

732
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,118
There are other secrets, right?

733
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,498
"Sim Jae-seung,
the director of Seonjin Welfare Center."

734
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,670
"Jang Woon-seong,
the CEO of Jangwoon Development."

735
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,968
"Shin Hyeon-min,
the finance director of Orchid E&C."

736
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,720
SHIN HYEON-MIN

737
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,305
CAR ACCIDENT,
FINANCE DIRECTOR, ORCHID E&C

738
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,062
You know what?

739
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,442
The people I just called out for you.

740
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,902
They're all dead.

741
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,697
What?

742
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,702
Most of these people are dead too.

743
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,372
Those who join Jeongran Society

744
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,458
tend to die earlier
than the average life expectancy.

745
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,797
Who is still alive then?

746
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,260
General Won Gi-seon.

747
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,554
Principal Jang Sa-pyeong.

748
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,348
And Choi Hee-jae,
someone who went missing long ago.

749
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,517
Lastly…

750
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,020
your great-aunt.

751
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,273
ALIVE

752
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,442
OH HYE-SEOK

753
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:18,489
Even if I do know something,
it's all ancient history.

754
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,785
You can't bring them down with that.
It's not like there's solid evidence.

755
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,203
I have a ledger.

756
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:28,583
It contains every single item
of the slush fund for the last 25 years.

757
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,919
A ledger marks the beginning
and the end of everything.

758
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,214
If we use the incidents you know
with the things I know,

759
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,175
we can cause a nuclear explosion.

760
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:41,012
This could become
the biggest business of your life.

761
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:44,057
Let's get rid of them quickly,
at once, and for good,

762
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,559
and keep all their money.

763
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,567
What is it that you know?

764
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,656
It's easy to figure out
how these people died.

765
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,908
Their names are all over the news.

766
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,411
Three people are involved
with the savings bank.

767
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,538
Private school corruption,
land speculation,

768
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,874
demolition service,
correctional facilities…

769
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,920
This is a digest of modern Korean history
through the 70s and 80s.

770
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,757
What on earth is this Jeongran Society?

771
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,552
It must have something to do with orchids.

772
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,887
MARCH 5TH, 1973, JEONGRAN SOCIETY

773
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,057
A group of people
who study the spirit of orchids?

774
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,896
It's that orchid.

775
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,315
The Ghost of Vietnam.

776
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:41,489
I found an orchid in Hwa-young's room.

777
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,283
It was also at the scene
of Director Shin Hyeon-min's accident,

778
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,286
as well as the incidents
In-kyung was investigating.

779
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,835
And this was painted
by Park Jae-sang's daughter.

780
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:58,798
At first,

781
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,801
I thought she painted Hwa-young's death.

782
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,302
It's a mirror image of it.

783
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,972
What's odd is that

784
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:10,143
she never knew Hwa-young
and never saw this scene.

785
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,728
But…

786
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,569
Do you see that?

787
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,450
It's the orchid.

788
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,204
All of the deaths are connected
by this orchid.

789
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,795
Great-Aunt.

790
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,506
Do you know anything about this orchid?

791
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,099
The group of people…

792
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,065
The group of people
who received this orchid

793
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,777
is called "Jeongran Society."

794
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:03,738
Jeongran…

795
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,128
You must be sleepy.

796
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,256
Let's call it a day.
Why don't we talk tomorrow?

797
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,841
No, Great-Aunt.

798
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,218
I'm just a bit tired.

799
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:26,302
Well, I'm exhausted.

800
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,659
You know what?

801
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,872
You and I have a lot in common.

802
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,212
We were both born into poor families.

803
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,756
We both didn't study well.

804
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,634
We both got divorced.

805
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,387
You were born poor…

806
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:37,808
and will die poor.

807
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:47,652
If you don't,

808
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,533
someone else will die.

809
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,131
I remembered.

810
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,217
I can see stairs.

811
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:56,178
Stairs that lead up.

812
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,610
Are you going up the stairs?

813
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:14,864
Where do they lead to?

814
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,450
They…

815
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,098
lead me to the sky.

816
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,753
I found it.

817
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:12,713
This is the place.

818
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,843
Are you sure this is it?

819
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,014
Yes. I used to come up here alone
when I was a kid.

820
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,518
When I got bored, sad, and when it rained.

821
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,229
I often fell asleep playing up there.

822
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:41,992
Girls!

823
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:48,332
What are you doing in the dark?

824
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,591
"In-kyung."

825
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,098
"In-kyung."

826
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:41,677
Great-Aunt, I'm here.

827
01:11:09,181 --> 01:11:12,059
WONRYEONG SCHOOL
26 NOMA-GIL

828
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,542
The Chairwoman's death
has nothing to do with that orchid.

829
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,253
Be upset with me for once.

830
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,213
Don't you see
that I'm upset with you, Mr. Choi?

831
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,174
From now on, your life will be in danger.

832
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,344
"The room that I locked myself up in
a long time ago."

833
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:51,140
She said I could join their group
if I received the orchid.

834
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:54,226
Come to think of it, there's no door.

835
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,186
Why did you put a tail on me?

836
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,688
Are you unable to trust me?

837
01:11:57,771 --> 01:11:59,690
I have 70 billion won in Singapore.

838
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:01,817
We should go to Singapore with In-hye.

839
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,695
If you do that, you'll end up dead too.

840
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,364
Get rid of Ms. Oh In-joo.

841
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:12,995
