1
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,512
Noodles with yeolmu kimchi?

2
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,848
Why didn't you throw the kimchi out
like I told you to?

3
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,933
I forgot.

4
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,646
It's annoyingly ripe and delicious.

5
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,113
It's good.

6
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,115
Should we chuck it after today?

7
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,699
Let's do that.

8
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
I don't want to keep craving it.

9
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,383
-In-joo.
-Yes?

10
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,304
I was suspended today.

11
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,222
For a month.

12
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,683
Why?

13
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,102
Because I drank on the job.

14
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,232
I think I'm an alcoholic.

15
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,734
What?

16
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,405
Then how come I didn't know?

17
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,950
I didn't want you to know.

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,286
Why not?

19
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,956
You and I know
that our dad is an alcoholic.

20
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,417
That's why we were so miserable.

21
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,338
Do I…

22
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,383
take after Dad?

23
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,720
You don't take after him.

24
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,598
He's indecisive and weak-hearted,

25
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,975
but you know exactly what you want.

26
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,269
And your heart isn't just strong.
It's hardened.

27
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,522
What do you mean by a hardened heart?

28
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,232
You're cold…

29
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,193
and full of yourself.

30
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,085
And do you think I'll let you
end up becoming an alcoholic?

31
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,055
Tell me if you need anything!

32
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,389
I'll do everything to help!

33
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,068
We should definitely
throw out this kimchi.

34
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,571
It's annoyingly good, right?

35
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,926
Do I really look like that?

36
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,886
It looks like my mom.

37
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,554
I like your nose.

38
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,181
It's like your mom's.

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,100
Really?

40
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:31,271
I got my nose done before taking
my middle school graduation photos.

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,109
Did your mom get a nose job too?

42
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,777
She was born with that nose.

43
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,363
Sadly, I look like my uncle.

44
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,824
Who do you take after?

45
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,868
Nobody.

46
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,083
I really love your paintings.

47
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,544
It's like listening to an old story.

48
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,921
I painted it in Van Dyck's style.

49
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,883
I wanted to portray the bloodline
of a distinguished noble family.

50
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,969
Do I seem noble?

51
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,055
Your mom and dad are nobles.

52
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,749
A billion and 970 million won.
A billion and 975 million won.

53
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,294
A billion and 980 million won.
A billion and 985 million won.

54
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:40,089
A billion and 990 million won.
A billion and 995 million won.

55
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,008
Two billion won.

56
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:49,474
You asked me what I wanted to do
if I had crazy amounts of money.

57
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,413
I don't know, Hwa-young.

58
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,707
I really don't know.

59
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,256
BUY 1, GET 1 FREE!

60
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,492
That'll be 98,800 won.

61
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,663
Here you go.

62
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,914
Thank you.

63
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,292
Cash receipt, please.

64
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,677
What I do know for sure is that

65
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,599
I would never kill myself
if I had that much money.

66
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,814
Does that mean…

67
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,817
she didn't

68
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,111
actually kill herself?

69
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,662
Don't reporters usually start drinking
in the afternoon?

70
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,541
You have a drink over lunch
with your source.

71
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,543
Then you have another drink at sunset.

72
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,378
Then at night…

73
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,379
Bomb shots.

74
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,507
I didn't simply just have a drink.

75
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,386
I checked my blood alcohol level
at 4 p.m. that afternoon.

76
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,679
It was at 0.08 percent.

77
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,307
A senior colleague reported me
to the police,

78
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,100
so I lost my driver's license too.

79
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,562
My father began the day
with a bowl full of makgeolli.

80
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,065
I also had a glass of whiskey before work
every morning back in the States.

81
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,320
But you were a nurse.

82
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,906
That wasn't a problem 40 years ago,

83
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,949
as long as I did my job perfectly.

84
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,952
I couldn't do my job perfectly.

85
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,163
I couldn't ask impolite questions
to strangers,

86
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,874
look straight into the camera
without blinking,

87
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,211
or become indifferent
to gruesome incidents.

88
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,506
I was always nervous and anxious.

89
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,257
I drank every time I was anxious.

90
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,218
By night, I found
I had emptied a bottle of tequila.

91
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,221
Stop working as a reporter.

92
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,976
You already know that
I never wanted to be a reporter.

93
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,896
You wanted to go abroad
and study something useless.

94
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,274
You refused to give me a loan
for the tuition, so I gave up.

95
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,777
I refused to give up your money, not mine.

96
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,697
That money was in
a bank account under your name.

97
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,033
It wasn't my money.

98
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,579
You put the first
five million won into the account.

99
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,333
And you taught a 12-year-old kid

100
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,085
how to trade stocks.

101
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,963
You were the one

102
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,924
who turned the 5 million won
into 70 million over 10 years.

103
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:13,678
I've never seen anybody
who trades stocks as easily as you did.

104
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,222
I just did it.
I wasn't trying to be good at it.

105
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,602
I wanted to stop you
from wasting your time studying.

106
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,313
What was it you wanted to study?

107
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,440
Economics.

108
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:31,445
I wanted to know why some are poor
while others are rich.

109
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,697
It's useless.

110
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,576
If you continued to invest,
you would've found out naturally.

111
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,035
But you became a reporter.

112
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,581
Now, you listen to me nag over breakfast
just for a petty 1.25 million won.

113
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,336
I've been wondering.

114
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,131
I eat breakfast here
to make 1.25 million won.

115
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,968
But why would you spend 1.25 million won
just to have breakfast with me?

116
00:09:58,806 --> 00:09:59,807
Are you afraid

117
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,101
you'll be alone until you die?

118
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,483
I know I hurt you.

119
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,110
But I was hurt too.

120
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,363
I made you an offer
to come work for me after you graduated.

121
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,034
But you never gave it
serious consideration.

122
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,996
Do you think I invested in you
without any purpose?

123
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,168
You're suspended anyway,
so come by my office.

124
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:32,048
I'll make sure to show you
how one becomes rich in Korea.

125
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,640
You made a wise decision.

126
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,226
That's what's best for yourself
and the company.

127
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,730
You already know every company
in Korea keeps a slush fund.

128
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,149
What do I have to do?

129
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,443
I don't know anything
regarding that matter.

130
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,363
We are looking for two things.

131
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,282
The 70 billion won Ms. Jin embezzled
and the slush fund ledger.

132
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,910
We have experts who will track those down,

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,871
but to do their job,
they need to know a lot about her.

134
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,831
Think of yourself as that thieving bitch,

135
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,084
and think about where
you would hide the money

136
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,754
and what you would do with the ledger.

137
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,341
Be as imaginative as you can.
I'll compensate you generously.

138
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,806
I think I might be able to do a good job.

139
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,850
But I have a few requests.

140
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,229
First, I don't want
to return to the office.

141
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,814
I'll work somewhere else.

142
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,191
The International Orchid Society?

143
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,777
You said our CEO
is the chairman there, right?

144
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,614
I'll take what you'll need there.

145
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,659
Second.

146
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,996
Please don't call the deceased
a thieving bitch.

147
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,289
What else would I call her?

148
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,542
If Hwa-young really committed the crime,

149
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,919
of course it would
leave you feeling awful.

150
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,713
But if you keep calling her
a thieving bitch,

151
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,591
I feel like you'll tell people
I'm a thieving bitch's friend.

152
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,555
From where I stand, I still can't believe
Hwa-young did something like that.

153
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,433
I'll start to find the evidence
of her embezzlement

154
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,017
and slowly try to believe it.

155
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,190
Come to think about it, Ms. Oh,

156
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,610
there are similarities
between you and Ms. Jin.

157
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,076
I've been meaning to ask for a while.

158
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,581
Where do you get heels like those?

159
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,126
Sorry?

160
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,594
Cheap heels like these are made with glue,
so the heels break off easily.

161
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,555
That's how you hurt your Achilles tendon.

162
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,892
The balance is off,
so it must hurt after a short walk,

163
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,893
and you feel uneasy

164
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,103
since you can't trust your shoes.

165
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,194
Buy a nice pair
with the money we give you.

166
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,280
If you don't, you'll end up
dragging your feet around for life.

167
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,741
Do you get what I'm saying?

168
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,088
We have webfoot octopuses today.
Get some webfoot octopuses.

169
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,592
A special on webfoot octopuses.
Only 30,000 won for 1kg, ma'am.

170
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,429
Get 5 abalones for 10,000 won!
Pick up some abalones, ma'am!

171
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,605
This is Kim speaking from
the seafood corner at P Mart.

172
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,233
Hello, I'm Reporter Oh In-kyung with OBN.

173
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,069
Are you the nephew
of Mr. Kim Dal-su of Bobae Savings Bank?

174
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,279
You sent me an email four years ago.

175
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,990
It was a tip
about Mr. Kim Dal-su's suicide.

176
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,368
I'd like to meet with you
and discuss the incident…

177
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,583
Oh In-kyung.

178
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,463
Where are you going?

179
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:07,596
These are totally fresh.
They're so fresh to the point

180
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,306
they're almost sexy.

181
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,642
Try it. They're different
from produce kept in fridges.

182
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm proud of you.

183
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,906
You used to cry
in the corner of the yard for your mom,

184
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,659
but you now grow vegetables
and make meals by yourself.

185
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,995
Hey, my mom had cancer back then.

186
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,916
And you're talking as if you never cried.

187
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,251
I remember you

188
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,461
getting upset and crying
when you got expelled.

189
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,723
Goodness, In-kyung. Long time no see.

190
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,225
Oh, my. You're a grown woman now.

191
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,020
Have you been well, sir? You seem healthy.

192
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,146
I do? Thanks.

193
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,900
If I had known you were here,
I would've gone up to say hi.

194
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,402
-Will you eat here?
-Yes, sure.

195
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,946
Gosh, why can't you take a hint?

196
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,498
Was it when you two were ten?

197
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,918
Jong-ho skipped school
saying his back hurt,

198
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,212
and In-kyung got kicked out of school
for punching a teacher.

199
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,134
-I didn't hit the teacher. I threw a rock.
-What?

200
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,762
She had anger management issues
when she was a kid.

201
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,555
Really?

202
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,517
It rained a lot that day,

203
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,479
and In-kyung sat by the window
and said this.

204
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:43,150
"The rain reminds me
of the flow of money."

205
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,487
"In the end, money also flows
through familiar paths."

206
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,741
Hey, you were really peculiar.

207
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:56,205
I read the prices for stocks and futures
to my great-aunt every morning.

208
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,416
No matter what I saw,
everything reminded me of the charts.

209
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:06,131
Look how In-kyung became a proper grown-up
and does her part in society.

210
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,008
Why? Do I seem pathetic?

211
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,595
Grandpa, I have a herniated disc.
That's why I took time off from school.

212
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,847
INCOMING CALL

213
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,479
Oh In-kyung with OBN.

214
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,691
Why didn't you report it back then?
I waited so long for you to do so.

215
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,152
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,362
At the time, I had no evidence

217
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,489
of Park Jae-sang's involvement
in the suicide.

218
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,534
I also wasn't familiar with his character.

219
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,788
Do you now know what he's like?

220
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,041
In your personal opinion,
what do you think he's like?

221
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,548
He's like a monster.

222
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,347
Write this down.

223
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,810
Go to 26 Gimtan-ri, Noma-myeon,
Musim-gun, Gyeonggi Province.

224
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,564
Begin your coverage from there.

225
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,150
If you want more details, be at column C7

226
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,986
at the Sorae Fish Market auction
by 4 a.m. tomorrow.

227
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,156
The letter C, number seven.

228
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,907
FISH MARKET COLUMN C7

229
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,087
FISH MARKET COLUMN C7

230
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,020
I asked Ms. Jin's father
not to touch anything.

231
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,689
Her laptop and phone underwent forensics.

232
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,692
She could've deleted something
before she died.

233
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:55,991
Cockroach.

234
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,744
My gosh!

235
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,540
It's odd, isn't it?

236
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,459
Her house is filled with luxury goods,

237
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,045
yet there are also roaches on the floor.

238
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,467
She lived here with her mother
until she passed away.

239
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,719
She wouldn't have wanted to move.

240
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,390
I set up your computer
and files at the IOS.

241
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,059
Grab what you need.

242
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,188
I'd like to stay here for a while.

243
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,567
Take your time. I have to check my email.

244
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,206
I'd rather be here alone.

245
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,750
You can attend to your business, Mr. Choi.

246
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,460
Won't you be scared?

247
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,507
Hwa-young liked me.

248
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,342
I'm not scared.

249
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,156
I'm here, Hwa-young.

250
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,825
I'll do whatever it takes

251
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,161
to find out why you died.

252
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,372
YEAR 2021

253
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,208
What are receipts and ledgers
to bookkeepers?

254
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,254
They're like the Bible.

255
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,340
Always keep them near and check them

256
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,176
whenever suspicion arises.

257
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,304
Everything begins here.

258
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,515
You taught me

259
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,727
where everything begins.

260
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,811
ORIENTAL ORCHID CARE

261
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,202
It's 1.23 million won.

262
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:04,953
1,230,000 WON, CREDIT CARD

263
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,524
Don't bring that kind of bag to work.

264
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,861
Doesn't it look real?

265
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,697
All knockoffs are obvious.

266
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,616
I was told it's a perfect replica. Look.

267
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,036
I don't care what you carry
in your private life.

268
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,788
But don't bring it to work.

269
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,458
Bookkeepers need to look shabby
to stop people from talking.

270
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,878
A bookkeeper must see money
as just numbers,

271
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,005
like how a doctor sees a patient.

272
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,133
So what does it say about you
if you carry knockoff bags?

273
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,636
It makes you look poor
and obsessed with money.

274
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,888
How can a company trust
a person like that with their money?

275
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,517
Then I can't do this.

276
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,105
I've always been obsessed
with money and men.

277
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,564
That's why you need training.

278
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,483
Training?

279
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,527
For example,

280
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,780
like creating a second account
in a video game.

281
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,701
Like how some celebrities perform
under alter egos.

282
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:31,331
Is that why you always come to work
in the same clothes?

283
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,792
And this is your alter ego?

284
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,302
Her gallery is filled

285
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,179
with only photos of goods and receipts.

286
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,974
It's like she has no face.

287
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,853
Is this…

288
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:58,984
somewhere abroad?

289
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,112
Where has she been to?

290
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,701
SELECT

291
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,497
Jin Mi-gyeong?

292
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,750
JIN MI-GYEONG

293
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,169
JIN MI-GYEONG
BOOKKEEPER FROM THE FUTURE

294
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,086
I found you.

295
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,963
Your second account.

296
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,716
"Bookkeeper from the Future."

297
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,593
Jin Mi-gyeong.

298
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,725
It looks as if she lives in Singapore,

299
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,144
and she looks carefree and rich.

300
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,567
Just who are you?

301
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,861
Hello, Ms. Alter Ego.

302
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,530
Nice to meet you.
What took us so long to meet?

303
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,035
This might be the real me.

304
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:53,413
The alter ego might be Jin Hwa-young,
who always wears the same clothes.

305
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,040
Jeez.

306
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,628
But I don't get it, Hwa-young.

307
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,631
Do we have to go that far as a bookkeeper?

308
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,883
Most bookkeepers
will be obsolete in the future.

309
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,427
Then who'll survive?

310
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,680
Those who can read
the stories numbers tell.

311
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,434
How did the company get here?

312
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,062
What are its risks and potentials?

313
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,190
How should we move forward?

314
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,238
Accounting software can never tell you
those kinds of things.

315
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,741
Neither can I.

316
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,622
Calculate everything.

317
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,291
If things don't add up
even after calculating multiple times,

318
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,753
it means something is up.

319
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,515
August 14th.

320
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:55,642
Hwa-young's birthday.

321
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,401
BERNIMO, SANTY, MALL

322
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,902
What's missing from that day?

323
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,626
They're about 260 million won in total.

324
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,337
She sold some and made cash,

325
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,923
and there are about 70 million won
worth of new goods.

326
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,759
The company can collect them.

327
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,262
What would we do with them?

328
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,182
-You can sell them as used goods…
-This room.

329
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,853
We gave 50 million won
to Ms. Jin's father for the entire place.

330
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,442
All this expensive trash Ms. Jin bought
with company money.

331
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,528
We bought it back for 50 million.

332
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,780
Why?

333
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,532
To recover a measly few million won?

334
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,953
Seventy billion won.

335
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,042
She has 70 billion won under her name
somewhere in this world.

336
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,342
There was a photo she took in Singapore
on her phone.

337
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,427
She's been there on a business trip.

338
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,349
I searched the image
and found a Skygram account.

339
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,350
These photos…

340
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,604
weren't found on her laptop or phone.

341
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,232
She must've used
another phone in Singapore.

342
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,610
She went there
at least once or twice a month.

343
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,822
You said she had a flight booked
to Singapore, right?

344
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,324
I did.

345
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,910
It may be possible

346
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:40,956
that she had been living
in Singapore for a long time.

347
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,633
Send me the link to her account.

348
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,346
Once I find where she lived in Singapore,

349
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,390
I'll find her phone and whatever else.

350
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,518
Then…

351
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,980
Then I can find where the 70 billion is.

352
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,448
Ms. Oh.

353
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,328
Did you look at these heels?

354
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,789
What about the bags and clothes?

355
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,625
Were they nice?

356
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,629
Did you want them?

357
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,134
Her father has an apartment unit
worth 700 million won.

358
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,221
I don't think this man
ever made money in his life.

359
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,556
So how did he afford that?

360
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,479
This is what the company offered.

361
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,276
Ms. Jin's work was important
and dangerous, so she deserved it.

362
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,527
But…

363
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,991
she should've stopped there.

364
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,045
What are you like, Ms. Oh?

365
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,759
I can give these all to you.

366
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,185
Your feet are
between 230mm to 235mm, right?

367
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:30,106
They look smooth and you have thin ankles,
so stilettos would suit you.

368
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,154
How about mules to show off your heels?

369
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,161
I'll send you something nice.

370
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,586
I always liked your cheap clothes, Ms. Oh.

371
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,300
So?

372
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:04,099
This company needs someone who is devoted
and has pretty feet like you.

373
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,528
Since when has that orchid been there?

374
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,703
I think it's been here all along.

375
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,247
Why?

376
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,210
Damn it.

377
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,815
I've been wanting to go
to the fish market.

378
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,568
Fish dishes are my expertise.

379
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,363
I lived in San Francisco for six months.
Next to Fisherman's Wharf.

380
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,906
I could've called a cab.

381
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,117
It's dangerous to grab a cab at this hour.

382
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,004
See? This time of day is dangerous.

383
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,922
Did they doze off?

384
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,509
The driver must be seriously hurt too.

385
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,015
Let's begin. Shall we?

386
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,642
Anyone, make a bid.

387
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,395
Get your cuttlefish.
30,000 won. 50,000 won.

388
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,482
There's 60,000, 70,000 won.
Sold for 70,000 won to 23.

389
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,941
Call me when you're done.

390
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,276
I'll get some fish.

391
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,695
-Sure.
-I got 33,000 won. 35,000 won.

392
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,531
I see 70,000 won. And 80,000 won.

393
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,753
These are 12,000 won a kilogram,
these are 14,000 won.

394
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,380
-I'll take two 14,000-won fish.
-Then two it is.

395
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,799
How about the cod?

396
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,926
They're 25,000 won per box.

397
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,719
-I'll take those too.
-Sure.

398
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:14,229
Your call cannot be connected.
You will be redirected after the tone.

399
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,148
KIM CHEOL-SEONG, NEPHEW OF KIM DAL-SU

400
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,669
Jong-ho, let's go.

401
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,462
Where to? He didn't show?

402
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,421
We have to hurry.

403
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,923
Does he want to meet somewhere else?

404
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,521
Wait, excuse me.

405
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,772
She's an acquaintance.

406
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,732
-With the driver?
-Yes.

407
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,613
Please step back.

408
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,395
OBN REPORTER OH IN-KYUNG

409
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,660
You're wearing our Velvet Orchid.

410
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:37,789
We brought in only three pairs.
It's a rare collection.

411
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,998
They look great on you.

412
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,420
I received them as a gift
on my birthday last year.

413
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,673
These came to my mind today,
so I put them on.

414
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,550
Right. Because you choose heels
depending on how you feel.

415
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,428
I'm sorry to ask,

416
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,765
but I had too much to drink
on my birthday,

417
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,476
so I can't seem to remember
who gave me these.

418
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,895
By any chance,

419
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,857
was he the one who bought these?

420
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,736
I want to return his kindness.

421
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,662
You're right. It's him.

422
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,330
I clearly remember.

423
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,042
He was the only one

424
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:27,171
who understood the balance of our shoes
from one's head to the arch of the foot.

425
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,265
You're something too.

426
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,102
I had to quit my job
and almost got divorced because of you.

427
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,563
So why did you ask me to meet you?

428
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,441
I was rash.

429
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,693
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,570
But now,

431
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,741
I just want to know the truth.

432
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,161
They were having an affair, no doubt.

433
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,830
If my affair was like a dessert,

434
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,750
for Hwa-young,
it was more for her livelihood.

435
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,835
How do you know that?

436
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,087
Everything was evident on the ledger.

437
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,006
Jin Hwa-young and Director Shin

438
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,300
pocketed a huge amount of money as a team.

439
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,387
Then I looked at those two,
and they were totally…

440
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,098
If you knew everything,
why didn't you say anything?

441
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,186
The CEO has been hospitalized
for four years.

442
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,646
Director Shin took charge
as the next in line.

443
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,898
So why should I?

444
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,734
He was famous for his affairs.

445
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:33,237
He had an office wife
at his former workplace too.

446
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,783
This is kind of awkward,

447
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,578
but Director Shin only goes
for a certain type of woman.

448
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,497
What type is that?

449
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,167
Women who wear cheap heels.

450
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,214
Didn't Jin Hwa-young seem different
from the other bookkeepers?

451
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,549
Director Shin hired her.

452
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,094
Is it because
he's the son of a shoe repairman?

453
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,222
He hates elite women
from wealthy families.

454
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,306
Right.

455
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,975
You know that
Director Shin hired you too, right?

456
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,777
You asked me why I treated her
like an outcast, didn't you?

457
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,863
I never treated her like an outcast.

458
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,951
We just live in different worlds.

459
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:09,292
FLOWER.YOUNG

460
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:12,128
HOW HIGH CAN SOMEONE FROM ROCK BOTTOM GO?

461
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,553
A penniless high school grad.
No hopes of getting married.

462
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,222
I want to find hope now.
How high can someone from rock bottom go?

463
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,975
But I wanted to live
with a perfect face at least once.

464
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,159
From Monday to Friday,
from early morning to 7 p.m.,

465
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:47,288
she was Team Leader Jin Hwa-young,
who always wore the same clothes.

466
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,833
But after yoga at night,

467
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,127
when she studied English
and software development…

468
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,758
When she ate at fine dining restaurants
and went shopping,

469
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,344
and when she was in Singapore,

470
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,806
she was someone else,
someone I didn't know.

471
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,060
And then…

472
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,233
I found a photo of her with someone else.

473
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,277
The tab wasn't in her file of receipts.

474
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,988
A man?

475
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,826
I realized there were photos of a meal
without a receipt about once a month.

476
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,829
And…

477
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,456
These are her cherished heels.

478
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,959
She said she bought them
on her birthday last year.

479
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,544
I couldn't find the receipt.

480
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,463
They were 4.3 million won.

481
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,507
Only three pairs came to Korea.

482
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,634
They must be from someone special.

483
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,888
It was Director Shin.

484
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,683
Were they having an affair?

485
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,484
Director Shin was supposed to go
to Switzerland.

486
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,611
But he couldn't,
so Hwa-young went instead.

487
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,990
I didn't suspect anything
since I'd known her for a while.

488
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:07,868
The account number and password
for the Swiss bank are 18 digits each.

489
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,496
It's impossible to memorize them all
then and there.

490
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:14,000
But a few days later,
Director Shin called.

491
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,961
He said Ms. Jin seemed odd
so I should check the account.

492
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,881
The 70 billion won disappeared.

493
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,135
After she made an account under her name,

494
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,012
I gave her a lift to the airport.

495
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,557
But she didn't take the flight,
went back to the bank,

496
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,809
and transferred the 70 billion.

497
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,522
If all of this was Director Shin's plan…

498
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,109
The final step would be

499
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,528
to kill Hwa-young.

500
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,115
Then Hwa-young takes the full blame,

501
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,702
while Director Shin is free forever.

502
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,666
It's also odd
that she typed out her suicide note.

503
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,335
Isn't it usually hand-written?

504
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,174
But how could Director Shin
have written these words?

505
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,634
The note is too realistic.

506
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,221
She had two Skygram accounts.

507
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,641
One as Hwa-young and one as Jin Mi-gyeong,
Bookkeeper from the Future.

508
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:18,356
She put together the things she wrote
on her Skygram account on the note.

509
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,565
Isn't that odd?

510
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,741
I'll see if her laptop and phone
can undergo forensics again.

511
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,372
Come to think about it,
they didn't share enough texts or calls.

512
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,415
Their work was closely related too.

513
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,336
Director Shin handled the forensics.

514
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,274
Don't worry about the orchids, Hwa-young.

515
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:05,486
I'll treat them like princesses.

516
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,363
I'll study hard to make them bloom too.

517
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,698
"In order to make the Princess bloom,

518
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,284
it needs a few days of cold mornings."

519
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,202
"Less than a week

520
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,121
when the outside temperature
is over ten degrees."

521
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:19,667
"When it withers,
it's a good idea to use aspirin."

522
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,628
"Refer to Hyang-sook's journal
for the recipe."

523
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,423
YANG HYANG-SOOK

524
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,764
The problem is you.

525
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,268
Fraud. Embezzlement. Suicide. Murder.

526
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,811
And the two billion you gave me.

527
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,108
I still have no idea what's going on.

528
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,528
But if you truly died an unfair death,

529
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,406
then I must bring it to light.

530
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:59,123
We have CCTV cameras everywhere,

531
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,625
so you can see everyone
who comes and goes.

532
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,672
I wasn't home that day,
so I didn't see anything.

533
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,467
When was it again?

534
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,677
Last Wednesday, the 17th.

535
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,595
Okay.

536
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,141
Did it fail to record?

537
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,227
Why did it stop at that hour?

538
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,321
Someone stole it a few days ago.

539
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,239
Just the dashcam.

540
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,658
Well, I guess
there was nothing else to take.

541
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,036
Odd, isn't it?

542
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,338
What? Wait.

543
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,590
What's with my car? What?

544
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,011
The brakes.

545
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,804
Brakes.

546
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,941
Is this sudden unintended acceleration?

547
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,361
About 95 percent of SUA accidents

548
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,072
are usually due to poor driving
or poor maintenance.

549
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,491
You'll need to request an analysis
from the National Forensic Service.

550
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,576
Thank you for calling and not forgetting.

551
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:03,372
This time,
I'll put my trust in you, Ms. Oh.

552
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,093
Make a reservation at Genji
for Thursday, 8 p.m.

553
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,054
-Put on Bruno Zumino stilettos.
-Yes, sir.

554
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,556
Damn it, Hwa-young.

555
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,850
This is so wrong.

556
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,312
Wait.

557
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,273
Where are you? Pick up the phone.

558
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,775
I'm sorry. I'm at a meeting outside.

559
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,236
The prosecution put a travel ban on me.

560
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:35,904
Why?

561
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,616
Macau. Do you know anything?

562
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,617
No.

563
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,951
Did the prosecution call?

564
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,202
No.

565
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,496
If they call, play dumb,
then tell me right away.

566
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,250
Delete all text messages.
Reset your phone and the dashcam.

567
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,044
Keep the ledger safe just in case.

568
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,338
-Don't let them get to the safe.
-Yes, sir.

569
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,340
Director Shin couldn't go to Europe

570
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,216
because he got banned from traveling.

571
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,094
I saw something in the deleted files.

572
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,220
GAMBLING

CASINO VIP ROOM GAMBLING VIDEO

574
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,807
I REPORT DIRECTOR SHIN HYEON-MIN
OF ORCHID E&C

575
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,686
"I report Finance Director
Shin Hyeon-min of Orchid E&C

576
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,480
-for illegal overseas gambling."
-…for illegal overseas gambling,

577
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,023
smuggling foreign currency,

578
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:14,318
illegal currency exchange,
and embezzlement.

579
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,281
It was Hwa-young who reported
Director Shin to the prosecution.

580
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,076
She started collecting
evidence on him four years ago.

581
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,577
She even had videos.

582
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,746
I guess Mr. Shin didn't know

583
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,832
Hwa-young was the one who reported him.

584
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,833
Pick up your phone.

585
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,627
You ratted on me to the prosecution.

586
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,836
You think I'm an idiot?

587
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,338
You think I wouldn't have found out?

588
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,174
I'm not going down alone.
You're coming too.

589
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,009
We'll stand before reporters together,

590
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,345
so make sure you pick out your heels.

591
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,971
He found out

592
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,016
the day after she came back to Korea.

593
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,019
How did he know?

594
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,021
I'm sure it was anonymous.

595
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,108
He probably poked around.
He has lots of connections.

596
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,485
Come out, you bitch!

597
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,405
I'm at your place. Pick up.

598
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,698
Do you remember
what happened to Yang Hyang-sook?

599
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:05,035
I'll do the same to you
before the police get here. Open the door.

600
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,495
Who is Yang Hyang-sook?

601
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,498
Yang Hyang-sook?

602
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,917
I've heard that name before.

603
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,888
She was in charge of the orchids
from 1999 to 2011.

Reporter Oh In-kyung from OBN?

608
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,376
How did you know about this?

609
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,842
Do you know how much we suffered

610
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,969
after what you said about my father on TV?

611
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,013
How dare she come here?

612
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,681
-Mother.
-Drag her out now.

613
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,099

-Come.

-Come out.
-Hey.

615
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,019
-Drag her out now!
-You have no right.

616
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,438
-Come out!
-Mother, calm down.

617
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,648
-Let go of me!
-Calm down!

618
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,358
-Let's go.
-What's with you?

619
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,651
Hey! Come out!

620
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,236
-Calm down!
-What are you doing?

621
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,404
Come out!

622
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,656
I'm sick of this! Come on!

623
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,867
Come out! How dare you come here?

624
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,452
Please!

CURRENT EVENTS DEPARTMENT
REPORTER OH IN-KYUNG

626
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:03,904
I was supposed to meet your brother
at 4 a.m. by column C7 at the fish market.

627
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:12,246
Nobody expected to find her like that.

628
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,916
A rotting, naked dead body was found

629
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,253
in her small, humble apartment unit
a week after her death.

630
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,089
Her name was Yang Hyang-sook.

631
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:26,093
Yang, a woman in her thirties,
was found dead

632
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,513
after her embezzlement charges
from her workplace.

633
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,140
She was a bookkeeper at work.

634
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,936
She suddenly began spending excessively,
such as buying luxury goods.

635
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,939
When the police closed in on her,
she took her own life.

636
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,274
I've never seen such a thing.

637
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:44,611
She was completely naked
with a fur coat over her body.

638
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,199
And she was wearing
numerous necklaces and bracelets.

639
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,451
Also, she was wearing heels.

640
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,953
-My gosh.
-Heels?

641
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,581
High heels. Red ones.

642
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,958
Everything is the same.

643
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,629
I'm sure Director Shin bought her
those heels too.

644
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,384
YANG HYANG-SOOK, YEAR 2011

645
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,885
WONRYEONG CONSTRUCTION
EMBEZZLEMENT CASE

646
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,096
Shin Hyeon-min was
the director of Wonryeong

647
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,848
when Ms. Yang worked there.

648
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,436
He gets someone economically vulnerable
without friends or families

649
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,314
involved in a huge embezzlement scheme,

650
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,775
then blames them for everything
and makes them kill themselves.

651
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,405
How disgusting.

652
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,534
Hwa-young must have known

653
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,580
that one day,
she could end up like Ms. Yang.

654
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,415
That's why she reported Director Shin.

655
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,251
He would've been arrested if she held out.

656
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,503
Let's report this to the police.

657
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,049
I can't do that.

658
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,634
Why not?

659
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:52,346
Because there isn't enough evidence?
The MO is the same.

660
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,264
Then I can't find the 70 billion won.

661
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,183
The state is entitled to slush funds.

662
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,394
What are you talking about?

663
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:02,981
I came here to find the money,
not to investigate a murder case.

664
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,108
Is that more important
than someone's life?

665
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,778
People died. Two people.

666
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,657
I know that Ms. Jin
would have shared my opinion.

667
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:16,203
She went to Switzerland
to steal the 70 billion won.

668
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,914
She must've known what the risk was.

669
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:21,708
She was the most professional accountant
I've ever seen.

670
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,590
I thought we could be friends.

671
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,596
Hwa-young told you
that I'm the outcast of the 13th floor.

672
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,183
She's not someone
who would share that with just anybody.

673
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,023
Hwa-young and I became friends

674
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,776
because we're similar.

675
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,779
People keep the thing they value most
inside their hearts.

676
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,657
We valued the same thing.

677
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,743
Money.

678
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,121
That's why I know
what Hwa-young would've done.

679
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,540
We have the same ethics.

680
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,001
What kind of ethics?

681
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:08,296
Nothing in this world…

682
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,717
is more sacred than money.

683
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,409
What does two billion won amount to?

684
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,588
An apartment unit that keeps my family
cool in the summer and warm in the winter.

685
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,175
Being able to send In-hye
to an art academy and a university.

686
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,470
I wanted to get
a new car for In-kyung too.

687
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,222
I wanted useless things.

688
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:03,393
I wanted the small luxuries I could afford
if I didn't have to worry about money.

689
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,603
Also, Hwa-young…

690
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,231
Never being able to forget
the image of you dead.

691
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,067
Covering up
the cause of your death forever.

692
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,029
If all that amounts to two billion,

693
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,323
is that a good deal?

694
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,290
When I was young,
I thought others were just like me.

695
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,834
I'm easily affected by people's emotions.

696
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:32,005
When I look at someone,
their emotions slowly seep into me.

697
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,382
That's why news reporting was tough.

698
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,053
Mostly, I keep myself under control.

699
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,932
But when I read the note of the daughter
of a family suicide case,

700
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,142
when I report on the death
of a high school girl

701
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,144
who jumped into a fire to save her sister,

702
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,730
or on a child abused by their stepmother

703
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,233
who called out "Mom" as they were dying…

704
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,363
Is that why you drink?

705
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,990
I can control my tears.

706
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,326
But not my voice.

707
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:05,705
My trembling voice in front of the camera.

708
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:11,336
But it was okay when I had a drink.
I could easily speak like a normal person.

709
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,507
What does that have to do
with believing the informant was killed?

710
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,477
…was cleared of all charges
in a retrial after 30 years.

711
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,564
An unexpected guest visited him today.

712
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,440
I'm sorry for coming so late.

713
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,151
When you were illegally tortured

714
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,153
and framed for espionage,

715
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,408
my father-in-law was the commander
of the Defense Security Command.

716
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,246
What can you feel from him?

717
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:50,208
I'm not sure. Even if this was
his father-in-law's fault,

718
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,460
it can't be easy
to own up to it and apologize.

719
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,254
He seems brave.

720
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,463
What do you feel?

721
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,467
-Candidate Park Jae-sang stated…
-He's creepily cold.

722
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,219
How so?

723
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,139
He's calculating his moves.

724
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:08,435
He knows that the weak old man
has no choice but to accept his apology.

725
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,312
That people will love this moment.

726
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,189
If he sheds a few tears now,
he'll be forgiven,

727
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,567
and his political career
will take off after this.

728
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,861
Even if that's true,

729
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,405
politics is a show business anyway.

730
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,991
Someone who represents the era
came out and apologized,

731
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:26,036
and the victim forgave him.
Isn't that significant?

732
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,626
Are you saying he's a criminal
just because of a hunch?

733
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,465
I know it doesn't make any sense.
But I'm sure of this.

734
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,508
He's the culprit.

735
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,804
Have you always been this irrational?

736
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:47,891
Sometimes.

737
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:56,858
What's with that look?

738
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,444
Tell me how I feel about you right now.

739
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,620
You're worried.
You're worried that I've gone crazy.

740
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,414
And?

741
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,050
Relaxed.

742
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,094
It's like watching TV
in comfortable clothes

743
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,679
when you're with me, right?

744
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,264
And?

745
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,063
Are you mad at me?

746
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,191
Or do you have a fever?

747
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,405
"Easily affected by people's emotions"?

748
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:44,990
I almost fell for it.

749
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:02,257
What the heck? Why are you sitting here?

750
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,930
In-joo, did you rob a store?

751
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,100
Did you win a giveaway?

752
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,227
I…

753
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,688
quit my job.

754
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,150
What?

755
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,780
I bought those wondering
if shopping would make me feel better.

756
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,991
Everything I've always wanted.

757
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:35,081
But still, who buys
every single color of lip gloss?

758
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:37,625
I hate seeing you on TV without makeup.

759
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,045
It's for you and In-hye.

760
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,298
Each color has a different scent.

761
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,093
Isn't it nice?

762
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,178
I mean,

763
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,305
we have a comb at home.

764
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,557
This can detangle every knot in your hair.

765
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,436
What's this?

766
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,272
A car air freshener. It smells exquisite.

767
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,025
I told you my license was suspended.

768
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,402
What good would it do
for a decade-old beat-up car?

769
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,073
It smells like decade-old dust,

770
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,742
sweat, and meal boxes
you randomly eat in your car.

771
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,702
That's why I hate getting in your car.

772
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,537
Can't you at least let it smell nice?

773
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,091
What is this?

774
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,683
Hey, In-joo.

775
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,062
I'm sorry.

776
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,945
I think this smells nice.

777
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,282
I have no idea what to do, In-kyung.

778
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,912
I have no idea what to do.

779
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,220
Things look suspicious,
but there's no evidence.

780
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,598
The company won't cooperate
with the investigation.

781
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,727
Reporting to the police won't help, right?

782
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,479
No.

783
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,608
Surprisingly, dozens of people
commit suicide every year

784
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,652
after they get caught
embezzling company funds.

785
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,029
Most never even make the news.

786
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,074
Since it's too common?

787
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,951
Yes.

788
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:37,412
Evidence is essential.

789
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,009
But did you really get all this
with your severance pay?

790
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,386
Or did you win the lottery?

791
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,431
Well…

792
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,516
Delivery.

793
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,276
In-hye left her phone here.

794
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,032
Hey, why can't I reach you?

795
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,117
I'll pick you up at the academy.

796
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,046
FROM SHIN HYEON-MIN
TO OH IN-JOO

797
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,650
Hey. You even bought heels?

798
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:06,668
Next up, the Grand Prize
for high school students.

799
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:09,837
The winner is…

800
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,801
Self-Portrait by Park Hyo-rin,
an 11th-grader at Seran Arts High School,

801
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:26,062
THE 13TH DONGHWA MEDIA
INTERNATIONAL TEENAGE ART COMPETITION

802
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,488
GRAND PRIZE
SELF-PORTRAIT

803
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:40,285
Park Hyo-rin's painting of the secretive
inner side of a 17-year-old girl

804
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:44,247
unanimously captured the judges' hearts
as the Grand Prize winner.

805
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,540
Congratulations.

806
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:20,325
WINNER OF DONGHWA MEDIA INTERNATIONAL
ART COMPETITION, PARK HYO-RIN

807
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,457
DONGHWA MEDIA INTERNATIONAL ART…

808
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,605
-Was I next?
-What?

809
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,232
I was haunted by the image of Hwa-young
after I found her like that.

810
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,902
And now, I see myself there.

811
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,321
The bookkeepers who embezzled
and hung themselves.

812
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,073
Ms. Yang Hyang-sook and Hwa-young.

813
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,783
Was I next?

814
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,331
Hey.

815
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:13,419
I know you got suspicious of me
and snooped, but no.

816
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,171
Yang Hyang-sook killed herself.

817
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,217
Read the autopsy report by the police.
It had to be suicide.

818
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,637
Of course, if you ask me
why she killed herself,

819
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,889
that's complicated.

820
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,140
Embezzlement is

821
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,895
an inevitable part
of operating an enterprise,

822
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,941
and someone has to take responsibility.

823
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:41,572
Do you know

824
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,701
who first found Yang Hyang-sook?

825
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,296
Hwa-young?

826
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,215
Do you know what she said to me?

827
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,594
She wanted to do
what Hyang-sook had been doing.

828
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,308
After Hyang-sook died,
Hwa-young's eyes were opened.

829
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,477
She knew Hyang-sook had an easy job.

830
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,062
All of you must think

831
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:16,315
I was in some affair with her,
but we really weren't.

832
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,236
She's seriously not my type.
She only took advantage of me.

833
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,876
How could she have taken advantage of you?

834
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:36,377
She's the one who's dead!

835
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,546
She positioned herself cleverly.

836
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,381
Who would've thought?

837
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:42,300
That a girl who looked like

838
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,886
she couldn't speak a word of English,
would have prepared so thoroughly

839
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,971
to make her own account in Switzerland?

840
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,057
That Hwa-young, who ran my money errands
for 15 years, would do such a thing?

841
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,476
She prepared this for years?

842
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:53,770
Studying English and software development?

843
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:57,231
And followed me to Macau, Gangwon,
and Singapore to get the evidence,

844
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,734
then reported me at the perfect time.

845
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,736
To go to Switzerland in my place.

846
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,906
Then why did she kill herself
if she stole the 70 billion won?

847
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:06,657
I thought she killed herself too.

848
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,659
That she thought I reported her

849
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,037
and that she felt cornered
like Yang Hyang-sook.

850
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,331
But what? Are you saying that's not true?

851
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,128
Jin Hwa-young didn't know

852
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,257
that there was something else
to be scared of.

853
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,511
That there's someone high up above us.

854
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,516
I'll report you to the police.

855
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,520
Forget the police.
I'm going to the prosecutor's office.

856
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,606
Go tell this to Choi Do-il.

857
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:41,192
Illegal overseas gambling,
smuggling foreign currency,

858
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,821
illegal currency exchange,
and embezzlement.

859
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,908
I'll take the full blame
and get locked up for five years.

860
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,409
But don't go any further.

861
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:54,205
I'm not the type who goes down alone.

862
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,543
I knew a day like this would come,

863
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,629
so I kept a slush fund ledger
for the last 25 years.

864
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,215
If he annoys me, I'll blow it up.

865
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:07,802
I'll do a press conference if I have to.
Got it?

866
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,895
-Yes, Director Shin.
-Prosecutor.

867
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,982
I'm on my way, but I haven't eaten.

868
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,358
Okay.

869
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:26,195
Could I have a bowl of noodles
before we begin?

870
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,382
What?

871
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:47,967
The RPM.

872
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:49,468
What the hell?

873
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,060
Brakes. Brakes, damn it.

874
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,945
How would someone feel
after losing 70 billion won?

875
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:32,738
Is that a threat?

876
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,490
Why are you lying there alone

877
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,409
in the dark forest?

878
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,202
It's my sister.

879
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,079
My dying sister.

880
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,040
Why are you so nice to me?

881
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,209
You're a small storm, Ms. Oh.

882
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,753
No matter where you go,
you change the flow of the air.

883
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,463
There's something in his hand.

884
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:51,215
Something small and blue.

885
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,675
Can you do it too?

886
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,844
If you intend to take this money,

887
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:55,970
I'll turn you in.

888
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,597
I'll spend this money

889
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,640
and go to prison.

890
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:05,146
