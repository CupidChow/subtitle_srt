really want to know?

we...

49
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:19,523
Don't say it.

50
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,923
I don't really want to know.

51
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,483
That's right.

Thank you.

It's the best birthday I have ever had.

55
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:56,282
No, Xiao Ya!

56
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,722
-Don't leave me.
-Let go of me!

57

Xiao Ya, don't leave me!

58
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:01,122
Xiao Ya!

59
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,363
He's mad.

60
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:04,203
Help me!

61
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:05,842
Don't go!

62
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:14,602
Call the police.

63
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,243
Don't call the police.

64
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,602
Who dares to call the police?

65
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,562
Xiao Ya, I'll be back.

66
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,282
Are you all right?

67
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,923
Come on. I'll bandage your hand up.

68
00:05:35,122 --> 00:05:35,923
Hurry.

69
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,282
It's done.

70
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:49,403
I was meant to comfort her.

71
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:50,923
But she's already asleep.

72
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,282
She sure is a happy-go-lucky person.

73
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,963
I wanted to give you a surprise.

74
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,803
But it turned out to be a shock.

75
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,403
Does it hurt?

76
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,523
I'll stay here tonight.

77
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,042
What are you talking about?

78
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,523
Man and woman should keep a distance.
I won't...

79
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,842
What are you thinking?

80
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,683
I'll sleep on the couch.

81
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,042
What if the crazy guy comes again?

82
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,363
Suit yourself.

83
00:06:23,523 --> 00:06:25,683
I won't look after you
if you feel cold at night.

84
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,683
Didn't you say you wouldn't look after me?

85
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:30,322
I see. You're sleepwalking.

86
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:39,963
Do you know how I usually

87
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:41,923
dealt with your sleepwalking?

88
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:49,083
Let me show you.

89
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:58,243
That's how.

90
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:24,282
I...

91
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:27,722
Did I sleepwalk again?

92
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,923
It was so dangerous just now.

93
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:32,682
You almost jumped off the building.

94
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,763
I'd better just stay by your side.

95
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:27,922
All right.

96
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:29,802
I'll be back soon.

97
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:33,562
What's the matter?

98
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,283
Do you have any trouble at the lab?

99
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,322
Is it serious?

100
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:38,322
Something went wrong with the test data.

101
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,482
Get back then.

102
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:41,603
I'll send you.

103
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:42,922
I can go there myself.

104
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:44,442
I know the way.

105
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:45,603
Goofball.

106
00:09:45,882 --> 00:09:46,963
I'm not sure you'd find the right way.

107
00:09:49,386 --> 00:09:52,226
(Liu Zihui)

108
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,203
Xiao Feng.

109
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:55,643
Check the message I've sent you.

110
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,083
We've got troubles at the dessert shop.

111
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:58,963
I'll hang up now.

112
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:02,129
(Liu Zihui)

113
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:05,995
(How scary is the internet-famous
dessert shop? Mouldy fruits, expired cream.)

114
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,200
(That saves us the trip.
The dessert shop is a mess.)

115
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,283
(My goodness. That's unbelievable.)
What...

116
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,879
(Seal)

117
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:20,362
Those ingredients were never used

118
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:21,922
at the shop.

119
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,523
I will help you find evidence.

120
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:25,442
Let's start over.

121
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:28,482
It's not that simple.

122
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:33,523
I won't let Ouyang Qingxue hurt you again.

123
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:35,643
How...

124
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,843
How did you know it was her?

125
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:40,922
How you got hurt today

126
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,322
was the same with

127
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,802
the attacks on you on the Internet.

128
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,963
I checked the source of the video.

129
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:48,723
Besides her,

130
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:49,922
who else could it be?

131
00:10:50,723 --> 00:10:52,643
You should stay out of it.

132
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:54,163
You're still trying to start a business.

133
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:55,603
Believe in me.

134
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:58,083
I have confidence in everything I do.

135
00:10:58,322 --> 00:10:58,922
But

136
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,682
the only thing I'm not confident

137
00:11:01,043 --> 00:11:02,322
is whether you like me or not.

138
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,083
Mr. Ouyang.

139
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,523
Something went wrong
with Le Diyin's drug trial.

140
00:11:11,682 --> 00:11:12,882
Come to the office at once.

141
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,362
All right. I'll get there soon.

142
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:16,523
What's the matter?

143
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,362
Le Diyin had serious side effects

144
00:11:18,523 --> 00:11:19,603
during the experiment.

145
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:20,723
I have an urgent meeting.

146
00:11:20,843 --> 00:11:21,482
I'll take you there.

147
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:22,122
No need.

148
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:23,242
You should head back to the lab.

149
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:24,723
Let's keep in touch.

150
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:37,283
How's Le Diyin doing now?

151
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,482
Did you find out what the problem was?

152
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:41,882
Calm down.

153
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:42,963
Take a seat.

154
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:55,682
Le Diyin's condition

155
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,362
is under control now.

156
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:59,442
Thomas suggested

157
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,643
adjusting the prescription
and re-doing the test.

158
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,314
Re-do it?

159
00:12:04,802 --> 00:12:06,322
How long is it going to take?

160
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:07,603
We have much time.

161
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:09,242
But not Le Diyin. He's...

162
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,242
Calm down.

163
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:11,802
Sit down first.

164
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,882
That's why I asked you to come back.

165
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,083
We need you in this project.

166
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,322
I'll get all of my American technicians

167
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:20,763
to work on this project.

168
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:22,682
We'll strive to adjust the prescription

169
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,403
and complete drug testing
in the shortest time, okay?

170
00:12:26,482 --> 00:12:28,122
All right. Well...

171
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:29,882
I'm counting on you.

172
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,043
Xiao Feng, you're here.

173
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,002
Take a look.

174
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,802
We've just unlocked a new map.

175
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,362
How are you feeling?

176
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:02,322
I'll get the medical report.

177
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:03,603
I'll leave you alone.

178
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,882
That's real.

179
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,523
That's indeed Su Muyun.

180
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:22,322
Why is he here?

181
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,963
Perhaps he's worried that you'd be upset

182
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,203
if I died.

183
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,083
You won't die.

184
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:32,562
Nothing's going to happen to you.

185
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:34,682
I'm really happy to see how much

186
00:13:34,922 --> 00:13:36,203
he has changed for you.

187
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,122
Xiao Feng.

188
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:39,482
It's not easy for you two

189
00:13:39,603 --> 00:13:40,963
to be together.

190
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,242
So promise me.

191
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,163
Be brave to be yourself.

192
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:47,482
Don't give up. All right?

193
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:53,763
But you...

194
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:55,723
Don't worry.

195
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,163
I won't give up either.

196
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,163
Don't cry anymore.

197
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,723
Wipe away your tears.

198
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:08,362
I want to get the IV drip faster.

199
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,562
No.

200
00:14:10,802 --> 00:14:13,283
If it gets faster,
your heart won't be able to take it.

201
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:17,843
You're more controlling than Dr Feng.

202
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:21,442
You are more disobedient than kids.

203
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,146
(Wangchun Tower)

204
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,242
Another one.

205
00:15:08,362 --> 00:15:09,643
Not bad.

206
00:15:10,603 --> 00:15:12,163
The weather is bad today.

207
00:15:12,322 --> 00:15:13,403
We did't get much sunlight.

208
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:15,283
Otherwise, we can get better photos.

209
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:17,163
I didn't expect you

210
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:19,043
to have a passion for art.

211
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:20,043
Of course.

212
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:22,442
Otherwise,
why would I be so devoted to you?

213
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,242
We're almost done.

214
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,122
You have work with the brand
in the afternoon.

215
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,603
It's time to hit the road.

216
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:36,802
You're right.

217
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:39,242
Not bad, Assistant Lin.

218
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:40,802
That's very professional.

219
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:42,403
Of course.

220
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,320
Don't move. Let me do it.

221
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:10,482
Let's go.

222
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:11,882
Let's go.

223
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,802
No one is picking us up.

224
00:16:20,442 --> 00:16:21,763
We're in a scenic spot.

225
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:22,882
It's not easy to get a taxi.

226
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:24,963
We shouldn't have picked this place
for the photoshoot.

227
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,203
I'm going to be late.

228
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:28,643
The brand owner will surely
have a bad impression on me.

229
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,002
Is that all right?

230
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,482
Just wear my shoes for now.

231
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,442
I think there are shared electric vehicles
around here.

232
00:16:58,603 --> 00:17:00,442
I'll look around and come back to get you.

233
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:01,442
Then

234
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,882
we'll get another pair of heels
on the way.

235
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,202
Don't worry. We can still make it.

236
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,283
You can count on me.

237
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,082
By the way, don't stain my shoes!

238
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:15,643
What's wrong?
Lost a fight with the haters again?

239
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,482
Lin Di is missing.

240
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,643
It's been three days and eight hours now.

241
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,163
And eight minutes.

242
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:24,923
He's missing?

243
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:26,362
Did you call the police?

244
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:28,923
He's fine.

245
00:18:31,722 --> 00:18:33,602
I'm the one in trouble.

246
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,362
You're just fine, aren't you?

247
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,443
If he doesn't text me,

248
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:41,323
I'm not in the mood to do anything.

249
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:43,283
Xiao Feng.

250
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:44,923
Am I...

251
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,163
Yes, that's right.

252
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:49,443
You have fallen in love with him.

253
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:52,602
What should I do?

254
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:54,002
Should I look for him?

255
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:57,323
Come on. You've been dating for so long.

256
00:18:57,482 --> 00:18:58,643
Stop playing hard to get.

257
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,242
There's no trick in true love.

258
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:04,283
What if he likes someone else?

259
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:07,803
I suspect

260
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:10,403
that he's cheating on me.

261
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,683
What?

262
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:16,643
All right.

263
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:23,323
Who was that?

264
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:24,962
A nobody.

265
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:35,482
That's a groundless accusation.

266
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:37,443
Don't bother yourself, all right?

267
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,443
Women are natural-born Sherlock Holmes.

268
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:40,882
Besides, I've already sensed

269
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,523
something unusual.

270
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,163
Girls who are in love

271
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,202
are afraid of losing the one they love.

272
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,163
I don't want to live anymore!

273
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,643
I don't think Lin Di is cheating on you.

274
00:19:55,842 --> 00:19:57,443
You should trust him.

275
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,643
Go to see him tomorrow.

276
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:00,602
Have a heart-to-heart talk with him.

277
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,163
No.

278
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,307
(Mingxian University)

279
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:12,602
Do you know where Lin Di is?

280
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:13,563
Zihui.

281
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:15,563
How can you come in as you wish?

282
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:16,683
Why do you always barge in

283
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,842
when I'm not dressed?

284
00:20:18,082 --> 00:20:19,362
As usual. Turn around.

285
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:23,923
Where is he?

286
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:25,443
You have the cheek to ask that?

287
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,443
Lin Di is working day and night.

288
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,242
Yet, you're always abusing him.

289
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:30,202
Why does such a good man

290
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:31,443
have to suffer so much?

291
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,482
It's none of your business.

292
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,283
I'll ask you one last time. Where is he?

293
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,002
Due to exhaustion,

294
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:39,202
he's been having a high fever for days.

295
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,283
How can I not look after him?

296
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:41,323
Is he ill?

297
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:43,602
Turn around.

298
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,202
You have defiled my pure body.

299
00:20:58,962 --> 00:21:00,122
Who is that?

300
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,403
Coming.

301
00:21:08,523 --> 00:21:09,563
What brings you here?

302
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:11,242
I'm here to return the clothes.

303
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:17,683
Since I'm here,
aren't you going to invite me in?

304
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:19,202
Come on in.

305
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,202
I didn't know you were coming.
Sorry for the mess.

306
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,403
Let me do it.

307
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,122
It's fine.

308
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,842
Don't move.

309
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:49,923
You've got high fever.

310
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,122
Do you want to die?

311
00:21:52,202 --> 00:21:52,962
Let's go to the hospital.

312
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:53,842
I'm not going.

313
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:57,002
Hold on.

314
00:21:57,643 --> 00:21:59,842
I've prepared a surprise for you.

315
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:01,923
I wanted to give it to you
once I recovered.

316
00:22:06,313 --> 00:22:07,873
(Industrial and Commercial Bank of China)

317
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:09,643
What is this?

318
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:11,683
It's the money I earned for the first time

319
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:13,082
without relying on my family

320
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:15,082
or by selling my shoes.

321
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:19,842
Why do you give it to me?

322
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:21,962
Don't you fancy a set of cosmetics?

323
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:23,523
I know you don't want to
spend that much of money.

324
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:24,923
So I buy it for you.

325
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:26,602
Whatever you want,

326
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,323
I'll do my best to get it for you.

327
00:22:31,882 --> 00:22:33,043
Silly.

328
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,443
Don't you like it?

329
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:43,082
I do.

330
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:48,242
No, I don't want you to get infected.

331
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:22,122
The investment in the project of Thomas

332
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:24,163
has exceeded the budget.

333
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,002
Yet you want to top up again?

334
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:27,763
I don't think this project is good.

335
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,362
I think we should put a halt to it
as soon as possible.

336
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,763
-That's right.
-Exactly.

337
00:23:33,602 --> 00:23:35,202
Dilated cardiomyopathy

338
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:38,082
is a highly intractable disease.

339
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,242
If we can find a cure,

340
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:42,563
it will benefit

341
00:23:42,842 --> 00:23:44,043
the company's long-term development.

342
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:46,323
There are many intractable diseases.

343
00:23:46,523 --> 00:23:47,803
Must you choose this?

344
00:23:48,082 --> 00:23:49,242
I've heard there's a researcher
working on this project

345
00:23:49,403 --> 00:23:51,122
called Zhuo Yifeng.

346
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:52,443
Both of you are very close.

347
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:53,842
Is she the one

348
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,362
who proposed this project, right?

349
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:57,803
The upcoming experiment

350
00:23:58,002 --> 00:23:59,403
is vital to the project

351
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,443
as well as the company.

352
00:24:00,643 --> 00:24:02,242
The media has been following it closely.

353
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,643
If we put a halt to it now,

354
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:05,403
it can cause us huge losses

355
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,002
and affect the stocks.

356
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:15,722
Mr. Ouyang.

357
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,923
Here is the latest drug budget.

358
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:27,563
The board of directors has approved it.

359
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,523
You can focus on the experiment.

360
00:24:29,722 --> 00:24:30,923
Thomas has told me

361
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,602
that if it wasn't for you
standing on your ground,

362
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,443
the project might have been stopped.

363
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:35,523
Thank you.

364
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:40,242
I think you still owe me a meal.

365
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:10,163
How is it?

366
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:11,722
I haven't had

367
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,122
such a delicious meal for a long time.

368
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:17,163
You must have had all kinds of great meals.

369
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:19,523
You overpraised me.

370
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:21,362
But the dishes you cooked

371
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,722
make me feel warm as at home.

372
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,523
Why don't you try the soup?

373
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:31,722
My boyfriend doesn't like fungus.

374
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,082
But he always finishes up the soup.

375
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:38,323
Boyfriend?

376
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:41,602
He's Su Muyun. You've met him before.

377
00:26:00,882 --> 00:26:01,763
I'll take you there.

378
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:03,962
No need. I don't ride in a car.

379
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:04,842
Thank you.

380
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,202
We're not taking the car.

381
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:14,602
You taught me to ride a bike, remember?

382
00:26:30,362 --> 00:26:33,043
I've arrived. I'll get going now.

383
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:34,082
All right.

384
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:36,643
You should have more rest.

385
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:39,202
The upcoming experiments
are going to be tedious.

386
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:42,202
Sure, I'll do my best.

387
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:49,842
Why are you here?

388
00:26:49,962 --> 00:26:50,882
Let's go home.

389
00:27:01,643 --> 00:27:02,683
Take off your hand.

390
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,722
What if I refuse?

391
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:09,722
I...

392
00:27:13,962 --> 00:27:15,082
Thomas.

393
00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:21,362
Got it.

394
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:22,643
What's wrong?

395
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:24,202
Did something happen at the lab?

396
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:25,602
Thomas said

397
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,563
the drug upgrading was successful.

398
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,043
Next, we can re-do the experiment.

399
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:31,082
Really?

400
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:32,362
That's so great.

401
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:36,043
Did you hear that?
The drug upgrading is successful.

402
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,443
There's hope for Le Diyin now!

403
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,043
I heard it, you fool.

404
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:40,403
Let's go.

405
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,122
We'll go home.

406
00:27:42,722 --> 00:27:43,763
See you.

407
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:52,466
(Inpatient Department)

408
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,242
I've set the alarm clock

409
00:27:56,403 --> 00:27:57,842
for the flight tomorrow morning.

410
00:27:58,002 --> 00:27:59,403
Thomas will come and pick you up.

411
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:00,882
We'll meet at the airport.

412
00:28:02,002 --> 00:28:02,842
That's perfect.

413
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,283
If I can have a pizza,

414
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,602
it will be even more perfect.

415
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:07,683
What's wrong with you?

416
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,403
Your appetite gets better
as your condition worsens.

417
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:12,362
Do you expect me

418
00:28:12,563 --> 00:28:14,122
to weep my life away

419
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:15,882
and cry all day long?

420
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,043
Although the drug upgrading succeeded,

421
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:25,443
it's still risky to go

422
00:28:25,602 --> 00:28:26,763
to the US for treatment.

423
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,403
If it failed...

424
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,563
Those who gamble for the first time

425
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:33,283
will not be in bad luck.

426
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:35,043
By the way, can you get me

427
00:28:35,202 --> 00:28:36,683
two bottles of Lao Gan Ma?

428
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:38,202
Don't even think about it.

429
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:40,283
You can't take spicy food.

430
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:42,923
If I knew you refused me,

431
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,043
I would have asked Su Muyun for help.

432
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,283
How dare he?

433
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:48,763
Are you ruling him?

434
00:28:48,923 --> 00:28:51,043
You're being so fierce to him now.

435
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:07,502
(Washington)

436
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,043
Concentrate.

437
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,082
Can you be more cautious?

438
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,482
She'll be in the US for only a week

439
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:39,683
and it's for work.

440
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:40,962
What's there to worry?

441
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:41,683
Anyway.

442
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,523
She won't be abducted
by the trafficker, will she?

443
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:44,722
Touch wood.

444
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:45,842
Forget it.

445
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
(A week later)

446
00:30:08,202 --> 00:30:09,122
They're here.

447
00:30:10,443 --> 00:30:11,683
Over here!

448
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:12,842
Over here!

449
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:13,923
You're here.

450
00:30:14,202 --> 00:30:15,323
Thank you.

451
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:33,043
You...

452
00:30:33,803 --> 00:30:35,482
Why are you here?

453
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,403
I've been missing you so much.

454
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:44,323
Mr. Ouyang.

455
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,882
Yes, I've just arrived.

456
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:50,323
All right.

457
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:53,323
What's the matter?

458
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:55,523
I've got some follow-up work to do.

459
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:57,163
I have an urgent meeting.

460
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,283
You just got back. Why do you
need to work in a hurry?

461
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,242
Le Diyin is still being treated
in the US.

462
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:02,763
I can't afford to be slack.

463
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,683
Can't you go back to work tomorrow?

464
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:06,842
Be good.

465
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:09,283
I'll see you as soon
as I finish my work, all right?

466
00:31:13,002 --> 00:31:15,242
Who styled your hair?

467
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:16,923
It got my hand sticky.

468
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:20,362
I just want to stick with you.

469
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,882
Let's go.

470
00:31:47,803 --> 00:31:48,842
Zhuo Yifeng.

471
00:31:49,443 --> 00:31:50,643
Come over here.

472
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,280
Check the details for Thomas's project.

473
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,680
(Zhuo Yifeng)

474
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,323
All right.

475
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,443
Look at you.
Why didn't you get changed

476
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,923
after you got off the plane?

477
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:11,523
You're unkempt.

478
00:32:11,683 --> 00:32:13,323
It affects the company's image.

479
00:32:33,443 --> 00:32:35,362
This is too expensive.

480
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:36,803
Thomas said

481
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:38,763
you haven't rested in
the past week in the US.

482
00:32:38,962 --> 00:32:40,763
Take it as a reward from the company.

483
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,403
Isn't it your birthday today?

484
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:46,403
Please accept it.

485
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:22,842
I heard Xiao Feng was back.

486
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,403
Don't bring her up.

487
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,082
Mr. Ouyang gave her a diamond necklace.

488
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:28,643
What makes her deserve that?

489
00:33:30,202 --> 00:33:31,643
Forget it. Don't be mad.

490
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,283
My brother only enjoys
exploring something new.

491
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,683
Look, she came back on her birthday.

492
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:37,523
I'm sure she has an ulterior motive.

493
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:39,882
So it's Xiao Feng's birthday today?

494
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:41,842
Yes, what about it?

495
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:43,683
I'm thinking

496
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:44,923
of giving her

497
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:46,683
a special birthday gift.

498
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:06,842
Are you done?

499
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:08,242
Not yet.

500
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,803
What time is it now?

501
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:12,523
There are some hiccups.

502
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,922
I just want you not to wait up.
You can eat first.

503
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,482
We can celebrate the birthday tomorrow.

504
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:19,523
Do your work then.

505
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,242
All right. Bye.

506
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,083
Hi.

507
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,402
I would like to cancel the reservation
that I made

508
00:34:28,563 --> 00:34:29,603
at your restaurant tonight.

509
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,700
(Ouyang Qingxue)

00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:59,283
I've heard from my brother
that today is Xiao Feng's birthday.

511
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:00,563
It's none of your business.

512
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:02,442
Don't be so fierce.

513
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:04,642
Have you prepared a gift for Xiao Feng?

514
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:06,442
My brother gave her

515
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,962
a diamond necklace.

516
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:10,682
What do you want?

517
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:13,283
Do you know why Xiao Feng
is working late tonight?

518
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,083
Because my brother
prepared a surprise for her.

519
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:18,722
They are together

520
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:19,763
right now.

521
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:20,763
Are you done?

522
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:21,922
I'm hanging up.

523
00:35:26,763 --> 00:35:27,843
Thomas.

524
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:30,202
I've gone through the latest information.

525
00:35:31,402 --> 00:35:33,002
I hope things will go well after this.

526
00:35:33,242 --> 00:35:34,563
Don't worry.

527
00:35:34,803 --> 00:35:37,323
I'll surely treat Le Diyin.

528
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:38,523
All right?

529
00:35:38,922 --> 00:35:39,843
Thank you.

530
00:35:40,043 --> 00:35:41,323
All right. Bye.

531
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:43,870
(Thomas)

532
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,050
(Zhuo Yifeng)

533
00:35:54,722 --> 00:35:56,603
Brother, why did you give her a necklace?

534
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,123
She doesn't deserve it.

535
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:05,962
Are you going to ignore me too?

536
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:08,803
Even if you manage to win her over,
you won't be together.

537
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,442
I have my own plan.

538
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:15,043
Stay out of it.

539
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:16,803
Can you keep the things
between Ouyang family

540
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,523
and Zhuo family forever?

541
00:36:18,962 --> 00:36:20,162
I feel only guilty

542
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:22,002
towards her.

543
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,523
Nothing else.

544
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,722
Don't over-think it.

545
00:36:26,162 --> 00:36:27,242
Brother.

546
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,363
Didn't I tell you not to wait up?

547
00:36:45,523 --> 00:36:46,803
I've prepared... You...

548
00:36:55,563 --> 00:36:58,563
Did you make this cake?
You're awesome.

549
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:01,043
Keep practicing
and you'll do even better than me.

550
00:37:05,843 --> 00:37:06,922
Isn't it sparkling?

551
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:09,962
It's very expensive. I really like it.

552
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,722
Guess who gave it to me.

553
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:14,722
It's not nice.

554
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:19,642
It's my birthday.

555
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:22,043
Can't you say something nice?

556
00:37:22,202 --> 00:37:23,283
You want something nice?

557
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:25,283
Ask the person who gave it to you
to say nice words.

558
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:27,603
I'm really exhausted today.

559
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,642
Can you not kick up a fuss?

560
00:37:30,563 --> 00:37:31,803
Take a good rest.

561
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:33,442
I won't disturb you then.

Are you feeling better?

576
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:03,803
Do you want to come over

577
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,763
to my studio and have a meal?

578
00:39:06,283 --> 00:39:06,763
No.

579
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,603
You can't say no.

580
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:11,682
My fans amount gets to more
than a million today.

581
00:39:11,803 --> 00:39:14,363
You have to come. Okay?

582
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:21,803
-It's not important.
-Not important?

583
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:23,242
Original flavor?

584
00:39:23,242 --> 00:39:24,283
Okay. Sure.

585
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:26,883
Take that.

586
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:30,563
Look, it's none of our business.

587
00:39:30,682 --> 00:39:32,162
It's better if we stay out of it.

588
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:34,002
What's wrong if friends gather

589
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:36,123
and have a heart-to-heart talk at home?

590
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,402
That makes sense.

591

(Su Muyun)

592
00:39:49,482 --> 00:39:50,642
Su Muyun.

593
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,202
Are you free tonight?

594
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:53,922
Come over to my studio for dinner.

595
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:55,283
I'm not free.

596
00:39:56,442 --> 00:39:57,442
Really?

597
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,162
If so, I might have

598
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:01,682
to ask Xiao Feng to come over alone.

599
00:40:02,803 --> 00:40:03,722
When is the dinner?

600
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:07,442
At 7 o'clock. Be there or be square.

601
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,002
Such a Tsundere.

602
00:40:14,202 --> 00:40:16,043
How could he find a girlfriend on his own?

603
00:40:16,323 --> 00:40:17,242
Dream on!

604
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:18,442
He's hopeless.

605
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,202
Let's buy some beer.

606
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,230
(Demon, it's time to eat)

607
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:45,523
I want that. Get it for me.

608
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:46,843
All right. Here.

609
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:48,883
Keep it to yourself.

610
00:40:49,002 --> 00:40:50,323
I want to eat crayfish.

611
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:52,043
I'll give you a crayfish head.

612
00:40:52,482 --> 00:40:52,962
Are you eating or not?

613
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:53,603
No.

614
00:40:53,722 --> 00:40:55,323
-Are you eating or not?
-No.

615
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:56,682
-Are you eating or not?
-No.

616
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,202
You two haven't said a word

617
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,922
since you came in here.

618
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,162
Are you some stones?

619
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:08,803
-What's going on?
-Exactly.

620
00:41:08,962 --> 00:41:09,843
Have some food.

621
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:11,682
Or else we're going
to finish up everything.

622
00:41:11,843 --> 00:41:12,843
Come on.

623
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,283
Eat them up.

624
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:24,283
You can't have spicy food.
Are you hurting yourself?

625
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,803
I won't look after you anyway.

626
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,202
Let me get this for you.

627
00:41:32,883 --> 00:41:35,043
