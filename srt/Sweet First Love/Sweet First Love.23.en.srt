25
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,040
I want that. Get it for me.

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,000
Keep it to yourself.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,519
I want to eat crayfish.

28
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,639
I'll give you a crayfish head.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,319
No.

30
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,080
Are you eating or not?

31
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:01,720
No.

32
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,919
Are you eating or not?

33
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,639
No.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,680
Are you eating or not?

35
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,399
You two haven't said a word

36
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,960
since you came in here.

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,199
Are you some stones?

38
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,919
-What's going on?
-Right.

39
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:17,839
Have some food.

40
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,800
Or else we're going
to finish up everything.

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
Come on.

42
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,160
Eat them up.

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,320
You can't have spicy food.
Are you hurting yourself?

44
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,639
I won't look after you anyway.

45
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,960
Let me get this for you.

46
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,919
Keep drinking.
Go home yourself if you get drunk.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Are you still treating each other with silence?

48
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,600
Stop being so childish.

49
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,800
That's right.

50
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,360
Quarreling doesn't solve anything.

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,240
Come on.

52
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,399
Cheers.

53
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,000
Let go of all the grudges
after drinking the wine.

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,880
Come on. Cheers.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Drink it up and we're still good friends.

56
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,800
Don't drink the beer.

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,520
I'm going to tell my mum today

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
that I want to marry you.

59
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm still a little girl.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,080
You're my lovely girl.

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,839
Well...

62
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,320
We'll get going now.

63
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Both of you listen to me.

64
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,839
No one can leave

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,960
if you don't talk it through.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,479
Lin Di, she's drunk.

67
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,520
Please take care of her.
We'll get going now.

68
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,479
My dear wife said that

69
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:49,320
you two must reconcile

70
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,880
and get married now.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
What are you looking at?

72
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,039
You can't be like this.

73
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,039
Let me tell you a trick.

74
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,800
You take a seat first.

75
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,080
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

76
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,639
What's going on with you two?

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,639
Tell me about it.

78
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,119
Let me help you to find the problem.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Hold on a minute. I've got a message.

80
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,200

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,760
Well...

86
00:04:56,119 --> 00:04:57,679
I totally forgot about this.

87
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,720
Let me delete it.

88
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,200
What do you mean? Tell me.

89
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,359
There's a misunderstanding.

90
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,359
I can testify that

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,079
she didn't mean it.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
A misunderstanding?

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,320
What misunderstanding?

94
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,880
Just tell me if you need money.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Why are you selling the present

96
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,040
that I gave you?

97
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
What am I to you?

98
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,119
You bought that present.

100
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,559
I accepted the purse.

101
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,559
I can do anything to it.

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,480
It's you who begged me
to be your girlfriend.

103
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,399
Leave me alone.

104
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,040
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
You don't love me anyway.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,799
What am I to you?

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,239
I'll disappear from your life completely.

108
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,440
-Are you happy now?
-Get out.

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,359
That's enough.

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,000
Listen to me, Lin Di.

111
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,359
I don't want

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,640
to see you anymore.

113
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,079
Fine.

Zihui.

115
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,799
Stop crying. I'm running out of tissues.

116
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,519
I just can't help it.

117
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,040
Such a bad guy.

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,440
I swear to god
that I'll never talk to him again.

119
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,720
Well then, why are you
still looking at your phone?

120
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,880
Don't tell me that
you aren't waiting for his call.

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm waiting for his death.

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
You're so in love with him.

123
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,480
Yet you don't want to admit it.

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,880
I finally realized that

127
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,519
all men

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,519
are the same. They're bad.

129
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,720
Stop it. You're crying your eyes out.

please don't leave me.

134
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,079
All right, Professor.

135
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,480
-Is it the data?
-Yes.

136
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,920
-This is the date.
-All right.

Muyun,

138
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,160
I need to talk to you about
your smart home system.

139
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,320
Although you've got the investment at
the initial stage.

140
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,720
You've got stuck in the
implementation of your project.

141
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,839
You have to find a way out.

142
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,480
I'll find a way to solve the problem.

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,399
If you can't solve it in a month

144
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,519
and without the follow-up investment

145
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,119
your start-up will be...

146
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,000
Keep it up.

147
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,880
I'm here to help

148
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:18,160
whenever you need me.

149
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,839
Thank you.

151
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,200
Su Muyun, come and have your dinner.

152
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,320
I've lost all my appetite when I saw you.

153
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,239
Fine.

154
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,479
Then, I'll tell Zhuo Yifeng
that you're on a hunger strike.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,559
You're being too harsh to yourself.

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,280
You work in the laboratory every day.

157
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,960
You're not doing well
in your romantic relationship.

158
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,599
But you're doing well in your business.

159
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,280
I've got some problems with
the implementation of my project.

160
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:56,280
It might be canceled.

161
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,159
Well, same goes for me.

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,679
Such a cruel woman.

165
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,440
Well, you didn't think before you spoke.

166
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,479
Wow, you did it well.

167
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,479
Can Zhuo Yifeng see your thoughts?

168
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,200
Is she talking to you now?

169
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,159
It's so easy to apply.

170
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,679
It's calming and specially designed for
sensitive skin. Its repairing effect

171
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,719
is awesome.

172
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,000
I apply it every morning.

173
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,479
That's why my skin is so good.

174
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,960
You must try it.

175
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,200
Lend me your phone.
I want to watch her live broadcast.

176
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,280
So I have to show you the effect first.

177
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,919
Gently pat on your skin.

178
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Why

179
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,320
doesn't she seem to be sad at all?

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,960
How am I supposed to know the reason?

181
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,359
Aren't you the top student here?

182
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:52,679
Help me to analyze her emotion.

183
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,559
Next, let's try

184
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,479
applying this hand cream.

185
00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,599
I strongly recommend

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,520
this hand cream.

187
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,840
I can guarantee that you'll be amazed by

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,640
what this hand cream can do.

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,280
Do you find any clues?

190
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,840
She still cares about me, right?

191
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,719
She does not seem to be sad at all.

192
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,239
Last but not least,

193
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,039
I would like to recommend this to you.

194
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,200
This necklace is my new love.

195
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,200
I gave it to my best friend
for her birthday gift.

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,719
She loves it very much.

197
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,359
All ladies must have this.

198
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,119
Besides that, all the single gentlemen

199
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,719
shouldn't miss it too.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,119
Isn't it sparkling? It's very expensive.

201
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,679
I really like it.

202
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,479
Guess who gave it to me?

203
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,239
You can't miss it.

204
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:35,799
Come and take a look.

205
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,239
What's going on?

206
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,919
Nothing.

207
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,680
(Ouyang Group)

208
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,119
My dear friend.

209
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,000
There's a cosplay party tonight.

210
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,119
Let's go together.

211
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,159
No.

212
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,400
Is it because of Su Muyun?

213
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't give up the entire pool of good guys

214
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,719
because of one man.

215
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,039
Don't be so stubborn.

216
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Are you saying that I'm being stubborn?

217
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,599
Who cried like a baby
at my house last night?

218
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,599
Well...

219
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,359
Even if I broke up with

220
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,719
a handsome guy,

221
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,760
I could get a more handsome
one to be my boyfriend right away.

222
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,359
I don't have the time to be sad.

223
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,200
A more handsome one?
Well, Where's your next boyfriend?

224
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
My instinct tells me that

225
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,320
he's waiting for me at tonight's
cosplay party

226
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,840
Let's go.

227
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,799
-Come with me.
-I'm exhausted.

228
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,320
I just want to get some sleep.

229
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:28,280
Let's sit here.

230
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,799
I want to leave now.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Go to the left.

232
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,520
Let's go home. We don't know anyone here.

233
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,239
So what? We'll get to know them in a while.

234
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,559
Fine.

235
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,840
Don't drink too much wine.

236
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,359
I'm fine. I'm happy.

237
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,479
Let's have fun!

238
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,640
Here.

239
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Can you smile, Miss Momo No Sei?

240
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,960
We're having a party here. Smile.

241
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,719
All right.

242
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:29,575
(Your location
Riverside coffee at the Sky-park)

243
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Look.

244
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:41,727
(Liu Zihui)

245
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,039
(Cosplay Single Night)
Welcome to the party.

246
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
-Welcome to the party.
-Welcome to the party.

247
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,799
Welcome to the party.

248
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:54,000
Sir,

249
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:54,719
this is

250
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,320
a cosplay party.

251
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,559
You can't get in if you're
not wearing some special costumes.

252
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,200
Welcome to the party.

253
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,559
Is there a clothing shop nearby?

254
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,440
You'll see a shop for special costume
if you turn right at the junction.

255
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,119
But it's going to close soon.

256
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,760
Why don't you go take a look there?

257
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,039
Are you all right?

258
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm fine.

259
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,119
I'm fine.

260
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,200
I need to go to the loo.

261
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,440
All right.

262
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,559
So here you are.

263
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,119
I was looking for you everywhere.

264
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,719
Here.

265
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,119
Cheers.

266
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:51,760
I'm here with friends. I don't drink.

267
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,799
No woman can say no to me.

268
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,440
Are you trying to catch my attention?

269
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,679
You've misunderstood what I said.

270
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Let's have a drink somewhere else.
How about that?

271
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,000
Come on. Don't say no to me.

272
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,760
Come on.

273
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,599
-Let's go.
-Leave me alone.

274
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,559
Come on.

275
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,559
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

276
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,280
Come on.
Come and have some drinks with me.

277
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:22,840
He's so handsome.

278
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,960
Let's go.

279
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,119
Come on.
-You...

280
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,119
Come with me.

281
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,159
Let go...

282
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,520
What are you

283
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,039
doing here?

284
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,440
If I was late for one more second,

285
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,200
you'd be taken away by a beggar.

286
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,599
A beggar?

287
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,840
Look at me. Who am I?

288
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,359
You're so ugly.

289
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,599
Disgusting.

290
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:58,919
Walk slowly. I'm going to fall.

291
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,880
Do you still dare to come
to this place in the future?

292
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,000
That's none of your business.

293
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,799
You're such a good girl.

294
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,520
Others might take you away.

295
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,119
What's wrong? Are you okay?

296
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,880
Does it hurt?

297
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,359
Yes, it hurts.

298
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,040
Does it still hurt?

299
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,479
No.

300
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,359
You...

301
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,880
What are you doing?

302
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,040
You look the most beautiful

303
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,199
when you put this on.

304
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,760
Why did you wake up so early?

305
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,400
Didn't you have much sleep last night?

306
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
No.

307
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
How touching.

308
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,599
I'll make breakfast from now on.

309
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,640
If you really want to help me,

310
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
you should do all the housework
from now on.

311
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,000
Hard-working people are the cutest.

312
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Exactly.

313
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,319
I can create a robot to do the housework.

314
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,359
What's wrong? You don't want to do it?

315
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,400
Nothing.

316
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,880
I have to go to the lab now.

317
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,280
Professor,

318
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,280
I know what's the problem.

319
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,640
What's the problem?

320
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,319
I have always wanted to create
the most advanced system.

321
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,760
And I totally forgot about
the reason why I started this project.

322
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,959
The system that I've created
is too complicated

323
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
It's just a robot.

324
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,280
Go on.

325
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,719
I need to remove something from it.

326
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:00,959
This robot

327
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,520
should be something
that every household needs.

328
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,280
It should be a part of a family.

329
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,359
I've already given a name for this robot.

330
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:07,920
It's called

331
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,800
Su Xiaoai.

332
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,160
But you're leaving for

333
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,040
Global Intelligence Robot Invention Competition

334
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,280
of the Consumer Electronics Show
in New York soon.

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,239
It's too late

336
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,280
to make changes to your system.

337
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:23,839
I've got two weeks left.

338
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,640
I want to give it a try.

339
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,439
Let's go with what we already have.

340
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,560
It's either I try my best
to create a perfect system,

341
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,199
or I give up.

342
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,359
All right.

343
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,400
I've found an assistant for you.

344
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,079
She can definitely help you.

345
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,479
Professor,

346
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm sorry to be late.

347
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,239
What are you doing here?

348
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,199
We're not allowed to eat in the lab.

349
00:20:23,946 --> 00:20:26,186
(The world becomes more wonderful
when you work with smart people.)

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,560
(Mention: Zhuo Yifeng)

351
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
The world becomes more wonderful

352
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
when you work with smart people.

353
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,839
You've worked so hard today.
Enjoy your meal.

354
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,160
(The world becomes more wonderful
when you work with smart people.)

355
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,040
You've worked so hard today.
Enjoy your meal.

356
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,300
(Su Muyun)

357
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,520
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

358
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,959
Are you all right?

359
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:27,160
You'll definitely

360
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,839
be a good father.

361
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:30,000
You've said this.

362
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,640
Would you like to become my child's mother?

363
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,800
Actually,

364
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,199
I think he misunderstood you

365
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,400
for selling the bag.

366
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,119
Stop torturing yourself.

367
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,319
I've tried so many different ways.

368
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,880
I just can't help thinking about him.

369
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,479
Xiao Feng,

370
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:57,959
I've hurt him deeply.

371
00:21:59,239 --> 00:22:01,319
He won't forgive me, right?

372
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,479
But Lin Di loves you.

373
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,119
You two should work out

374
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,560
a solution together.

375
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,160
Not running away from the problem.

376
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:17,839
You're right.

377
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,160
If you really like him,
you should fight for him.

378
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,719
And you must cherish him.

379
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,119
You're in no place to give advice to me.

380
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
You're facing the same problem as I do.

381
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,439
Even I'm convinced by what I've just said.

382
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,000
All right.

383
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,520
I'll go talk to Su Muyun later.

384
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,760
I'll face the problem with him.

385
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,959
And set a good example for you.

386
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,319
To your courage.

387
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,079
Cheers.

388
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,640
Why are you working so hard
for this project?

389
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
I can ask my uncle

390
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,400
to reconsider investing in your project.

391
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,560
I don't need your help.

392
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,959
You really hate me that much?

393
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,800
Su Xiaoai is my project to start a business.

394
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,800
It's also my proposal present.

395
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,079
Su Muyun,

396
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,119
you'll regret what you do today.

397
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,640
Are you jealous?

398
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
What are you talking about?

399
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,400
Excuse me, who are you?

400
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,880
Do we know each other?

401
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,959
I'm upgrading my system now.

402
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,000
My professor insisted
on making her my assistant.

403
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,439
I thought you two got along so well.

404
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,319
No. She hugged me all of a sudden.

405
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
Well,

406
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,599
why didn't you avoid it?

407
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,280
I've already rejected her.

408
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,599
I also told her that the robot was my...

409
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,880
It's my...

410
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,239
Your what?

411
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,599
It's my...

412
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,920
You can't even lie.

413
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,359
You're a bad guy.

414
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,800
The robot is my proposal present.

415
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,560
Zhuo Yifeng, don't forget

416
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,839
who killed your parents.

417
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,640
Who is this?

418
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,439
Are you all right?

419
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm here.

420
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,959
Don't be afraid.

421
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,479
How come you're here?

422
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,719
I was alerted by the bracelet.

423
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,239
Are you all right?

424
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:23,599
Are you feeling all right?

425
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,280
I'm fine.

426
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,359
It's just a nightmare.

427
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,520
I was busy with my project recently

428
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,719
and I completely forgot to
care about your feelings.

429
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm sorry.

430
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,800
I'm just so scared to lose.

431
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:48,319
I should have trusted you.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,880
I shouldn't have doubted you for
what happened to my parents.

433
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,268
You did nothing wrong.

434
00:27:02,108 --> 00:27:03,748
Let's face it together.

435
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:09,628
I don't want to keep running away
from it anymore.

436
00:27:11,748 --> 00:27:13,508
Let's work together to find out the truth.

437
00:27:17,628 --> 00:27:18,748
Okay?

438
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,840
(Equity Acquisition Agreement)

439
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:36,539
(Zhuo Mufeng)

440
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,920
(Ouyang Yuanqin)

441
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:39,988
The Ouyang Group must have had

442
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,349
something to do with
the collapse of Zhuoyang Group.

443
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:44,829
I didn't have much time back then

444
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,388
so I couldn't
snap every page of the contract.

445
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:47,429
And when I went back to search for it,

446
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,949
it's gone.

447
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:50,148
I once saw

448
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:51,988
Ouyang Qingxue holding this contract.

449
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:54,669
Did she threaten you?

450
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,268
Do you think she could threaten me?

451
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:04,709
Professor.

452
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:08,309
All right. I'll be there soon.

453
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:14,709
I've got to go to the lab.

454
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:16,469
See you later.

455

(Ouyang Qingxue)

457
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,669
Xiao Feng, do you want to know the truth?

458
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:04,228
You sent me the message last night, right?

459
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:07,868
Come to my house now

460
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,789
if you want to know the truth.

461
00:29:10,189 --> 00:29:11,349
Come here alone.

462
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:13,988
You won't regret it.

463
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,988
Ouyang Qingxue wants to see me alone.

464
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,148
If I don't get back home safely,

465
00:29:34,589 --> 00:29:36,108
go to her house and pick me up.

466
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:41,309
Professor.

467
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:42,908
You don't have much time left.

468
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,108
If the test fails again,

469
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:47,429
you can't take part in the competition.

470
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:48,988
I'll take all the responsibility.

471
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:50,108
All right.

472
00:29:58,602 --> 00:29:59,602
(Xiao Feng)

473
00:30:00,969 --> 00:30:01,569
(You've got 13 missed calls from Xiao Feng.)

474
00:30:11,748 --> 00:30:13,549
Xiao Feng, come on in.
Take a seat.

475
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,108
Take a seat.

476
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,268
Just cut to the chase.

477
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,949
What do you know about

478
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:23,429
what happened back then?

479
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,309
Before the accident,

480
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,589
your parents' car was sent for inspection.

481
00:30:40,148 --> 00:30:41,268
Do you know

482
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:42,789
who the person in charge was?

483
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:45,549
It's the assistant of

484
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:46,949
your adoptive father, Su Zijian.

485
00:30:47,108 --> 00:30:48,189
He's Chen Jun.

486
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:58,028
The day after the car was repaired,

487
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,628
the accident happened.

488
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:01,469
Coincidentally,

489
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,069
the day after the accident,
Chen Jun received

490
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:05,829
a huge amount of money.

491
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,469
Do you know who transferred
the money to his bank account?

492
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,549
It's Su Zijian's wife,
your adoptive mother,

493
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,028
Yang Keying.

494
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:19,028
What you're holding is the evidence.

495
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:22,153
(Car Inspection Report)

496
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:34,628
Is this the only evidence you've got?

497
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:36,349
Do you still remember
the car inspection report

498
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:37,988
that I showed you the other day?

499
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:39,868
Xiao Feng,

500
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:41,669
the Su family
orchestrated the entire accident

501
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:43,829
to kill your parents.

502
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:45,669
Why are you so stupid?

503
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,148
There's a saying.

504
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:51,069
You're treating the murderers as a family.

505
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:05,309
Ouyang Qingxue wants to see me alone.

506
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,228
If I don't get back home safely,

507
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,988
go to her house and pick me up.

508
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,600
(Xiao Feng)

509
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,748
The number you have dialed

510
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:17,508
is unavailable.

511
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:18,880
(Ouyang Yu)

512
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:26,868
Ouyang Qingxue
lured Xiao Feng to your house.

513
00:32:27,189 --> 00:32:28,829
You'd better take a look.

514
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,789
Why should I believe you?

515
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,148
It's the evidence. Why should I lie to you?

516
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,189
I know it hurts you.

517
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:45,908
But it's the truth. You've got to face it.

518
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:48,429
The Su family
did such a thing to your family.

519
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:49,949
Su Muyun and you

520
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,589
will not have a happy ending.

521
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,908
Finally, that's your main purpose.

522
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:59,589
You're hoping that Su Muyun and I

523
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:00,908
could break up.

524
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,108
Xiao Feng,

525
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:03,789
You'll get more pain

526
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:05,028
if you are with him.

527
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:06,628
You won't be happy.

528
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:08,829
Time is the best cure.

529
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,268
I'm here to help you.

530
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:12,829
I can send you to the US for further study.

531
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:14,589
To get the best medical school.

532
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:17,388
I'll help you to leave here
and start all over again.

533
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,988
You want to send me to study abroad?

534
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:25,669
Are you all right?

535
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:28,429
Don't worry. I'm fine.

536
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,988
What do you want from her?

537
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:41,628
We're just chatting.

538
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:43,628
I'm sharing a very important secret

539
00:33:43,748 --> 00:33:45,189
with Xiao Feng.

540
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:49,748
What brings you two here?

541
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:23,708
Qingxue,

542
00:34:26,028 --> 00:34:27,909
I'm so disappointed in you.

543
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:53,708
Xiao Feng,

544
00:34:56,789 --> 00:34:58,668
I didn't want
to tell you the truth initially.

545
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:12,988
Mr. Zhuo,

546
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:14,508
I'm a reporter from Metropolis Daily.

547
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:16,149
The fund chain of the Zhuo Group

548
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:17,069
went wrong overnight.

549
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:18,748
Was there any reason behind?

550
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:20,869
I've made a wrong decision.

551
00:35:21,028 --> 00:35:22,188
I believed in the wrong people.

552
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,789
Mr. Zhuo, do you mean

553
00:35:24,948 --> 00:35:27,428
your current business partner,
Ouyang Group?

554
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:28,668
Partner?

555
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,309
That's their well-planned conspiracy.

556
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:34,188
We've heard that all the senior
managers of Zhuoyang Group

557
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:35,549
have resigned.

558
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:38,028
Do you have any plans to deal with
all these troubles?

559
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:40,668
My best friend, Mr. and Mrs. Su Zijian,

560
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,268
are very good at company management.

561
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:45,028
We'll work together to
overcome the difficulties.

562
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,789
Mr. Zhuo, about your company...

563
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:48,268
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:51,069
My wife and daughter are still waiting
for me. Goodbye.

565
00:35:58,188 --> 00:35:59,109
So,

566
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:00,948
the recording you gave me is fake.

567
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:02,468
Brother,

568
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:04,069
what are you doing?

569
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,228
What's the truth exactly?

570
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,869
Back then,

571
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,589
Ouyang Group was growing very well

572
00:36:17,988 --> 00:36:19,188
under the leadership of my father.

573
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:23,468
Zhuoyang Group was his biggest competitor.

574
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,549
In order to remove the threat

575
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,188
brought by Zhuoyang Group,

576
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,069
my father used

577
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:30,468
a very extreme means
to win the competition.

578
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,109
He pretended
to collaborate with Zhuoyang Group.

579
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,789
In fact, he was destroying
the backbone of Zhuoyang Group.

580
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:37,988
All talented employees left Zhuoyang Group.

581
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:39,428
He also cut its fund chain.

582
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,988
And Zhuoyang Group filed
for bankruptcy eventually.

583
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:47,668
So, she gave me a fake recording.

584
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:51,629
The car inspection certificate is also fake.

585
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:53,549
Besides that,

586
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:56,789
the share transfer contract is fake as well.

587
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:00,829
So, the Su family is innocent, right?

588
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,508
The Su couple,

589
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,668
who were the partner of Zhuoyang Group,

590
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,789
trusted Zhuoyang Group very much.

591
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:09,069
They were also very supportive of

592
00:37:09,069 --> 00:37:10,988
the collaboration between
Zhuoyang Group and Ouyang Group.

593
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:14,188
They shared a lot of internal information

594
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:16,468
with Ouyang Group.

595
00:37:20,389 --> 00:37:22,668
They could do nothing when they discovered

596
00:37:25,988 --> 00:37:27,349
my father's conspiracy.

597
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,069
My father

598
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,309
had already hollowed out Zhuoyang Group

599
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,549
and took over Zhuoyang Group.

600
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:37,268
The share transfer contract

601
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:39,228
is real.

602
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:41,789
Maybe

603
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:43,869
to your parents,

604
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,349
the Su family would always be trustworthy.

605
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:50,309
All the other documents

606
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:56,789
were all forged by Qingxue.

607
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,909
I'm sorry.

608
00:38:27,028 --> 00:38:28,268
Ouyang Qingxue,

609
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,589
why are you doing all these?

610
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:34,948
Why am I doing all these?

611
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,188
It's all because of you, Su Muyun.

612
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:41,948
What?

613
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:44,589
Back then,
my father paid a visit to your house

614
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:47,909
to persuade your parents to work with him.

615
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:50,708
I was very fond of you

616
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:52,549
when I saw you at your house
for the first time.

617
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:54,948
But you...

618
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,309
You didn't even look at me.

619
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,668
All you can see

620
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,668
was Zhuo Yifeng.

621
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:09,349
We're so thankful for your trust.

622
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,349
This belongs to Sister Xiao Feng.

623
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,428
This is for Sister Xiao Feng.

624
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:15,228
Here you go, Sister.

625
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:16,708
Let me help you to put this on.

626
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,309
Look at your son, Xiao Yun.

627
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:21,668
-Do I look good?
-He's a mischievous boy.

628
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,468
I felt so humiliated by you.

629
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:26,468
That was the most humiliating day in my life.

630
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:29,428
You destroyed my self-esteem.

631
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,589
I always

632
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:33,708
get what I want

633
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,468
since I was born.

634
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:37,748
But I can't get Su Muyun.

635
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,389
No matter how hard I've tried,

636
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,389
he sees nothing but you.

637
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:44,268
You're my worst nightmare.

638
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:47,869
I've tried so hard to excel.

639
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:50,508
I want Su Muyun to recognize me.

640
00:39:50,748 --> 00:39:51,748
I want him to fall in love with me.

641
00:39:53,228 --> 00:39:54,508
But

642
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:57,428
he sees nothing but you,
the most ordinary girl.

643
00:39:58,428 --> 00:39:59,549
What do you have?

644
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:01,789
Why can you have him?

645
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:04,988
I don't remember a thing about

646
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,629
what you've just said.

647
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:09,789
Ouyang Qingxue,

648
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:12,789
you think that the world has failed you.

649
00:40:13,468 --> 00:40:15,748
Actually, you're the one who
misinterprets the world.

650
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:19,069
What makes you think that

651
00:40:19,268 --> 00:40:20,829
you'll get everything you want?

652
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:24,589
Don't make yourself a victim.

653
00:40:24,988 --> 00:40:27,149
No one wants to hurt you.

654
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:28,549
You get all these

655
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,789
because you're so possessive.

656
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:33,988
Do you know me well?

657
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,869
How could you define me with your standard?

658
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:39,228
Are you done?

659
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:41,869
Are you done talking?

660
00:40:42,829 --> 00:40:43,428
Qingxue,

661
00:40:43,549 --> 00:40:44,069
-You...
-Qingxue,

662
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:45,668
-Why are you helping her?
-Qingxue.

663
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:46,789
You're my brother.

664
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:48,829
Why are you helping her instead?

665
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:50,309
-Calm down.
-Why are you doing this?

666
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,589
Calm down.

667
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,508
Qingxue.

668
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:57,228
Calm down.

669
00:40:57,228 --> 00:40:59,268
-Brother, let go of me.
-Calm down.

670
00:40:59,428 --> 00:41:00,789
-Let go of me.
-Qingxue.

671
00:41:01,028 --> 00:41:01,948
Brother.

672
