26
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,119
Do you work as a security guard here?

27

This bench is comfortable.

It's getting cold. Leave now.

No one will look after you if you get sick.

00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,360
Will you ignore me even if I'm sick?

33
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,720
I...

34
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,720
I will be fine.

I've been wearing this watch.

It will protect me.

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,039
Don't worry.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,199
I'm worried.

41
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,440
I can be relieved only when
I take care of you in person.

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,279
Go home soon.

43
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,119

90
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,119
Hello, Mr. Ouyang.

91
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
Send me the footage of the Data Room.

92
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,359
All right. I'll send it immediately.

94

(Mingxian University)

95
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,959
Don't you feel it dry if you only eat bread?

96
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,480
Do you want to try my self-made drink?
It can make you white.

97
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
Are you attending the class or not?

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,679
Sis.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,359
I have a request.

100
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,839
Tell me after class.

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
The assignment this time
is of great difficulty.

102
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,799
But one of you

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
exceeded my expectations.

104
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,119
I'll invite her up here

105
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,231

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,799
Come up.

108
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,920
My paper focused on

109
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,720
the research of
using Trimetazidine to help with

110
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,040
dilated cardiomyopathy.

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,359
The reason I've picked this topic

112
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,920
is that my best friend

113
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,000
is suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy.

114
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,559
You are the most cultured friend

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,959
that I have.

116
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,440
Please.

117
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,000
Come on. Don't.

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
I can't be your model.

119
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,079
Help me.

120
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,399
It's too expensive to hire a model.

121
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't even afford to eat.

122
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,399
Let's talk about it next time.

123
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,160
I have to return to the office.
I'm running late.

124
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,600
You are not eating?

125
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,799
I'll contact you later.

126
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,959

127
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,200
Xiao Feng, help me...

128
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,080
You short Legs. Why are you running?

129
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,479
Why not participate in

130
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,760
the Olympics as you can run so fast?

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,799
Move!

132

Take it.

135
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,640
How could the cafeteria be so generous

136
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,200
to offer such a good lunch box.

137
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
I'm really going to be late.

138
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,080
My salary will be deducted if I'm late.

139
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440

140

00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,280
Yes.

171
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,479
I got it.

172
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:55,663
(Data Room)

173
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,799
What?

174
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,799
I left a document on my car.

175
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,880
I need it for the meeting later.
Go and get it for me.

176
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,440
But I'm keying in the data.

177
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,320
Marketing department said it's urgent.

178
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
It won't take long
for you to go to the parking lot.

179
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,280
All right.

180
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,880
(Ouyang Group)

181
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,559
Recalculate these.

182
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,679
These are all wrong.

183
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,159
-Take a look at other data too.
-Excuse me.

184
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,679
There is not signal in the parking lot.

185
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,919
I didn't find your car.

186
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,799
Perhaps you remembered
your license plate wrongly?

187
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,640
I suddenly remembered that

188
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,960
I didn't drive today.

189
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,440
You...

190
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,400
You should have told me earlier

191
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,159
if you couldn't find the car.

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
Didn't I tell you just now?

193
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,840
I need that document urgently.

194
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,960
Can you take the responsibility

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,200
if the meeting is delayed?

196
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,520
If it's really urgent,

197
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,840
you could reprint it.

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,679
Leaving it in your car

199
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,880
means you don't care about it.

200
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,119
Also,

201
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,599
finding something from your car

202
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,159
is not part of my job.

203
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,280
Now that I helped you,

204
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,280
shouldn't you thank me?

205
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,159
Zhuo Yifeng.

206
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,039
Come with me for a while.

207
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,960
Take a look inside.

208
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,599
There's a banquet tonight.

209
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,679
I want you to be my partner.

210
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,039
Are you free for that?

211
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,760
I...

212
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,679
Sir.

213
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,919
The proposal from the advertising department

214
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
needs your signature.

215
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,599
Leave it here.

216
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,960
I'll sign it later.

217
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,159
I don't think I'm suitable for that.

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,159
I want to focus

219
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,799
on Thomas' project.

220
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,880
And I need to take care of my sick friend.

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,960
It's all right.

222
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,159
You have the right to reject me.

223
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll be leaving then.

224
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,679
I noticed that you liked it just now.

225
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,840
It's for you.

226
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,719
For me?

227
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,599
This is the Autumn Limited Edition.

228
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,000
It's hard to get it.

229
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,400
It's fine as long as you like it.

230
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,520
Thank you.

231
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,039
How did Xiao Feng do at the office?

232
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:03,119
She was actually quite capable.

233
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,799
I underestimated her.

234
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,599
What happened?

235
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,863
Mr. Ouyang invited her to the banquet tonight.

236
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,960
He even gave her accessories and clothes.

237
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,200
Didn't my brother

238
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,272
bring you to all the previous banquets?

239
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,960
I'll accept it

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,239
if she's more capable than me

241
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,599
in all sides.

242
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
But she is just an intern.

243
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,599
How dare her.

244
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,359
Furthermore,

245
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,479
she even rejected his invitation.

246
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,160
Xiao Feng rejected my brother?

247
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,559
Looks like she's playing hard to get.

248
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,760
I'll not let her get her own way easily.

249
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,359
Let's have a look over there.

250
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:43,400
All right.

251
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,560
It'll be best if he doesn't come.

252
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,839
Su Muyun.

253
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,000
Su Muyun.

254
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,160
Stay away from Liu Zihui.

255
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,959
We've started dating each other.

256
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,680
To be honest,

257
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,880
today's game was very exciting.

258
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,640
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

259
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,400
Let's go.

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,400
That shot was great.

261
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,640
Of course, drink more later.

262
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,239
Come, have a seat!

263
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,359
-Sit over there, you two.
-I'm starving.

264
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,599
-Hurry.
-We're finally here.

265
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,239
Bros, now that we are so happy today,

266
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,560
why not have a feast
and get drunk tonight, all right?

267
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,479
Yes!

268
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,040

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,079

We'd have a happy life.

278
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,760

283
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,839
Lin Di.

284
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,680
He looks like in low spirit.

285
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,920
Who offended him?

286
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:47,520
Liu Zihui.

287
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,160
Liu Zihui.

288
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,079
Liu Zihui.

289
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,520
Can you be a bit more reserved?

290
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,479
It's me who had dated with you.

291
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,160
Who dated with you?

292
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,640
When did we ever date?

293
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,760
Last time.

294
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,239
I even have been your model.

295
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,079
Was that a date?

296
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,160
You're just a backup at most.

297
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,880
You...

298
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,319
Lin Di.

299
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,560
Come on.

300
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:11,719
Drink it up.

301
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:12,880
We're leaving!

302
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,040
Take care!

303
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,239
Take it slow. Bye.

304
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:16,520
I'll get going.

305
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,760
Su Muyun.

306
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,439
You haven't drunk with me yet.

307
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:32,079
What are you doing?

308
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,160
A toast.

309
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,518
I'll drink it up. Suit yourself.

310
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,680
Whatever.

311
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:42,560
Have you quarreled with Xiao Feng?

312
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:45,400
Tell me the truth.

313
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,359
Do you like Xiao Feng?

314
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,640
Don't be shy.

315
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,839
You are free to like who you want.

316
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,800
But I like you!

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
But I like Xiao Feng more.

318
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,520
If you like Xiao Feng,

319
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,239
I won't like you then.

320
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,319
It's nothing.

321
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,479
What are you talking about?

322
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,319
Who like whom?

323
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,000
Who doesn't like whom?

324
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,319
Get away.

325
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,680
Su Muyun.

326
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Do you dare to have
a drink competition with me?

327
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,080
(Monica)

328
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,839
I've sent you some documents through e-mail.

329
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,359
Sort them out and send to me later tonight.

330
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,680
I...

331
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,239
Liu Zihui! Liu Zihui!

332
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
What?

333
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,599
Look.

334
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:19,839
I won.

335
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,280
He drank a few bottles before that.

336
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,920
It's not a win.

337
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,199
What are you doing?

338
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,920
I don't care. I'm sending you home.

339
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,319
I don't want it.

340
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,479
What are you doing?

Yes.

Your house is too far

515

what happened between us?

521
