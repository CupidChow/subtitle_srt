(Episode 2)

25
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:53,720
It's a precious opportunity
to sit beside me.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,680
I'll give you a chance.

27
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:57,680
As long as you...

28
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,160
No need, thanks.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,760
I haven't got even with you

30
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,480
for scribbling my notebook.

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,239
I can help you with the pre-test.

32
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,160
I've made my choice.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,199
Who is it?

34
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:18,119
You really don't plan to sit with me?

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,360
You are my last choice.

36
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm not worthy to sit with

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,479
a cosmic-level top student like you.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,440
If you flunk again,
you'll have to repeat the grade.

39
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,479
Okay, brother.

40
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,720

Jia Qing.

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,279
Yu Wenguang.

47
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,040
I don't want to sit
in the first row this time.

48
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,399
Not bad.

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,320
Li Na

50
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:06,960
Alright, get in.

51
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,520
Okay.

52
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,800
From now on, I'll be your deskmate.

53
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,279
Whatever.

54
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,880
Su Muyun.

55
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,919
Hope we could get on well.

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
Su Muyun.

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,520
Me.

58
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,119
Here, here...

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,199
You're welcome.

60
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,800
Su Nianfeng,

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,759
how much for Su Muyun's gossip?

62
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,519
Can I sit here?

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,839
Buddy,

64
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:30,839
where can I get hot water in school?

65
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,640
Be quiet.

66
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Teacher is here.

67
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Be quiet.

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,160
I bet you've already known

69
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:41,760
the enrolment rate of Huiming High School.

70
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
This pre-test

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,359
will indicate your future.

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,600
If you get poor results,

73
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,119
there is still hope.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
Besides repeating the second grade,

75
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,286
there is another option.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,000
You can choose any arts and sports classes

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,240
like painting and music classes.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
It's an alternative way to success.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,400
Put away all the books on your desks.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,040
What happened?

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Nothing.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Are you feeling unwell?

83
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Or are you...

84
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,559
I've just realized that

85
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,799
neither am I good at arts nor sports.

86
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
So, I'm worried about the exam.

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,440
Stop whispering, concentrate on the exam.

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Let's begin the English listening test.

89
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,385
(Mock Examination, English answer sheet)

90
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,720
(If you want to adopt an animal,)

91
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,480
(first,)

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
(we need to know some references.)

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,480
It's the same clip that
Su Muyun played this morning.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
(References? People I know?)

95
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,440
(Yes.)

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,359
(Friends, teachers...)

97
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,799
(We need to talk to some people...)

98
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,119
The rest that hasn't been scribbled

99
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,200
are the same with the exam questions.

100
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,279
(We want to be sure that you can
take good care of an animal.)

101
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,079
(Is that all?)

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,200
(No, there's more.)

103
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,720
(Have you ever had an animal?)

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,079
(Yes. When I was eighteen,)

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,959
(I have a cat,)

106
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,959
(a very cute cat.)

107
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,640
Su Muyun, collect the test papers
after the class

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,520
and come to my office when you're free.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Help me mark the test papers.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,040
Here.

111
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,560
I was about to say something nice,
but you treat me this bad.

112
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Let's go to the cafeteria together.

113
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:30,720
Sure, I'll bring you there.

114
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:32,480
I'm not going, I'm not hungry.

115
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,320
I didn't say I'd bring you.

116
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:46,880
You've just finished the meal.
Yet you're walking so fast.

117
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you in low spirit?

118
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,480
Seating arrangement is based
on grade ranks.

119
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:55,200
Who'd want to sit next to
a study slacker like me?

120
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,679
Of course I feel sad.

121
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,279
This is the best key school.

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
How can there be any study slackers?

123
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,839
Indeed, back then

124
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,760
I was good enough to get enrolled.

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,880
If it was not
for taking care of my brother...

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,640
Your brother?

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,640
Yes, his name is Su Muyun,

128
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,040
an egomaniac.

129
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,160
He's in our class too,

130
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,279
the one surrounded by many girls.

131
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,440
I see.

132
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,640
I didn't expect you two are a family.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,080
You guys have totally different
temper and personality.

134
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,239
Yes, he is handsome,

135
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,880
and he's better-looking than me.

136
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,399
Although I am a foster child,

137
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,359
my foster parents treat me so well,

138
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,880
just like a family.

139
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,560
I mean, you're way more adorable
and good-tempered.

140
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,719
Really? Thank you.

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,640
Who...

142
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,520
Shit of luck.

143
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,719
What is this?

144
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,120
Fried potato, eggplant and green pepper.

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,160
The best rice bowl by the school gate.

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,919
It's like dog's food,

147
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,440
with gutter oil.

148
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,359
I'd rather starve to death.

149
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,159
Just make do with it.

150
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Not everyone is so lucky as you

151
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,679
to have someone cook for you every day.

152
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,239
You mean Su Nianfeng?

153
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,359
She's poor in every way,

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,559
except cooking.

155
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:35,599
Hurry up, have a try.

156
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,239
The rice tastes amazing.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
We're in senior year,

158
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,599
do you have any plans?

159
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
Take the college entrance examination.

160
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,239
Are you talking nonsense?

161
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
Qi Yuan and I are going to the same college.

162
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,160
You and Xiao Feng can't get into
the same college, right?

163
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:01,658
For the sake of my food,

164
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:04,638
She has to follow wherever I go.

165
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,119
I mean, you're way more adorable
and good-tempered.

166
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
I don't want to waste it.

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,760
for Su Muyun.

171
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,679
Su Muyun, this is for you.

172
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,799
Open it up.

173
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
No, thanks.

174
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,640
What's that?

175
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,960
Are you Su Muyun's teammate?

176
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,640
Here you go, please accept this gift.

177
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,599
It's for me?

178
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,239
This pair of shoes

179
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,679
is sold out everywhere, right?

180
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,919
I've seen it before, it's limited edition.

181
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,159
I'm so envious.

182
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,239
Let's go.

183
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,000
It would be so cool to wear them.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,760
I know.

185
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,520
I'm sorry,

186
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,200
it's not my size. Thanks.

187
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,640
Su Nianfeng,

188
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,919
your brother has

189
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,479
messed up two of my businesses.

190
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,136
First, he wouldn't let me sit beside you.

191
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,400
The gossip fee worth

192
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:44,401
100 million is gone.

193
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,719
Second, Liu Zihui took my

194
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,280
most expensive pair of shoes to give him.

195
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,760
I lost 200 million in total.
What should I do?

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,119
I...

197
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,119
Tell me.

198
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Hey, girl. Excuse me.

199
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,679
My brother is too ignorant.

200
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
Perhaps, your gift is too expensive,

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
so he dare not accept it.

202
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,559
If you want to buy him gifts,

203
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,080
you can buy him a notebook,

204
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,520
writing paper or something else.

205
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,880
Why do you keep talking bro and sis?

206
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,919
Why are you everywhere?

207
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,280
It's so out-dated.

208
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,080
What?

209
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,960
We are real siblings who grew up together.

210
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
We're just not related by blood.

211
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
I can be the witness.

212
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,799
I see, then we're a family. Sister,

213
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,159
what does he like?

214
00:12:22,557 --> 00:12:24,317
Your title of the composition test today is

215
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:25,749
(Ideal)

216
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
"Ideal."

217
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,840
Create your own subject matter,
no word number limit.

218
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,760
You're required to write
based on your true thoughts.

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,920
You won't get zero mark for
writing a composition.

220
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,919
Just write anything that you want to do.

221
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,119
I've spent most of my time

222
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,840
dealing with Su Muyun.

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
I've never really thought about
what I want to do.

224
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,906
Just write down the things
that you're good at.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,680
It's also another way of thinking.

226
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:39,892
Give me your evidence of crime.

227
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,039
What evidence?

228
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
The proof of puppy love.

229
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,440
I'm telling mom and dad.

230
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,599
Your love letters

231
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,640
are all piled up in my room.

232
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,839
Then, I will tell Qin Yao

233
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,080
that you have a new sweetheart.

234
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,200
You...

235
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,120
If you dare to say that to him, I'll...

236
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,920
I'll break all ties with you.

237
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,479
Okay.

238
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:06,774
I'm the least important one, right?

239
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,693
(Senior Year College Entrance Examination
Oath-taking Rally)

240
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,000
Next, please welcome

241
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,360
Su Muyun from Year 3 Class 5
to deliver his speech.

242
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,280
What are you doing?

243
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,799
You did it on purpose.

244
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,719
I'm still not done with you

245
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,200
after you robbed Su Muyun's
information from me.

246
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,320
Okay, I'm always available for you.

247
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,880
Dear teachers and students.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,799
Hello, everyone.

249
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,880
I am a student representative, Su Muyun.

250
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,320
From today onwards,

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,080
our senior-year life will begin officially.

252
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:03,854
The college entrance examination
is drawing closer too.

253
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Once we entered into Huiming High School

254
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
with our visions and dreams

255
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,119
and planted a wish here.

256
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,520
We've pursued our dreams

257
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,320
in the slight spring chill.

258
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,880
We continue to stay firm

259
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,520
under the pouring rain in summer.

260
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,760
We are filled with passion

261
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,280
in the autumn wind.

262
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,520
We have left our footprints

263
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,039
on the snowy path in winter.

264
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Back then,

265
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,080
we were confused and hesitated.

266
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,919
But yesterday is already history.

267
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,520
What's waiting for us now

268
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,359
is our bright distant future.

269
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,200
Let us work together

270
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,479
to compose the best youth symphony.

271
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,880
Huiming High School is like a launching pad.

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,240
And all of us

273
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
are like Shenzhou rockets poised to launch,

274
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,440
roaring and rising into the sky,

275
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,039
and flying towards the shore of ideal.
Thank you.

276
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,919
Thank you, Su Muyun for your speech.

277
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,320
It's truly amazing.

278
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,799
Su Muyun

279
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,640
has maintained an excellent
academic performance.

280
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,880
He's developed morally, intellectually,
physically and aesthetically,

281
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,280
and has won various school-level
and city-level awards.

282
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,679
He is the pride of our school,

283
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:18,159
and a role model for all students here today.

284
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,479
Students,

285
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,640
senior year has started.

286
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,800
If you feel downhearted now,

287
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,840
then you can only dream on.

288
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,720
But if you work hard now,

289
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,720
then you will realize your dream.

290
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,400
Next, all National Science
Olympiad participants,

291
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
please gather at the podium.

292
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
The rest of you, dismissed.

293
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:58,462
Which college do you plan to go?

294
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,320
I always want to study medicine,

295
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,919
but my grades are not good enough.

296
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,359
What about you?

297
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,079
I'm still considering.

298
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,199
Shall we go for a meal?

299
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:12,357
Hurry up, go home and cook for me.

300
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
Sorry, I need to go home.

301
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,839
Maybe next time.

302
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:23,760
Is it fun?

303
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,199
Nana, do you want to go higher?

304
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,719
I want to fly.

305
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,599
Skinny monkey, get down.

306
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,719
It's my turn.

307
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,640
Don't you dare bully my sister.

308
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,599
She's not your sister.

Can you help me?

338
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,520
I've made a lot of delicious food
for you today.

339
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,800
Okay.

340
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,640
Come, Xiao Feng.

341
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:11,760
Have some meat.

342
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,000
-Eat more.
-Okay.

343
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,400
Why didn't you tell me that

344
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,719
mom and dad were back?

345
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
You'll know it when you get back.

346
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
While we're in London these few days,

347
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,327
all we had were

348
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,319
fried fish and french fries for every meal.

349
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,359
The foreigners

350
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,920
love using induction cooker.

351
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,199
How can you cook a decent meal

352
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,839
without open flame?

353
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,280
Am I right, Xiao Feng?

354
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,320
But,

355
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,640
the humanistic atmosphere
in Europe is quite good.

356
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,119
From now onwards,
both of you should study hard.

357
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,560
When you graduate,

358
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:44,239
you get to travel abroad as a reward.

359
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,280
Great.

360
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,560
But her English...

361
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,359
She'll get lost in a foreign country.

362
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,800
I can cook anyway. I won't starve to death.

363
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:51,959
It's you who should be worried.

364
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:54,079
You lead an easy life
with everything provided.

365
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,839
Xiao Feng, Xiaoyun.

366
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,680
We are very busy recently.

367
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,520
So, you have to learn
how to take care of yourself.

368
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,479
Especially you.

369
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,359
Xiao Feng is so obedient.

370
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,959
She keeps herself busy every day.

371
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,800
You're indeed my sweet honey.

372
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,000
Is it holding up

373
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,359
too much of your studying time?

374
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes, puppy love did hold up a lot of time.

375
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:19,887
I...

376
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,359
-Puppy love?
-I didn't. Nonsense.

377
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Yes, you do.

378
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,080
The guilty party files the suit first.

379
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,439
Fine, hold on.

380
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,560
What is that?

381
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,560
While you're gone for a month,

382
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,479
Su Muyun threw his socks everywhere 13 times,

383
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,920
which made me arrive late 18 times.

384
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,599
And he entered my room
without my permission 7 times.

385
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,280
And also, he didn't turn off
the TV after watching.

386
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,319
You're poor at math, let me
do the calculations for you.

387
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,239
You...

388
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't need your help.

389
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,000
I've counted it 5 times with a calculator.

390
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,479
Xiaoyun, I've told you so many times.

391
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
You should be polite to Xiao Feng.

392
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,920
Anyway, Xiao Feng.

393
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,719
Academic performance

394
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,120
is not the only standard
for measuring a student.

395
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,839
My only hope

396
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,280
is to see you

397
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,560
healthy and safe, growing up happily.

398
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:13,599
Yes.

399
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,959
We just want you to be happy.

400
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,400
The grades are not important.

401
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,199
If you can't get into
a good domestic university,

402
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,359
we can send you abroad

403
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,000
to study your favorite major.

404
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,040
Tell me earlier if you want to go abroad.

405
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,959
Then I'll prepare for IELTS or TOEFL.

406
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,880
Do you know what did I write
for my composition

407
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,760
titled "Ideal" this afternoon?

408
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,719
What?

409
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,560
My ideal is

410
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,640
to stay away from you.

411
00:21:46,959 --> 00:21:48,359
Xiaoyun, come in.

412
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,359
-What is it?
-Have a seat.

413
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,839
Xiaoyun.

414
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,119
Senior year

415
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,479
is the most important year in school.

416
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Your sister's grades are getting worse.

417
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,000
As her brother,

418
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,479
you should care more

419
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,079
and help her more often.

420
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,839
I know.

421
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,880
Xiao Feng has good genes.

422
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,280
She's exceptionally smart since youth.

423
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,800
If it were not for...

424
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
Anyway,

425
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,599
help her more.

426
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:32,239
Your sister has been haunted

427
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,400
by the events in her childhood.

428
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,239
Furthermore, she has

429
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,479
always been taking care of you in life.

430
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,319
(Xiao Feng has good genes.)

431
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,479
(She's exceptionally smart since youth.)

432
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,119
(If it were not for...)

433
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,599
The pre-test results are out.

434
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,719
Come and get your paper
when I call upon your name.

435
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,959
Su Muyun.

436
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,479
Full marks.

437
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,079
Well done.

438
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,560
The following students also did quite well.

439
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,119
Pan Yuchen.

440
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,199
Zhao Jingming.

441
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,359
Everyone has his paper, right?

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,119
Sir.

443
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,359
I didn't get my paper.

444
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:36,926
I hope you're not discouraged.

445
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,119
Keep up the hard work.

446
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:43,693
(English answer sheet)

447
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,719
Let's have a seat here.

448
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,359
I don't have many friends.

449
00:24:11,768 --> 00:24:13,488
I don't know how to comfort others.

450
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,719
I don't deserve to be comforted.

451
00:24:23,576 --> 00:24:25,079
When you're suffering,

452
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,840
think of those who suffer even more.

453
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,400
Maybe, you'll feel better.

454
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,719
In psychology, this is called

455
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,119
sharing anxiety.

456
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm afraid

457
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,959
I don't know anyone
who suffers more than me.

458
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,359
Me.

459
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
You?

460
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:43,959
Stop joking, your results are so good.

461
00:24:45,439 --> 00:24:47,479
I got sick when I was still young.

462
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,800
The doctor said I couldn't live long.

463
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
Therefore, to me

464
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,880
as long as I'm alive,

465
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,400
then life is good

466
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,400
and meaningful.

467
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,520
I...

468
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,719
I didn't know you're that sick.

469
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,079
So learning is just a phase of your life.

470
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,079
There are endless possibilities
in your future.

471
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,466
(The Devil is calling...)

472
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,000
I'll get going.

473
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,239
You really...

474
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,439
All of your compositions are quite similar.

475
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,479
Su Nianfeng, come here.

476
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,719
Read it out to everyone

477
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,400
about your unique ideal.

478
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,040
Socrates...

479
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,119
Socrates once said,

480
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,920
"The happiest thing in the world

481
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:59,040
is to fight for a noble ideal."

482
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,679
Opening a green restaurant

483
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,359
is my little ideal that

484
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm fighting for.

485
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:06,920
Green restaurant refers
to the restaurant set

486
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,560
in front of an organic farm,

487
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,439
to ensure the ingredients
are fresh and healthy.

488
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,959
I would take care of the farm every day,

489
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,560
feed the chickens and milk the cows,

490
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,040
plant organic...

491
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:31,760
Miss, I don't want to continue.

492
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,439
Okay, sit down.

493
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,079
You guys, why are you laughing?

494
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,359
I think it's very well written.

495
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,119
These little trivial things

496
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,680
are actually of great significance.

497
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,719
Su Muyun.

498
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,400
Miss.

499
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,319
I think we'd sometimes

500
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,680
fall into this misconception

501
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,280
that only by pursuing the extraordinary

502
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,119
can we lead a meaningful life.

503
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,000
But Shakespeare once said that

504
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,959
nothing is more common

505
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,359
than the wish to be remarkable.

506
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,360
In my opinion,

507
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,959
as long as one works hard enough

508
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,319
and lives with sincerity,

509
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,239
without giving up on the things he loves,

510
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,920
then such ideals are the most valuable.

511
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,000
-Well said.
-Right.

512
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,600
(English answer sheet)

513
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,000
This grammar question
is in your notes, page 7.

514
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
I...

515
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,920
I flunked.

516
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,880
The classmates were all laughing at me.

517
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,719
They all said my head is
full of soybean curd residue

518
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,439
behind my back,

519
00:28:05,524 --> 00:28:08,324
and the teachers were always
worrying about me.

520
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,880
I am a human.

521
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,839
I have feelings too.

522
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,680
I have worked very hard.

523
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,599
But the results are still not good.

524
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,400
Maybe, I'm really useless,

525
00:28:34,439 --> 00:28:37,680
really dumb and stupid.

526
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,239
Let me have a look...

527
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,680
Take a good look at this.

528
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,880
The teacher is here, hurry up.

529
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,800
Sit down.

530
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
Dudes, many of you would think that

531
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,359
senior year would be boring and dull.

532
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,599
But I can seriously tell you that

533
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,079
this may be

534
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,479
the only few times

535
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:10,560
you can compete fairly in life.

536
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,359
What is youth?

537
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,160
It is something we need to fight for,

538
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,439
so that we won't be wasting our youth.

539
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,959
Sir.

540
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,760
There's a problem
with Su Nianfeng's test paper.

541
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,560
How did you know that?

542
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,640
As to Su Nianfeng's test paper,

543
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,040
in the 35-mark question,

544
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,479
she got 30 marks.

545
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,120
As for the 85-mark question,

546
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,040
I've calculated it,

547
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:47,767
she deserved 72 marks,

548
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,560
but was given only 28 marks.

549
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,720
I've been think hard for a long time.

550
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,960
Maybe Su Nianfeng was nervous

551
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,119
when she handed in her papers,

552
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,680
so her answer sheet A was submitted
as answer sheet B.

553
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,840
I think she's able to score 102 marks.

554
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:03,119
Is he serious?

555
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,479
-That's awesome
-102 marks?

556
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,520
Sir, if you don't believe me,

557
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,320
then let her retake the test.

558
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,359
Su Nianfeng.

559
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,199
Do you want to?

560
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,920
I...

561
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,680
72 is the passing mark.

562
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,880
She'd still be in last place.

563
00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:27,680
It's impossible for

564
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,800
a study slacker like her to score 102 marks.

565
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,160
-I don't believe it either.
-She's up for it?

566
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,359
I'll get you a brand-new test paper.

567
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,720
Different questions with
similar levels of difficulty.

568
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,640
You can do it.

569
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,319
I believe in you.

570
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,080
The rest of you, do your own reading.

571
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,239
Su Nianfeng,

572
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:00,800
come with me to the office.

573
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,479
It's okay.

574
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,599
I'll go with you.

575
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:05,920
Su Nianfeng's results are out.

576
00:32:12,479 --> 00:32:13,719
She got 105 marks.

577
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,479
105 marks? That's awesome.

578
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,640
How did she get such high marks?

579
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,800
Su Nianfeng, you've done a good job.

580
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,239
Thank you, sir.

581
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,920
It seems like your brother

582
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,640
has been helping you a lot.

583
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,319
♪ We're not tired of our sweet smiles ♪

584
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,440
Alright, you may return to your seats.

585
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,560
♪ Happiness comes in the same style ♪

586
00:32:42,719 --> 00:32:44,890
♪ Two lovely hearts together ♪

587
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:47,199
Open your textbook to page 12.

588
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,160
♪ An eternal truth ♪

589
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,319
Here, have some fruits.

590
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,520
Tomato again?

591
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,840
You're not a total failure, are you?

592
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,319
Well...

593
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,839
thank you.

594
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,479
For what?

595
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,119
My English notes

596
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,199
was scribbled up by you.

597
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,040
So,

598
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,239
I could only see a small part.

599
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,479
Who knows,

600
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,280
I could actually get such a high score.

601
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,479
As if you're betting

602
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,119
on every question.

603
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,119
Remove the words "as if".

604
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,040
No matter what, thank you so much.

605
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
I don't have to repeat this year anymore.

606
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,639
Eight dishes.

607
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,120
No way.

608
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:13,600
Then, how many?

609
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,159
At least

610
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
18 dishes.

611
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,159
I was thinking of

612
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,439
cooking 18 dishes for you last night.

613
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,959
But you, Su Muyun!

614
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,679
Yes?

615
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,040
You devil.

616
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,400
If you dare turn off my alarm again,

617
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,440
I will...

618
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,520
It rang five times, but you didn't wake up.

619
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,879
It's too noisy.

620
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,000
Su Muyun.

621
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,679
I'll now give you an opportunity

622
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,159
to turn over a new leaf.

623
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,399
Get on.

624
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,960
Change your deskmate.

625
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,160
I assure you that you won't be late today.

626
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,199
It's not fair.

627
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,879
Not happy with it?

628
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,000
You always change your mind.

629
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,439
You think the world revolves around you?

630
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,719
Very well then.

631
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,639
Take the bus.

632
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,719
What are you waiting for? Run.

633
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,879
The morning wolf is coming out.

634
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:33,959
Stop.

635
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,479
Get on.

636
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,479
Do you want to be late?

637
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,439
Thank you.

638
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,719
Bye.

639
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,199
Su Nianfeng, oh, Su Nianfeng.

640
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,520
Why are you late again?

641
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,600
Seventh time this month, right?

642
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,960
Today is the eighth day of the month.

643
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,360
If you continue acting like this,

644
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,960
forget about taking
the college entrance examination,

645
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,239
I wonder if you can even graduate.

646
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,360
What did you cover your face?

647
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,679
Stand straight.

648
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:37,199
I mean, look at yourself.

649
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:39,479
What should I do to make you listen?

650
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:40,873
A girl like you,

651
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
late for school every day.

652
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,760
Are you addicted to being late?

653
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,320
I don't know what else to say.

654
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,520
Do you think it's funny?

655
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,919
Do my words sound useless to you?

656
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,679
Why do you stop reading?

657
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,480
Don't you know that you're in senior year?

658
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,080
Are you guys still dreaming?

659
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,959
Continue to memorize the words.

660
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,719
Sir, you're right.

661
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,600
We're already in senior year.

662
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,919
Just let Su Nianfeng in.

663
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,080
If she misses a class,

664
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:16,040
it may affect her performance in the exam.

665
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Sir, I think she's not feeling well.

666
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,080
Why don't you let her in?

667
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,080
Come in.

668
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,479
Don't let me catch you again.

669
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,560
Yes, sir.

670
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,000
Thank you, sir.

671
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,479
I'll be watching

672
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,040
all of you.

673
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,439
Continue.

674
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,239
Present, present, present.

675
00:38:02,399 --> 00:38:04,959
I did it to repay you for sending me to school.

676
