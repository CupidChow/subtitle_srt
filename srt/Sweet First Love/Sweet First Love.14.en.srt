Sir, is there anything else you want?

26
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,520
Do you have buns?

27

What are you looking? You look so happy.

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,160
Nothing.

00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,479
Are you in love?

33
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,119
I told you it's nothing.

34
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,320
Who is she? Show me.

35
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,800
It's nothing. Really.

36
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,119
Fine.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
You're being so mysterious.

38

It's her again?

39
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,000
Give me the phone.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Brother,

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,320
how could you fall for her?

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,759
What's so good about her?

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,479
All she does is seducing men.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,160
I'm not going to let you be with her.

45
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,399
I said it.

46

Who is responsible for the project of Thomas?

59
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,040
It's me.

60
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,119
Why haven't you sent me

61
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,440
the report of the pharmaceutical materials?

62
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,679
Thomas still

63
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,880
owes us some data.

64
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,279
If you can only wait up for others,

65
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,519
why do we need you here?

You mean...

67
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,200
I really don't know what
the chairman was thinking?

68
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,600
How could he assign such an important project

69
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,440
to a mere intern?

70
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,799
That's right.

71
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
I heard she got into the company
by pulling some strings.

72
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,880
She got backed indeed.

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,679
No wonder.

74
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,239
You must send the report to me

75
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,320
before coming to the office tomorrow.

76

Monica.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Too much material is needed for the report.

78
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,839
I need at least a few days.

79
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm afraid I can't finish it tomorrow.

80
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,760
I've heard that you're studying at
Department of Medicine in Mingxian University.

81
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,399
And you're one of the top students there.

You look so exhausted.

Did you stay up late last night?

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,279
Are you trying to compete with me
for the scholarship?

90
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
Don't even think about it, buddy.

91
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,799
You can't beat me.

92
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,959
Just let it go.

93

I'll never let it go.

96
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,239
go for a stroll and enjoy the light breeze.

97
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,600
Shut up. Are you doing it on purpose?

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,200
Where is it?

99
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,359
I remember it's here.

100

101
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,640

113
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,599
It seems like

114
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,919
Zhuoyang Group really did some business

115
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,919
with Ouyang Group.

116
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:16,799

117

two weeks before the accident.

118
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,719
Do you think

119
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,599
Ouyang Group had something to do

120
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,960
with my parents' death?

121
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,719
It's a serious issue. Don't make
any conclusion without solid evidence.

122
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,000
I know little about contract.

123
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,159
I think

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,479
you can ask Su Muyun.

125
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,400
Why do I have to ask him?

126
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,440
He is the only one who will
do everything to help you.

127
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,479
Maybe

128
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,719
he wants to find out the truth
more than you do.

129
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,039
You two haven't reconciled yet?

130
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,679
I...

131
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,640
Well, I'm not stooping to his level.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Do you have other way out?

133
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,039
Even if I ask him,

134
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
he knows nothing about it.

135
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,559
I need to ask
someone professional to help me.

136
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,440
Right,

137
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:08,039
Qin Yao is a law major.

138
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,400
I can ask him.

139
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,960
This contract looks

140
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:29,960
like an ordinary

141
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,479
share transfer contract.

142
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:34,479
But...

143
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,520
What?

144
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,119
The purchase price stated here is strange.

145
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,520
It is way too low.

146
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,840
It doesn't make sense.

147
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,880
What does it mean?

148
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,479
Does it mean that Ouyang Group

149
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,159
launched a hostile takeover
bid for Zhuoyang group?

150
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm not sure if it's a hostile takeover.

151
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,719
After all, what you've shown me...

152
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,119
is just a part of the contract.

153
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:58,719
Well, I'll try to record the whole document.

154
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,599
Xiao Feng, don't worry.

155
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
I'll do my best to help you.

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
The truth

157
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,479
will be revealed some day.

158
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,719
Thank you.

159
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you for your help today.

160

163
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,159

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,359
Are you coming?

166
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,359
I have an appointment. I'll get going now.

167
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,400
All right. Bye.

168
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,359
She has just left.

169
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,799
So you're not coming again.

170
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,159
Well, girlfriend always comes first to you.

171
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,840
Goodbye.

172
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:04,534
(Data room)

173
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,907
(Only for directors)

174
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,400
It's okay. Take it slow.

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,359
You'll get a chance to get in there.

176
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,599
I'll re-check the contract out

177
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,719
you've sent to me.

178
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
Maybe I can find more clues from it.

179
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,119
Thank you, Qin Yao.

180
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,440
You're welcome.

181
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,599
I'm glad that I can help you.

182
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,440
How is it? Are you happy today?

183
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,960
You spent the whole day with me.
Of course, I'm happy.

184
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,679
Xiao Feng.

185
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:48,760
Nothing.

186
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm hanging up now, bye.

187
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,719
Qi Yuan.

188
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,719
Qi Yuan,

189
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,280
it's really you.

190
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,359
What are you doing here?

191
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,320
Does Qin Yao know about this?

192
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,479
What's the matter?

193
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,559
Do I have to report to him

194
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,599
when I go shopping with my friend?

195
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,640
You're going shopping with your friend?

196
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,119
You're too close to be just friends.

197
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,559
How can you do this to Qin Yao?

198
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,359
Xiao Yuan, who is this?

199
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:24,640
She looks cute.

200
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,239
But she's so fierce when she talks.

201
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,919
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

202
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,239
She's good at seducing men.

203
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,719
Do you know Ouyang Yu from Ouyang Group?

204
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,320
Even he is enchanted by her.

205
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,559
Qi Yuan, what are you talking about?

206
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,080
All right, babe. Don't argue with her.

207
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,119
Let's go
and eat some delicious cuisine later.

208
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,320
I feel so sorry for Qin Yao.

209
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,000
You don't deserve his love.

210
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:50,440
Who do you think you are?

211
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,200
You're the one who hooks up with Ouyang Yu.

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
And you have the cheek to criticize me?

213
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,119
Don't you dare to slander us.

214
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,880
You leave him right away.

215
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,239
Otherwise, I'll tell Qin Yao now.

216
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,520
By all means.

217
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,719
You can try and see
if he will ever break up with me.

218
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,680
(Qin Yao)

219
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,494
(Mingxian University)

220
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:37,520
Do you like it?

221
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,400
I told you that I wanted it with less sugar.

222
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,080
Why is this so sweet?

223
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:43,159
I'm on diet.

224
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,799
Well then, try this.

225
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
It has already melted.

226
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,840
How could I eat it?

227
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,599
Qin Yao, do you really care about me?

228
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,000
Of course, I care about you.

229
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,080
I'll take you to the cafe next time.

230
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,119
Don't be angry.

231
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,640
Well, don't eat it if you don't like it.

232
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,359
It's not what you like anyway.

233
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,200
Xiao Feng.

234
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,159
Qin Yao, look how she's talking to me.

235
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:12,919
What a coincidence, Xiao Feng.

236
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,200
We're going to have lunch with Xiao Yun.

237
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you want to join us?

238
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,640
I don't know what happened to him recently.

239
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,520
He's been spending most of
his time in the lab.

240
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,479
Come along and talk some sense to him.

241
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,679
I've got other things to do.

242
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Well, she is an intern in a big company now.

243
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,679
Of course she's very busy.

244
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,479
Stop it.

245
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,640
No.

246
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,799
I suddenly realized that it's important to have lunch with you.

247
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,880
Let's go.

248
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,919
All right. Thank you.

249
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,280
I'll ask for your help if I need it.

250
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,119
Xiao Feng,

251
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,320
what do you like to have?

252
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,840
Qi Yuan,

253
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,119
look and see what you like.

254
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,000
Thank you, dear.

255
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,760
Thank you for always taking care of me.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,439
Well. What would you like to have?

257
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,599
Look at the recipe.

258
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,760
What would you want?

259
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:24,400
I think it's the new dish here.

260
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,959
What are you doing here?

261
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,079
Let me take a look.

262
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
You're here.

263
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,160
I'm here for lunch.

264
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,479
Do you care for anything else except food?

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,599
That's none of your business.

266
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,040
Xiao Feng, don't be so nasty.

267
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,000
No wonder Qin Yao didn't choose you
when you had a crush on him.

268
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,880
We're girls. It's better to be gentle.

269
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,560
Qi Yuan.

270
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,920
What are you talking about? Stop it.

271
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,640
Xiao Feng,

272
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,920
what would you like to have?

273
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,479
Let's just leave.

274
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,239
Yes, I'm nasty.

275
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,040
But it's much better than being a hypocrite.

276
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,719
Qi Yuan,

277
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,479
stop pretending.

278
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,319
Don't you feel tired
to pretend the whole day?

279
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,800
What are you talking about?

280
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,359
Stop it.

281
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:36,719
Do you really like Qin Yao?

282
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:39,640
Qin Yao,

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
she's bullying me.

284
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Are you going to look on?

285
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,640
All right.

286
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,119
If you really liked him,

287
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,640
You wouldn't have asked him

288
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,160
to buy so many things in the hot sun

289
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,000
while you just sat being picky.

290
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,079
And you wouldn't have laughed at his friends

291
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,439
in front of him.

292
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,920
And you wouldn't be in a relationship
with another man.

293
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,119
Stop talking nonsense.

294
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
Qin Yao,

295
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,599
she's too much.

296
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,920
You guys have your lunch.
I'm leaving now.

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,640
Stop looking at me.

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,000
It's just a quarrel.

299
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,359
Have lunch.

300
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm relieved to see that
you're still so nasty.

301
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:37,280
I heard that you spent the night in the lab.

302
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,680
Have you had anything to eat?

303
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,359
Why don't you care for your stomach?

304
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,520
Excuse me.

305
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,199
Hi. What do you want to have?

306
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,359
I'd like to have some soup.

307
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
All right. The food will be served shortly.

308
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,439
I don't like soup.

309
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,800
Am I nasty?

310
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,520
But you're right.

311
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,839
Qi Yuan,

312
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,880
You're walking so fast. Wait for me.

313
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,439
Why are you walking so fast?

314
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,079
She targeted me.

315
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:27,839
I'm the one who found out

316
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,040
her relationship with Ouyang Yu.

317
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,959
And now she wanted to sling mud at me.

318
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
It must be some misunderstanding.

319
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,479
She isn't that kind of person.

320
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,760
Why are you still standing up for her?

321
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,199
Do you have feelings for her?

322
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,839
That's absurd. If I had feelings for her,

323
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,920
I'd be with her long time ago.

324
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,439
Why bother waiting until now?

325
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,719
Really?

326
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
Or course.

327
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,319
Anyway.

328
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,079
From now on, stop contacting her.

329
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,479
You can't meet her again.

330
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,800
Yuan Yuan, let's go to

331
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,439
the Japanese restaurant that
you've been longing to go.

332
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,400
Do you want to come with me?

333
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Which Japanese restaurant?

334
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,040
The one you always talk about.

335
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:01,160
The one that costs RMB1300 per person.

336
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,160
Really?

337
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,880
What are we waiting for?

338
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,800
Let's go.

339
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
I knew you're the one who treats me the best.

340
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,160
Didn't you know it before?

341
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,800
I've always been nice to you.

342
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,199
Let me feed you.

343
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,839
I need to use the washroom.

344
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Take it slow.

345
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,920
I'm thinking about you.

346
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,640
Shall we meet up this week?

347
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,719
Let me think about it.

348
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,920
Do you still need to think about it?

349
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,000
I have to get ready.

350
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,079
All right.

351
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,479
Actually,

352
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,280
I want to see you tonight.

353
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,400
I'll check my schedule and reply you later.

354
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,760
(Baby Yuan Momo)
See you tonight.

355
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,040
(I feel great
when the car's window is open. Happy.)

356
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,400
Is it tasty?

357
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,839
It's good.

358
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,239
Here you go.

359
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,040
All right.

360
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,199
I'm home.

361
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,119
It's just a spam call.

362
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,800
Go home now.

363
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,719
All right.

364
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,160
I'll get going now.

365
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,119
I told you

366
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,719
Qi Yuan is a bad girl.

367
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,479
She's just a vain girl,

368
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,239
like a fortune hunter.

369
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,160
I feel pity for Qin Yuan.

370
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,119
He doesn't know anything about it.

371
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,560
Do you still have feelings for Qin Yao?

372
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,959
Of course not.

373
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,880
That's in high school.

374
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,000
Now, I just feel that

375
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,640
it's so unfair

376
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,479
to my good friend.

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,760
It's getting worse in the society.

378
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,800
No wonder I'm still single.

379
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,239
All these good men

380
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,280
are fooled by these bad girls.

381
00:24:10,343 --> 00:24:11,343
(Qi Yuan
(What are you doing?)

382
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,199
What are you doing?

383
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,800
I'm going to take a shower.
Talk later.

384
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,920
All right, have a good rest
after taking a shower.

385
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
(Qin Yao)

386
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,239
It's me, Xiao Feng.

387
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:10,040
I'm sorry for what happened today.
I acted impulsively.

388
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,439
You don't have to apologize.

389
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm the one who should apologize to you.

390
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,880
Let's have coffee at noon tomorrow.

391
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,560
All right. See you tomorrow.

392
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,719
Bye.

393
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,719
Bye.

394
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Is it Qin Yao?

395
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,839
Excuse me.

396
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,280
You're here.

397
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,719
Am I late?

398
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,479
No. I arrived here early.

399
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,800
I invited you.

400
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
Yet I'm late.

401
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,040
It's alright.

402
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,520
I've heard that the coffee here
is pretty good.

403
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,520
How about ordering two cups of coffee?

404
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,000
All right. What would you like to have?

405
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,839
An Americano without ice.

406
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,959
Okay.

407
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:08,880
What do you want to buy? Just tell me.

408
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,959
Give me a hug.

409
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,760
Call me when you miss me.

410
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,719
Okay?

411
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:29,920
All right.

412
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,760
(Hampton by Hilton)
I'll take you somewhere funnier next time.

413
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Qin Yao.

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,319
Qin Yao, are you all right?

415
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,479
Dear,

416
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,479
listen up. Just go.

417
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:43,560
I'll deal with him.

418
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,959
Calm down.

419
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,479
Qin Yao.

420
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,599
Qin Yao, please listen to me.

421
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,079
It's not true.

422
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,079
Qin Yao, listen.

423
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,839
It's not like what you think.

424
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:57,959
Qin Yao.

425
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,319
Are you okay?

426
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,040
I'm sorry. Can you walk?

427
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,119
Come on. I'll send you home.

428
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,160
Hold on.

429
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,760
Have a good rest. I'll leave now.

430
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,319
Can you help me get the first-aid kit?

431
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,280
Sure.

432
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,719
Let me help you.

433
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,599
I'm fine. I'm quite tough, you know.

434
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,880
It will be healed in a few days.

435
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
Thank you.

436
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,880
Xiao Feng, I feel that

437
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,119
you've changed a lot.

438
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,800
Have I become stronger?

439
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Have I become a tough person?

440
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,160
I can't find the exact word.

441
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,119
I just feel that

442
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,319
you've become much tougher.

443
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,800
Everyone has to grow up somehow.

444
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's eat something before you leave.

445
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:32,839
Su Muyun.

446
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,319
I have good news for you.

447
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,760
Do you want it?

448
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,479
Nope.

449
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
Come on.

450
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,199
You can have all the information I collect.

451
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,160
What do you want?

452
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,239
I've heard that you know my goddess,

453
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,880
Ouyang Qingxue.

454
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,599
Can you help me ask her out?

455
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,439
I can't. I don't know her.

456
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,239
Are we dudes?

457
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,560
Who is it? Is it my goddess?

458
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:09,058
(Qi Yuan)

459
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,119
See what your sister was doing.

460
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,800
Not only does she have a relationship
with Ouyang Yu,

461
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,119
now she's trying
to steal my boyfriend as well.

462
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,760
Let me take a look.

463
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,880
Stop bothering me.

464
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:24,400
Such a grumpy man.

465
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:45,239
When I was in high school, I always said that

466
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,040
I envied Su Muyun.

467
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,800
I'd be so happy if someone could

468
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,000
cook for me every day.

469
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,199
It's just a bowl of noodles.

470
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,239
I don't have time
to do grocery shopping today.

471
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,319
And I got injured.

472
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,079
Just make do with it.

473
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,239
You're awesome, Xiao Feng.

474
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,680
A simple bowl of noodles
could be so delicious.

475
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,199
Whoever marries you

476
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,520
will be the happiest man.

477
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,599
I'm sorry

478
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,000
for hurting you today.

479
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,199
No need for apologizing.

480
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:34,760
You didn't mean to.

481
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,119
What if I tell you

482
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:42,280
I knew all these all along?

483
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,719
I knew it.

484
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,000
Qi Yuan has always been like this.

485
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,479
I knew everything about her.

486
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:53,239
What?

487
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,839
She has always been like this?

488
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,719
Why do you have to endure it?

489
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,560
She wasn't like this back then.

490
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,719
Back then, her family was loaded.

491
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,560
She was spoiled.

492
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,800
She was very proud at school.

493
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,839
In the sophomore year,

494
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,560
something happened in her family.

495
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,680
And her family
got in finance troubles as well.

496
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,920
Maybe that's when she started to change.

497
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,359
That's the point when she changed.

498
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,479
It seems like only money
can make her feel safe.

499
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:41,520
I just want to treat her better.

500
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,760
And then one day she'll know that

501
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,599
I'm the one who truly treats her good.

502
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,640
And she'll find her old self.

503
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:56,439
But I think that's just my imagination.

504
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,119
She won't change anymore.

505
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,040
It is so delicious.

506
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,680
What's going on?

507
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:50,920
I need to take a leave this afternoon.

508
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,000
For what?

509
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,239
I lost my rabbit.

510
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,000
His rabbit?

511
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:58,719
When did he rear a rabbit?

512
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,000
Xiao Feng,

513
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,399
thank you so much.

514
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,840
I wouldn't have known what to do

515
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,719
without you.

516
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,639
Don't be so sad.

517
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:21,479
Just like the lyric of 'Break Up Happily'.

518
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,280
♪ Breaking up happily,
please be happy ♪

519
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:29,000
♪ You'll find a better one ♪

520
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,399
♪ Don't want... ♪

521
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,760
You're just leaving

522
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,320
a person who didn't cherish you.

523
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:42,000
You're a good man.

524
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,080
You'll meet a girl

525
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,360
who knows you and cherishes you.

526
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,439
Maybe you're right.

527
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,199
Get back now.

528
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,679
Xiao Feng,

529
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,479
it'd be great if it were you.

530
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:22,080
We'd have a happy life.

531
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,159
I'm fine.

532
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,639
I'll get going now.

533
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,800
But I'm destined to be

534
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,919
a passer-by in your life.

535
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Just like what I thought,

536
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,679
I won't blush anymore.

537
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,000
What happened today?

538
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,840
Nothing happened.

539
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't move.

540
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,360
Let me take a look.

541
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:10,280
Where's the first-aid kit?

542
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,120
It's time to change the dressing.

543
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,280
It's just a minor injury.

544
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,080
It's nothing.

545
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,280
What brings you here tonight?

546
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,040
You and Qin...

547
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:08,040
Go pack up your things and come home with me.

548
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,120
Just go home and sleep.

549
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,679
You'll get everything you want in your dream.

550
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,919
Why you can be Le Diyin's housemate

551
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,919
but not mine?

552
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,199
He's a patient. I have to take care of him.

553
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,000
You're also a patient.

554
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,360
A severe sleepwalker.

555
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,199
I have to take care of you too.

556
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,800
I don't need you to take care of me.

557
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,040
I won't let you be in danger anymore.

558
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:07,239
Get out.

559
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,879
I won't go back.

560
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,760
Don't even think about it.

561
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm not a sleepwalker anyway.

562
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,520
But you're not the same.

563
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I forgot to tell you that

564
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,000
you almost jumped off the building
when you sleepwalked the other day.

565
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,560
I almost jumped...

566
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,120
I almost jumped off the building?
