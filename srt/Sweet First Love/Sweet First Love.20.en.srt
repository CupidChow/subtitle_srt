00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,500
Why not forget about it?

170
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,101
Let sleeping dogs lie.

171
00:10:04,261 --> 00:10:05,060
"Forget it"

172
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,661
doesn't exist in my dictionary.

173
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,101
You have many accounts, aren't you?

174
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,300
Come and help me.

175
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,341
Why are you still doing nothing?
Hurry up.

176
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,620
Calm down first.

177
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,341
There's no point arguing with them.

178
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,740
The heat will die down
in another few days.

179
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:20,940
Are you

180
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,901
going to watch them bully me
and do nothing?

181
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:25,540
Correct the mistake if any,
and take it as a lesson if not.

182
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,180
Correct the mistake?

183
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,300
Are you also suspecting
that I'm selling counterfeit products?

184
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,420
Fine. I quit.

185
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:35,461
I swear.

186
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,021
There's no such thing.

187
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,980
I know best how much effort

188
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,221
you have put into this store.

189
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,940
Don't get too emotional.

190
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,701
You quit on an impulse.

191
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:44,701
If you really do that,

192
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,620
you can't accomplish anything.

193
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,620
Lin Di.

194
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,701
You're quite something.

195
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,420
You way too side with the others
to be against me?

196
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,180
What do you mean I want to quit?

197
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:59,500
Didn't you just say
you wanted to quit?

198
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,380
What exactly are you trying to do?

199
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,101
I want you to get lost, you fool!

200
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,581
Don't let me see you again!

201
00:11:10,221 --> 00:11:13,781
What do you mean?
What have I said wrong again this time?

202
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:16,093
(Lin Di)

203
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:26,901
I think Lin Di treats you well.

204
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:28,701
That's enough.

205
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,581
I'm nice to him as well.

206
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,661
This is called to retreat
in order to advance.

207
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,940
You know nothing about love.

208
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:37,420
What does that mean?

209
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,461
Look, that's how men are.

210
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,141
The harder you are to get,

211
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,740
the more he will cherish you.

212
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,141
Believe it or not?

213
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,060
Whatever demands

214
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,461
that I make now,

215
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,740
he'll agree to all of them.

216
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,180
That doesn't seem like a good idea.

217
00:11:52,341 --> 00:11:53,540
When you are in a relationship,

218
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,620
doesn't sincerity matter most?

219
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,540
Love tactics.

220
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,141
There's still plenty for you to learn.

221
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,701
I'll teach you.

222
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,461
I...

223
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,221
I'm not interested.

224
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Really?

225
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:13,940
Really?

226
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:15,620
Really?

227
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,581
Why are you holding your book upside down?

228
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,420
Time's up. I'm going to wash my face.

229
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,141
(Lin Di)
No way.

230
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,821
Impulse is the devil. Hold back.

231
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,021
Hold back.

232
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:40,843
(Industrial and Commercial Bank of China)

233
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:54,661
(Zhuo Yifeng)
Thanks for helping me with the fund application.

234
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,341
Would you like to come over to eat?

235
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,620
You cook.

236
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,420
That sounds too polite.

237
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:13,701
I'm having a stomachache.

238
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,261
Come home and cook for me.

239
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,901
That sounds too harsh.

240
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,720
(Qin Yao)

241
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:32,060
What's the matter?

242
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:33,620
Are you missing me?

243
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:35,141
I've got the fund.

244
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,701
Come over.

245
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
Let's have a takeaway tonight.

246
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,060
You've got such a poor stomach.

247
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,540
You're still thinking about
having a takeaway?

248
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,500
Why don't I cook for you?

249
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,261
I won't eat the food you make.

250
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:47,860
You should be frank

251
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,101
if you want me to ask Xiao Feng to come
on your behalf.

252
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:50,781
Don't beat around the bush.

253
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:52,701
Let's have a takeaway then.

254
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,821
The worse comes to worst,
I'll have a stomachache for two days.

255
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
All right. Fine.

256
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,420
You win.

257
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,940
I'll contact the chef

258
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,261
to go over and cook for you.

259
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,740
That's good.

260
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,620
Let me help you.

261
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:25,420
Are you serious?

262
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:26,740
After all these years,

263
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,021
you're finally conscience-stricken?

264
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,661
Next time, whenever you cook,
I'm going to help you.

265
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,300
Remove the leaves and keep the clean ones.

266
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:41,781
How do I do that?

267
00:14:42,141 --> 00:14:44,940
Strip off all the leaves on the outside.

268
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,060
That's quite funny.

269
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
Are you done yet? Time to cook.

270
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,701
It's done.

271
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,180
Get out.

272
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,860
Dinner is ready!

273
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,060
I'll help myself to it then.

274
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,420
Is it good?

275
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,101
Xiao Feng, if I were a man,

276
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:29,821
I would marry you on the spot.

277
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,540
This is my place.

278
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,101
Get out.

279
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:38,461
Hey.

280
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:40,420
Hui, we can't infuriate him.

281
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:41,500
Don't do that.

282
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,581
Here.

283
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,980
Forget it.

284
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:47,940
Right.

285
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,980
Thank you.

286
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,461
All right.

287
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,261
Here. Cheers.

288
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,021
-Here. Cheers.
-Cheers.

289
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,180
By the way,
have you taken the medicine?

290
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:05,740
Yes.

291
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,021
Good boy.

292
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:13,980
Well...

293
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,141
The wine is so sour
that I'm having a toothache.

294
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:19,180
This dish...

295
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:21,581
It's too sweet
that it makes my throat itch.

296
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:44,500
I'm full.

297
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
You're done?

298
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,101
We prepared the meal.

299
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,540
They'll do the dishes.

300
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,420
Forget it. They are our guests.

301
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,221
That's right. Did you hear that?

302
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,461
We're your guests.

303
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:58,380
The lady of the house said it.

304
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:01,180
I'll do the dishes then.

305
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,740
What are you talking about?

306
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm a guest too.

307
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,900
We prepared the meal.
They should do the dishes.

308
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,060
Right?

309
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:17,581
All right then.

310
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,540
All right.

311
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:19,821
We'll do the dishes then.

312
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,501
Here we go.

313
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:33,381
Give me that.

314
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,341
All right. Here.

315
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,221
You'd better hide.

316
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,780
The latter part is even scarier.

317
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,060
Are you meant to it?

318
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,060
The ghost is going to ring the bell soon.

319
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,180
Who's that?

320
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,221
I'll get that.

321
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,260
No. Who knows
if it's a ghost or human?

322
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:45,260
It's me! Is anyone in?

323
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,221
Is this Su Muyun's house?

324
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,300
Ladies and gentlemen.

325
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,300
Have you really had education?

326
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,581
Lin Di?

327
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,461
You're a dead man.

328
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:01,940
Here.

329
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,821
How would I know
you were watching a ghost movie?

330
00:19:06,461 --> 00:19:09,461
Zihui, you went a little overboard
with that.

331
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,821
Why are you here?

332
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,861
I heard that Su Muyun got the fund.

333
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,300
Shouldn't we celebrate it?

334
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,540
Sorry, you're too late.

335
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,140
The celebration is over.

336
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,501
Come on. I...

337
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:22,560
I bought tickets

338

Let's watch it together.

340
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,741
Why don't we go?

341
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,341
As you like it.

342
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Well...

343
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,381
I'll go too.

344
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:40,660
You traitors.

345
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,660
Are you coming or not?

346
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,621
Yes!

347
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,180
Let's see what he has up his sleeve.

348
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,101

A success talk? What...

351
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,660
Where's the stage play?

352
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,780
I think I bought the wrong tickets.

353
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,581
That explains why the VIP tickets

354
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,581
were so cheap.

355
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,780
As I said, you're unreliable, right?

356
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,581
How could you mistake a success talk
for a stage play?

357
00:20:27,581 --> 00:20:28,461
Come on. Let's go.

358
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:29,501
Don't go.

359
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,981
It's my first time buying tickets.

360
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,501
It won't go wrong next time.

361
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,581
Next time?

362
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,900
We will unfriend you now.

363
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,020
Forget it. Since we are here,

364
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,180
it's nice to listen to a talk, right?

365
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:44,140
That's right.
Maybe after listening to the talk,

366
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,621
we'll reach the pinnacle of our careers.

367
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:46,381
Right?

368
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:47,501
Come on.

369
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,581

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,741
-Lin Di.
-Come on.

371
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,060
I don't want to see you anymore.

375
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,461

376

a new lease of life.

378

As long as you like it,

379
00:21:05,461 --> 00:21:06,981
I'll go through with you

about the haters.

383
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,940
I didn't put myself in your shoes.

384
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,660
You did pretty well today.

385
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,101
But I won't forgive you that easily.

386
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,540
It depends
on how you treat me in the future.

It's not every day that we get together.

388

I have to endure two couples

393
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,060

If Su Muyun asks you
to be his girlfriend today,

397
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,180
leave him out in the cold.

398
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:52,140
That's what he gets
for giving me a hard time.

399

We're in the same direction.
