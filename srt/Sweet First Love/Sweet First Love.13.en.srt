Where am I?

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,320
Are you an idiot?

28
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,120
Su Muyun.

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,760
Why are you here?

30
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,479
You have the cheek to question me?

(Zhuo Yifeng)

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,320
Hello.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,120
Hello.

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,600
You Little devil.

36
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,680
You big jerk.

37
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:54,479
Are you drunk again?

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,919
I'm not.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
I can drink more.

40
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,160
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,880
I don't want to go home.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
All of you are bad people.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,600
Tell me. Where are you?

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Do you still want me to cook for you or not?

45
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,839
If you continue to snap, I'll tell mum.

46
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,160
If you don't tell me where you are,

47
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,400
how could you lecture me?

48
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,199
That makes sense.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,359
If so, you...

50
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,320
Bark like a dog, and I'll tell you.

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,520
Knock it off.

52
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,999
Forget it if you won't.

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,880
Bark like a dog? Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,279
That's embarrassing.

55
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,279
That's because you're snapping.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,439
You scared me.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,439
I want a little puppy.

58
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,199
Not a ferocious dog.

59
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,760
You're too much.

60
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,639
You're so nasty. I'm hanging up.

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,559
Where are you?

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,880
I...

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I don't know where I am.

64
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,639
Open your WeChat.

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,199
Find my name.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,520
Share real-time location.

67
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,440
It's done. I'm smart, right?

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,919
Give me some praise.

69
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,720
You're so amazing.

70
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:30,599
Don't hang up before I get there.

71
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,079
Stop.

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,120
Say no more.

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,479
You must have made up the story.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,079
How could I possibly...

75
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,879
I haven't even got
to the most embarrassing part.

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,639
Do you want to hear?

77
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
Thanks for picking me up.

78
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,359
Sorry to trouble you.

79
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,599
You should head back first.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm going back now.

81
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,000
Let go of me!

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,199
Before the truth comes to light,

83
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,599
I won't go home with you.

84
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,319
I'll send you to Le Diyin's house.

85
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,199
It's too late now.

86
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:37,359
It's not safe.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,759
Let's go.

88
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,720
Wait for me.

(Hualian Market Place)

90
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,300
(Hualian Market Place)

91
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,479
It's for your hangover.

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,560
How much is it?

93
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll pay you back.

94
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,199
Don't drink so much next time.

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,079
Mind your own business.

96
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,720
What if the same thing happens again?

97
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,560
It's so dangerous.

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,479
Su Muyun.

99
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,960
Tell me.

100
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,079
Do I sleepwalk?

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,280
Yes.

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,840
Is it a traumatic stress disorder

103
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,879
caused by the car accident?

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,960
Why didn't you tell me

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,479
when I asked you before?

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
You can do nothing if you know.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,720
At least,

108
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,479
I can protect myself.

109
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,639
I can protect you.

110
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
You don't need to bother yourself.

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,280
So...

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,359
back then...

113
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,199
you always slept in my room

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,159
just to protect me?

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
Thank you.

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,000
I feel cold.

117
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,319
Let me warm up.

118
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,720
Let go of me.

119
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,759
Didn't you say you wanted to thank me?

120
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,400
You know how to return the favour, right?

121
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,919
Why don't you eat something
before you leave?

122
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm not hungry.

123
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Go back and have some rest.

124
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,359
I'm not asking you.
It's me who feel hungry.

125
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
When I had a stomachache,

126
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,719
mum would make me rice congee.

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
I got sick of it.

128
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,760
Since you left,

129
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,919
they've been having a hard time every day.

130
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Mum always locked herself in your room

131
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,159
and kept cleaning it up.

132
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,200
No one could stop her.

133
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,760
Dad didn't say anything.

134
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,359
But he always drank by himself.

135
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,839
When he got drunk,
he'd flip through your photo album

136
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,399
and talk about your childhood.

137
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,959
You knew it.

138
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,220
Dad never drank before.

139
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,039
We were so good

140
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,320
as a family.

141
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,479
Have you forgotten it all?

142
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,320
Stop forcing me.

143
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,479
I respect your decision.

144
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,039
Give me some time.

145
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Go inside.

146
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm leaving.

147
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,320
Le Diyin, I bought breakfast...

148
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,359
Le Diyin!

149
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,279
What's wrong?

150
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,039
Le Diyin!

151
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,320
What's the matter?

152
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,359
He passed out.

153
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,479
Get him to the hospital.

154
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,599
Let's go.

155
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,719
You can't ride in a car.

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,919
I'll take him to the hospital.

157
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,120
I'll see you at Chengzhong Hospital.

158
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,039
All right.

159
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,200
Don't worry.

160
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,599
He'll be fine.

00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:07,673
(Intensive Care Unit)

162
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,743
(Intensive Care Unit)

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
How is he?

164
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,000
Dilated cardiomyopathy

165
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,880
caused Stokes-Adams syndrome.

166
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,000
He needs to
stay hospitalised for observation.

167
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,959
He'll be fine, right?

168
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,760
Don't worry.

169
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
He'll be fine.

170
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Mr. Ouyang.

171
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,839
Are you all right?

172
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,200
I'm not good.

173
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,519
I...

174
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
I'd like to take a day off.

175
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:12,959
My best friend

176
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,880
passed out today.

177
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,080
I'm still in the hospital.

178
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,719
Is it Le Diyin?

179
00:14:20,599 --> 00:14:21,959
How did you know?

180
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,800
You told me about him last night.

181
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,080
I...

182
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,200
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

183
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:30,039
I drank too much. Sorry.

184
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,399
I even ran out late at night.

185
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:33,640
Remember it.

186
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,880
You don't need to apologize to me.

187
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,880
What matters is that you're safe.

188
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,719
Anyway,

189
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,719
he's still in hospital.

190
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,959
I don't know what I should do.

191
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,000
I still have a lot of work to do.

192
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,000
Sorry.

193
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,839
It's fine.

194
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,880
How about this?

195
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,880
Do what you have to do.
We'll talk when you're back.

196
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:02,959

Here's the information that you asked for.

220
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,440

Are you meeting Thomas

for his illness?

223
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,279
You just have to do

224
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,960
as your duty.

225
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,919
Thomas is waiting for you.

00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,159
There's nothing I can do.

230
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,999
I'm sorry.

231
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,080
I've heard that

232
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
your viral myocarditis project
has been suspended

233
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:00,960
due to lack of funds.

234
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,039
How did you know?

235
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm interested in your project.

236
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,560
I can give you the equipment

237
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:08,919
professionals and funds.

238
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,239
I can give all you need

239
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,639
but on one condition.

240
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,320
I've got you an assistant

241
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,879
and you need to let her study

242
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,800
the drugs for dilated cardiomyopathy with you.

243
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,680
Think about it.

244
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,239
What assistant?

245
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,560
Who is she?

246
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,200
You'll know it then.

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,879
But don't worry.

248
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,200
She's very smart.

249
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,080
She won't be a drag on you.

250
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,080
Most importantly,

251
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,320
no one is more desperate than her

252
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:36,879
to find out the drug.

253
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,279
Qingxue.

254

Do you know who's Le Diyin?

255
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,320
I asked the maid

256
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,840
to make your favorite soup today.

257
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,879
Take a seat.

258
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,999
The soup is turning cold soon.

259
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,680
Have a piece of meat. It's your favorite.

260
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,279
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

261
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,480
Tell me.

262
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:14,919
What is it?

263
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,600
Nothing.

264
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,639
I'm just curious.

265
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,639
Brother, why are you
spending so much money

266
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:28,600
to get Thomas

267
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
to do the research and development
for cardiomyopathy drugs?

268
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,999
Can you forget about Le Diyin?

269
00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:36,720
He's not a big shot.

270
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,480
If you offend the board of directors again
because of him,

271
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,039
it's totally not worth it.

272
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,039
Don't worry about it.

273
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:47,759
I know what I'm doing.

274
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:50,919
You can fool anyone else but not me.

275
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,159
You did it for Zhuo Yifeng, right?

276
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,840
What's wrong with you?

277
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,840
Did she manage to seduce you too?

278
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,320
You knew what happened back then.

279
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,919
I just want to make up to her.

280
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,720
Do you dare say
that you have no feelings for her?

281
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,440
Not only she took Su Muyun away
from me,

282
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,239
she's now trying to take you too.

283
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,759
I'll show her no mercy.

284
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,119
Enjoy it.

285
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,999
Thank you.

286
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:38,960
Thank you.

287
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,879
My gut feeling was right.

288
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,200
My brother and Xiao Feng

289
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,999
are indeed getting closer.

290
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,960
What are you getting at?

291
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,919
Le Diyin

292
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,919
is Xiao Feng's best friend.

293
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,800
So it's for her that Mr. Ouyang

294
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,999
invest in new drug research and development?

295
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
In my heart,

296
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,360
you're my best sister-in-law.

297
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,720
Don't worry. I'll help you.

298
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:12,999
Do you have any plans?

299
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,440
My brother is a sentimental person.

300
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:18,320
The longer they stay together,

301
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,720
the deeper they'll be connected.

302
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:23,999
But fortunately,

303
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,360
Xiao Feng is just an intern.

304
00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:32,360
The working environment
is so stressful in Ouyang Group.

305
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,919
Many interns have resigned.

306
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Don't worry.

307
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,759
The data for these plans is all wrong!

308
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
You can't even get the table right.

309
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,879
Redo it!

310
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,680
I have checked several times.
How could it...

311
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,960
All I care about is the results.

312
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,999
Also,

313
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,759
we have several new projects now.

314
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,720
Be at work two hours earlier.

315
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,320
I've been working overtime lately.

316
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,039
Before dawn...

317
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,560
I don't care about it.

318
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,119
Being late will be considered as absenteeism.

319
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,440
Redo your work.

320
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,840
Send it to my email by tonight.

321
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,192
(Liu Zihui)

322
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,759
You should just forget about it.

323
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,879
If you continue to work there,

324
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,999
they'll surely torture you to death.

325
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,320
It's not worth it.

326
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,320
I've been persuading myself

327
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,680
to hang on.

328
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,960
But actually,

329
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,600
I've prepared the resignation letter.

330
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
Have you decided to resign?

331
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:51,039
Well,

332
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll have your back.

333
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,239
Mr. Ouyang, I...

334
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,879
We will be conducting researches

335
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,639
on drugs for dilated cardiomyopathy.

336
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:16,800
We need several suitable research subjects.

337
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,720
Really?

338
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,279
I remember

339
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,759
you have a friend

340
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:23,360
who may be suitable.

341
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
You can ask him
if he's willing to take part in it.

342
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,119
Also,

343
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,159
I'm going to assign you
as the company's representative

344
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,039
to be Dr Thomas' assistant.

345
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,080
Okay?

346
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:34,200
Okay. That's great.

347
00:23:34,399 --> 00:23:35,320
Right.

348
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:37,080
Why did you ask to see me?

349
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,879
Nothing.

350
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,320
Thank you.

351

(Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University)

352
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,159
Professor Thomas is the project leader.

353
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,440
It's not every day
one can be a research subject.

354
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Are you willing to join in?

355
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:57,720
Of course.

356
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:58,800
Thank you.

357
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,039
Don't mention it.

358
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,200
By the way,
there will be many new projects soon.

359
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:05,159
I'm planning

360
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,720
to move somewhere nearer to the office.

361
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,759
That's a good idea.

362
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:10,360
Be alert and don't get fooled

363
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,519
when you find a new place.

364
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,999
Don't worry. I'll take a day off tomorrow.

365
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,519
I can consult the agency

366
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,080
near the office.

367
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:20,960
Okay. Get some rest.

368
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,480
Bye.

369
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:24,480
Bye.

370
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:37,518
(Le Diyin)

371
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,960
Xiao Feng is planning for a move.

372
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,440
She'll consult the agency near the office.

373
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,239
If you're free,

374
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
help her out.

375
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,879
After all, it might not be safe

376
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,320
if she's alone.

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,519
Got it.

378
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,600
Thank you.

379
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,800
If you have things to do,
you can leave first.

380
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,039
I'll keep looking around.

381
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:15,720
I have some information.

382
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,039
I've sent you the details.

383
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:23,720
Not bad.

384
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,960
The location is good. How much is it?

385
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,680
All are less than

386
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:29,800
2,000 yuan.

387
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,200
How could they be so cheap?

388
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,399
Are you paying out of your own pocket?

389
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Forget it.

390
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,080
I'll search on my own.

391
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,560
What happened to your cardigan?

392
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,360
Maybe I accidentally tore it
when I came in just now.

393
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,440
It's fine. Just patch it up
and it's as good as new.

394
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:55,639
I'll buy you a new one.

395
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:58,759
I'm not that particular.

396
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,480
No way.

397
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,960
What's the matter?

398
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,360
I need to use the bathroom.

399
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,039
I said I didn't need you
to send me back.

400
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:39,800
You're feeble now.

401
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,600
You're the one who need protection now.

402
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Go home now.

403
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,039
It's you who are protecting me.

404
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,360
Remember to take the medicine.

405
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,399
I don't know where it is.

406
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:56,480
It's in the leftmost drawer
of the TV cabinet.

407
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
Remember to eat.

408
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,239
What matters is you remember it.

409
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,480
(Qin Yao)

410
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,519
Come out.

411
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:31,519
I need your help.

412
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,119
Tell me.

413
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,720
We two are either single

414
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,680
or straight.

415
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,320
Isn't it a bit wired shopping in
the women's clothing store.

416
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Cut the crap.

417
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,680
This isn't too bad.

418
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,720
It looks quite fashionable.

419
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,999
I'm starting to regret
asking for your help.

420
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,879
This is quite nice.

421
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,560
Xiao Yun.

422
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:41,800
Check this store out.

423
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,919
Let's go.

424
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,600
Sirs, you want to buy...

425
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,480
Let's go,

426
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,560
It's so exhausting.

427
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,800
You asked for my advice.

428
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,119
But you rejected

429
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,480
every piece I picked for Xiao Feng.

430
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,119
Why do you need me then?

431
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,279
Right, you...

432
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,999
You should ask Liu Zihui.

433
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,879
Why didn't you say so earlier?

434
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,440
I just thought of it.

435
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,639
Call her and ask her.

436
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,279
I'm buying clothes for Su Nianfeng
at the mall.

437
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,159
What does she like?

438
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,440
Is that all?

439
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Let me see.

440
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,999
Let's go

441
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,119
and start all over.

442
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,360
I can't walk anymore.

443
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,720
Can I wait here for you?

444
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,239
What do you think?

445
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,279
Come on.

446
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,360
Please.

447
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,000
(Ouyang Group)

448
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,560
Today is another great day!

449
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,480
Keep it up!

450
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,080
Monica has fair skin.

451
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:17,639
She looks even fairer in this outfit.

452
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,119
Fair and beautiful.

453
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,560
Don't the interns get paid?

454
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,639
She doesn't even have a decent outfit.

455
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,039
Jeez.

456
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,159
-Ugly.
-It stinks.

457
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,960
You have the cheek to work wearing that?

458
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,999
What an eyesore.

459
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,440
That's right.

460
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,999
First of all,

461
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,399
I don't spend my money on clothes.

462
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,680
Because I don't rely on good clothes.

463
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,600
Besides, my shirt doesn't stink.

464
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,320
If someone thinks it stinks,

465
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,239
that's because her sense of smell gets wrong.

466
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,519
Lastly, my outfit is none of your business.

467
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,759
If you find it an eyesore,
you can look elsewhere.

468
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,320
Why bother yourself?

469
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,200
You...

470
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,720
What an ungrateful silly girl.

471
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:10,360
Is she mad?

472
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,279
As long as you like it.

473
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,080
Mr. Ouyang.

474
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,080
Let's go.

475
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,399
I'll take you to buy some clothes.

476
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,279
Thank you.

477
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
But I can't ride in a car.

478
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,480
I'll buy a new one tomorrow.

479
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
You can go back first.

480
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:18,879
Yes.

481
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,840
In another few days,

482
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,800
you'll be representing the company
to meet up with Thomas.

483
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,480
It's best if you have a formal outfit.

484
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,960
Sure. I'll...

485
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:30,239
Thomas is very picky about others' outfit.

486
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
You don't know what he likes.

487
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,600
Let's go.

488
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,759
Mr., can you ride a bike?

489
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,800
I've never tried it before.

490
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,320
But I can learn it.

491
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:08,880
I'll teach you then.

492
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,160
Sure.

493
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,239
Hold the handlebar and keep it straight.

494
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,679
Keep the balance.

495
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,400
Don't grab them too tight.

496
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,959
That's right.

497
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,560
Hi, sir.

498
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,400
How can I help you?

499
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:20,199
It's 2,800 yuan?

500
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:27,519
Sir, why don't we go
to another store?

501
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,479
It's too expensive here.

502
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,959
Try it out first.

503
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:33,439
Miss.

504
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,999
Take all the clothes on display here.

505
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:37,560
Take this lady to the fitting room.

506
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,080
Sure.

507
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,959
Miss, this way, please.

508
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,080
Tell her it's at 70 percent off.

509
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,880
Pay the remaining balance with my card.

510
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:55,719
Understood.

511
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,439
Not bad.

512
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,439
It's quite nice.

513
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,999
But why don't we go to another store?

514
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,999
Then, I can decide whether to buy this.

515
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,560
You're so lucky here!

516
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:33,199
We're having a sale.

517
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,920
Send a photo of you wearing our clothes

518
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,360
to our official account
to get a 70-percent off.

519
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,479
Seventy percent off? For real?

520
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,320
Here. Three, two, one.

521
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,199
Why are they together?

522
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,600
Isn't that Ouyang Yu?

523
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,320
Who's that girl next to him?

524
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,600
You look so much better than her.

525
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:05,999
Let me help you with that.

526
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:06,840
It's fine.

527
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,920
I bought so many nice clothes today.

528
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,719
I'm feeling so good.

529
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,279
Right.

530
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,519
After the banquet the other day,

531
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:18,439
you pretended to be drunk
and asked him to send you home.

532
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,600
How did it go? Did anything happen?

533
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Ouyang Group is a large company.

534
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,959
He turned his nose up at me.

535
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm sure the girl is too manipulative.

536
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:27,679
We're no match for her.

537
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,600
It's okay. I'll introduce you
to better guys

538
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:31,279
at the party two days later.

539
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,343
(Qin Yao)

540
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:39,400
The fall-back guy, huh?

541
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,640
All right. Let's go.

542
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,840
Let's go.

543
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,320
Why are you here?

544
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,279
He is the chairman
of the company I work for.

545
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
This is...

546
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,880
He's my friend, Su Muyun.

547
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,560
Hi.

548
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,360
I'm Ouyang Yu.

549
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,479
Your new outfit is nice.

550
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,959
It perfectly reveals your bad body shape.

551
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,239
You're too much.

552
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,560
I think it looks nice.

553
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,160
Xiao Feng.

554
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Have a good rest.

555
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
I'll go back now.

556
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,120
All right. See you.

557
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,519
You aren't allowed to be with him
from now on.

558
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,320
I'll do as I like.

559
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,039
It's none of your business.

560
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,360
Then.

561
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,080
Why are you here?

562
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:26,600
I said it.

563
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,360
You aren't allowed to be with him
from now on.

564
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,999
What has got into you?

565
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,560
It hurts.

566
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,479
Is it for me?

567
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,439
No.

568
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,120
What is that?

569
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,320
Trash.

570
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,600
Go to another community to throw trash?

571
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,840
Is he losing his mind?

572
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,120
Stay away from her.

573
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:39,479
You are just ordinary friends.

574
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,519
You have no right to interfere.

575
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,160
Haven't the Ouyang family

576
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,360
done enough to hurt the Zhuo family?

577
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,439
If you have no proof,

578
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,279
be careful of your words.

579
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,679
I won't let anyone hurt her.

580
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,160
Me too.

581
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,640
As for the proof,

582
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,479
I'll find it.

583
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,120
You should have just told me
that it was a gift for me.

584
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,800
