What do you want?

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,199
Is she getting better?

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,879
It's none of your business.

28
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,039
I just want to see her.

29

30
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
has your family got her into hospital?

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,399
Stay away from her.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
This time,

33
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,520
it's indeed my fault.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,919
I will never let it

35
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,199
happen again.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,160
She's asleep.

37
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,639
Please leave.

It's the test report of Thomas's project.

39
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,600
She'd be happy seeing it.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,240
Please pass it to her.

41
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,399
And the flowers too.

42
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,039
She's allergic to flowers.

45
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,240
It's so fast.

46
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,839
I knew it.
You don't know how to wash. You idiot.

50
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,839
I don't know.

51
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:40,880
Has Mr. Ouyang been here?

It's too late last night.

54

You can't be together alone.

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,559
Exactly. It's too late.

56
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,880
Why didn't you leave last night?

57
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,960
I won't leave.

58

Who can help you pack if I leave?

59
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,559
Why are you here?

60
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,039
The doctor said I was getting better

61
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,520
and allowed me to walk around.

62

Thank you.

65
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,160
It smells good.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,920
It's too heavy.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,279
I'll take it for you.

68

69
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,720
By the way,

70
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,399

72
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,519
I'll officially join the team.

73
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,279
Wait for my good news.

74
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,920

By the way,

77
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,359
you shouldn't delay

78
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,600
your psychotherapy any longer.

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,160
I've set an appointment with Dr Ding for you.

80

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,920
I don't know.

86
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,720

Culprit, stop!

90
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,880

93
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,959
have you been discharged?

94
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,239
Don't worry. I've already been discharged.

95
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880
I've been so busy these two days.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,679
I didn't have the time to keep you company.

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll make up for you after I'm done.

Le Diyin introduced a psychologist

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,640
to me.

100
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,640
She might be able to
jog my memory of the incident.

101
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:47,640
Really?

102
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
Yes.

103
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,440
All right, I'll wait for your good news.

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
All right.

105
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,679
What are you looking at?

106
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,359
Oh gosh, I lost some fans again.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,799
You don't have many fans.

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Is it possible to have lesser?

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,359
Do you dare to say it again?

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,559
What about this?

111
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,839
I'll register few accounts
to make up for the deduction?

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,920
Do you think I need more fake fans?

113
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,119
Are you kidding me?

114
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
These days,

115
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,519
it's no longer about updating posts daily.

116
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,079
Even if you send 8 new posts a day,

117
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,239
you might not gain popularity.

118
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm busy with my study.

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,239
Are you taking responsibility
for my delayed graduation?

120
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,279
I do want to be responsible to you.

121
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,000
You...

122
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,559
Don't hit me.

123
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,200
I notice that

124
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,880
your skin has become smoother.

125
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,959
Really?

126
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,799
Perhaps,

127
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,119
ever since I turned poorer,

128
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:50,279
I started using many cheap local brands.

129
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,000
They are equal to the big brands. Very effective.

130
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,200
Forget it. You won't get it anyway.

131
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,239
Yes. Expert of local brands.

132
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,239
Here.

133
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,920
Have some noodles and get more fans.

134
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,079
Dig in. Stop looking at your phone.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,880
Come on.

136
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,839
I don't need to sell

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
branded products to my fans.

138
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,200
Local products are cheap and affordable.

139
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,239
That's right.

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,279
I need you.

141
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,600
What do you want?

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
Listen up. Do you want...

143
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,000
How's it? Is it awesome?

144
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,440
No! Absolutely not!

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,679
This is my bottom line as a man.

146
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,239
Hi, my dearest fans.

147
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,239
I guess you've already known that

148
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,399
the people in the Song Dynasty
liked to wear lipstick.

149
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,559
And people in the Ming and Qing Dynasties
preferred rouge.

150
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,920
At the end of the Qing Dynasty,

151
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,679
they like powder for beauty,

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,799
particularly Xie Fuchun's powder.

153
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,239
Now,

154
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll introduce you

155
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,600
a mysterious local brand, Xie Fuchun.

156
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,239
Let me introduce.

157
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,359
This is

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,279
Xie Fuchun's latest duck egg powder.

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,079
Let's try it.

160
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,039
Oh my gosh. What a fine powder.

161
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,840
You'll become the most beautiful one

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,559
after applying it.

163
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,239
This is a must-buy.

164
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,760
Next, I'll demonstrate on

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,520
how to use the powder the right way.

166
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,559
Come over.

167
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,119
No.

168
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Come over.

169
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:56,400
Three.

170
00:08:56,719 --> 00:08:57,719
Two.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
One.

172
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:05,520
Smile.

173
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,760
Now,

174
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,239
let's witness the miracle.

175
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,520
Did you see it?

176
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,559
You can still

177
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:42,000
get perfect makeup effect with local brand.

178
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,719
It is no less than the big brands.

179
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,799
My dearest exquisite girls,

180
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,880
you must buy this product.

181
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,919
All right. That's all for today.

182
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,159
I'll recommend it to you again.

183
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,200
Duck egg powder from Xie Fuchun.

184
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,280
Goodbye.

185
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,760
Bid them farewell.

186
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
How's it?

187
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,350
(Liu Zihui's fans number is increasing)

188
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,876
(Liu Zihui's fans number is increasing)

189
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,520
You're gaining popularity.

190
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,479
I never thought

191
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,280
it's not easy to become a beauty blogger.

192
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,760
Has my image

193
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,000
improved tremendously in an instant?

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Keep still.

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,479
The makeup might not be properly removed
if you keep moving.

196
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,159
Don't blame me for acne outbreak.

197
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:15,880
What do you want? I'm doing live sharing.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,159
I'll go upstairs if you've got nothing to say.

199
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,599
You work so hard every day.

200
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,479
You'd fall ill.

201
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,719
Come, let's have something to eat.

202
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,599
Let's go.

203
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:26,159
Ever since your fans increased,

204
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,359
you've been doing live broadcast

205
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,919
over 12 hours a day for three days in a row.

206
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,599
Making money is indeed important.

207
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,440
But health is more important.

208
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,400
Am I right?

209
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,359
You haven't been poor. You won't get it.

210
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,719
Having no money is akin to death.

211
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,440
And I'm doing what I love.

212
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm very happy. I don't feel tired.

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,640
What are you looking at?

214
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,719
I'm not looking at anything.

215
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:51,159
All right.

216
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,280
Since you helped me to gain fans,

217
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,520
I'll treat you to a meal.

218
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,799
No way.

219
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm a man. How can I let you pay?

220
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,080
Do you have any money?

221
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,719
I have brains.

222
00:12:03,239 --> 00:12:05,000
Then please use your brains

223
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,520
to find a restaurant
offering varieties of meat

224
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:09,200
at an average of RMB50 per person.

225
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
Can't find it, right?

226
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,919
It's my treat then.

227
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:14,320
I can do it.

228
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,679
Wait and see.

229
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:28,960
Have a seat.

230
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,479
The ground is cold.

231
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,000
Sit on my shirt.

232
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,719
This is cool.

233
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,280
It's...

234
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,719
Try it. I'm professional.

235
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,520
Try it.

236
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,799
This is the secret barbecue recipe

237
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,359
of Lin family.

238
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,359
Is it cooked?

239
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,239
Have a try.

240
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
How's it?

241
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,599
Is it so delicious
that it makes you wanna cry?

242
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,159
Are you all right?

243
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,760
Does it hurt? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

244
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,919
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt...

245
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,200
Well then.

246
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,679
I never thought you could cook.

247
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,200
Because

248
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,599
I have brains.

249
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,000
You're definitely

250
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,359
a good father.

251
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,239
You've said this.

252
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,760
Would you like

253
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,520
to become my child's mother?

254
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:32,501
(Ding Mo Psychological Clinic)

255
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,919
Xiao Feng.

256
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,679
Can I call you like this?

257
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,520
Yes.

258
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,280
Actually, the essence of hypnosis

259
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,200
is to get you into your subconscious

260
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,119
to know yourself better.

261
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,280
Don't be nervous.

262
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Let's get started.

263
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Come.

264
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,559
Look at this pocket watch.

265
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,719
Relax your mind. Keep breathing deeply.

266
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,760
Slower down the speed
and frequency of your breathing.

267
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,559
Get it slower.

268
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
Xiao Yun, Xiao Feng.

269
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,719
Slow down.

270
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,119
Don't get tripped.

271
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,760
Sister, be careful.

272
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,239
Look. I caught it.

273
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,840
Thank you.

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,239
I can fly. I'll protect you.

275
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,039
Xiao Feng will be your sister from now on.

276
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,840
Younger brother should protect elder sister.

277
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:38,239
Yes, sir!

278
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,400
Sister, don't be afraid.

279
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,239
Ultraman, Transformers

280
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,119
and I will protect you.

281
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,039
Xiao Yun, look.

282
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,280
This is your birthday present.

283
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:05,159
Quick, make a wish.

284
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:10,200
I want to be with you forever.

285
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,760
How can we stay together forever?

286
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,760
I know it!

287
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,400
We'll get married like dad and mum.

288
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,239
We can stay together forever then.

289
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,760
How was your visit to Dr Ding's?

290
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,440
I recalled many childhood memories.

291
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,960
Is there anything interesting?

292
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:53,840
There were dad, mum

293
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,760
and

294
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,840
Su Muyun.

295
00:16:58,239 --> 00:17:00,760
I had a great childhood.

296
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
Although I always said that

297
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,400
Su Muyun was a devil.

298
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,319
But whatever happened,

299
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
he was always there by my side.

300
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,760
He never left me

301
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,479
even if I pushed him away

302
00:17:15,719 --> 00:17:16,880
and suspected him.

303
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,199
Indeed,

304
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,560
he treated you so well.

305
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,239
I knew it.

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,319
No matter what the truth is,

307
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,760
he's innocent.

308
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Xiao Feng,

309
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,880
no matter what your decision is,

310
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,400
I'll always support you.

311
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,520
But you should

312
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,199
follow the truest idea

313
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,719
in your mind.

314
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,640
Thank you.

315
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,160
Goodbye.

316
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Goodbye.

317
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Before this,

318
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,640
I just want you to focus on your studies.

319
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:59,160
I don't want you to be disturbed.

320
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,119
But I forgot to care about your feelings.

321
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,479
I'm sorry.

322
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,719
Although

323
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,119
I didn't love you the way you like.

324
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,160
I still love you no matter what.

325
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,280
Zhuo Yifeng, fighting.

326
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,680
I believe in you.

327
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,239
No one has the right

328
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,880
to despise the dreams of others.

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,760
A person shines

330
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,719
not when he talks about his dream,

331
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,839
but in the process of making efforts.

332
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,079
I believe that Su Nianfeng can realize it

333
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:29,000
because I've personally witnessed

334
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,119
her growth and transformation.

Are you able to do it?

340

I only have 3 wishes.

341

when you cooked me delicious meals

371
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,400
and I gave you tuition.

I'm not going. I need
to prepare for the defense.

the less to be cherished.

00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,319
but you can never insult my aesthetic.

513
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,560
Do you have aesthetic?

514
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,359
Do you dare to say it again?

Hey man,

we're at the graduation dance party.

519

It's not good if we hide in a corner.

520

I only need you

521

and seal your secret off.

575
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,760

So I'm returning you a favor now.

578

Why are you looking at me?

579
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,280
Xiao Feng, you've grown up

580
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,680
and become more beautiful.

00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,159
I'm Ouyang Qingxue.

682
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,560
Since childhood,

683
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,320
I always got

684
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
what I wanted.

685
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,360
Everyone must give in to me.

686
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,719
You're the only one

687
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,320
that

688
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,479
keep tramping on my self-esteem.

689
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,000
But I've fallen for you.

690
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,879

691
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,199
