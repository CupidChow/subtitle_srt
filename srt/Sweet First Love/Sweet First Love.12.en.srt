You can go back and rest.

141
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,880
I can find a place to stay.

142
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you going to sleep
on the bench at the park

143
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,719
or under the bridge?

144

146
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,679
I also know that you don't want to
spend their money.

147
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,239
How about...

148
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:50,960
you stay at my place for a day or two?

149

No. No need.

150

Just like when I gave you tuition,

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,080
I'll ask for payment.

152
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,359
I'm short of a chef.

153
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,119
It'd be better for someone
with medical background.

154
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,559
Come stay at my place for two days.

155
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,119
You can move out once you find
somewhere suitable to live.

156

Take it as you're looking after me.

157
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,719
Then... I'll stay for two days.

Sure.

159
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,559
You can still cook, right?

160
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,719
You'd cry for my tasty food.

161
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:21,119
I'll start to order then.

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,000

171
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
Can you just shut up for a moment?

172
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,119
No.

173
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,320
What exactly happened
between you two this time?

174
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,239
How could you end up like this?

175
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
Something happened at home.

176
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,559
I'll tell you the whole story next time.

177
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,932
(Advance Bravely and Surpass Yourself)

178
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,200
What's important now is

179
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,080
you should

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
bring Xiao Feng back
from Le Diyin's place.

181
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,520
I'm not going.

182
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,159
I think

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,679
Le Diyin

184
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,960
is quite a charismatic man.

185
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,239
He is elegant and a gentleman.

186
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,840
Apparently, he has a serious illness as well.

187
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,159
It's easy to get sympathized, isn't it?

188
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
It's just like those Korean dramas.

189
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,000
Maybe you can even see Xiao Feng

190
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:34,320
being in a 'till death do us part' scene.

191
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:38,880
No way!

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,080
Anyway,

193
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,960
if he does get together with Xiao Feng,

194
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,479
you'd definitely regret it.

195
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
Le Diyin's home address...

196
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,200
Find out for me.

197
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,960
I was joking.

198
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,200
You really cooked all these?

199
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,239
We made a deal.

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,119
It's my payment.

201
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,119
Grab a seat.

202
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
Here.

203
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,840
This is the bitter gourd and honey juice

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,359
that I improved.

205
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,599
I added some celery.

206
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,159
It is pretty conducive
to cardiovascular system.

207
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:42,479
Drink it up.

208
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,159
I'll get the door.

209
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,159
You...

210
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,799
You're trespassing!

211
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,280
Report me to the police then.

212
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,520
You...

213
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you hungry?

214
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,880
Why don't you sit down and eat with us?

215
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,960
The toast

216
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,880
is burnt.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
The beef

218
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,119
is overcooked.

219
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:57,719
The salad

220
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,479
isn't fresh.

221
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,760
The bitter gourd and honey juice

222
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
smells disgusting.

223
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,920
None of your business!

224
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Go back home with me.

225
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,239
Su Muyun.

226
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,400
Before we find out the truth,

227
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,040
please stop interfering with my life.

228
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,439
I don't want to see you.

229
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,880
Please leave.

230
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm not leaving.

231
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,599
Fine.

232
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,680
If you don't leave, I will go.

233
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,880
She was just blowing off her steam.

234
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,599
She's actually sadder than you.

235
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,119
I know.

236
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,359
I don't need you to tell me.

237
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Even if you didn't look for me today,

238
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,079
I would look for you.

239
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,119
Don't be so fierce.

240
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,280
Sit down and talk with me.

241
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm sick.

242
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,119
Standing makes me tired.

243
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
Why did you go back here?

244
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,400
I want to help her.

245
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,079
This is our family affair.

246
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,520
I think

247
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,520
if someone wants
to get Xiao Feng into trouble,

248
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,400
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

249
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,959
Wouldn't it be better

250
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,239
if we help her together?

251
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,239
You're done considering?

252
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,400
As to the issues of Zhuo Family,

253
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,760
Ouyang Qingxue was the one who told her.

254
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,239
This is her recording.

255
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
I think there's something wrong with it.

256
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,719
But I can't be sure.

257
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,599
I have an idea.

258
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,959
What idea?

259
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,119
Tell me.

260
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,280
Follow me.

261
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,040
Is this person that you're contacting

262
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,319
good?

263
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,160
He has been the champion of

264
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,239
China Cyber Hacking Competition
for a few terms straight.

265
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,319
He's good.

266
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,239
We'll just have to wait for him.

267
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,400
Noob.

268
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,040
Let's get food delivery.

269
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,560
What do you want to eat?

270
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,880
Why don't we have hotpot?

271
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,119
I learned the recipe of a nice dip

272
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,680
from Xiao Feng a few days ago.

273
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,079
Hotpot dips are the least of her forte.

274
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,599
You're so short-sighted.

275
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,239
When did you two have hotpot?

276
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,680
Do you also want to ask

277
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,079
what we ordered

278
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,280
and what she told me?

279
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,119
Aren't you sick? How can you eat hotpot?

280
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,439
Are you worried about me now?

281
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,599
The audio track of this recording

282
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,520
does have been edited.

283
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,119
Uhm...

284
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,800
About the recording,

285
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,319
we haven't gotten to the bottom of it yet.

286
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,280
Just keep it from her for now.

287
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,040
Don't worry.

288
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,680
I'll persuade her to go back.

289
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:45,079
At least to talk things through
with your parents.

290
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:46,880
You're so good to her

291
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,719
just because you two are friends?

292
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,640
Trust me.

293
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,079
Fine.

294
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,319
Come in.

295
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,920
I thought it was Su Muyun.

296
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:27,280
He just left.

297
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:28,599
Didn't you bump into him?

298
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:30,160
No.

299
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,000
After I left,

300
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,560
he didn't bother you, did he?

301
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,680
Did he talk any nonsense?

302
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,400
Did he do anything...

303
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,160
I...

304
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm not concerned about him.

305
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,319
I'm worried about you.

306
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,920
You're sick. I need to take care of you.

307
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,520
I think you like him.

308
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,119
What are you talking about?

309
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,880
Why don't you go back?

310
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,599
Have a good talk with them.

311
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,280
After all, your relationship goes way back.

312
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,359
You should listen to their explanation.

313
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,680
Xiao Feng!

314
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,880
Xiao Feng!

315
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,719
Xiao Feng, you're back.

316
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,880
I...

317
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm back to take my stuff.

318
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:58,560
Xiao Feng...

319
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,040
Let go!

320
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,359
I will never let you go.

321
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,839
I have to leave this place.

322
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,000
Then at least have a talk
with mom and dad.

323
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,239
They

324
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,439
are my biological parents?

325
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,760
Your mother's name was Qin Nianyun.

326
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,800
Your father was Zhuo Mufeng.

327
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:04,719
We were childhood friends.

328
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,400
We grew up together.

329
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,959
We were best friends.

330
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,800
We studied together,

331
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,119
travelled together.

332
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,359
Even our wedding photos
were shot together.

333
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,560
Then

334
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,839
we wanted to start a business together.

335
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,439
So we decided to

336
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,560
come back here and work our way up.

337
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,560
But it was easier said than done.

338
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,199
We've been through a lot of hardships.

339
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,319
Your parents were very determined.

340
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,599
They never gave up.

341
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,719
We tried to persuade them

342
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,040
not to be so harsh

343
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,800
on themselves.

344
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,760
But then...

345
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,319
Then...

346
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,199
I want to know

347
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,800
if you had anything to do with

348
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:02,920
the car accident that killed my parents?

349
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,079
Then, both our families

350
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
started doing business together.

351
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,760
We once accidentally,

352
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,920
unknowingly,

353
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
leaked out a trade secret.

354
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,400
It caused our company

355
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,280
to fall into a crisis.

356
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,880
In the end, we had no choice

357
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,920
but to declare bankruptcy.

358
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:34,319
In order to save the company,
your parents were

359
00:26:35,199 --> 00:26:36,560
working day and night

360
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,000
to raise funds everywhere.

361
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
In the end, it was because

362
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,839
drowsy driving that...

363
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:46,479
Can you explain it in detail?

364
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,800
What do you mean by leaking trade secret?

365
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,199
What does that mean?

366
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,839
So do their deaths

367
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,439
have anything to do with you?

368
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:58,119
It was an accident, a traffic accident.

369
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,880
None of us wanted it to happen.

370
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,400
Why should I trust you?

371
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,479
The recording that Ouyang Qingxue gave you

372
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,119
was edited.

373
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,640
The reference materials she gave you

374
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,280
might not be real as well.

375
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,959
I'll be by your side and
find out the truth with you.

376
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
No need.

377
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,400
As for the truth,

378
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:24,959
I will find it out myself.

379
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,160
Thank you for raising me all these years.

380
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,160
I'll never forget your kindness.

381
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,439
Xiao Feng...

382
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,040
But before this is settled,

383
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,800
I don't want to have anything

384
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,479
to do with you Su Family.

385
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,319
Xiao Feng...

386
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Xiao Feng...

387
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,119
Xiao Feng...

388
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:07,920
Xiao Feng...

389
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,560

You're awake. Do you want breakfast?

408
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,800
Nope.

409
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,280
I need to get to class in the afternoon.

410
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,719
I'll head to school now.

411
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,000
Are you okay?

412
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,719
Time to eat.

413
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,680
(Monica - Director of R&D Department)
Miss.

414
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,680
What?

415
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:35,479
She's Monica.

416
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,359
Both her parents are involved in business
and from a wealthy background.

417
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,959
(Curriculum Vitae, Overview, Project undertaken)
She graduated from an Ivy League university.

418
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,040
Half a year ago, she
accepted the offer of Ouyang Group

419
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,599
to be the director of the R&D department.

420
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,880
Strict, disciplined,

421
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,040
a perfectionist.

422
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,800
But in private...

423
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,599
Go on.

424
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,199
It's said that

425
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,439
she's very ambitious

426
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,959
always wants to be the girlfriend
of the chairman.

427
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,680
Whereas she has always laughed it off.

428
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,319
Interesting.

429
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,880
Then how is her relationship
with Zhuo Yifeng?

430
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,119
She is very against the idea of

431
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,160
hiring interns for the chairman.

432
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,160
Zhuo Yifeng

433
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,040
is only still an undergraduate student.

434
00:31:08,479 --> 00:31:10,319
She's got good grades in school,

435
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,560
and the chairman seems to be
especially fond of her

436
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:13,800
and even entrusts her with important tasks.

437
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:16,199
Monica has always seen her
as a thorn in the flesh.

438
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,119
To have

439
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:21,239
an intern that came out of nowhere

440
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,359
steal her thunder in front
of someone she likes.

441
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,359
I understand why she's upset.

442
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,880
Get back to work.

443
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,239
-Yes.
-That's all for now.

444
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,439
Monica.

445
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,880
I've seen you a few times
in my brother's company.

446
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,599
I have a really good impression of you.

447
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,280
Really?

448
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,400
Thank you.

449
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,280
You're an exceptionally smart woman.

450
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,920
So let's get straight to the point.

451
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
The reason why I looked for you

452
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,800
was my brother.

453
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,079
He's old enough to have a girlfriend.

454
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,359
My mom is hurrying him up

455
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:08,000
and I'm worried about him as well.

456
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Qingxue.

457
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,520
Why are you saying all these?

458
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,199
In my heart,

459
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,520
only the finest woman

460
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,199
is worth being with my brother.

461
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,680
For example, you.

462
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,000
This is too valuable.

463
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,359
But...

464
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,119
I heard that my brother

465
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,319
is getting close with an intern
in the company.

466
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
I'm afraid that...

467
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,119
It's nothing to worry about.

468
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,040
She's just an undergraduate intern

469
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,439
whose looks and capability
are way below par.

470
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,040
The chairman will never fall for

471
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,439
this kind of girl.

472
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,400
Xiao Feng is my schoolmate.

473
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,920
She's a simple person.

474
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,920
I don't think she gets close
to my brother on purpose.

475
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,520
Maybe my brother rarely

476
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,119
gets to meet such an innocent girl.

477
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,719
That's why he thinks she's special.

478
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:06,880
Innocent?

479
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,680
Not necessarily.

480
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,359
Girls who seem innocent on the outside

481
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,000
are usually more dangerous.

482
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,359
But I feel that

483
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
the chairman won't

484
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,199
waste his time with this kind of girl.

485
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:19,839
Don't worry.

486
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,920
I know what to do.

487
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,800
Finish all these before you get off work.

488
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:41,239
That's too much.

489
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,520
Even if there were three of me,

490
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,479
I couldn't finish them
even if I work overnight.

491
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,520
If you're incapable, you can leave.

492
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:49,560
But there's been too much work this week.

493
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,520
I've been going back at midnight everyday

494
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,119
and sleeping only four to five hours a day.

495
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:58,640
You can actually hire one more intern.

496
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,439
The company is trying to save budget.

497
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,199
Someone as incapable as you

498
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:04,479
would quickly be overtaken
if we get another intern.

499
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,479
I'm only doing this for you.

500
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,040
You can think about it.

501
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,239
Monica!

502
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,560
Can I ask for

503
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,040
an advance on my salary this month?

504
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,000
Salary?

505
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,159
You were absent and late for work
without any reason a few days ago

506
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,879
and you dare to ask for a salary advance?

507
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
If everyone is like you in the company,

508
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,679
how can the company even work?

509
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,719
I've heard that

510
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:42,719
you got in there

511
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,479
by pulling strings, right?

512
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,840
If I were you,

513
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,800
I would feel really embarrassed.

514
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,360
She pulled strings...

515
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Things went pretty well this morning.

516
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,919
I think our cooperation

517
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,760
would go very smoothly.

518
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,439
Happy to work with you.

519
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,679
Sure. See you next time.

520
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,360
Where have you been these few days?

521
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm sorry, sir.

522
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,399
Something happened at home recently.

523
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,679
But I'll finish off

524
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,080
the rest of my work as soon as possible.

525
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:26,520
Sir.

526
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,919
I wonder

527
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,199
why you'd hire me?

528
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,000
Are you too tired recently?

529
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,159
How about this?

530
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,919
Let me bring you to a place.

531
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,439
Take it as employee welfare.

532
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:53,360
Let's go.

533
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,439
When in a bad mood,

534
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:17,879
everyone needs a glass once in a while.

535
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,879
The color looks so pretty.

536
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,040
Have a taste.

537
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,159
It's so sweet.

538
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,560
One more?

539
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,520
Don't drink anymore.

540
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:08,320
You'll start to feel unwell.

541
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,760
I still want to drink.

542
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,320
You really can't drink anymore.

543
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,320
If you're upset about anything,

544
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,000
you can tell me.

545
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,360
It's easier to talk with a stranger

546
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,360
than people whom you're close with.

547
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,120
What should I say?

548
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,199
Anything.

549
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,560
Your past

550
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,000
or your present.

551
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
Past...

552
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,600
In the past...

553
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,320
I was rarely to be noticed

554
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,560
and was always ignored.

555
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:58,719
But

556
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,919
I still wanted to live my ordinary life.

557
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,479
You can't drink anymore.

558
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,719
In the school,

559
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,639
I had few friends.

560
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
Oh, yeah...

561
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,520
Le Diyin was my only friend.

562
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,399
Le Diyin?

563
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,840
Who's Le Diyin?

564
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,639
He kept encouraging and supporting me.

565
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,639
He's my best friend.

566
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,840
I got into medical school for him.

567
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,239
Is he sick?

568
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:50,679
He has a very serious heart disease.

569
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,840
I'm sorry.

570
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:41,524
(Thomas)

571
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,760
Mr. Ouyang, are you free to talk now?

572
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:44,800
Please wait a while.

573
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,840
Have you finished writing

574
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,080
our recent lab report?

575
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,639
It's due this weekend. Don't forget it.

576
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,320
I need this to get the scholarship.

577
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,879
Don't hold me back.

578
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
I know.

579
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,000
Be careful!

580
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,360
Where am I?

581
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,719
Are you an idiot?

582
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,159
