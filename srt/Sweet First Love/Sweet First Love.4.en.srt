The Days When My Brother And I Live Together)

00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,326
(Episode 4)

25
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:53,523
Think about this recommendation seriously.

26
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:54,722
Give it a deep thought.

27
00:01:54,923 --> 00:01:56,003
Give me your parents' number.

28
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,523
I'll talk with them.

29
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:59,482
My parents are usually abroad.

30
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:00,883
It's hard to meet them.

31
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,003
Why don't we ask Su Nianfeng to come over?

32
00:02:03,442 --> 00:02:05,762
My parents are not around,
so she is considered my guardian.

33
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,083
Get out.

34
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:12,923
Goodbye, sir.

35
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,993
(Year 3 Class 5)

36
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:33,322
Stand up.

37
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:36,923
Good day, sir.

38
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,122
Sit down.

39
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,042
School anniversary is around the corner.

40
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:44,242
Prepare a class performance.

41
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:46,602
It'll be quite meaningful.

42
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,563
You all seem to be very interested in it.

43
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,803
However meaningful it is,

44
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,443
it is less important than study.

45
00:03:58,003 --> 00:03:59,122
If anyone is interested,

46
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:01,042
submit the registration form to me.

47
00:04:01,762 --> 00:04:02,723
The class is over.

48
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,122
How about singing?

49
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:11,843
It's fun.

50
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:12,602
We're in our senior year.

51
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,682
Who would have time for this?

52
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,723
Su Nianfeng.

53
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,362
I think you're suitable.

54
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:22,323
Come. Listen up.

55
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:24,323
Le Diyin, let me borrow your pen a while.

56
00:04:24,563 --> 00:04:26,483
Well, in terms of appearance,

57
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,763
it's barely acceptable.

58
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,043
But the good thing
is that you have plenty of time.

59
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:33,323
I need to study too.

60
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:35,003
Look.

61
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:35,723
It's very meaningful

62
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,563
to do performances.

63
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:38,402
Think about it.

64
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:40,443
The whole school will be watching you

65
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,202
performing on the stage.

66
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,122
Even the thought of it
makes me feel so excited.

67
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:46,443
Look. Many famous alumni

68
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:49,003
will be attending the school anniversary.

69
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,163
What if...

70
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,443
What if any scouts are interested in you?

71
00:04:52,603 --> 00:04:55,003
Isn't it great to reach
the pinnacle of life in an instant?

72
00:04:57,443 --> 00:04:58,962
She said she didn't want to go.

73
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:00,402
Didn't you hear her?

74
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,443
Su Nianfeng, the harder you work,
the luckier you get.

75
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:05,962
Go for it.

76
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:07,402
Go for it.

77
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:14,082
I can bully you.

78
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,163
But

79
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:19,603
not others.

80
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:43,922
Qin Yao.

81
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:49,082
Xiao Feng, I heard you've improved
by ten in the rank.

82
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,202
Your brother told me to have a celebration.

83
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,402
Let's go and have hotpot.

84
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:53,802
Sure.

85
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:55,163
Don't spew nonsense.

86
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:56,603
It has nothing to do with me.

87
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:03,163
Le Diyin, do you want
to have hotpot together?

88
00:06:04,362 --> 00:06:06,122
Qin Yao, this is my desk mate.

89
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:07,163
His name is Le Diyin.

90
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,402
Thanks to him for tutoring me
for the exam.

91
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:10,962
I'm greatly indebted to him.

92
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,163
Hi.

93
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:13,362
Hi.

94
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:22,003
I don't feel so well.
So I won't be joining you.

95
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:24,522
All right then.

96
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:26,563
All right.

97
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,763
We'll get going then.
Go home and get some rest.

98
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,723
Le Diyin, see you tomorrow. Bye!

99
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,402
We'll get going then. See you.

100
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:34,443
Bye.

101
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,043
Xiao Yun, let go of Xiao Feng.

102
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,642
Why do you always bully her?

103
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:52,362
All right.

104
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:53,962
To prevent Su Muyun

105
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:55,202
from ruining my sauce,

106
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,883
I've come up with a name for it.
It's called...

107
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:58,003
It's called poison.

108
00:06:58,603 --> 00:06:59,922
You're so annoying.

109
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:01,843
All right. Thank you.

110
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:04,122
Right, Xiao Feng.

111
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,603
Are you planning to take part
in the school anniversary performance?

112
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:09,003
I...

113
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,723
I'm in my senior year now.

114
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,483
I should just focus on my study.

115
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,922
How about you? Are you taking part in it?

116
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:17,723
I'm planning to sign up
for a singing performance

117
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,122
with Qi Yuan.

118
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,563
I think the participation
in the school anniversary

119
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:22,883
is going to be a special memory.

120
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,962
I don't want to have any regrets
in my high school years.

121
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:28,522
All right. All the best.

122
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:33,883
Quickly finish up the meal
and go home to do your homework.

123
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:37,522
Xiao Feng, I think you can give it a try.

124
00:07:37,682 --> 00:07:38,642
Look.

125
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,323
One,

126
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:41,723
it helps to relieve study stress.

127
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,283
Two, we can develop our skills.

128
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,843
Isn't that great?

129
00:07:45,323 --> 00:07:48,003
Do you think I can do it?

130
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:49,443
She has no talent.

131
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:50,922
It's the school anniversary.

132
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,642
Not the New Year Gala.
It's not that strict.

133
00:07:52,843 --> 00:07:54,242
I think everyone has his own

134
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:55,843
unique talent and potential.

135
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:57,242
Just brush up on your skills.

136
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:58,563
I believe you can do it.

137
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:00,202
Xiao Feng, you can do it.

138
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:02,003
Eat your food.

139
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:03,642
Don't mislead her.

140
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:10,682
It's so hot.

141
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,402
I'll do it myself.

142
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:33,562
If only I could perform with Qin Yao.

143
00:08:33,723 --> 00:08:34,843
That will be great.

144
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:37,803
I'm starving.

145
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,442
Would you like a bowl

146
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,043
of extreme spicy hell ramen?

147
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,522
Less spicy. I have acne.

148
00:08:50,283 --> 00:08:51,402
Give it back to me!

149
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:54,603
All it takes to change your mind

150
00:08:54,762 --> 00:08:56,402
is a few words from Qin Yao?

151
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,082
Of course not.

152
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:00,043
I just want to develop my skills

153
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:01,322
and have no regrets.

154
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:02,843
You have no artistic talent.

155
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,562
How do you know I don't?

156
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:07,363
Get out!

157
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:09,603
I'm gonna discover my artistic talent.

158
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,163
Suit yourself.

159
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:12,762
Get out.

160
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:15,562
Su Muyun.

161
00:09:22,043 --> 00:09:24,283
What kind of performance I should do
for the school anniversary?

162
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:25,723
Fried Rice with Eggshell.

163
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:31,962
Do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si...

164
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:33,762
I'll call the cops if you keep singing!

165
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:35,082
I'll stop. All right?

166
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:44,873
(Su)

167
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:46,843
"Why are you so silly?"

168
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:49,243
"Where have you been, my silly child?"

169
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:52,923
"Why are you so silly, my child?"

170
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,483
Planning a talent show here?

171
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,402
Could this place

172
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,202
have some special scent

173
00:10:01,322 --> 00:10:02,603
that gives you special inspiration?

174
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:03,642
No.

175
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,843
This is the only place
where Su Muyun isn't around.

176
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,603
I want to be alone.

177
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,803
It's just a talent show.

178
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,603
I'll help you.

179
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,163
Do you have any talents?

180
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:20,002
A makeup show?

181
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,363
I don't. But I can learn.

182
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,163
Let's form a team.

183
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:28,402
We could call ourselves Huiming Sisters.

184
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,043
If Su Muyun joins us,

185
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,762
we'll call the team

186
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,962
as Huiming TF Girls. It's perfect!

187
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,442
It's good enough
if Su Muyun doesn't screw it up.

188
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,123
You must be kidding me.

189
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,562
If so, we can perform...

190
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:45,483
a recital.

191
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:46,803
Recital?

192
00:10:47,762 --> 00:10:50,363
We could do the kind with extreme misery

193
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:52,522
coupled with a piece
of melancholic background music.

194
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,723
The audience will weep uncontrollably.

195
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:57,882
The star of campus
will be none other than you.

196
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:01,683
When you put it that way,
it seems like it might just work.

197
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,082
Also, my dad happens to know

198
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:04,843
a broadcast expert.

199
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,642
Given her expertise,

200
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,363
you'll learn in no time.

201
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:09,762
You'll win for sure.

202
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:11,843
All right. Let's sign up then.

203
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:12,843
All right.

204
00:11:15,363 --> 00:11:16,442
I'll fill up the form then.

205
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:19,082
Our team is called TF Girls.

206
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:20,762
The team leader?

207
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:21,762
It's you.

208
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,522
No, I can't do it. You'll be the leader.

209
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,402
You do it.

210
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,563
(Registration form)

211
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,202
So, you and Liu Zihui
want to perform together?

212
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,363
What's your talent?

213
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,082
We have found the centre.

214
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,723
We'll be going there to learn.

215
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:40,002
You don't even have enough time
to study for your senior year.

216
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,642
And you want to learn this?

217
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,762
Do you have good grades?

218
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,402
Sir.

219
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:46,402
Come on in.

220
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:52,962
All right.

221
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:58,082
Sir, don't worry.

222
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,683
I'll tutor her.

223
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:05,123
You, youngsters, are just so impulsive.

224
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,123
Su Nianfeng, make full preparations.

225
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:08,483
Don't make us look bad.

226
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:10,202
Sure. Thank you, sir.

227
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,283
Thank you, sir.

228
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,603
Get back to your class.

229
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,723
Hey, thank you.

230
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:22,803
I agreed to tutor you

231
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,923
but it doesn't mean you have my support
with the performance.

232
00:12:25,723 --> 00:12:26,723
You're not cut out for it.

233
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,442
Why would you help me then?

234
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:30,882
I just don't want

235
00:12:30,882 --> 00:12:32,603
to have a sister
who has never gone to college.

236
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:33,402
You...

237
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:35,363
Can you say something nice for once?

238
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:51,762
Xiao Feng.

239
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:53,603
Qin Yao.

240
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,283
Xiao Feng, where's your desk mate?

241
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,243
Why didn't he join you for lunch?

242
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:02,163
Le Diyin took sick leave.

243
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,762
I'm worried if it's serious.

244
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:06,283
You should just mind your own business.

245
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:10,082
Right, Qin Yao.

246
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:12,123
I've participated
in the school anniversary too.

247
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:13,683
Really?

248
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:14,962
What performance did you sign up for?

249
00:13:15,202 --> 00:13:17,442
Liu Zihui and I signed up
to do recital performance.

250
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:18,123
Tomorrow

251
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,243
she'll take me to the broadcasting class.

252
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:21,522
Really?

253
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,882
Qi Yuan is taking lessons there too.

254
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:26,283
She's going to take the art exam.

255
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:29,202
What a coincidence.

256
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:32,762
The school anniversary
is going to be a great memory.

257
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:34,762
I think it's worth the try.

258
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:36,283
Xiao Feng, keep it up.

259
00:13:36,522 --> 00:13:38,642
I'm waiting for your performance
to amaze everyone.

260
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:39,843
Sure. Keep it up.

261
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:42,522
Don't get too excited.

262
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:45,962
You'll most probably
just make an exhibition of yourself.

263
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:48,603
Su Muyun.

264
00:13:48,803 --> 00:13:50,522
Why won't you have faith in me?

265
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:53,843
Because I know you better
than you know yourself.

266
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:56,762
Xiao Yun.

267
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,562
Stop trying to demotivate Xiao Feng.

268
00:14:00,002 --> 00:14:01,843
You're so disappointing.

269
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:05,043
After some time
I'll really lose confidence.

270
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:06,923
I need to stay away from you

271
00:14:07,082 --> 00:14:08,962
so I can live well.

272
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,243
Here.

273
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:13,803
Xiao Feng, here's a drumstick for you.

274
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:16,642
-Thank you.
-Don't be mad.

275
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:20,002
Actually, Xiao Yun is quite nice to you.

276
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,163
His bark is worse than his bite.

277
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:23,762
He doesn't know how to express himself.

278
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:25,243
Actually, he did something behind...

279
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,243
Shut up.

280
00:14:29,442 --> 00:14:32,123
Qin Yao, thank you
for always comforting me.

281
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:33,843
Also, thanks for the drumstick.

282
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,082
Where are you going?

283
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:49,642
It's a secret.

284
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,002
Liu Zihui has told me.

285
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,002
Broadcasting course, right?

286
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,642
Why bother asking since you already knew?

287
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,123
Don't you know your place?

288
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:58,642
Mind your own business. I'm your sister.

289
00:14:58,803 --> 00:15:00,923
Don't you have respect for the elder?

290
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:05,402
You're not my sister.

291
00:15:06,002 --> 00:15:07,243
Zhuo Yifeng.

292
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:21,123
How about playing a round?

293
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:22,962
No, I have things to do.

294
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,243
It's the weekend. What could you be doing?

295
00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:26,603
Is your schedule that packed?

296
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,322
I risked getting frozen to death

297
00:15:32,283 --> 00:15:33,843
to get this piece of information.

298
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:35,043
Thank you.

299
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:36,603
Take a look.

300
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,243
Do you think I can get

301
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,123
Su Muyun's attention with this top?

302
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:42,762
From my 17 years
of aesthetic point of view,

303
00:15:43,163 --> 00:15:45,082
you need to wear a skirt
to look more feminine.

304
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,962
You need the no-makeup makeup look.

305
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:49,923
Also, my mom told me

306
00:15:50,163 --> 00:15:51,522
that girls who act coquettishly
are the luckiest.

307
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:54,163
You have to know how to act coquettishly.

308
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,683
Those are outdated tricks.

309
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,642
Try it out.

310
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,562
All right then.

311
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,522
I'll give it a try.

312
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,442
Today, we'll be learning Chapter 7.

313
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:09,082
It's about the coordination

314
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,683
of the oral and facial muscles.

315
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,082
Su Nianfeng.

316
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:13,642
First of all,

317
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:15,723
-Su Nianfeng.
-Lift up the zygomaticus muscles.

318
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:16,882
Just like what I'm doing now.

319
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,163
Come over.

320
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:20,483
All right. Focus and watch me.

321
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,882
Come on. Repeat after me.

322
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,843
-Ah...
-Ah...

323
00:16:23,843 --> 00:16:25,082
Yes, open your mouth.

324
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:26,522
You can feel that the zygomatic muscles

325
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:28,762
don't just produce
the expression of smiling.

326
00:16:28,923 --> 00:16:29,683
Girls.

327
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:31,442
You can feel it yourselves.

328
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,723
Are you out of your mind??

329
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:36,562
Go home and cook for me.

330
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,522
My class isn't over yet.

331
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,522
Just give up on the school anniversary.

332
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:42,002
Let me tell you. I can do it.

333
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:43,163
We'll see.

334
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,002
Are you doing it because of Qin Yao?

335
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:54,163
Take down the notes.

336
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:57,082
None of your business.

337
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:07,322
You don't want Su Nianfeng

338
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:09,442
to take part in the school anniversary,
right?

339
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,003
What do you want?

340
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,763
I can help you.

341
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:14,723
You?

342
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,243
It's lunchtime.

343
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,962
I'm feeling a little hungry.

344
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,363
It's not funny.

345
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,403
Enjoy yourselves.

346
00:17:36,483 --> 00:17:37,282
Here.

347
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:38,840
Try the lobsters.

348
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,120
It tastes better
than any high-end restaurants.

349
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,200
Are you telling me

350
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,763
you don't know how to peel crayfish?

351
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:04,082
Su Nianfeng helps me peel them

352
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,843
when I eat at home.

353
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:12,003
There you go.

354
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:17,162
It looks like Su Nianfeng is really mad.

355
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,003
If she doesn't want to cook
for you anymore,

356
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,843
come to me. We can order meals together.

357
00:18:22,003 --> 00:18:22,843
How about that?

358
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:46,883
What can I do to stop her
from joining the school anniversary?

359
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:49,763
First, you have to tell me

360
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,922
why won't you let her take part in it?

361
00:18:52,082 --> 00:18:53,643
It's not a bad thing anyway.

362
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:56,523
I'm a very reasonable person.

363
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,802
You don't have to know.

364
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:00,243
No way. You have to tell me

365
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,682
what you are quarrelling for.

366
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,003
I forgot to remind you.

367
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:17,322
Don't make him feel annoyed.

368
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,562
If the loss is more than the gain,
you'd better not meet him.

369
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,922
It's too late.

370
00:19:29,082 --> 00:19:29,843
It still can be salvaged.

371
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,922
Pretend to have a stomachache.

372
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,282
Show the weak side of you.

373
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:34,562
Arouse his sense of responsibility
and desire to protect you.

374
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:37,962
-I'm having a stomachache.
-I'm having a stomachache.

375
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:48,523
Su Muyun, remember it.

376
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,202
I saved you.

377
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:56,562
Su Nianfeng, open up!

378
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:58,802
Su Nianfeng!

379
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,603
Open the door!

380
00:20:03,523 --> 00:20:05,922
Su Nianfeng, your brother is dying!

381
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:10,082
Hurry.

382
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:12,682
What's going on?

383
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,409
(Indigestion tablets)

384
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:26,123
Let me help you.

385
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,363
No, it's fine. I'll do it.

386
00:20:28,682 --> 00:20:30,243
Don't you know you have a bad stomach?

387
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:31,123
If anything happens to you,

388
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:32,682
how am I going to answer to our parents?

389
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,723
Here. Take the medicine.

390
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,162
Well...

391
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,562
I'm sorry.
My brother has caused you trouble.

392
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,082
Not at all.

393
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:01,843
We're going to be a family anyway.

394
00:21:01,962 --> 00:21:03,123
Shut up.

395
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,763
Xiao Feng, if there's nothing else,

396
00:21:12,243 --> 00:21:13,603
I'll get going.

397
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:14,723
All right.

398
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,483
Su Muyun, take care.

399
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:21,082
See you.

400
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:23,042
-I'll see you out the door.
-Bye.

401
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:30,843
See you.

402
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:31,483
Bye.

403
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,322
Bye.

404
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:57,243
Why are your eyelashes so long?

405
00:21:57,843 --> 00:21:59,802
They are even longer than mine.

406
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,082
What's the use?

407
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,962
You have such a bad temper.

408
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:12,282
Look how nice I am to you.

409
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:15,003
If you don't let me take part
in the school anniversary,

410
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,523
I'll ignore you from now on.

411
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:19,003
I'll not take care of you.

(Small Eyes)
Hey, did he do it on purpose?

432
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:15,802
If he was,

433
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,763
his acting skills...

434
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:21,202
could have contested for the Oscar.

435
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:22,883
You're right.

436
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,562
I always felt things are weird

437
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:27,243
between Su Muyun and Su Nianfeng.

438
00:24:27,403 --> 00:24:29,843
But I couldn't tell what it was.

439
00:24:30,922 --> 00:24:32,322
You could tell

440
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,403
from their academic performance,

441
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:35,363
right?

442
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:36,403
No.

443
00:24:37,282 --> 00:24:39,243
It's a woman's intuition.

444
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,682
I need to dive deeper into it.

445
00:24:46,643 --> 00:24:47,763
Where are you going?

446
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:55,003
Li Zihui said

447
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,603
that they'd be teaching pronunciation
in the broadcast class today.

448
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,243
Fine. Just go.

449
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,322
I vomited three times

450
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,802
and had the runs four times last night.

451
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,883
When you get home
and find my dead body,

452
00:25:07,042 --> 00:25:08,763
don't be afraid.

453
00:25:27,082 --> 00:25:28,282
I'm going to be late.

454
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:29,962
Is the school anniversary

455
00:25:30,082 --> 00:25:31,442
really that important to you?

456
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:34,403
I want to prove myself to you.

457
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:36,723
Besides, I want to develop my skills.

458
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,003
I can't rely on you forever.

459
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:40,442
Right, there's porridge.

460
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:41,483
Wait for me.

461
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,922
Actually, you can rely on me forever.

462
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:51,682
Are your preparations
for the school anniversary going well?

463
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,042
I've been working really hard.

464
00:25:55,202 --> 00:25:57,643
But I'm still a little scared.

465
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,042
Do you want to give up?

466
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:01,003
My grades are bad.

467
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:04,042
In terms of talents,
it's a hasty last-minute effort.

468
00:26:04,322 --> 00:26:05,643
Our teacher takes a dim view of me,

469
00:26:05,883 --> 00:26:07,723
not to mention Su Muyun.

470
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,962
Tell me. Is there even a point

471
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,523
for me to persevere?

472
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:14,442
It doesn't matter
what others think of you.

473
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,243
What matters
is what you think of yourself.

474
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,363
Sometimes, you have to make efforts

475
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:18,763
that no one else has made before

476
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,483
to get yourself further in life.

477
00:26:22,962 --> 00:26:24,162
I've prepared some materials.

478
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,643
You can bring home and take a look.

479
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,363
Remember to practice the tongue twister

480
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:38,523
that I sent you today. Fighting!

481
00:26:39,962 --> 00:26:42,162
Eight hundred pacesetters
run to the north slope.

482
00:26:42,483 --> 00:26:44,483
Eight hundred pacesetters
run to the north...

483
00:26:44,723 --> 00:26:45,843
Eight hundred...

484
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:14,363
Who's that?

485
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:27,202
Is his stomach better?

486
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,082
I came to visit him.

487
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:32,322
I'm not dead yet.

488
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,883
It's my first time bringing flowers
to visit the patient.

489
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:42,483
I don't know what kind of flowers
I should buy.

490
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,042
I think the flowers

491
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,763
look beautiful.

492
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:48,962
It's quite artistic.

493
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,003
Right?

494
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:55,082
Actually, I'm here to see you.

495
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:55,883
Me?

496
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:56,962
Yes.

497
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:58,843
Think about it.

498
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:00,042
Both of us

499
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:01,682
have formed a team, right?

500
00:28:01,883 --> 00:28:03,162
We should foster our relationships

501
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:05,442
and chemistry.

502
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:08,123
Well, have you memorised
the tongue twister?

503
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,643
When was this photo taken?

504
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:13,082
This was...

505
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:16,802
Is this Su Muyun?

506
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,363
He looked so funny when he was a kid.

507
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:23,322
I don't quite remember the things
when we were kids.

508
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:25,523
But my parents
would go through it with me.

509
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,322
You don't remember?

510
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:31,883
Look at this.

511
00:28:32,123 --> 00:28:33,723
We took it in Hangzhou.

512
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,162
Who's this little girl?

513
00:28:37,363 --> 00:28:38,523
She's quite pretty.

514
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:40,082
She...

515
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:44,763
♪ Let's paddle together ♪

516
00:28:45,162 --> 00:28:49,682
♪ The boat pushes away the waves ♪

517
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:54,763
♪ The sea reflects
the beautiful white pagoda ♪

518
00:28:55,603 --> 00:28:56,802
Xiao Qiang, come here.

519
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:00,202
For you.

520
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:01,282
Thank you.

521
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:04,003
Xiao Qiang, my mom told me that the kid

522
00:29:04,162 --> 00:29:05,123
who played with my sister

523
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,802
would have a lifetime bed-wetting issue.

524
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:09,562
Really?

525
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:15,202
Sister.

526
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,042
Don't cry anymore.

527
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:22,202
Because of you, Xiao Qiang doesn't want
to play with me anymore.

528
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:24,363
Sister, if he doesn't play with you,

529
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,322
I'll play with you.

530
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:29,562
Xiao Feng! Xiao Yun!

531
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:30,682
Look over here!

532
00:29:33,243 --> 00:29:35,403
It turns out Su Muyun was so mischievous
when he was a kid.

533
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,442
That's right.

534
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,042
I didn't expect you

535
00:29:43,243 --> 00:29:44,883
to be so concerned
about the school celebration.

536
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:48,523
I've never done this before.

537
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:50,363
If I don't work harder,

538
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:52,523
I might not even pass the audition.

539
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,723
He doesn't want you to join, right?

540
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:56,763
Why is that?

541
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:57,802
Him?

542
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,322
He's just being upset.

543
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:02,243
He said Qin Yao's suggestion
was not suitable for me.

544
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:03,723
Qin Yao?

545
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:08,562
Qin Yao, the captain
of the basketball team?

546
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:14,202
But I heard

547
00:30:14,483 --> 00:30:16,442
that Qin Yao would be performing too.

548
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:17,843
Are you doing this for him?

549
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:19,282
Of course not.

550
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:20,883
Don't be shy.

551
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:22,643
Look.

552
00:30:22,802 --> 00:30:25,802
With my help, you can surely
make it for the school anniversary.

553
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:26,962
Really?

554
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:30,763
I can never repay you
for your great kindness.

555
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,042
It's no big deal.

556
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:34,202
We're a family.

557
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:35,723
Su Muyun.

558
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:37,843
I'll help your sister
with the performance.

559
00:30:38,042 --> 00:30:39,483
Just focus on getting better.

560
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:47,042
Hold your head up high.

561
00:30:47,202 --> 00:30:48,202
Stick out your butt.

562
00:31:00,682 --> 00:31:01,643
Xiao Feng.

563
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:04,082
I get a headache
whenever I hear others doing a recital.

564
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:06,082
We'll part one day no matter how far we go.

565
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:07,123
I'm leaving now.

566
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:09,483
No, we're Huiming Twins.

567
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:11,042
We can't do it without any of us.

568
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,883
I'll go out and cool down first.

569
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:29,123
I'm sorry.

570
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:30,802
She didn't mean it.

571
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,442
Are you all right?

572
00:31:32,962 --> 00:31:33,802
I'm fine.

573
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,922
No one's asking you.

574
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:39,282
Qi Yuan.

575
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:46,802
Are you tired?

576
00:31:48,922 --> 00:31:50,643
Pudding milk tea. Your favorite.

577
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:51,643
Let me get that for you.

578
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:52,843
Thank you.

579
00:31:53,282 --> 00:31:54,763
Less sugar with extra oat.

580
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,483
So she's Qi Yuan?

581
00:31:58,682 --> 00:31:59,843
I like the flavour the most.

582
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,282
Thanks for keeping my favours in mind.

583
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:02,282
It's no big deal.

584
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:04,723
Lame.

585
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:06,363
There's nothing to see.

586
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:08,682
Xiao Feng, what a coincidence.

587
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:09,802
Let me do the introduction.

588
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,162
This is Su Nianfeng, Xiao Yun's sister.

589
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,562
This is my friend, Qi Yuan.

590
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:17,322
Compared to her brother,

591
00:32:17,682 --> 00:32:19,562
that's quite a huge difference.

592
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,682
Is this how you talk?

593
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:24,723
What's wrong?

594
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:26,802
Do you not know
how to mind your tongue?

595
00:32:26,922 --> 00:32:27,562
Forget it.

596
00:32:27,562 --> 00:32:29,723
Let's take a breath. Come on.

597
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,322
Sure.

598
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:33,123
It's filled with foul atmosphere.

599
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,322
Let's take a walk outside.

600
00:32:37,483 --> 00:32:38,603
It's quite stuffy in here.

601
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:39,843
Sure. Let's go.

602
00:32:39,962 --> 00:32:42,243
Did someone spill the lemon?
I smell jealousy.

603
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:47,562
Why would you like to eat later?

604
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:49,042
Xiao Feng.

605
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,162
I heard you're learning broadcasting.

606
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,442
No, I'm preparing
for the school anniversary.

607
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:57,922
So I came to sit in on the class.

608
00:32:58,082 --> 00:32:59,843
Broadcasting isn't something
that anyone can learn.

609
00:33:00,123 --> 00:33:02,123
Given your conditions,

610
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,042
don't be discouraged

611
00:33:04,202 --> 00:33:05,562
if you make an exhibition of yourself.

612
00:33:05,802 --> 00:33:07,082
Who are you looking down on?

613
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,243
-It's for her own good.
-Don't say that.

614
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,403
I've heard you have bad grades.

615
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:12,802
Instead of doing this,

616
00:33:12,922 --> 00:33:14,682
you might as well use the time
to memorise English vocabulary.

617
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:15,962
-If not, you might not
-Stop.

618
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:17,483
even pass the college entrance exam.

619
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:18,962
You just don't know
how to talk properly, right?

620
00:33:18,962 --> 00:33:20,363
-Forget it.
-What she wants to do...

621
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,162
has nothing to do with you.

622
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:28,442
Don't shoot your mouth off
if you don't know her.

623
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,282
No one has the right

624
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,322
to undermine others' efforts.

625
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,723
You know I don't mean that.

626
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:39,202
I'm a professional.

627
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:40,883
It might sound harsh.

628
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:42,643
But the truth is often hard to swallow.

629
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:44,763
I really just wanted to help Xiao Feng.

630
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:45,802
Save it.

631
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:49,562
Xiao Feng is great.

632
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:51,403
You should just mind your own business.

633
00:33:54,442 --> 00:33:55,723
Let's go back to the class.

634
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:58,883
He does have a conscience after all.

635
00:34:00,322 --> 00:34:02,282
Xiao Feng, don't take it to heart.

636
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:08,282
Pretending to be innocent. How annoying.

637
00:34:08,722 --> 00:34:10,403
Is Qin Yao blind?

638
00:34:11,522 --> 00:34:12,722
Why are you here?

639
00:34:16,282 --> 00:34:17,562
I'm afraid you might lose your voice.

640
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,801
(Loquat honeysuckle throat lozenge)

641
00:34:19,403 --> 00:34:20,843
Don't curse me.

642
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,562
Are you feeling unwell of your voice?

643
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,163
Take this.

644
00:34:36,403 --> 00:34:38,123
I gave it to you. Only you can eat it.

645
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,562
Do you have no conscience at all?

646
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:45,242
Whatever it is,
I've saved your life before.

647
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,683
My heart is aching.

648
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:52,643
So cold, and it's just so sad.

649
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:06,802
Thank you.

650
00:35:16,802 --> 00:35:18,002
(Broadcasting Training Class)
Girls.

651
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,722
Let's begin today's recital lesson.

652
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,802
This is the last day of the year.

653
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,082
On the night New Year's Eve

654
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,482
it was cold and dark,

655
00:35:26,843 --> 00:35:28,963
a cute little girl was walking barefoot

656
00:35:29,123 --> 00:35:30,363
on the street.

657
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:33,403
I think she is not good enough.

658
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:35,603
She's definitely better than me.

659
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:39,242
She was wearing a big pair of sandals.

660
00:35:39,522 --> 00:35:40,562
They were so big.

661
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,843
They were worn by her mother.

662
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:45,722
When she was crossing the road,

663
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:47,963
two carriages were moving quickly
in her direction

664
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,722
and gave her a real shock
that one of her sandals came off her feet.

665
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:51,643
She just couldn't find it
no matter how hard she tried.

666
00:35:51,843 --> 00:35:52,963
A boy picked up the other sandal

667
00:35:53,123 --> 00:35:55,123
and went off with it.

668
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,203
He said,

669
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:57,722
If I have kids in the future,

670
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:59,322
it can be used as a cradle.

671
00:36:00,163 --> 00:36:02,603
And so, the girl walked away
in bare feet.

672
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:06,042
A pair of little feet
were swollen and bruised.

673
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,843
There were many matches in her old apron.

674
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:10,603
And she had one in her hand.

675
00:36:11,082 --> 00:36:12,443
All day long,

676
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,203
not a single person
had bought her matches.

677
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:17,883
No one had given her a single penny.

678
00:36:18,163 --> 00:36:19,163
Not bad.

679
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,562
Listen carefully.

680
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:23,363
She did really well.

681
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:25,082
The story was told
with emotions and details.

682
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:26,603
All right. Next person.

683
00:36:34,522 --> 00:36:36,282
Such a pitiful girl.

684
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:38,163
She was cold and hungry.

685
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:40,443
She was trembling as she moved forward.

686
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:46,242
Snow fell on her long golden hair.

687
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:49,722
She realized...

688
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:53,562
Come on. That was so funny.

689
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:55,762
What are you laughing at?

690
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:00,963
You may be seated.

691
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:39,963
How about having sukiyaki for dinner?

692
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:44,363
I'm not eating.

693
00:37:46,242 --> 00:37:48,123
If I fall in love with you,

694
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:51,762
I will never resemble
clambering trumpet creeper,

695
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,443
to flaunt myself by you high branches.

696
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:00,802
If I fall in love with you,
I will never imitate...

697
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,212
(Su Nianfeng,
College Entrance Examination Package)

698
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,762
Together we partake cold waves,

699
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,363
storms, and firebolts.

700
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:07,002
Together we share fogs,

701
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:09,082
flowing hazes and rainbows.

702
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:10,762
We seem always apart,

703
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,443
But interdependent all lifelong.

704
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,403
Only this is great love.

705
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,163
Faithfulness lies here:

706
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:18,963
I love not only your gigantic stature,

707
00:39:19,082 --> 00:39:20,683
but also the position you uphold,

708
00:39:20,802 --> 00:39:22,203
and the earth on which you stand."

709
00:39:22,762 --> 00:39:24,002
Su Nianfeng.

710
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:25,403
Your pronunciation

711
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:27,322
sounds quite natural.

712
00:39:29,403 --> 00:39:30,363
But it's not bad.

713
00:39:30,522 --> 00:39:32,643
Very confident and emotionally stable.

714
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:34,042
You've made improvements.

715
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:38,282
All right. The class is over.

716
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:42,163
Recently, the Hanjiang District Court
concluded the trial

717
00:39:42,322 --> 00:39:44,963
of the multiple thefts from motor vehicles

718
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:46,363
and sentenced the defendant, Li,

719
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:47,683
to two years of imprisonment

720
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,482
and fined 10,000 yuan

721
00:39:49,643 --> 00:39:51,242
as well as recovering
the proceeds of crime

722
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:52,883
and return the stolen money
to the victims.

723
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:55,042
Police handling the case remind residents

724
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:56,562
especially owners of private vehicles

725
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:58,363
of increasing awareness
and taking prevention measures

726
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,603
Take your valuables with you
when you get off the car

727
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:01,843
and not to leave them in the car.

728
00:40:02,482 --> 00:40:04,123
Why is she  so happy?

729
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:07,482
(A young girl disappeared at night)
Coming up next.

730
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:09,002
A young girl who was born in the 90s

731
00:40:09,163 --> 00:40:10,683
disappeared at night.

732
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,203
The police are currently
conducting an investigation

733
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:15,522
and launched operations in three groups.

734
00:40:15,762 --> 00:40:16,883
The first group

735
00:40:17,002 --> 00:40:19,363
will search entertainment venues
such as Internet cafes and hotels.

736
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:21,002
-The second group will search...
-Hello?

737
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:21,963
Who is this?

738
00:40:22,883 --> 00:40:25,082
May I know if this is Le Diyin's number?

739
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,802
I'm his father.

740
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:29,603
He's being resuscitated
at a hospital in the city.

741
00:40:30,802 --> 00:40:32,163
Someone saw the girl

742
00:40:32,322 --> 00:40:33,403
being taken away by two young men

743
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:35,082
on a motorcycle.

744
00:40:35,282 --> 00:40:36,923
After checking the surveillance cameras,

745
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,042
the police found out

746
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:41,762
that the girl stayed alone by the roadside
for dozens of minutes.

747
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,683
The police remind residents...

748
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:47,123
Where are you going?

749
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:48,522
It's an emergency. We'll talk later.

750
00:40:48,643 --> 00:40:50,203
Where are you going at this late hour?
You can't go out.

751
00:40:50,522 --> 00:40:51,562
There's no time to explain.

752
00:41:07,843 --> 00:41:09,123
It's late at night. What's all this?

753
00:41:09,322 --> 00:41:10,203
How about your recital?

754
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:11,683
Want to give up halfway?

755
00:41:15,322 --> 00:41:16,322
Go home.

756
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:17,883
Go home.

757
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:18,883
That's enough!

758
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:22,203
I'm stupid and lack of self-esteem.

759
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:24,762
I wanted to give up countless times.

760
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:27,603
There is only one person in the world...

761
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,482
He was the only one who told me

762
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:31,883
that I could do it.

763
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:34,322
And right now, he's in the hospital.

764
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,843
He's being resuscitated.

765
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:39,843
Right now,

766
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:42,363
I'm going to the hospital
to keep him company.

767
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:45,363
Being resuscitated?

768
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,643
Le Diyin?

769
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:55,203
Let me go.

770
00:41:55,443 --> 00:41:56,322
I'm going to the hospital.

771
00:41:56,562 --> 00:41:57,522
