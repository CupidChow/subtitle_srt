00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,159
Don't be such a nag.

173
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,400
Hi,

174
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,919
I'm Ouyang Qingxue of financial management.

175
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,559
Look,

176
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,479
she's so beautiful.

177
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Please sign here.

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,760
Thank you.

179
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,840
She looks beautiful.

180
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
Like a fairy.

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
Hi, I'm Su Nianfeng of medical department.

182
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,239
-Please sign here.
-Alright.

183
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,239
What's your major?

184
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll register for you.

185
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:55,719
He's not

186
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,039
from our university. He's...

187
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,039
Artificial intelligence.

188
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,679
Su Muyun.

189
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,400
(Admission Notice)
Aren't you being recommended into Tsinghua?

190
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,719
I gave it up.

191
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,840
Let's get acquainted.

192
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,159
Are you Su Muyun's...

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,159
I brought them from home.

194
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,479
Thank you.

195
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,320
We live in the same dormitory.

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,719
We're now a family.

197
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,919
We can eat, study

198
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,919
and go to the library together.

199
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,559
And date our boyfriends together.

200
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

201
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,000
I won't be alone from now on.

202
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,080
Follow me home. I'm hungry.

203
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,400
Isn't he Su Muyun,

204
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,679
the legendary iceberg campus king?

205
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,400
I've heard that he has an older sister.

206
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,359
Could it be you?

207
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,320
Sis, I'm your sister-in-law from now on.

208
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,119
Oh my gosh.

209
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,320
I won't let you ruin

210
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,280
my university life.

211
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,159
Surprise!

212
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,840
It's not a surprise. It's a scare.

213
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,919
You will never escape from me.

214
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,919
Come back later for your student ID.

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,679
Come, this way. Follow me.

216
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:04,960
Dudes,

217
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:07,280
these are freshmen. Please sign here.

218
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,120
Alright.

219
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,640
Lin Di.

220
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,119
You're a junior already.

221
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,440
Why would you help us welcome the freshmen?

222
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,400
I had an intuition last night

223
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,159
that the love of my life

224
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
was among the freshmen.

225
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,000
Bro, you said the same thing last year too.

226
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,919
Brother, you said it
the year before too.

227
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,359
The year before was based on horoscope.

228
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:29,520
Last year was palmistry.

229
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,119
This year was I Ching and astrology.

230
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,400
How could they be the same?

231
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,359
Alright, they're different.

232
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,960
She's here.

233
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,799
I can feel it.

234
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:49,799
I'll go over now.

235
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,559
Alright.

236
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,039
It's Liu Zihui.

237
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,039
Hey, what's your major?

238
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,080
I'll register for you.

239
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Higher vocational education.

240
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm Liu Zihui, majoring in stage makeup.

241
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,039
Did you hear it?

242
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,599
Hurry up and register for this beauty.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
When I gaze into your eyes,

244
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,280
I know that you're mine.

245
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,799
You got the wrong person.

246
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,679
What are they talking about?

247
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,119
They're not talking about you anyway.

248
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:27,000
We're starting university life
with a reunion.

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,320
This is destiny.

250
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,479
I'll treat you to a meal.

251
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,599
Go ahead. I don't want to be a gooseberry.

252
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,960
I'll eat at the cafeteria.

253
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,559
I'll eat at the cafeteria too.

254
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,599
I'll treat you at the cafeteria then.

255
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,280
Give it to me.

256
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,359
Bro, I'll treat you to barbeque.

257
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,799
To pay tribute to your lost love

258
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,440
before the beginning.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,239
Let's go and have a look at the freshmen.

260
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,559
Please register there.

261
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,400
(Dormitory No. 4
Welcome to new students.)

262
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,358
(Our future home. Nice to meet you.)

263
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:14,385
(Dormitory No. 4)

264
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,520
Yes, it's over here.

265
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,320
Please sign here.

266
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,239
Alright.

267
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Hi, Madam.

268
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,679
I'm Su Nianfeng from the medical department.

269
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,080
Su Nianfeng, right?

270
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,359
Your name is not in the list.

271
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,159
Have you applied to live on campus?

272
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,400
It can't be.

273
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,400
Look.

274
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,119
Who's she? How can she not live on campus?

275
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,359
Everyone lives on campus.

276
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,080
Why to be so special?

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
Thank you, madam.

278
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,039
It's fine.

279
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,119
Su Muyun, you did it, right?

280
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,920
You...

281
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,760
I want to live independently too.

282
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,040
Can you stay away from me?

283
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,359
Stop bothering me.

284
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm afraid you can't accept
such a big change.

285
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,479
Our parents have approved.

286
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,599
I've applied for an accommodation off campus.

287
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
The house is ready.

288
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:19,880
Here's the key.

289
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Hold it.

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,199
♪ You're keeping those dreams in a jar ♪

291
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,119
♪ You're telling me the one that you like ♪

292
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,920
♪ You don't have enough games but ♪

293
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,199
♪ we could have a good time ♪

294
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,880
♪ You'll bring the dreams into life ♪

295
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,719
It looks good.

296
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:04,000
♪ You're the one with light inside ♪

297
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,160
It's nice.

298
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,400
You like it?

299
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,199
The style is quite depressing.

300
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,599
-Xiao Feng.
-Xiao Feng.

301
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,400
Have you moved your things in?

302
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,959
How's the house?

303
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,760
It was renovated by your father's classmate.

304
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,880
He's on a business trip overseas.

305
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,160
So he let it out cheaper to you.

306
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
You can

307
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,880
take care of each other.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,959
Be good.

309
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,160
I'm an adult. I want to be independent.

310
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,479
Go busy with your day.

311
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,839
We're used to living together.

312
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:54,760
We don't want to live separately.

313
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,599
Alright.

314
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,439
Take care.

315
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,719
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

316
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,599
Don't waste time.

317
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,839
I'm hungry.

318
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,479
What a well-equipped kitchen.

319
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,719
They're cooked specially for you.

320
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,800
If you don't like it, you can drive me away.

321
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,359
It's delicious.

322
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,040
Are you all right?

323
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,000
It's delicious.

324
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
God, please save this kid.

325
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,920
My slippers are broken.

326
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,640
Please buy me a new pair.

327
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,599
Su Nianfeng!

328
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,719
Su Nianfeng!

329
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,400
What you cooked

330
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,839
is delicacy even if it tastes bad.

331
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,359
Zhuo Yifeng.

332
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What did you just call me?

333
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,719
I said

334
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,160
you should wipe the table.

335
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,280

(Mingxian University.)

337
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,760
Nice shot.

338
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,479
Quick.

339
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,560
Is he the freshman Su Muyun?

340
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,719
Who else could be with
such good-looking features?

341

Tragedies are repeating

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,560
and surprisingly familiar.

343
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,000
None of them are my opponents.

344
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:16,880
Let's go.

345
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,000
Let's take a break.

346
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
Let's go.

347
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,359
I want to drink water.

348
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,280
I have class.

349
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,319
Liu Zihui, why don't you get it for him?

350
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,839
So handsome.

351
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,959
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,959
It's fine. Are you all right?

353
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,280
I'm fine.

354
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Are you all right?

355
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm fine. I was the one who bumped into her.

356
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,640
Are you freshmen too?

357
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,959
Hi, I'm Su Nianfeng.

358
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,239
I'm from clinical medicine.

359
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,400
This is my brother, Su Muyun.

360
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,680
I saw you at the registration counter.

361
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:12,400
You're so beautiful.

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,040
Thank you.

363
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,199
Hi, nice to meet you.

364
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,719
I'm from financial management.

365
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,239
-I'll go back to the game.
-Ouyang Qing...

366
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,839
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,880
My brother has a weird temper.

368
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,839
I have class. I'll get going.

369
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,280
See you.

370
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,839
Awesome.

371
00:23:41,076 --> 00:23:41,676
(Xiao Feng)

372
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,760
It's awesome to take a bath
after all the sweating.

373
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,400
Dudes,

374
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
how about a hot pot for dinner.

375
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,240
It's my treat.

376
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,800
Alright.

377
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm not going.

378
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,839
Lin Di,

379
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,920
come over.

380
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,359
Look at how serious he is making the call.

381
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,280
He must be calling his girlfriend.

382
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,880
Do you think he's calling Liu Zihui?

383
00:24:09,542 --> 00:24:10,014
(Xiao Feng.)

384
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,248
(Liu Zihui.)

385
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,497
(Liu Zihui.)

386
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,119
Su Muyun, where are you?

387
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,680
Didn't you say you're thirsty?

388
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,479
I bought you a drink. I'll bring it to you.

389
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm at the changing room.
You don't need to come over.

390
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,160
It's really Liu Zihui.

391
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:37,479
He...

392
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,400
Su Muyun.

393
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,840
(Men. Please keep the door closed. Pull gently.)

394
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm delivering your drink to you.

395
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,560
Didn't I say not to come over?

396
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,400
How

397
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,719
could they?

398
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,040
She's Liu Zihui

399
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,079
who followed Su Muyun
to the changing room.

400
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:23,880
So envy.

401
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,760
She might have seen

402
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,439
Su Muyun's naked body.

403
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:27,839
Stop your dirty thoughts.

404
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,280
You're defiling him.

405
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,520
I think,

406
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,520
the only girl that matches Su Muyun

407
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,359
is Ouyang Qingxue

408
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:35,520
from financial management.

409
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,400
And me, the fairy.

410
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,959
I disagree.

411
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,040
As a female university student,

412
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,599
can you keep your mouth shut?

413
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,880
Don't have lewd thoughts
over other's boyfriend.

414
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,920
Su Muyun is your boyfriend?

415
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,439
don't you think we're matched?

416
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:00,760
Hey,

417
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,280
are you Su Muyun's sister?

418
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,000
No.

419
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:05,880
It's you.

420
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,160
I saw both of you chatting

421
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,760
at the girls' dorm entrance the other day.

422
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I also know that

423
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,800
you two are living off campus.

424
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,400
What do you want?

425
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,439
Can I go to your house

426
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,479
and have a look at
his living surroundings?

427
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,479
Sis,

428
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,199
what time is Su Muyun usually at home?

429
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,959
I'll go to your house and cook for you.

430
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:21,920
I'll mop the floor.

431
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,640
I can do anything.

432
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,359
I can do whatever he likes.

433
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,760
Can you please just leave me alone?

434
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,000
The student over there, please stand up.

435
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,520
Please read the text just mentioned.

436
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,680
You kept chatting in class.

437
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,479
You're already a university student.

438
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,319
You should be more disciplined.

439
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Forget it. Please sit down.

440
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,800
Cherish my life
and stay away from Su Muyun.

441
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,040
I must move out.

442
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520
Right away. Immediately.

443
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,239
I came to the library for the past week.

444
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,959
I saw you here every day.

445
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,439
What a coincidence.

446
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,400
Are you working
on the underwater robot subject?

447
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
It looks interesting.

448
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,280
Can you teach me?

449
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,760
You can search on Baidu Baike.

450
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:03,531
(Xiao Feng)

451
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,439
You really want to move out?

452
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,239
Yes, I've decided.

453
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,400
I'll run away from home

454
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,839
to live a happy life.

455
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,199
Why do you have to move out?

456
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,439
Su Muyun, I don't want to study

457
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,680
at the same university with you

458
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,680
because I don't want
to live under your shadow.

459
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,439
Please

460
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,640
return me a normal university life.

461
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,880
No.

462
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,280
Dad and mom won't allow it.

463
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,640
I've told them.

464
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,599
They agreed.

465
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:17,280
You're already 18 years old.
You can live independently.

466
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,199
If you want to live on campus,

467
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,319
then don't take anything with you.

468
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,479
Alright.

469
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,839
I can support myself by doing part-time jobs.

470
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,119
I only take few books with me.

471
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,760
I didn't take anything else.
Do you want to check?

472
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,640
Wait a moment.

473
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,800
Why you sound so weak?

474
00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:08,160
Stop feigning.

475
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,199
I won't fall into your trap.

476
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,280
I'll send you there.

477
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,520
Just tell me what else you need.

478
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,920
I'll send  it to you.

479
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,959
What's wrong?

480
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,520
Does your stomach hurt again?

481
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,680
I'm fine.

482
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,319
I'll get you settled down first.

483
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,359
What can you do it as you're so weak?

484
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,839
Stay at home and rest.

485
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,680
You're right.

486
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:34,959
I'm unable to help you in anything.

487
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Just leave.

488
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,880
Just leave me alone.

489
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,839
I won't

490
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,359
care about you.

491
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,119
Take the medicine after you have the porridge.

492
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I found a recipe online.

493
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:13,199
Eat according to the recipe this month.

494
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,599
Take care of your stomach.

495
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,319
I don't know how to cook.

496
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,079
Who says you can cook it yourself?

497
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,479
So you aren't leaving?

498
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,800
How can I leave

499
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,079
my sick brother alone?

516
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,839
Everyone,

517
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,719
does anyone know

518
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,319
how to apply first aid to fracture?

519
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,719
Yes?

520
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,160
We need to stop the bleeding,

521
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,760
fix the position and bandage it.

522
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,400
If possible,

523
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,839
send the patient to the hospital
after relieving the pain.

524
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,359
What's your name?

525
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:20,119
I'm Su Nianfeng.

526
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:21,239
You've done well.

527
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,400
You'll be the class representative

528
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,880
from now on.

529
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,000
Thank you, sir,

530
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,040
Sit down.

531
00:33:28,199 --> 00:33:30,000
Here, look at the screen.

532
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:32,040
There are many ways to stop bleeding.

533
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:32,959
For instance...

534
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:33,880
Help me to sign in.

535
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,479
I'll pay for all your milk teas this week.

536
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,719
Okay.

537
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,119
Who do you want to be?

538
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,719
I'll turn you into that person.

539
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,560
We've imitated the makeup of celebrities

540
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:51,119
like Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe

541
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,520
and Namie Amuro.

542
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,280
Today,

543
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
we'll do something different.

544
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,839
Imagine that

545
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,319
your ex-boyfriend is getting married

546
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,280
but you're not the bride.

547
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,319
What kind of makeup allows you

548
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:06,040
to hold everyone's attention?

549
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,839
It must be something amazing.

550
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,199
Yes, you've come to the right place

551
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,719
today.

552
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,320
Alright, let's start with the base makeup.

553
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,360
Gosh, I love her.

554
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:18,800
Such an innocent and unpretentious blogger.

555
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,600
She has great skills. I'm a fan.

556
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,120
A fairy-like makeup.

557
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,239
Great skills. I'm a fan.

558
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,760
Am I lack of cosmetics?

559
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,639
No, I'm lack of the blogger's skilled hand.

560
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,320
Are you all right?

561
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It looks like a fracture.

562
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,040
What should I do?

563
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,360
What should I do?

564
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,800
Don't move.

565
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,600
Keep still.

566
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,840
What are you doing?

567
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
Are you abusing the cat?

568
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,239
-Put it down.
-Don't be afraid.

569
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,159
Su Nianfeng?

570
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,159
Someone is abusing the cat?

571
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,959
I heard it too. Such a freak.

572
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,919
Zihui,

573
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,919
I guess it's injured

574
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,800
by the bike.

575
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,520
What should I do? It might be a fracture.

576
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,719
We must send it to the vet immediately.

577
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
Otherwise, it'll cause secondary damage.

578
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,199
Be careful. Be gentle.

579
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,159
Don't be afraid.

580
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,679
Do you know

581
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,520
any vet nearby?

582
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,639
Yes.

583
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,000
Come, be careful. Slowly.

584
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,120
Take it easy.

585
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,879
Hey,

586
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,959
stop recording.

587
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,959
Hey,

588
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:39,439
we're saving the cat, not abusing it.

589
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,679
Please delete the video.

590
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,760
Alright.

591
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
Let's go.

592
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,000
Let's go.

593
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,040
It was injured by hard object.

594
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,000
One leg is broken.

595
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,000
Fortunately, you sent it here on time.

596
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Otherwise, such a small cat

597
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,520
might be dead.

598
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,000
Your diagnosis is the same
as the veterinarian.

599
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,320
You're professional.

600
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,040
Does it need to be repositioned?

601
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,439
Can it still move?

602
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,719
You may bring it home

603
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:03,199
after the treatment.

604
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,439
We can't let it
to become a stray cat anymore.

605
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
We must find it a new home.

606
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,679
Since you love cats,

607
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,399
why don't you bring it home?

608
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,080
I can't keep it.

609
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:18,560
Why?

610
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm allergic.

611
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,879
Really?

612
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Anyway, I can't keep the cat.

613
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,760
Alright then.

614
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,320
I'll bring it home first

615
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,080
and look for a new home after it recovers.

616
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,080
Snowball.

617
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,639
You'll have a home, Snowball.

618
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:37,919
Snowball.

619
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,840
Don't come near me.

620
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:42,919
This is Snowball.

621
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,239
It's our new family member.

622
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,600
Isn't it adorable?

623
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,520
Don't come near me.

624
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:48,320
Su Muyun, are you afraid of it?

625
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,439
Look at how adorable it is.

626
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,320
Touch it.

627
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,239
Send it away quick.

628
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,439
I can't.

629
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,080
It'll stay with us until I find it

630
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:56,159
a new home.

631
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,000
No way.

632
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,159
I disagree.

633
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Alright.

634
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,919
I'll go with it.

635
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,879
Come back.

636
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,560
It can only stay in your room.

637
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,199
Don't let it come near me.

638
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,439
Snowball,

639
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,320
let's have a look at our room.

640
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,320
Let's go.

641
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,639
Su Nianfeng.

642
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,000
Don't come near me!

643
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:46,679
The scene can be sold for a good price.

644
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,639
I'll take a picture.

645
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,120
So I can get better canned food for Snowball.

646
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,800
-Don't come near me!
-Is it adorable?

647
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:55,600
Put it down!

648
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,199
Put it down!

649
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,439
Is it adorable?

650
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,159
I think

651
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,760
this liquid foundation lasts long.

652
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,560
But it looks a little cakey.

653
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,919
Let's see how it will be

654
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,360
in 2 hours.

655
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,600
Who are you?

656
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:27,840
Do you remember me?

657
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm Lin Di, a junior.

658
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,800
We met on the registration day.

659
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,360
What do you want?

660
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,199
I heard that you're looking for a model.

661
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
What do you think of me?

662
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,520
I might flunk if I chose you.

663
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,320
I've high requirements on models.

664
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:42,040
If you flunk, I can atone it.

665
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,360
I can treat you a meal,
a movie or hot spring.

666
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,800
Whatever you like. What do you think?

667
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:45,800
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,080
I don't go on a meal
and movie with a stranger.

669
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,879
Hot spring? Forget about it.

670
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,040
Let's be friends.

671
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,639
I have a boyfriend.

672
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,000
Su Muyun. Do you know him?

673
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,800
Su Muyun.

674
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:00,800
Don't brush me off with him.

675
00:39:00,919 --> 00:39:02,239
He has already fallen for someone.

676
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,760
What's her name?

677
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,000
Which class is she in? How old is she?

678
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,959
Forget it. I'll ask him myself.

679
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,639
You won't believe it even if I tell you.

680
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,360
I'm coming.

681
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:20,679
You're here.

682
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,719
I'm here for Snowball.

683
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,239
I've bought its favorite snack

684
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,399
and calcium tablets.

685
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,239
Where's Su Muyun?

686
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,639
He's playing video games.

687
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,639
Playing video games?

688
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,040
Me too.

689
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,879
Su Nianfeng.

690
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,000
Drink less coke.

691
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,320
It's not good for your health.

692
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,879
I won't feel happy if I don't drink it.

693
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,679
That's not good for my health then.

694
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,320
Su Nianfeng.

695
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,520
You'll get fatter.

696
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:58,760
Not so fat as you.

697
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,800
They're in so much sync.

698
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,800
Zihui, I'll get some fruits for you.

699
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:03,959
Alright.

700
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,159
Su Muyun.

701
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,280
I know. Let me play it.

702
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,239
Here.

703
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:37,879
I've practiced the game for a long time.

704
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
But I can't win.

705
00:40:39,919 --> 00:40:41,159
I'll take the blame.

706
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
(Mingxian University's Cat Abuser Su Nianfeng)

707
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,679
Which school is she from?

708
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,320
She should be expelled.

709
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,080
She doesn't even spare a kitten.

710
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,800
I've seen her. She's from clinical medicine.

711
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,159
Su Nianfeng.

712
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,320
Does Su Muyun

713
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
act strangely lately?

714
00:41:02,679 --> 00:41:03,320
Yes.

715
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:06,120
He's very well-behaved lately. It's strange.

716
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,919
Why do I feel he only treats you that way?

717
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,199
Snowball.

718
00:41:17,479 --> 00:41:18,399
What's it?

719
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,239
Which school is she from?

720
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,760
She should be expelled.

721
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,919
She doesn't even spare a kitten.

722
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,919
I've seen her.

723
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,199
It's not true.

724
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,199
Snowball had a fracture. I was saving it.

725
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,520
Yes, we explained later on.

726
00:41:33,879 --> 00:41:34,679
I've asked the girl

727
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,360
to delete the video immediately.

728
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,159
Why didn't she record the part
we're saving it?
