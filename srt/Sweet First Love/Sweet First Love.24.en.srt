00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
(Ouyang Group)

26
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,919
Why do you have to quit?

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,120
I've made my decision.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,959
Xiao Feng, with your capabilities,

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,080
it's such a pity for you to leave now.

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,199
Thank you,

31
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,800
but I want to take a rest for some time.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,559
I want to think about my future.

33
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,479
I'll leave the research

34
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,880
of dilated cardiomyopathy to you.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,679
I will go to HR
and get the procedures done.

36
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Ouyang.

37
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,399
The special fund for dilated cardiomyopathy

38
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,639
is almost done.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,639
We need you to sign on some papers.

40
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,759
You really want to arrange Zhuo Yifeng

41
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,199
as the fund manager anonymously?

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
This is what the Ouyang Group owes her.

43
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it necessary

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,880
for you to compensate her
with all the shares of Ouyang Group?

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,199
After I return to the United States,

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,240
send the email

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,199
of the dilated cardiomyopathy
special fund to Xiao Feng.

48
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,039
Remember,

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,000
keep it a secret before that.

50
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,520
Let's meet at the office.

51
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,919
Sure, let's meet there.

52
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,800
Say goodbye to uncle.

53
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,880
Goodbye, uncle.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,919
Goodbye.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,759
Brother, this is for Sister Qingxue.

56
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,720
Tell her I'm sorry.

57
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,600
Xiao Yun did not do it on purpose.

58
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,800
Alright.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,360
Bye.

60
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,119
-Bye.
-Let's see Uncle Ouyang off.

61
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,119
Come.

62
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,839
This is the last thing

63
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,080
that I can do for her.

64
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,800
Good day, Mr. Ouyang.

65
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,600
Good day, Mr. Ouyang.

66
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,520
Wait.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,559
I still owe you a formal apology.

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,239
For everything in the past.

69
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,640
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,239
Those were the issues
from the previous generation.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,640
You've already done many things for me.

72
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,200
Thank you.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,160
If you need my help in the future,

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
I will always be there.

75
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,799
Feeling better?

76
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,959
Brother.

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,119
Sorry.

78
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,320
Sorry.

79
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:04,519
We will make many mistakes

80
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,920
in our life.

81
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,440
But,

82
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,921
we have to be responsible for our mistakes.

83
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,399
When something needs to be left behind,

84
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,079
just let it go.

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,359
I am regretting so much.

86
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,000
How good it would be if those things

87
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,119
didn't happen at all?

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,119
Don't worry.

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,119
I'll be by your side.

90
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,920
Thank you.

91
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,040
Let's have a drink.

92
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,640
Come on, Xiao Feng, have more food.

93
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,839
Dad, mom.

94
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,239
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,799
Silly child, what are you talking about?

96
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,720
As long as you're happy,

97
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,239
your dad and I will be content.

98
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,399
What are you doing?

99
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,348
Everything is good about Xiao Feng

100
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:18,959
except for her taste.

101
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:22,040
I don't think this son-in-law is good.

102
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,559
I think so too.

103
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,640
I think it's not too bad.

104
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Not too bad?

105
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,040
Just make do for now.

106
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,440
Sure, we have no choice anyway.

107
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,679
Just make do for now.

108
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,880
Xiao Feng might have to suffer for a bit.

109

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,880
Live your life

173
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,400
with all your efforts every day.

174
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,640
Don't have regrets in your life.

175
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,720
(One Month Later)

176
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,679
I'm good indeed.

177
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Isn't it just a technology awards ceremony?

178
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,919
Should I dress up so formally?

179
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,520
What's wrong with that?

180
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,719
This is an international awards ceremony.

181
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,200
The invitation stated clearly

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,119
to dress up formally.

183
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,320
I almost forgot it.

184
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,400
My life will be over

185
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,359
if I forget it.

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,760
What is this?

187
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,799
This is the latest trend,

188
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,280
the popular back-of-hand tattoo.

189
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,000
It matches your lip color perfectly.

190
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,320
That's fine, it's too troublesome.

191
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,359
Do you still want
to become an exquisite woman?

192
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:00,840
Take my advice.

193
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you still giving Lin Di
the silent treatment?

194
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:15,919
It's such a happy day.

195
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,880
Don't talk about someone
who's dead, alright?

196
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,320
What happy day?

197
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,599
I meant

198
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,440
Su Muyun got an award.

199
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,479
We should be happy for him.

200
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,719
Alright.

201
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,039
Leave it there.

202
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,919
Done.

203
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,320
Perfect.

204
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,559
Hello, everyone.

205
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,400
CES

206
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,559
(Awards Ceremony)
Global Intelligence Robot Invention Competition

207
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,200
is an international robot competition.

208
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,760
It has been ongoing for 15 years.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,239
It has attracted tens of thousands

210
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,679
of students worldwide
to participate every year.

211
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,640
Compared to other traditional competitions,

212
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,440
CES

213
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,799
Global Intelligence Robot Invention Competition

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,239
prioritizes the participants' innovation,

215
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,359
skills and teamwork.

216
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:24,320
Although our participants are young,

217
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,400
each of them
is full of confidence.

218
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,000
Besides designing

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,239
and building the robot,

220
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,919
they can also write programs

221
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,919
to bring their robots to life.

222
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,280
This summer, young participants from China

223
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,960
have performed well.

224
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,919
They competed with

225
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,599
more than 560 teams

226
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,400
consisting of more than 1,700 participants

227
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,280
all around the world

228
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,599
and received more than 10 awards.

229
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,919
Next, please welcome the recipient
of the Best Design Award,

230
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,159
Su Muyun on stage to give his speech.

231
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,440
Congratulations.

232
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,799
Previously,

233
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,479
we only know about Japan
and the United States

234
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,679
when it comes to artificial intelligence.

235
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,159
Now, China's innovation

236
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,280
has led us into a new era.

237
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:22,798
The breakthrough in technology

238
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:24,880
has exceeded our imagination.

239
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Robot Su Xiao'ai,

240
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,960
is a breakthrough progress

241
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,000
in the artificial intelligence field.

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,400
May I know where the inspiration

243
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,840
for Robot Su Xiao'ai comes from?

244
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,760
It comes from the person I love the most.

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,239
I want to make her

246
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,799
an all-round robot.

247
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,559
So,

248
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,799
we will have more time to be together.

249
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
The most advanced technology

250
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,400
comes from a certain desire

251
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,960
and the highest level of desire

252
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,840
is love.

253
00:16:02,246 --> 00:16:03,366
Once,

254
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,400
I didn't know about love.

255
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,400
I ordered as much food as I can

256
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,359
and wanted her to cook for me.

257
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,880
I laughed at her

258
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,520
for not knowing how
to solve simple questions.

259
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,760
Only with my tuition,
she could pass her exams.

260
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,880
I forbade her to have friends

261
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,320
and caused her endless troubles.

262
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,400
I wanted her to take care of me at home

263
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,880
because I wanted her time to be spent on me.

264
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:29,960
I wanted to be with her every second.

265
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,880
My childish actions

266
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,520
always made her angry.

267
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:35,679
We have been quarrelling since young.

268
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,520
I finally understand after growing up

269
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,440
that loving someone

270
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:43,239
is not about occupying all her time,

271
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,320
taking away her right to make friends

272
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,719
or keeping all my secrets to myself.

273
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,840
Loving someone

274
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,840
is to spend more time with her,

275
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,280
treating her friends

276
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,960
as my own friends,

277
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,880
and sharing with her

278
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,520
all my happiness and sadness.

279
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,199
Cherishing her,

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,239
protecting her,

281
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:09,280
and respecting her.

282
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Fortunately,

283
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,760
I was still young
when I understood all of these.

284
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:16,959
Fortunately,

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
I still have a lifetime

286
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
to be with you.

287
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,280
Zhuo Yifeng.

288
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,280
I want to tell you

289
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,599
that the dishes you made

290
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,959
are the best in the whole world.

291
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,280
You are always amazing

292
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,239
in my heart,

293
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,800
so amazing that you're always shining.

294
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,359
I'm so afraid that
you will be taken away from me.

On my 7th birthday,

317
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,599
we promised

318
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,599
to be together forever.

319
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,920
Since that day,

320
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,800
5,781 days

321
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,439
934 minutes

322
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,160
and 12 seconds have passed.

323
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,880
I hope in the next second,

324
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,439
we will have a brand-new start

325
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,880

Xiao Feng.

337
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,839
Why are you here? Are you feeling well?

338
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,560
The improved medicine

339
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,119
helped me a lot.

340
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

341
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,560
Su Muyun asked me to keep it a secret

342
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,599
to give you a surprise today.

343
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm the main character today, alright?

344
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,719
Will you marry me?

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,959
Marry him.

346
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:09,199

I'm not lying to you.

353
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:33,520
You can ask Professor Thomas.

354
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,800
I'll hug him for you.

355
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,640
Take good care of her.

356
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,760
You don't have to tell me that.

357
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,119
We'll be going back.

358
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,079
Take care on your way back.

359

Have you prepared for
the proposal for a long time?

362
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,479
No.

363
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,239
Walk slowly.

364
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,400
It'll be faster this way.

365
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,319
Hold me tight.

366

How about I carrying you?

367
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,079
Why don't

368
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,800
we take a taxi back?

369
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:49,959
No.

370
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm not afraid.

371
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,680

(Liu Dahai)

389
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,719
Come to Time Hotel now.

390
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,479
Chairman Zhang's son wants to meet you.

391
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,599
I'm not going.

392
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,959
If you're not coming,

393
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,800
I will disown you tomorrow.

394
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,880
Alright, I'll be there.

395
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,160
Don't regret it.

396
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,439
A good dog doesn't block anyone.

397
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,560
Zihui.

398
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,160
Shall we make peace?

399
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,000
Give me a punch

400
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,400
if you're still angry at me.

401
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,839
I'm not angry.

402
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,400
We broke up for real.

403
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,079
My dad and

404
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:22,920
my new boyfriend

405
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,400
are waiting for me at Time Hotel.

406
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,719
Don't bother me.

407
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,599
(Yongfang Garden)
Stop.

408
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,920
You want to leave after splashing wine

409
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,040
on Chairman Zhang's son?

410
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,640
A trash like him

411
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,239
should be treated like that.

412
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,760
Go back immediately

413
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,520
and kneel in front of him to apologize!

414
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,280
Liu Dahai.

415
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,199
I'm your daughter.

416
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,439
Can you have a bit of self-esteem?

417
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,439
You...

418
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,719
You know nothing of it.

419
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,439
You should appreciate it

420
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,199
if Chairman Zhang's son takes a liking to you.

421
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,760
You useless trash.

422
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,599
She has more than a million fans,

423
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,599
her own brand and
is economically independent.

424
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,640
Trash? Who are you talking about?

425
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,680
Who are you?

426
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm educating my daughter. Get lost!

427
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
I'm her boyfriend.

428
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:55,040
Boyfriend?

429
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,319
Liu Zihui, all right.

430
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,479
You're living off a rich guy?

431
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,000
Excuse me.

432
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,400
She is not living off me,
but I'm living off her instead.

433
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
In order to get to her level,

434
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,560
I scraped by to be
a postgraduate student at Tsinghua University.

435
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,319
I tried my best to keep pace with her.

436
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,880
Come to me
if you have any problems in the future.

437
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,280
Don't bother her anymore.

438
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,119
Let's go.

439
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,280
Get off!

440
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,359
Liu Zihui!

441
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,160
Liu Zihui!

442
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,400
Not bad.

443
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,040
Your acting is pretty good.

444
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,439
You think I acted?

445
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:04,359
You?

446
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,560
36 marks in Chemistry.
A postgraduate of Tsinghua?

447
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,319
Aren't you a hopeless student?

448
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,719
I got near full marks for liberal arts.

449
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,920
I got into Mingxian University
because I was top 3 in my school.

450
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:16,880
You borrowed this car, right?

451
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't stain it.

452
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,199
This is really my car.

453
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,640
(Vehicle License, Lin Di)
This is the proof.

454
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,079
Were you born in

455
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,959
those legendary rich families?

456
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,479
If it wasn't for you,

457
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,800
I would never drive this car.

458
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
I didn't tell you because

459
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,640
these are my family's properties.

460
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,760
They are not mine.

461
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,040
I will let you have a better life

462
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,560
with my own efforts in the future.

463
00:28:47,479 --> 00:28:48,520
Zihui.

464
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,199
I really like you.

465
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,599
I don't want to break up with you.

466
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,199
No.

467
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,680
Zihui.

468
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,520
I know you're always afraid to lose

469
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
because of your family.

470
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,599
The past is the past.

471
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:14,319
I will use my own efforts in the future

472
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,920
to give you a warm home.

473
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,239
We will never separate

474
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:18,959
and be together for life.

475
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
I will respect,

476
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,680
love and cherish you.

477
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,760
I admit

478
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,560
I like you at first

479
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,239
because you're good-looking.

480
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,680
After that,

481
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,119
I realized that you've got

482
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,160
more and better good sides.

483
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,400
You are hardworking,

484
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,560
smart and strong.

485
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,400
You are also very funny.

486
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,119
You are the cutest girl I've ever met.

487
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,920
I don't want to lose you.

488
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,000
To me,

489
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,520
you can be bossy,

490
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,959
you can be spoiled,

491
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,760
you can also cry.

492
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,439
That's because I love you.

493
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,839
I love you no matter how you look.

494
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
But I sold your purse before.

495
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,760
I said you were aiming at the moon.

496
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
You were right.

497
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,719
I am aiming at you indeed.

498
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,079
Sorry.

499
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,359
With me in the future,

500
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,280
no one will bully you anymore.

501
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,199
You are the one
that likes to bully me the most.

502
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,920
I hate you.

503
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:48,800
Shouldn't you

504
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,560
put all your baggage straight to my room?

505
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,359
Cut the crap and help me.

506
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,000
It's nice to hang it here.

507
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,719
Why don't we remove it?

508
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,560
What if it falls and hits your head?

509
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,239
You are already silly.

510
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,199
