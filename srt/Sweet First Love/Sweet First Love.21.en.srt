you'll be doomed.

27
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm sorry, I'm late.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
The clothes that you're wearing...

29

No matter how many weaknesses I have,

he'll find my strengths.

Your clothes...

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,480
are special.

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
Do you still have a fever?

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,520
It's so weird.

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,520
I feel good when I see you.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,440
How come your house is so clean?

37
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Did a thief come in and clean it up?

38
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,960
I cleaned it up.

39
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Awesome, right?

40
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,680
Look, dust is all over the place.

41
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
It's not clean.

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,240
You're right.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,720
I'll do it better next time.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,960
How come you're so easy-going today?

45
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
Are you still Su Muyun?

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
Then, do you like the way I am now?

47
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,520
I think something is
overcooked in the oven.

48
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,920
Let me have a look.

49
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
Easy trick.

How's it?

62
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,519
It should be cooked for a longer time.
It's still raw.

63
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,320
Okay.

64

132
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
I wouldn't have written down
the wrong answers.

133

Eat it up.

138
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,039
It's true. I swear to the light.

139
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,679
Okay, I'll be there immediately.

140
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,280
There's an emergency in
the hospital. I'll leave now.

141
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,039

No, it's okay. Thank you for today.

You...

144
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:15,080
Doctor, it's impossible
that he can't be saved.

145
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,760
It's just a piece of fish bone, right?

146
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
Honey.

147
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,520
-Please save my son.
-Honey.

148
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,520
It's not a mere fever.

149
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,400
The fish bone pierced his oesophagus

150
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,760
for quite a while.

151
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,479

Everyone is so busy in the ER.

154
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,400
Why are you still crying here?

155
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,799
I'm sorry.

156
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,679
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,400
I feel so useless.

158
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,799
If you can't face life
and death rationally,

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,679
you can't be a doctor.

160
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,320
Am I useless?

161
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,719
You've tried your best.

162
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,359
If I were you, I would
probably be worse.

163
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,599
He was still good yesterday.

164
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,280
I promised him that

165
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,280
I'd make a cake for him

166
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,760
when he recovered.

167
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,119
Xiao Feng,

168
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,359
have you ever thought that

169
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,320
you might not be suitable to be a doctor?

170
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,400
Is it?

171
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,679
But it has always been my dream

172
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,039
to be a doctor.

173
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,159
How do you feel lately?

174
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:24,000
Given your medical records,

175
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,640
the drug trial went well.

176
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,719
Everything is good.

177
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,719
Thank you, Professor Thomas.

178
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,400
What's wrong with you?

179
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,799
I'm fine.

180
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:42,280
Help yourself.
I'll head back to work.

181
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,159
If you feel unhappy,

182
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
you can talk to me.

183
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,280
Maybe I can help you.

184
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,119
If I tell you

185
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,520
my intention of studying medicine
was very simple back then,

186
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,239
I just wanted to save Le Diyin,

187
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,679
will you believe me?

188
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,840
Yes, I will.

189
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,119
But now I'm thinking

190
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,039
it could just be my obsession.

191
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,359
I have never thought that

192
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,559
a doctor needs to face

193
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,719
the problems of the profession

194
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
and so many life and death events.

195
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,000
I feel scared everyday

196
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,000
during my internship.

197
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I...

198
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,840
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

199
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,559
Do you think I'm suitable to be a doctor?

200
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,000
As for the answer,

201
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,760
you should find it out yourself.

202
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,840
Don't cry anymore,

203
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,799
OK?

204
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,479
You wanted porridge.

205
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
But I realized

206
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:22,920
I didn't know what you liked

207
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,560
when I was buying.

208
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,520
I like this one.

209
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,640
Remember it.

210
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Try it.

211
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:36,280
I cooked this for a long time.

212
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,520
The century eggs are too broken.

213
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,319
I'll make it better next time.

214
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm just joking.

215
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,599
The porridge you made

216
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,319
is better than that I cooked.

217
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,520
Today,

218
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,800
I...

219
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,160
Le Diyin told me everything.

220
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,199
I'm very scared.

221
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,319
When I think of it

222
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,520
that this is my duty,

223
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,599
how should I do with it?

224
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,520
But I've never expected

225
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,920
that it was just the beginning.

226
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,319
Follow your heart.

227
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't force it on yourself.

228
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,280
Do something you like.

229
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,040
But what else can I do?

230
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,040
Have some confidence in yourself.

231
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,719
You're very good.

232
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,760
You're better than anyone else.

233
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,040
All you need is just time

234
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,160
to figure out what you want.

235
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,880
Then, you can be firm and do it.

236
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,599
Thank you.

237
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,199
No matter what choice you make,

238
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,680
I'll always be by your side.

239
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,239
Okay.

240
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,280
Then, I'll apply to the
hospital tomorrow

241
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,959
for a short break.

242
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,199
I'll be back after thinking it out.

243
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,520
How come my handbag is with you?

244
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,000
You forgot to take it with you.

245
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,160
You've washed it?

246
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,439
Who else if it's not me?

247
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,959
Then,

248
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,599
I'll mount it and put it in a frame

249
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,400
and make it as a collection.

250
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,479
Eat it up.

251
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,199
Here's your food delivery.

252
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,760
Remember to rate five stars.

253
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,959
You may leave now.

254
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,000
My queen,

255
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:49,520
how about taking a few days off?

256
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,400
You look tired these few days.

257
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,079
Xiao Lin Zi,

258
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,040
are you good at chemistry?

259
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,680
I want to look for a factory to
do a sample for my eye shadow.

260
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,280
But I don't understand

261
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,959
the prescription at all.

262
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,680
Chemistry?

263
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,119
At the high school,

264
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:08,439
the highest mark I got for
Chemistry was 36/120.

265
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,520
That's why I chose to learn liberal arts.

266
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,359
I'm sorry to ask you.

267
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,560
(Cosmetic Formulas and Process Technology)
Who can help me?

268
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,280
Liu Zihui, I'm here to save you.

269
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:26,000
-You're a bad student.
-I'm here to save you.

270
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,920
Go away!

271
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,400
He's a senior majoring in chemistry.

272
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,119
-Professor Chen Cheng of chemistry.
-Hi.

273
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,560
Ask him if you have any questions.

274
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,800
Don't be shy.

275
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,199
Chen.

276
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,040
Come over and have a seat.

277
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,719
I want to ask you something.

278
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,839
I don't understand about the mascara.

279
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,439
Let me get my notebook.

280
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,359
Okay.

281
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,719
What are you waiting?

282
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,079
-Get him some fruit, drinks and mineral water.
-Okay.

283
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,000
Go get it.

284
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,239
The main ingredients of mascara are

285
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,400
beeswax, vegetable wax,

286
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,719
and soy lecithin.

287
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:55,719
How to write this?

288
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes, soy lecithin.

289
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,959
Wax based mascara.

290
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,239
It is slightly dry.

Hello, I'm here.

304
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,839
I've brought some delicious food for you.

305
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,079
What do you want to eat?

306
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,800
-Love you.
-There are cakes,

307
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,520
and a lot of chips.

308
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:24,640
Where is Lin Di? Is he not here?

309
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,920
He's gone to help me
with the trademark registration.

310
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,400
If you're free,

311
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,160
please help me to try my products.

312
00:22:30,959 --> 00:22:32,520
Sorry, I don't have time.

313
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,160
I really cannot. Forget it.

314
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
If you have time,

315
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,959
help me to boost the popularity of my shop.

316
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,599
You still have time to play games?

317
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,199
That's learning to do business.

318
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,760
It's fun.

319
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,079
You can play if you have time.

320
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,319
I think the cream of the cake from this shop

321
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,079
is over-whipped.

322
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,400
Let me try.

323
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,560
Not bad.

324
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,400
Then your sense of taste
must have gone wrong.

325
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,880
Go to the hospital.

326
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,959
You don't want to work?

327
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,040
This game is very professional.

328
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
It simulates the data of a real shop

329
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,000
and provides policy guidelines.

330
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,040
You want to open a stop?

331
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,000
Don't you think that the cakes I made

332
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,560
are better than this?

333
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,199
No.

334
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,479
Why?

335
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,000
Haven't you been
supporting me to open a shop?

336
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,560
You can only make it for me.

337
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,359
Stop dreaming.

338
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,880
♪ If it's just a vague promise ♪

00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,320
Moreover, I don't
know whether it's clean.

507
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,280
What if I have diarrhea later?

508
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,479
Zhuo Yifeng, how dare you open a shop

509
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,399
with such bad cooking skills?

510
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,560
You have overestimated yourself.

511
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,479
Xiao Feng, don't feel bad.

512
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:05,600
I'm a picky person.

513
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,600
I don't put everything in my mouth.

514
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,719
If you don't want to eat,
why bother coming here?

515
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,919
Don't assume that

516
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:12,719
I don't know what you're thinking.

517
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,879
In my eyes, you're just

518
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,879
a girl from a rich family who
has nothing to do every day.

519
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,360
Do you think Xiao Qing
really sees you as a friend?

520
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,840
It's just because you're rich.

521
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
You...

522
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,639
Without these minions,

523
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,239
what else do you have?

524
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,800
I admit you're right.

525
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,919
But you don't even have the
chance to be my minion.

526
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,479
I like to be her minion.
You have no right to judge.

527
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,639
You'd better get away from Su Muyun.

528
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,199
You don't deserve him.

529
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,399
Ouyang Qingxue,

530
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
you're just a pitiful person.

531
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,159
A person who wears
all the branded stuff

532
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:55,159
and show off your wealth to everyone.

533
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,600
While Su Muyun

534
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,199
has a noble and pure soul.

535
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,679
You...

536
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,679
don't deserve to like Su Muyun either.

537
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,080
Like or not, it doesn't matter.

538
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:12,719
I always get what I want.

539
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,719
Do you think Su Muyun

540
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,560
is someone you can get if you want?

541
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,159
You have no choice. He likes me only.

542
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,199
Since we were kids,

543
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,719
I've been the only one in his heart.

544
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,879
Stop messing up.

545
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,959
I don't have time to
entertain someone like you.

546
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,080
The meal

547
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,479
is on me.

548
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,000
Please get out and do not come again.

549
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,639
You're not welcomed here.

550
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,040
I...

551
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,000
Qingxue, let's go.

552
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:59,103
(AME'S GIFT
Wind Patisserie De Paris)

553
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,360
(Su Muyun)
I've almost done with my work.

554
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,679
I'll be slightly late.

555
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:25,959
Okay.

556
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:30,959
Everyone, please follow me.

557
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,360
We had diarrhea

558
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
after we ate the cakes from this shop.

559
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,679
The ingredients used
in this shop were not clean

560
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,439
and bad.

561
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:35,959
Who are you?

562
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:36,399
Look,

563
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,040
the spoiled cake is still here.

564
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,120
What are you doing?

565
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,919
I'm calling police now.

566
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:41,639
Move aside.

567
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,199
Come, follow me to the kitchen.

568
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,800
There must be something
dirty in the kitchen.

569
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:45,479
Come, follow me.

570
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,639
Let's have a look.

571
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,439
Look, the butter is expired.

572
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,719
There is still unidentified
sediment inside.

573
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:53,919
This...

574
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:57,199
The fruits that they used to
decorate the cakes are more disgusting.

575
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:58,639
Look at the mildew on it.

576
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,760
I just bought this. It's
impossible that it's expired.

577
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,520
Don't film anymore.

578
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,919
You can explain to the netizens later.

579
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,879
Let's go.

580
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,760
You...

581
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,280
(Ouyang Qingxue)

582
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:38,800
Have you got the surprise?

583
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,719
I knew it was you.

584
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:43,399
Nobody can take away
something that I like from me.

585
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,159
I'll not leave him.

586
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,000
Stop dreaming.

587
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,600
I heard that he found investors

588
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:52,000
for his smart home project.

589
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,439
What do you want to do?

590
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,239
You guess how many things he will lose

591
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,080
because of you?

592
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:11,679
What happened?

593
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:15,080
I didn't check on the ingredients

594
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,840
that I bought today.

595
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,919
Then, two men came to my shop.

596
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,239
They said that I was a
sinister shop owner.

597
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:28,959
Su Muyun,

598
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,399
I'm sorry.

599
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,199
You made this cake

600
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:40,800
for me?

601
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,879
I've prepared it for so long.

602
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,600
I didn't expect that...

603
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:03,239
This is the best cake

604
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,040
