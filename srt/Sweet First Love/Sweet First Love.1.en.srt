1
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:13,119
Xiao Feng, don't be afraid.

2
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,159
Scissors.

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,976
(Operating)

4
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,870
(Operating)

5
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:36,338
We failed to rescue them due to
heavy bleeding from the accident.

6
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:38,000
Both patients have died.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,520
Dad.

8
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,400
Sister Yifeng.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,959
She has post-traumatic stress disorders,

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,919
commonly known as PTSD.

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,680
She may have sleepwalking disorder,

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,599
or selective amnesia,

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,560
and other symptoms such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

14
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:05,040
Sister Yifeng,

15
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:07,440
I will surely protect you.

16
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,959
If memories can be kept in a box,

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,080
how big of a box do I need?

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,720
Where should I hide the key?

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,879
People grow up
as they're searching something,

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,720
and sometimes they lose things too.

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,599
But I

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,839
have re-found myself through searching.

23
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,720
It is inevitable for life and death

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,800
to occur on the journey of life.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,559
We all experience the tastes of life,

26
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,160
and the sorrows and joys
of partings and meetings.

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,599
Some people

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,000
are destined to be passersby,

29
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,639
while others

30
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,800

a lifetime bond with you.

Qin Yao.

57
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:28,440
Su Muyun, get out of here.

58
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,519
Get out, you...

59
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,079
You...

60
00:04:35,239 --> 00:04:36,000
You're not a kid anymore,

61
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,119
go back to your own room.

62
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,760
Don't sleep here, okay?

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,239
So noisy.

64
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:41,079
You...

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,239
I'm going to record it as evidence

66
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:44,600
and report it to my mum.

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,720
You...

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,000
Give it back to me.

69
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,480
Give it back.

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,200
Good morning.

71
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,959
Xiao Feng, my baby girl.

72
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,959
Mum, Xiao Yun...

73
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,760
Someone refused to cook and
tried to starve me to death.

74
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,480
It wasn't like that, it was him...

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,440
We just went on
a business trip for 20 days,

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,239
but you two have quarreled for 43 times.

77
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,959
Mum...

78
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,440
-It's her fault.
-It's his fault.

79
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,519
Fine.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,079
Xiao Feng, you're the elder sister.

81
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
You ought to look after him a little.

82
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Xiao Yun, you're a boy.

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,119
You should be chivalrous
to girls, understand?

84
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay, I'm hanging up.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
We're boarding the plane now.

86
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,320
Did you hear that?

87
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,480
You should take care of me.

88
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,200
You should be a gentleman.

89
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,279
Are you a girl?

90
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,239
You...

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,040
This is my nightmarish life.

92
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,440
How nice would it be

93
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,160
without the demon brother.

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,519
Send them to my room.

95
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,239
I'm not your servant.

96
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,519
I'm not eating it then.

97
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,000
Stop.

98
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,000
If it wasn't for your gastrosis

99
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:07,959
due to the math competition

100
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,000
(Indigestion tablets)
and made things so troublesome,

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,279
I wouldn't have spent
my precious study time

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,000
to cook for you every day.

103
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,279
It's newly bought.

104
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,679
Hurry up, eat and get well soon.

105
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,308
(Indigestion tablets)

106
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,839
Steamed buns,

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,559
multi-layer oil cake,

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,279
sliced lotus root with sweet sauce congee.

109
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,600
It's too hard.

110
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,040
It's too sweet.

111
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
He had only one spoon of congee.

112
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,559
I'll cook that more frequently.

113
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,640
He ate all the buns.

114
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,760
I'm not making them anymore.

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,079
They're all delicious.

116

Hello, students of Huiming High School.

117
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,959
The new semester has begun.

118
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,399
(Huiming Senior High School)
I believe all of you

119
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:47,279
have already set up

120
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,200
new study plans and goals.

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,880
Students in the senior year...

122
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,000
It's the senior year. I'm going to work hard.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,959
Su Nianfeng, which class are you in?

124
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,920
You just touched on a sore spot.

125
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,839
I'm a slacker,
how could you ask that question?

126
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,799
Of course, I'm going to Class 5.

127
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
As expected, me too.

128
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,279
We are still classmates.

129
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,640
Let's take care of each other.

130
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm easily distracted when I'm studying.

131
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,480
But now we're in the last year,
I've decided to put in big effort

132
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,040
and fully concentrate on our studies,

133
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,119
to get much improvement.

134
00:08:15,414 --> 00:08:16,335
Wait, aren't you

135
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,000
going to ask your little brother
for to be your tutor?

136
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,640
He only knows how to lecture me

137
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:22,720
with a long face all day.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
I'll never ask for his help.

139
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,799
What long face all day?

140
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,279
(Year 3 Class 5)
Su Nianfeng, wait for me.

141
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
You're in this class too.

142
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,200
-You're in this class too.
-Yeah.

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
We're deskmates from now on.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
(Mathematics)
Oh God, I've brought the wrong textbook.

145
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,799
What was I thinking?

146
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,280
Oh my goodness.

147
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,159
Iceberg campus king is in our class?

148
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,880
He is too handsome, right?
Isn't he a top student?

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
What a handsome face.

150
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,080
Is he really attending our class?

151
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,760
He's been the basketball MVP
for three years and the top student.

152
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,640
No way, he should join
the first class of top students.

153
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,719
Yeah, what's he doing here?

154
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,799
Why did he come to our class
of study slackers?

155
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,799
Such a scatterbrain.

156
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,080
He's just sending me textbooks.
That's good.

157
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:37,840
Thank you.

158
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,640
Go back. Class is starting soon.

159
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:45,753
Mom and dad are worried that
you'd get puppy love.

160
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,440
They asked me
to supervise you in your studies.

161
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,559
Why is he always around?

162
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,239
The first agenda in the new semester

163
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
is a friendly basketball match.

164
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,080
And also, I'm surprised that

165
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,039
Su Muyun has proposed to join our class.

166
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,520
How's the preparation of

167
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,359
the opening ceremony speech?

168
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:04,080
I'll just improvise it on stage.

169
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,000
Sure.

170
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,960
Senior year, two goals.

171
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,000
First, escape from Su Muyun.

172
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,631
(Huiming High School Year 2 final examination
transcript: Su Muyun)

173
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,000
(Su Nianfeng)

174
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,320
We're 532 places apart.

175
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,440
I'll definitely

176
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,840
get into the university

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
that's miles away from that demon.

178
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,359
But

179
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:40,239
is my score enough to be
enrolled into university?

180
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,559
My second goal...

181
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
What are you doing?

182
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,640
Does that matter?

183
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
What? Are you jealous?

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,599
Qin Yao is more handsome and
friendlier than you.

185
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,440
His basketball skills
are also better than you.

186
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,080
Especially his smile,

187
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,200
it's making my heart melt.

188
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:13,679
You don't have

189
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,359
to praise others in front of me.

190
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,291
I'm reminding you

191
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,011
to come see me play later
in the afternoon.

192
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
I've told you I'm not going.

193
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,119
I need extra lessons.

194
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:28,743
Qin Yao.

195
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,440
Hello.

196
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,480
It's okay if you don't want to go.

197
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,999
Extra lessons are also important.

198
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
No, no, no...

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,479
From now on, I'll be a good sister.

200
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,479
I won't miss your moment of winning.

201
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,719
Why are you still standing here?

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,559
I need to change clothes, get out.

203
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,679
Get out.

204
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:04,000
Xiao Feng, let me help you.

205
00:12:04,095 --> 00:12:04,816
Thank you.

206
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,241
I feel a little bit embarrassed

207
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,440
to rush you off your feet.

208
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
Can I have it?

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,599
Sure, help yourself.

210
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:13,719
Let me try it.

211
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
It's quite delicious.

212
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,919
Did you make it yourself?

213
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
That's incredible.

214
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,840
Qin Yao.

215
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,359
Do you really think that's delicious?

216
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,260
Yes, she is amazing.

217
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
She's great in the kitchen

218
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,338
and in school too.

219
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,480
I'd be extremely happy

220
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,961
if someone could prepare

221
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
delicious food for me every day.

222
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,599
Well, you can come more often.

223
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,119
I will.

224
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,560
If you want to watch the game,

225
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,880
you need to make something for us.

226
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,480
Have you made a cheer sign?

227
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,479
Oh yes,

228
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,641
I'll make one right away.

229
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,319
See you at the stadium.

230
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,039
Okay, see you.

231
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,119
Isn't this the formula I need
to solve the question?

232
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,159
It's so well written.

233
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
You're not that heartless after all.

Since when did I start

311
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,479
to pay close attention to Qin Yao?

312
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,440
Perhaps it was at that time.

313
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,159
He's the first

314
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,159
guy to treat me so gently.

315
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,799

Su Muyun, go fight win!
Qin Yao, go fight win!

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,119
You can do it, Qin Yao. Come on!

321
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,919
Have you written everything down?

322
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Is it complete?

323
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,760
Look, I've written down Su Muyun's height,

324
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,840
shoe size, and weight.

325
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,840
What a bad taste.

326
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,120
Maybe she was rejected by Su Muyun before?

327
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,239
That's why she's venting her anger on me?

328
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,899
There are so many girls who adore Su Muyun.

329
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:13,372
Don't be too sad even if you got rejected.

330
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:15,461
What did you say?

331
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,600
I mean, it's not just you he has rejected.

332
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:20,161
He has rejected everyone,

333
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:21,376
boys and girls.

334
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,018
So don't be too sad.

335
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:25,081
You are a beauty. You should be confident.

I

337
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,840
got rejected?

338
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,640
By who?

339
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:33,967
Isn't it?

340
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,160
Ridiculous.

341
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,720
It's so ridiculous.

342
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:41,400
Serious? How can I get rejected?

343
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,319
Su Muyun.

344
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,479
What happened?

345
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,920
It's all because of you.

346
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,160
It's none of your business, please get

347
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,280
out of here.

348
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,119
Get out of here now.

349
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
I'm talking to you.

350
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,680
Do tell me if you have any questions.

351
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,560
She treated my girlfriend

352
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,839
goddess, without any respect.

353
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,319
Apologize now.

354
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,199
There are many teachers here today.

355
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,239
I'm not afraid
if you want to make a scene.

-He's so handsome.
-Handsome.

357
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Don't think that I'm afraid of you.

358
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Hey you,

359
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,239
let's go.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,959
Did you see it? He's so handsome.

361
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,920
We will meet again soon.

362
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,319
Are you injured?

363
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,359
You're rubbing your sweat onto my hair.

364
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,719
You didn't wash your hair anyway.

It's so ugly.

368
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,079
No, it's not.

370

(Delete the photo? Yes.)

This is my phone.

You're not allowed to check my phone.

You're late for class and got puppy love.

379
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,760
I didn't.

380
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,760
How could you deny it?

381
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,959
It's her.

382
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,680
Hey there, are you okay?

383
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,160
Do you need help?

384
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,840
I might just be a little hungry.

385
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I'm okay.

386
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:34,210

He had basketball training.

389
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,839
He got no time to eat.
So I'm taking it back.

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,959
You can have it.

391

I could meet her again so soon.

I've heard that you're famous.

398

from Su Muyun's sister.

405

It's hard to get it.

406
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,920
You have Su Muyun's first-hand information?

407
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm not sharing.

408

-Over there.
-Where?

you have nice food to eat,
but she's getting thinner.

418
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,040
The capable ones should eat more.

419

Wait for me.

420
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:48,359
Alright, that's all for today.

Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

431
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,920
I spent my weekends

432

to provide extra classes for
students with poor grades.

433

And yet, you don't care about it.

434
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:17,599
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,480
To be honest,

436
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,560
you're not doing well in your studies.

437
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,800
Have you thought about your own future?

438
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,158
I...

439
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,959
It's up to you to decide
what you want to do in the future.

440
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
You have to make efforts

441
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,079
to prove that you're capable.

442
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,839
I will work hard.

443
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
Here, I've chosen a few key questions

444
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,560
specifically for you.

445
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,439
If you practice these hard enough,

446
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,000
it might be helpful to you.

447
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,119
You can do it, I believe in you.

448
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,359
Thank you, sir.

449

When are you going to prepare for dinner?

455
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm starving to death.

456
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,280
It's late already.
Why haven't you come back?

457
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,640
Sorry, I'll be back immediately.

458
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm an expert at tutoring.

459
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,519
You can beg me for help.

460
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,585
No, I'm not begging you.

461
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,109
I've endured you for the whole day.

462
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,080
Do not speak to me
in such a condescending way.

463
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,160
A bad-tempered person like you

464
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,239
is destined to end up alone.

465
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,560
Stupid.

466
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,239
Why did you come?

467
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,439
You scared me to death.
You walked so quietly.

468
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,240
Eat it up.

469
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,319
It's still hot.

470
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,280
How could you be so kind?

471
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,599
You talk so much.

472
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,079
Is it poisonous?

473
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
Aren't you going to eat it?

474
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
I'll eat it then.

475
00:25:33,238 --> 00:25:34,319
You really know that

476
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,760
I love tuna rice balls, right?

477
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,440
Don't flatter yourself.

478
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:53,389
Let me teach you.

479
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,528
No, thanks.

480
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,640
Why?

481
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,719
You're good at studying.

482
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,000
But that doesn't mean
you can be a good tutor.

483
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,119
So arbitrary.

484
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,239
The first thing to become a tutor

485
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,560
is to have an equal attitude.

486
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,239
Otherwise, it's impossible to communicate.

487
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,479
Deal.

488
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,079
What?

489
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
I'll treat you equally.

490
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,439
Let me teach you, okay?

491
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,560
I have something to discuss with you.

492
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:28,685
What is it?

493
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,120
Next time, can you say nice things about me

494
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,920
to Qin Yao?

495
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,640
Don't always embarrass me. After all...

496
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,680
You...

497
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,280
You really got a bad temper.

498
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:43,199
I can't believe
so many girls are admiring you.

499
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:44,760
Are they all blind?

500
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,920
I haven't finished my food yet.

501
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
Wait for me.

502
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,439
Su Muyun.

503
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,040
What should I do?

504
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,400
My Chinese is bad, and my math is worse.

505
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,839
Oh gosh, I don't have that much time.

506
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,119
Be quiet.

507
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,119
My time

508
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,880
has spent on cooking for you.

509
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,200
Give me back my time.

510
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
You're the one that's easily distracted,

511
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,119
how could you blame me?

512
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,079
I...

513
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,959
It's your fault.

514
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,599
You scared me.

515
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,040
Are you plotting anything? I knew it.

516
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,040
♪ You're the one with light inside ♪

517
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
Su Muyun,

518
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,079
why did you throw so much rubbish?

519
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,560
Look at you.

520
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,520
This is the reason why

521
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,359
I can't get good grades.

522
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Why you always mess up the house?

523
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
If you fail again, that means you're dumb.

524
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,599
Su Muyun,

525
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:22,959
you're so sweet and nice.

526
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,959
Let go.

527
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,760
Let me out!

528
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,959
(If you want to adopt an animal,)

529
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:04,719
(first,)

530
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
(we need to know some references.)

531
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:10,188
(References? People I know?)

532
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
(Yes.)

533
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:12,548
(Friends, teachers...)

534
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,200
Where is my breakfast?

535
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,000
The first thing to do every morning

536
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:19,560
is to leave home at the speed of light,

537
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,040
and stay away from my brother.

538
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,160
Oh no,

539
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,599
I cannot be late for today's pre-test.

540
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,573
You're in big trouble.

541
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:34,572
I haven't done my revision yet.

542
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,165
Rome wasn't built in a day.

543
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,760
It makes no difference whether
you finished your revision or not.

544
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,199
The results

545
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,119
will be announced in class after the test.

546
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,280
If I still come in last,

547
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,079
I'd rather die.

548
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,680
Hold this.

549
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,760
Come on.

550
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,920
Remember to bring your notes.

551
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,439
Your slippers...

552
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,880
Don't want it anymore?

553
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,800
(Su Nianfeng's college entrance
examination notes)

554
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,120
Stop.

555
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,920
Thank you.

556
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,400
I'll ride with you.

557
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:44,479
How could you become so kind?

558
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,120
In exchange for 3 more dishes for dinner.

559
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,160
No way.

560
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,439
That's the deal.

561
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,760
I'll officially name this bread

562
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,319
the cosmic ghost rider's bread of love.

563
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,199
Cling to me.

564
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,520
If I'm late today,

565
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,920
then I'll be in a bad mood,
and fail the test.

566
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,480
Then I can not cook well

567
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,959
and you'll starve to death.

568
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,520
If you talk so much, get off my bike.

569
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,199
Watch out.

570
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:40,000
Are you blind?

571
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,040
It's you.

572
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,319
Hey, are you okay?

573
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,479
Here.

574
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,479
My head

575
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,439
is in pain.

576
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,520
My butt hurts too.

577
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,218
Do I have a concussion?

578
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,200
Go and see a doctor.
Come find me if you have any problem.

579
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,680
It has nothing to do with her.

580
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Let's go.

581
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,800
I'm sorry, my name is Su Nianfeng.

582
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,719
I'll buy you breakfast tomorrow.

583
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,719
Su Nianfeng,

584
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,400
We'll see.

585
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,320
Where's my skateboard?

586
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,880
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

587
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,080
-I'm going to be late.
-I'm late. Hurry up.

588
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,199
I'm almost late.

589
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,319
It'll be too late.

590
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,239
Wait, wait, wait for me.

591
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,199
Hurry up...

592
00:32:26,199 --> 00:32:27,479
Ten.

593
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,800
Nine.

594
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,599
Hurry up...

595
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,560
Eight.

596
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,199
Seven.

597
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,719
Six.

598
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,800
Five.

599
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Four.

600
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,640
Three.

601
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,319
Two.

602
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,280
One.

603
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Stop.

604
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,960
Never forsake nor give up.

605
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,119
Give you a thumb-up.

606
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,479
This is your bicycle.
Why should I help you park it?

607
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,800
Late for school on the first day.

608
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
Do you know how serious it will be

609
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,880
if you're taking the
college entrance examination?

610
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,959
Dean, may I ask you something?

611
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,400
Who's that?

612
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,479
He is Su Muyun. Don't you know him?

613
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
He's the top student in the school.

614
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,199
Top student?

615
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,101
He's the champion

616
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,009
in the International Mathematical Olympiad,

617
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,840
physics competition, and
composition competition.

618
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,160
He's the ultimate top student.

619
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,239
Dean, can you please do me a favor?

620
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
If it's not related to your studies,

621
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:29,959
then forget it.

622
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,439
No, I just want to ask

623
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,439
which class is Su Muyun in?

624
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,520
Is this related to your studies?

625
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,719
Of course.

626
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,079
I want to be his classmate,

627
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,359
so that I can ask for his advice.

628
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:40,079
Be influenced by close association.

629
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,400
Hold on.

630
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,060
Come over here.

631
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,196
Su Nianfeng,
is this a school or your house?

632
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,040
How can you just come at any time?

633
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,640
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,239
Don't be sorry.

635
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll inform your class teacher,

636
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,399
let him deal with you.

637
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,399
Please don't.

638
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
I'll receive my punishment voluntarily.

639
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,399
Please don't tell Mr Liu.

640
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,440
Fine, don't be late again.

641
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,320
I'll keep an eye
on you in your punishment.

642
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,000
How did my notes turn into this?

643
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,199
Su Muyun.

644
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
You...

645
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,879
You should study hard because you're ugly.

646
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,560
I know I'm not good-looking,

647
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,240
but if you dare scribble my notes again,

648
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:23,879
I will let you have it.

649
00:35:23,899 --> 00:35:25,819
(I know I'm not good-looking, but if you dare
scribble my notes again, I'll let you have it.)

650
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,960
Let's memorize some English words.

651
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,560
I haven't got the references book yet.

652
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
But I will have the test

653
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:46,280
with this type of questions.

654
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,879
Don't worry.

655
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,760
Hello.

656
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,011
Are you late? Be careful not to get caught.

657
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,560
Here.

658
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,520
Cover up your face.

659
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,439
Hurry up.

660
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,479
Come, come...

661
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,639
Hurry up.

662
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,719
Hurry.

663
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,320
Actually, I can use my hands
to cover my face.

664
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,679
Because my face is smaller.

665
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,199
Right.

666
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Boy, is this your first time being late?

667
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Yes.

668
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,239
Don't let the morning wolf spot you.

669
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,280
Who's that?

670
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,800
The dean of our school.

671
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,560
My name is Le Diyin.

672
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,000
Thank you for rescuing me.

673
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,160
My name is Su Nianfeng,
we share the same misfortune.

674
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,760
I'll get the monthly test paper

675
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,720
Su Muyun,

676
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,479
lead everyone to read these words aloud.

677
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,679
Okay.

678
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,360
Seriously, don't ever get caught.

679
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,080
Understand?

680
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,800
-Generous.
-Generous.

681
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,120
-Attractive.
-Attractive.

682
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,239
-Harmony.
-Harmony.

683
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,840
-Disappointing.
-Disappointing.

684
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:32,221
(English)

685
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,080
-Bastard.
-Bastard.

686
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,600
-Freeze.
-Freeze.

687
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:38,879
Your handwriting

688
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,040
is quite neat.

689
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,959
Thank you.

690
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,160
I'm quite ordinary.

691
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,720
I seldom get praised.

692
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:46,840
Ignore.

693
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,840
-Calm.
-Calm.

694
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,959
-Recover
-Recover.

695
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,280
-Discover.
-Discover.

696
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,679
Have I met you before?

697
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,440
Class is over.

698
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:08,679
You have to work harder.

699
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,080
Be quiet.

700
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,960
This is your new classmate.

701
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,199
Please introduce yourself.

702
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,240
Hello everyone, my name is Le Diyin.

703
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,080
Life is fragile and short.

704
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:23,080
I hope everyone can cherish their lives,

705
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,440
don't be afraid to be yourself.

706
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,360
Well said.

707
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,320
Also, I'm no expert in making friends.

708
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,600
Hope you'll excuse me.

709
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,959
Come, sit over there.

710
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,120
Without bitterness and hardship,

711
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,520
the senior year will be boring.

712
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,720
Without fight or risk,

713
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,880
then your life is in vain.

714
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
In order to excite you,

715
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,439
from today onwards,

716
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,680
all of you shall seat
according to your grade ranks.

717
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
-Right now...
-Discrimination.

718
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:59,040
It's a kind of discrimination
against study slackers.

719
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,560
Who is this?

720
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:05,445
You must be Liu Zihui.
Please introduce yourself.

721
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,600
Liu Zihui.

722
00:39:15,235 --> 00:39:16,755
(Liu Zihui)

723
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,120
I believe everyone will know me soon.

724
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,600
My specialty is

725
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,040
good-looking.

726
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,639
It's nice to be friends with all of you.

727
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,159
Good good study, day day up.

728
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:30,719
Good!

729
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,600
Good!

730
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,760
As classmates,
you all should help one another.

731
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:34,760
So your new classmate

732
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,719
can fit into our class as soon as possible.

733
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Now, I'll make a roll call.

734
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,679
Since we need to help each other,

735
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,439
then we should let the top student

736
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,479
sit together with poor students.

737
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,280
Am I right, classmates?

738
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,600
Yes, that makes sense.

739
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,719
Yes, yes. She's right.

740
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,479
You are very thoughtful.

741
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,239
What do you think we should do?

742
00:39:56,399 --> 00:39:57,399
I think

743
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,080
we cannot judge a student
to be a top or slack one

744
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,800
only from the aspect of grades.

745
00:40:02,898 --> 00:40:04,520
It's a good thing to think independently

746
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
with a holistic view.

747
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,600
Sir,

748
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,600
I suggest that

749
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,479
we find our deskmates at will.

750
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:12,879
What do you think?

751
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,280
Good idea.

752
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,560
Yes, yes, that's good.

753
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,479
Well, that means

754
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,320
it will be your first decision
to make in the senior year.

755
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,159
You decide who you want to be,

756
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,640
and whom you want to sit with.

757
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,440
How do we arrange?

758
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,520
Which one of you wants to sit with me?

759
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,919
Rearrange your seats after the class is over.

760
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,800
Everyone, pack up your things

761
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
and line up at the door.

762
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,920
First come first served.

763
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,600
It's a precious opportunity to sit beside me.

764
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,479
I'll give you a chance.

765
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,399
As long as you...

766
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,959
No need, thanks.

767
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,479
I haven't got even with you

768
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,199
for scribbling my notebook.

769
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,920
I can help you with the pre-test.

770
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,000
