00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:52,879
Qingxue,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,680
Qingxue, this bouquet of flowers is beautiful.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,199
Who are you going to give it to?

28
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,319
(Guest)
We've won the game!

29
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,399
Nice game.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,559
Look.

31
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,080
Who's that?

32
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,240
She's Ouyang Qingxue, a major in finance.

33
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,320
She's nice.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,759
She comforted me when I was struggling

35
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,119
because of the case of Snowball.

36
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,919
She was the one who believed in me.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,839
Congratulations!

38
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:43,119
Your strategies helped the team win the game.

39
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,720
Let's go.

40
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,679
Let's go.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Su Nianfeng,

42
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,600
did you take a photo of me
when I was playing basketball?

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,600
Yes, I did.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,960
Here you go.

45
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,000
You're really bad at taking photos.

46
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,119
You knew

47
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,479
how bad I am at taking photos,

48
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,240
and yet you forced me to take photos of
you when you were playing basketball.

49
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,240
I took every photo with all my heart.

50
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:16,720
You took a lot of photos.

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,919
Well, I guess I'll have to take it.

52
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,520
Mr. Ouyang,

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,800
(Guest)
let's take a walk outside.

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,679
You're so amazing today.

55
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,559
I'm so happy for you.

56
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm serious.

57
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Su Nianfeng,

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,800
long time no see.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,119
Are you going to the dinner hosted by
the basketball team tonight?

60
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,399
A senior from the Department of Sports
invited me to join them.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,919
But I feel a little awkward

62
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,000
to join a bunch of men for dinner.

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,199
She's not going.

64
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,679
We're busy tonight.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,679
Do you want to join us too?

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,759
There are conflicts
between you and your teammates.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,039
You can take this chance

68
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,320
to resolve all the conflicts.

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,759
That's the past.

70
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,720
Things will be different

71
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,399
from today onwards.

72
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,880
Thank you for your concern.

73
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,279
Let's go home. Cook dinner for me.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,639
Okay.

75
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,720
Let's go to the dinner together.

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,720
My brother always listens to me.

77
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,839
I want to join you too.

78
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,880
Let's go.

79
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,151
Great!

80
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:28,551
Team leader,

81
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:30,711
I apologise for what I've done.

82
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,031
What you did today was for the entire team.

83
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,752
You sacrificed yourself for the greater good.

84
00:04:34,952 --> 00:04:36,072
I'd like to propose a toast for you.

85
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,031
Cheers.

86
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,031
Cheers.

87
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,111
Great!

88
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:43,632
Great!

89
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:45,711
Everyone must be exhausted today.

90
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,311
Let's dive in.

91
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:49,031
Come on.

92
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:50,512
Let's dive in.

93
00:04:50,952 --> 00:04:53,232
Su Muyun, I can't get the spinach over there.

94
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,632
Can you help me, please?

95
00:04:54,871 --> 00:04:55,871
There's a lazy Susan on the table.

96
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,431
Just turn the lazy Susan
and you'll be able to get it.

97
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:00,392
Are you physically disabled?

98
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,672
You must have favorable scores in the NCEE.

99
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,431
Xiao Feng, here you go.

100
00:05:03,792 --> 00:05:04,792
Thank you.

101
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,632
Try this.

102
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,672
You didn't have breakfast this morning.

103
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:11,311
Thanks to you who turned off
my alarm this morning.

104
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,151
This is delicious.

105
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:15,031
-Try this.
-Right.

106
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:16,031
It's delicious.

107
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,192
Su Muyun is so close to his sister.

108
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,551
Those who don't know that they're siblings,

109
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,991
will think that they're a couple.

110
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:25,792
I think so too.

111
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:26,952
You're right.

112
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,232
Well,

113
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:31,512
they grew up together.

114
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:32,912
Of course, they're close to each other.

115
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,912
Don't think about those nonsensical things.

116
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,952
-She's right.
-Yes.

117
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,111
Excuse me, I have to go to the loo.

118
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,271
Come on, let's finish the dishes here.

119
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:45,232
Come on!

120
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:47,632
Su Muyun,

121
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,672
your performance on
the basketball game today was amazing.

122
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:51,792
Thank you.

123
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:54,792
Actually, my body is weak since I was young.

124
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,672
I've always wanted to learn
how to play basketball.

125
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:01,952
Can you teach me, please?

126
00:06:13,952 --> 00:06:15,871
Why are you coming back together?

127
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:17,271
What did you do?

128
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:23,192
I smell something.

129
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,831
It's the smell of love.

130
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,072
Ailun,

131
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:28,431
I think there are some problems
with your sense of smell.

132
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:29,952
Do you need me to call the ambulance for you?

133
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,912
Liu Zihui, I...

134
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:31,871
Nothing happened.

135
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,512
It's just happened that we met just now.

136
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:34,991
Don't get us wrong.

137
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,551
She told she wanted to learn
how to play basketball.

138
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:37,831
Qingxue,

139
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,912
I'm good at teaching ladies

140
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:40,991
how to play basketball.

141
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,512
I'll teach you. How about that?

142
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:45,831
I'll do it. Don't you dare to compete with me.

143
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:47,111
Let Qingxue go. I'll do it.

144
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:47,871
I'll do it.

145
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,271
Thank you, guys.

146
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,151
Let's go.

147
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:54,271
Let's go home.

148
00:06:58,392 --> 00:06:59,031
What?

149
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:00,192
Are you leaving now? What's going on?

150
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,392
What are you doing?

151
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:03,912
You've screwed it up.

152
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:07,352
I'll see you out.

153
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,392
No need.

154
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,431
See. You still gain something at the dinner.

155
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,512
Now, the conflicts between you and
your teammates have been resolved.

156
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:30,232
I don't care what others think of me.

157
00:07:30,431 --> 00:07:31,551
But I care.

158
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,672
I don't want others to misunderstand you.

159
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:34,672
Just tell me

160
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,520
if you have any problems.

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Let me help you.

162
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:38,711
Stop nagging.

165
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:48,192
asks me to go for an interview.

166
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:52,831
We're back.

-Do you miss me, Xiao Yun?
- Come here.

171
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,192
Give me a hug.

172
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:01,472
How are you?

173
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:02,632
I'm fine.

174
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:03,232
Do you miss me?

175
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:03,912
Listen to me.

176
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:06,352
I brought so many presents for you.

177
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,752
I brought you some make-up and clothes.

178
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,472
Come and take a look.

179
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:08,991
Really?

180
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,072
I can barely fit everything
into the luggage box.

181
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:12,352
Let me help you.

182
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:14,151
Come and take a look.
See if you like them or not.

183
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,431
Xiao Feng,

184
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,151
we're busy all the time.

185
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,512
We don't have time to take care of you two.

186
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:19,912
Thank you for taking care of your brother.

187
00:08:20,072 --> 00:08:21,512
That's not a problem. I feel contented

188
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:22,752
when everyone in this family

189
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:24,232
is living a happy life.

190
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:25,591
Son, take this.

191
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:27,711
Here we go.

192
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:28,752
Take a seat.

193
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:30,431
Dear,

194
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,431
the dishes look very delicious.

195
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:33,952
Let's taste

196
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,152
the crucian carp soup that Xiao Feng made for us

197
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,752
Let's propose a toast before we start eating.

198
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:39,911
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

199
00:08:40,032 --> 00:08:40,512
Toast first

200
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,111
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

201
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:47,791
I want to taste the soup now.

202
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:50,512
Let's see how the soup
made by my daughter tastes.

203
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:53,752
What do you think?

204
00:08:53,871 --> 00:08:54,832
Do you like it?

205
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:58,032
It's so delicious.

206
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,032
You're getting better at cooking.

207
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,351
I remember when she was young

208
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,791
she liked to sneak into the kitchen

209
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,231
and learn how to cook from me secretly.

210
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,551
She and her brother

211
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,512
even started to play cooking games
in the kitchen.

212
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,512
That's right.

213
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,431
Back then,

214
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,832
you two created a big mess in the kitchen.

215
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,471
Everything included the seasoning

216
00:09:14,592 --> 00:09:15,632
was scattered all around.

217
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,832
And you were so brave

218
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,351
and said you did it all by yourself.

219
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:21,311
So what?

220
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:22,911
I was still beaten.

221
00:09:23,752 --> 00:09:24,871
Speaking of that,

222
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,712
you were covered in flour,

223
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:28,551
and yet you told me,
it had got nothing to do with you.

224
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:30,192
You thought I wouldn't find out
that you were lying to me?

225
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,351
Of course, I beat you up.

226
00:09:31,911 --> 00:09:33,471
You two are too biased.

227
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,911
Su Muyun is awesome.

228
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:36,952
And he's so kind to me.

229
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:37,952
If it's not for him,

230
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,752
there's no way I could be qualified
to enter the university.

231
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:42,231
Here's your drumstick. It's a reward for you.

232
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,272
She could make it because of her hard work.

233
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,072
Su Nianfeng has always been taking care of me.

234
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:52,592
Here's your fish fillet. It's a reward for you.

235
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:54,311
What's going on with you two?

236
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,952
It's once in a blue moon.

237
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,752
How come you two become so closed?

238
00:09:58,871 --> 00:09:59,512
That's right.

239
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,752
I'm not used to this vibe.

240
00:10:02,072 --> 00:10:03,791
That's because we've grown up.

241
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:05,471
From now on, we'll live in harmony.

242
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,392
Let's live a happy life.

243
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:09,111
Great!

244
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:10,392
I'd like to propose a toast
to this happy family.

245
00:10:10,512 --> 00:10:12,032
Cheers.

246
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:14,072
Cheers.

247
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:30,752
The company that I applied

248
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,351
asks me to go for an interview.

249
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,272
(Ouyang Group)

250
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:56,832
Sorry, I'm late.

251
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,471
I'm Su Nianfeng.

252
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:00,671
Hi, Miss Su. This way, please.

253
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:01,712
All right.

254
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,911
Snowball.

255
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,712
Before it was adopted by me,

256
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:21,752
it's called Snowball.

257
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:25,512
I save it once at my campus.

258
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:26,952
What a coincidence.

259
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,192
Nice to meet you. I'm Su Nianfeng.

260
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:31,671
I'm sorry that I was late for seven minutes.

261
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:33,551
You don't have to apologise.

262
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,231
I know that you can't take the car.

263
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:36,512
You don't have to apologise.

264
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,032
How do you know about that?

265
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:39,871
I even

266
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,351
have your examination results from high school.

267
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:42,471
Do you want to take a look?

268
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:44,952
No. That's my nightmare.

269
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:46,752
But I just want to ask you

270
00:11:46,952 --> 00:11:49,311
how you got all this information.

271
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:51,752
Well, I'm hiring a personal assistant.

272
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:53,192
Of course,

273
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,712
I have to know that person well.

274
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:57,032
I've read all of your information.

275
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,911
You major in medicine, right?

276
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,351
You've learnt the broadcasting skills before
and you're an eloquent speaker.

277
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:02,991
You're good at cooking.

278
00:12:03,512 --> 00:12:05,351
Totally fulfill my requirements.

279
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:06,551
You are hired.

280
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:08,072
As for your salary,

281
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,431
the Human Resources Department
will talk to you about it.

282
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:13,392
But I have to tell you something
before I start to work here.

283
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,871
I'm still a student.

284
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,632
My time is not very flexible.

285
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,431
And I've no experience in this.

286
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:21,392
I'm worried that I'll waste your time.

287
00:12:22,072 --> 00:12:23,592
I know about all those.

288
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:26,192
Although you're a part-time personal assistant,

289
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,431
you have to join the training
from each various department.

290
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:29,991
Your job scope includes

291
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,632
but not limited to organising my schedule,

292
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,272
accompanying me to attend
some business functions.

293
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,911
Besides that, you'll have to
prepare my meals at weekends.

294
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:37,911
Your probation period is one month.

295
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,072
All right. I'll try my best.

296
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,351
There's one thing that you have
to pay special attention to.

297
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:45,791
My time is precious.

298
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:48,032
So I don't like to explain everything.

299
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,791
Don't ask me lots of questions
when you're working with me.

300
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:51,791
All you have to do is

301
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,192
to follow my orders.

302
00:12:53,392 --> 00:12:53,991
Get it?

303
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,272
Got it.

304
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,712
Qin Yao is in a bad mood today.

305
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:07,791
He'll be dining with us.

306
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:08,991
Come and do some grocery shopping with me.

307
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,592
I want to join you both.

308
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:11,712
What are we going to have?

309
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:13,512
How about crayfish?

310
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:14,871
Awesome!

311
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:16,231
No.

312
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,832
We should learn to be frugal, okay?

313
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:19,471
I just got a new job.

314
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,752
My salary is RMB8000 every month.

315
00:13:20,911 --> 00:13:22,471
Let's celebrate.

316
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:23,791
You're awesome.

317
00:13:24,032 --> 00:13:26,231
Don't worry, I'll control myself.

318
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,072
And make sure that you two won't go bankrupt.

319
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,791
If I fail to do so,

320
00:13:30,111 --> 00:13:31,632
you two may join my family.

321
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:34,311
I can assure you that you'll be rich and happy.

322
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:36,512
What part-time job is that
that could offer you such a high salary?

323
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:37,712
Are you sure you're not deceived?

324
00:13:37,911 --> 00:13:40,111
Stop talking nonsense. It's Ouyang Group.

325
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:41,551
The listed company

326
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:42,752
that sponsors your basketball team.

327
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:43,791
I'm going to be the personal assistant

328
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,752
for the CEO of Ouyang Group.

329
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:46,752
Whose personal assistant are you going to be?

330
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:47,871
Ouyang Yu.

331
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,911
You've met him on the basketball court before.

332
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,311
Do you still remember that
you were involved in a fight?

333
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:53,431
I remember that.

334
00:13:53,911 --> 00:13:54,952
He's quite good-looking.

335
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:55,991
You can't work for him.

336
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:57,712
Why?

337
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:58,952
You can't go.

338
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:01,351
He's losing it again.

339
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,032
Don't ask me about the reason.

340
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:04,632
I'm begging you

341
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:05,871
for the first time.

342
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,072
Don't work for him, okay?

343
00:14:10,592 --> 00:14:12,551
But I'm still in the probation period.

344
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,152
What if I can't complete the probation period?

345
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:16,072
Just let me try for a month.

346
00:14:16,192 --> 00:14:17,991
Just treat it as a practice for me.

347
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,592
I think

348
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,272
we should talk about this later.

349
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:25,871
Let's go for grocery shopping now.

350
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:29,392
I think

351
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,791
you can't be protecting Xiao Feng forever.

352
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:34,752
She has to learn to overcome the obstacles
in her life on her own.

353
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:36,712
Are we going to have crayfish
for dinner tonight?

354
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:37,431
Yes.

355
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:41,152
Su Muyun, does Qin Yao like crayfish?

356
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:43,311
I don't know.

357
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:51,592
Let me take a look at you.

358
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,791
Let me have a look.

359
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:01,632
How do I look in this outfit?

360
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,791
You look perfect.

361
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:07,351
You're so infatuated with him.

362
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,592
You still have feelings for Qin Yao, don't you?

363
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:11,512
No, of course not.

364
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,231
Qin Yao is my guest, I have to behave myself.

365
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:26,632
From what I can hear,

366
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:29,832
Su Muyun and Qin Yao are talking about Qi Yuan.

367
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,111
What's going on between the two of them?

368
00:15:33,752 --> 00:15:35,512
The soundproof effect of your house
is way too good.

369
00:15:35,512 --> 00:15:36,832
I can't hear their conversation clearly.

370
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:39,752
Fine.

371
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:41,592
Listen to me.

372
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:43,752
I know Qi Yuan well.

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,911
She's a bad woman.

374
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:49,752
We can't let that bad woman
ruin a virtuous man, right?

375
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:52,392
You're the only person

376
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,272
who can save Qin Yao from this.

377
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,311
But I'm not sure

378
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,952
if he is dating Qi Yuan.

379
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:59,272
Who cares.

380
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:01,311
Sometimes even a goalkeeper
can't stop the ball from going into the goal.

381
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:03,551
A good man like Qin Yao
is standing right in front of you.

382
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,911
This is your perfect chance.

383
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,752
You won't get a second chance.

384
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:08,991
There are a lot of things
that I'm not sure about.

385
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,032
It's not good to take actions now, right?

386
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:14,911
Qin Yao is handsome and kind.

387
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:15,911
It's such a waste

388
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,032
that he chooses to be Qi Yuan's boyfriend.

389
00:16:18,512 --> 00:16:19,351
You've my support.

390
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:20,911
I'll never let you back off now.

391
00:16:21,952 --> 00:16:23,032
But...

392
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:24,671
There's no 'but'.

393
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:29,471
If I were Qin Yao,

394
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:33,032
I would confess my love to you right away.

395
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:37,272
Since I started to date Qi Yuan,

396
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:40,431
I really give her my best.

397
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,791
But she doesn't show much interest in me.

398
00:16:43,152 --> 00:16:44,752
I really don't understand
what are women thinking.

399
00:16:44,911 --> 00:16:46,032
What should I do?

400
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:57,471
Don't move.

401
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,351
There's a caterpillar on your eyelid.

402
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:04,672
Those are the fake eyelashes
that I helped her to apply.

403
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:07,752
That's so ugly.

404
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:10,032
Xiao Feng, don't listen to him.

405
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,672
I think you look good.

406
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:13,351
Qin Yao,

407
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:14,951
you have good taste in this.

408
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,191
Take a look at Xiao Feng's outfit.

409
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:18,512
She's so presentable, right?

410
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:19,871
Besides, she's good at cooking too.

411
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:22,032
Do you have feelings for her,
even just a little?

412
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,711
Let's forget about the past.

413
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:26,111
Let's look forward to the bright future.

414
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:27,591
That's enough.

415
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:28,711
Stop it.

416
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:32,512
Well,

417
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:35,752
Xiao Feng,

418
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:39,471
I'm dating Qi Yuan now.

419
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:42,351
I happen to have a fight with her today.

420
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:43,792
So...

421
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:45,512
I'm sorry.

422
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:52,471
Young boy,

423
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:55,071
You're too naive.

424
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,711
Su Nianfeng, is the innocent lady

425
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:00,831
who is worthy of your love.

426
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,432
I know that Xiao Feng is good.

427
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:12,111
But I like Qi Yuan very much.

428
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:15,191
I've known her for many years.

429
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:16,951
I know her well.

430
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:20,032
And I cherish what I have with her.

431
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:22,752
So I won't give up on us

432
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:24,191
no matter what happens.

433
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:30,632
I...

434
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:34,071
I'm full. I'm going to take a stroll.

435
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:39,951
We haven't had our dinner yet.

436
00:19:17,912 --> 00:19:19,272
Please go back home.

437
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,912
I just want to be alone.

438
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:25,591
I'm worried about you.

439
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,071
Stop crying.

440
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,191
I don't like to see you cry.

441
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,831
Do I even have no right
to cry after all that?

442
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,831
Don't you have empathy?

443
00:19:36,111 --> 00:19:37,951
Fine. You can cry whenever you want to.

444
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:49,552
Can't you just

445
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,951
hug and comfort me?

446
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,432
Of course, I can.

447
00:19:58,272 --> 00:20:00,032
I want to hug you for the rest of my life.

00:21:57,512 --> 00:21:58,512
My roommate is there to reserve a table.

481
00:21:58,632 --> 00:22:00,071
Let's have lunch together.

482

What a deal!

486
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:12,951
Can I apply for a monthly pass?

487
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:14,032
That's absurd.

488

What's going on?

489
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,272
You look gloomy.

490
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:34,512
I got the highest score

491
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:36,111
for my diagnostic studies paper
in my class.

492
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:38,111
Why are you

493
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:40,392
so gloomy then?

494
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,752
You're the cause of everything.

495
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,152

497
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,471
I wouldn't have offended Professor Fang.

498
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,071
Handsome men will only bring troubles.

499
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:50,831
It's all my fault.

500
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:53,272
Professor Fang is very angry.

501
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:55,032
The consequences are serious.

502
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:57,792
Most importantly, I could get

00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,512
at the seminar in the United States.

504
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,032
It's going to come in handy
in treating Le Diyin.

505
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,231
Well, I screwed everything up.

506
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:05,591
Professor Fang is angry with me.

507
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,591
He decided to bring other classmates
to the seminar.

508
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,672
Is there any way to undo this?

509
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,512
Why didn't you accept the offer from Tsinghua
University and come to Mingxian University?

510
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,951
You really are an obstacle in my life.

511
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:30,231
It's so crowded here.

512
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,351
Why do you want to have lunch here
all of a sudden?

513
00:23:35,632 --> 00:23:37,272
Can we find any delicious food here?

514
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:44,632
Su Muyun, what a coincidence.

515
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,711
Can I sit here?

516
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,152
There are no vacant seats left.

517
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,191
You can accept lemonade, can't you?

518
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:11,632
Xiao Qing is going to order food.
Is there anything that you can't eat?

519
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:15,552
This person is...

520
00:24:24,392 --> 00:24:25,552
Are you hungry?

521
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:27,512
Do you want me order some food for you?

522
00:24:28,231 --> 00:24:29,752
I'm fine. I don't have an appetite.

523
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,591
Su Muyun

524
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,831
seems to be very close to his sister.

525
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,231
That's right.

526
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,152
I wonder what sin

527
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:54,591
did Su Muyun commit in his previous life.

528
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:56,991
And what good deeds did Su Nianfeng
do in her previous life.

529
00:24:57,351 --> 00:24:58,591
She's even

530
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:00,432
worse than

531
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,392
an ordinary woman.

532
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,991
Maybe she has some strengths
that we couldn't see.

533
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,831
You are the fairy.

534
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:10,792
What does Su Nianfeng have?

535
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,471
She could only stand beside Su Muyun by force.

536
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:16,471
She's so annoying.

537
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,672
I have indigestion.
I can't eat all this oily food.

538
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,831
What's wrong with Su Muyun?

539
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:39,272
He's indifferent to others.

540
00:25:39,392 --> 00:25:41,752
But he's so kind to Su Nianfeng.

541
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:42,951
Those who don't know them

542
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,752
will think that

543
00:25:43,871 --> 00:25:45,711
Su Nianfeng is his beloved girlfriend.

544
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:55,871
Wait for me.

545
00:25:57,951 --> 00:25:58,792
Good morning, everyone.

546
00:25:58,951 --> 00:26:00,991
I'm Chen Weiran,
the president of the Student Council.

547
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:02,191
The Student Council

548
00:26:02,191 --> 00:26:03,792
will be monitoring the competition.

549
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:05,552
Besides that, we've invited

550
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:08,512
the famous student in
artificial intelligence, Su Muyun,

551
00:26:08,711 --> 00:26:11,312
to be one of the judges for the debate.

552
00:26:11,552 --> 00:26:12,591
Let's welcome him.

553
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:17,752
The members of the Student Council

554
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:18,672
should take the initiatives

555
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,552
to encourage all the students in this

556
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:21,591
to take part in the debate.

557
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:22,991
Besides that, you should also be aware of

558
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,432
the deadline for the registration.

559
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:25,471
You'll lose the chance,

560
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:26,951
(The Star of Arts from Mingxian University)
once after the registration deadline.

561
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,792
(Debate competition)
Do you have

562
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,591
(Star Singer Competition)
any questions?

563
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:40,672
What are you doing here?

564
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:45,871
I'm here to see your sister.

565
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:55,831
RMB120000.

566
00:26:57,512 --> 00:26:58,792
Let's take part in the competition.

567
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,111
I'll make you a superstar.

568
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:04,632
What are you doing?

569
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:12,312
I can't even recognise
all the 24 letters of the alphabet.

570
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,471
There are 26 letters of the alphabet.

571
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:17,471
Did you forget the letter "I" and "Q"?

572
00:27:20,512 --> 00:27:22,152
I'll take part in this competition
no matter how.

573
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,392
I want Su Muyun to see

574
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:25,711
how I shine on stage.

575
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,512
Then he'll fall in love with me.

576
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:32,471
Just forget about it. I'll only hold you back.

577
00:27:35,591 --> 00:27:36,552
Su Muyun

578
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:38,552
will only pay attention to the competition
if you take part in it.

579
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,432
He'll focus on the competition
if you take part in it.

580
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,111
Come back here.

581
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,392
I really don't want to take part
in the competition.

582
00:27:48,591 --> 00:27:49,792
I can't even finish all the courses

583
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:51,552
-which I should take even if I don't sleep.
-Please.

584
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:52,552
I don't have time for this.

585
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:54,351
I'm begging you, the future Star of Arts.

586
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,552
Stop forcing her if she doesn't want to
take part in it.

587
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,512
What do you know about anything?

588
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,752
I'm supporting the activities organised by
the Student Council.

589
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:01,991
Moreover,

590
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,591
Su Nianfeng and I will be

591
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,471
the brightest star in the competition.

592
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:10,191
I'm begging you, I really don't want to go.

593
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:14,272
I heard that the grand prize is RMB10000.

594
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,432
How much? RMB10000?

595
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,471
You'll get a discount on the flight tickers
to the United States.

596
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,191
You only have to pay around RMB4000
for one round-trip ticket.

597
00:28:21,512 --> 00:28:23,591
I suppose you can still make it to your seminar.

598
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:26,672
All right. Let's think about it.

599
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:27,752
What are we going to perform?

600
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:29,831
My goal is the grand prize.

601
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:31,792
I've thought about it.

602
00:28:31,991 --> 00:28:33,351
Let's discuss about it in your room.

603
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:35,871
Su Muyun, please ask
the president of the Student Council

604
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:37,471
to maintain the website properly.

605
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:39,632
I don't want to see the server crashes

606
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:41,272
when you guys are counting the votes.

607
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:42,991
Let's go.

608
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:20,272
I really can't concur this kind of outfit.

609
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,632
What do you know about fashion?

610
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:23,991
If we put some effort
into the design of our outfit,

611
00:29:24,152 --> 00:29:25,111
the judges will feel that

612
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,191
we respect and value the competition.

613
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,591
That will help us gain some extra marks.

614
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,912
when they have a good impression on us.

615
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:32,752
No, I can't do it.

616
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,792
Are you taking part in
the Star of Arts competition?

617
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:38,191
What does it have to do with you?

618
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,032
The event is organised
by the Department of Art.

619
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,752
Qingxue is the director
of the Department of Art.

620
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,512
Do you still think that
it has nothing to do with her?

621
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:48,351
I've seen some preview of the performances.

622
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,191
Your dance is amazing.

623
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:51,951
You might be able to win the grand prize.

624
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:53,032
Really?

625
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:54,272
That's great.

626
00:29:57,392 --> 00:29:59,632
Xiao Qing, please get their contacts.

627
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,032
When the time and venue
for the competition are fixed,

628
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,672
please inform them in advance.

629
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:04,991
Let's exchange our contact details on WeChat.

630
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,191
Sure.

631
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:12,552
All right.

632
00:30:13,752 --> 00:30:16,512
Sorry, I've reached the limit of friends
on my WeChat.

633
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:21,032
I'll forward her contact details to you.

634
00:30:22,351 --> 00:30:23,351
All right.

635
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:30,392
Why are you giving her our contact details?

636
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:32,632
She's not going to help us.

637
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,480
(Mingxian University)

638
00:30:43,032 --> 00:30:44,111
Finally, you're here.

639
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:45,591
It's your turn soon, hurry up.

640
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:46,871
I'll take you to the competition.
Hurry up!

641
00:30:47,032 --> 00:30:47,951
The competition will begin at 10 a.m., right?

642
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:48,951
It's only 9.30 a.m. now.

643
00:30:49,071 --> 00:30:49,752
You remembered the wrong information.

644
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:50,672
Give me your bag.

645
00:30:50,792 --> 00:30:51,351
Hurry up!

646
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,231
Let's go.

647
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:55,351
All right. Let's give our next contestant

648
00:30:55,512 --> 00:30:57,351
(The Star of Arts Debate of Mingxian University)
a big round of applause.

649
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,552
She's a freshman from the Medicine Faculty.

650
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:00,792
Let's welcome

651
00:31:00,951 --> 00:31:02,312
Su Nianfeng.

652
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,991
Lady, this way, please.

653
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:13,191
Just go.

654
00:31:13,191 --> 00:31:14,912
How can she dress like this for a debate?

655
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:16,152
She's at the wrong place, isn't she?

656
00:31:16,152 --> 00:31:17,672
How can she dress like that?

657
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,152
What is she doing?

658
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:21,191
God knows.

659
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:22,951
Lady, this way, please.

660
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,400
(The Star of Arts Debate of Mingxian University)

661
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,312
How can she dress like this for a debate?

662
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,152
She's trying to get our attention.

663
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:43,312
Is she at the wrong place?

664
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,471
She doesn't respect the debate competition.

665
00:31:47,632 --> 00:31:48,792
Pick one.

666
00:31:49,752 --> 00:31:51,351
Is she going to

667
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,912
perform a rap for us?

668
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,312
Is she at the wrong place?

669
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:00,792
Hurry up. What's wrong with you.

670
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:05,711
This is ridiculous.

671
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:08,711
Please choose your side. Are you in favour of
or opposed to the debate topic?

672
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:10,231
You have three minutes for the free debate.

673
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:11,912
Please start your debate now.

674
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,672
All right.

675
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,752
She can't even read the topic out loud properly.

676
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,111
(Debate topic)
What takes her so long?

677
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:27,111
The introduction of artificial intelligence
in judging football matches.

678
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:32,351
Are you in favour of the topic or opposed to it?

679
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:35,191
You shall begin your debate now.

680
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:42,152
I seldom watch football matches.

(The Star of Arts of Mingxian University)
Lady, is your partner coming?

682
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,432
Please wait a few more minutes.

683
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,792
It should be a pair to attend, isn't it?

684
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:54,432
She stutters. How can she take part in a debate?

685
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:57,071
How did the Student Council
filter the candidates?

686
00:32:57,871 --> 00:32:58,951
That's right.

687
00:32:59,071 --> 00:32:59,831
She still has the audacity to join the debate.

688
00:32:59,951 --> 00:33:02,312
I remember that she's taking part in
the Star of Arts competition.

689
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,351
There are too many people
registered for the debate.

690
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,191
Someone must have mixed up the list.

691
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:10,912
What's the point of you doing all these?

692
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:12,831
Are you saying that

693
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:14,032
I deliberately put Xiao Feng in this debate

694
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:15,752
just to embarrass her?

695
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,831
What do you think?

696
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:19,951
Su Muyun,

697
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,392
I'm so disappointed with you.

698
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,871
Su Muyun,

699
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:26,351
Ouyang Qingxue doesn't need
to embarrass your sister.

700
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:27,912
How can she be able to do this?

701
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:29,071
Don't get me wrong.

702
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:30,032
I mean

703
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:31,871
I think the both of them are at good terms.

704
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:39,951
Ouyang Qingxue,

705
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,312
let me warn you about this.

706
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:44,991
Stop embarrassing Su Nianfeng.

707
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:46,632
Or else,

708
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,231
you'll regret what you've done.

709
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:52,272
One more thing.

710
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,711
It's really annoying to see

711
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:56,552
you pretending to be innocent.

712
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:05,392
She just left.

713
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:07,872
She should leave at the beginning.

714
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:13,832
(Venue of Xingyi Cup Debate Competition)
I feel embarrassed.

715
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:16,272
I feel that the entire school knows who I am.

716
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,552
Actually there aren't many audience in the all.

717
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:22,711
You're right.

718
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:24,391
All the students in the university

719
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,792
can only watch you performance
on the Internet.

720
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:27,552
You're so annoying.

721
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,191
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

722
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,471
Actually most people

723
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:40,272
only care about themselves.

724
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,391
No one will actually care about what others do.

725
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:43,711
Besides that,

726
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,792
there's an advantage of being
eliminated at the early stage.

727
00:34:46,312 --> 00:34:47,391
What advantage.

728
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,872
The sooner you get eliminated,

729
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,872
the lesser you'll embarrass yourself.

730
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,191
Did you

731
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,911
come from hell? I hate you.

732
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,752
Lady,

733
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,312
how about we let the next candidate
to perform first?

734
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:04,911
All right.

735
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,391
Thank you.

736
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,151
Why are you following me?

737
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,872
Stop your internship.

738
00:35:19,231 --> 00:35:21,671
Stop repeating the same thing.
Are you a repeater?

739
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:23,312
Do you know

740
00:35:23,312 --> 00:35:25,191
which group or community
is the easiest to be cheated?

741

who has a younger brother.

742
00:35:28,112 --> 00:35:28,911
Wrong.

743
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:31,471
The answer is any group you're in.

744
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:42,191
I told you I'll change.

745
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:43,872
I'll prove it to you.

for a short-term internship

757
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,032
Is this

758
00:36:25,312 --> 00:36:26,512
for real?

No.

when did I become so lucky

765
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:38,512
bcause usually the luck is not on my side.

766
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:40,391
You deserve this.

What do you mean?

768
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:45,151
We've agreed

769

to not ask me lots of questions.

Don't interfere with my arrangements.

Are you doing a charity work?

She doesn't

786
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:01,792
worth it?

787
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:03,872
This is Ouyang's family affair.

788
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,191

please stay away from her.

792
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:14,832
I'll stay away from her.

But,

794

she must stay away from you and Su Muyun.

Regarding the debate list issue,

00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:07,592
as the director of the Department of Art,
I'll take full responsibility for it.

806
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:11,911
Lots of people registered for the competition.
It's normal that someone mixed up the list.

807

Don't blame yourself.

808
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,671
No one will blame you.

809
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,471
Right.

810
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:18,512
Due to the debate list issue

811
00:39:18,872 --> 00:39:21,032
a lot of good participants were eliminated.

812
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:23,431
Such as Su Nianfeng
from the Department of Medicine.

813
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,072
It's a waste.

814
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,592
So I'd like to propose

815
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,951
that we add a revival round to the debate.

816

So that no one will feel regretful.

What do you think?

818

This is a good idea.

819
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:34,431
I agree.

820
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:35,752
We agree too.

821

You're so kind to Su Nianfeng

823
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:42,911
She should be eliminated.

824
00:39:43,151 --> 00:39:44,951
Why did you propose to add in
a revival round?

825

I've so much expectation on her.

I believe that she has what it takes.

00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,151
He even embarrassed you in front of everyone.

833
00:39:59,312 --> 00:40:00,671
I'm so angry when I think about it.

834
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:03,391
I think Xiao Feng is an innocent girl.

835
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,471
If everything goes well in
the revival round,

836
00:40:05,631 --> 00:40:06,951
she'll be able to enter the next round.

837
00:40:07,512 --> 00:40:09,552
You're too kind.

838
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:12,872
I won't let her enter the next round.

839
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,631
Now that she wants to show off,

840
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,671
I'll let her get all the attention in
the revival round .

841
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:18,471
Xiao Qing, don't do anything reckless.

842
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:20,872
You're the goddess in my heart.

843
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:22,991
I won't let bad guys bully you.

844
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:30,991
We're having dinner. Look.

845
00:40:34,352 --> 00:40:35,391
There are so many dishes.

846
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,752
I'll cook for you when you get back.

847
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:40,991
I'll recover soon

848
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:42,512
for your cooking.

849
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:46,032
Right.

850
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,032
Do you know who is Dr Thomas?

851
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:49,231
Or course I do.

852
00:40:49,431 --> 00:40:50,872
He's a cardiologist.

853
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:53,711
He's very well-known in the United States.

854
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,231
We tried to make appointments with him.

855
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:56,391
But we couldn't make it.

856
00:40:56,512 --> 00:40:57,512
Listen to me.

857
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:58,631
I might have a chance

858
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:00,552
to attend a seminar in the United States.

859
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:01,832
Maybe...

860
00:41:02,512 --> 00:41:03,872
Maybe I'll be able to meet him.

861
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:06,911
All right. Go and have your dinner.

862
00:41:07,191 --> 00:41:08,471
Or else Dr Thomas

863
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,471
will have to treat Su Muyun's cough first.

864
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:11,631
All right. I'll talk to you later.

865
00:41:11,792 --> 00:41:12,631
Bye.

866
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:13,832
Bye.

867
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:18,711
How is he?

868
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:20,671
Le Diyin is in good condition.

869
00:41:21,951 --> 00:41:23,711
I mean your internship.

870
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:25,911
It went well.

871
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,671
What did Ouyang Yu say to you?

872
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:30,631
He said a lot of things to me,
what do you want to know?

873
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:32,191
You'll regret your decision

874
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:34,072
