25
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:19,002
Xiao Feng.

26
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:22,801
Are you...

27
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,922
Are you crying?

28
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:26,241

I don't know what to do.

30
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,161
Don't cry.

31
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,961
Tell me what happened.

32
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,482
I don't know how to tell you.

33
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,642
Just tell me when you feel like it.

34
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,441
Calm down first.

35
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,122
Don't worry.

36
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,002
I'll always be by your side.

37
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,082
Focus on your treatment.

38
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:49,202
Let me clear my head.

39
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:59,521
How long do I expect to live?

40
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,082
It's not optimistic.

41
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:03,002

Who is it calling so early in the morning?

55

Damn it.

56
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:06,252
(Su Muyun)

57
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,121
Anything?

58
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:12,642
Did Su Nianfeng contact you?

59
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:14,402
No.

60
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:28,242
What's the matter?

61
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,082
Did Su Nianfeng contact you?

62
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:31,321
No.

63
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:33,121
What's wrong?
Did something happen to Xiao Feng?

64
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,001
What's the matter?

65
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:17,762
Grande valse brillante in E-flat major.

66
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,402
You seem to be in a good mood.

67
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,082
I practice playing the piano every day,
don't I?

68
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:26,642
What are you trying to do?

69
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,402
Brother, what are you talking about?

70
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:32,202
Su Nianfeng has never done anything
to you.

71
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:35,161
You're talking about Su Nianfeng?

72
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,242
I only meant well
to tell her the truth.

73
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,802
She's been kept in the dark
for so many years.

74
00:06:41,881 --> 00:06:43,001
It's quite pitiful.

75
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,482
The truth?

76
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,762
Fake car accident certificate.

77
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,522
Edited recording.

78
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:50,482
Are these your so-called truth?

79
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:53,962
Regardless if it was the truth,

80
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:56,482
she believed it anyway.

81
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:57,922
Back then,

82
00:06:58,522 --> 00:07:00,922
our family acquired Zhuoyang Group
at a low price

83
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,922
which ended up ruining their family.

84
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:03,802
Su Nianfeng

85
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:06,001
is the victim in this case.

86
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:07,202
Why do you keep

87
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,121
picking on her?

88
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:18,362
That's because she gets close to someone
she shouldn't have.

89
00:07:20,762 --> 00:07:22,402
It will boomerang against herself.

90
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:40,642
Chairman, please sign here.

91
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:44,802
Thank you.

92
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,121
You're back.

93
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,642
How did it go with the lab in the United States?

94
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,482
Everything is going well

95
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,682
There's progress
with the new drug development.

96
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,441
The details have been sent to your email.

97
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:53,121
I need your confirmation and signature

98
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,082
for the newly launched
hospital equipment list.

99
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,402
Also, United Healthcare representatives

100
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:56,762
are waiting for you
in the conference room.

101
00:07:58,321 --> 00:07:59,121
All right.

102
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:08,321
Right.

103
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,041
A new intern will be joining
our company soon.

104
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:11,242
Her name is Su Nianfeng.

105
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:12,721
When she comes,
let her familiarize herself

106
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:14,242
with the new drug development project.

107
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:15,922
Make further arrangement
for her participation.

108
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:17,482
I'm back now. I can...

109
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,561
Contact her.

110
00:08:40,042 --> 00:08:41,121
Su Muyun.

111
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,681
Good morning.

112
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:51,522
What's the matter?

113
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,962
Su Muyun, let go of Qingxue.

114
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:56,801
You're hurting her.

115
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,162
Su Muyun!

116
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,801
What did you say to Su Nianfeng?

117
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:19,441
I'm just trying to help her.

118
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,361
But I didn't know

119
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:22,801
the Zhuo family

120
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:24,602
and Su family have such a deep connection.

121
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:27,881
Who are you to say that?

122
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,241
Where's the evidence?

123
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,042
I only have good intentions,

124
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,722
but it goes awry and
hurts Xiao Feng accidentally.

125
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:36,402
But I never want to hurt you.

126
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:38,561
What exactly have you told her?

127
00:09:55,522 --> 00:09:56,402
Mr Zhuo.

128
00:09:56,642 --> 00:09:57,681
Why would there be a problem

129
00:09:57,801 --> 00:09:58,722
with Zhuoyang Group's capital chain?

130
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:00,522
I made a mistake in my decision

131
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,762
and trusted the wrong person.

132
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,202
Mr Zhuo, who are you referring to?

133
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:05,762
My best friend.

134
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:07,361
Su Zijian and his wife.

135
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:12,522
Don't be upset.

136
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,082
This was grudge from our parents' generation.

137
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,881
Are you all right?

138
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,162
Su Muyun.

139
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:30,722
Right from the start, it's impossible
between you and her to be together.

140
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:32,321
That's my own business.

141
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:41,211
(Mum)

142
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,402
Don't worry.

143
00:10:58,681 --> 00:10:59,402
Xiao Yun.

144
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:00,481
Xiao Yun.

145
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:02,241
Why is Xiao Feng missing?

146
00:11:02,402 --> 00:11:04,121
Is anyone able to find her?

147
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,241
I think we should call the police.

148
00:11:10,722 --> 00:11:12,361
I have filed a report at the police station.

149
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,082
Should anything come up,

150
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:15,962
the police will give us a call.

151
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:17,881
But still,

152
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,361
we can't just sit here and wait.

153
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,361
Why don't we go out there
and search for her?

154
00:11:21,602 --> 00:11:22,642
Mum.

155
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:25,082
Was the incident
with Su Nianfeng's parents

156
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,881
related to our family?

157
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:32,722
Xiao Yun, who told you about it?

158
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,522
Was it our family

159
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,561
who caused the death
of Su Nianfeng's parents?

160
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:37,561
Shut up.

161
00:11:38,481 --> 00:11:40,082
Do you know what you're talking about?

162
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:41,602
Don't spew nonsense.

163
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:42,801
Xiao Yun.

164
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:43,962
Don't overthink it.

165
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:45,561
That was an accident.

166
00:11:45,762 --> 00:11:46,881
All right. Let's drop that topic.

167
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,801
We can talk later
after we find Xiao Feng.

168
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:50,361
Dad.

169
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:51,842

00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,361
Is this for real?

340
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:37,682
It's like the story in a movie.

341
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,241
I wish none of this was real.

342
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,042
But you heard about this

343
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:48,121
from Ouyang Qingxue, right?

344
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:51,361
I have the feeling that this girl

345
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:53,402
bears you ill will.

346
00:24:54,642 --> 00:24:56,721
Actually, I do doubt her.

347
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:58,682
But this is an important matter.

348
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:00,121
I guess she wouldn't be lying to me.

349
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:02,361
You're being so naive.

350
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:05,241
Think about our
Stars of Art competition last time.

351
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:06,442
It was Xiao Qing.

352
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:08,442
Her lackey was behind it, right?

353
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:10,802
I'll take you inside. Hurry.

354
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,881
Isn't it at 10am? It's only 9:30 am now.

355
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:13,642
You remembered it wrongly.

356
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,682
Here. Let me take your bag.

357
00:25:14,802 --> 00:25:16,001
Hurry. Let's go.

358
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:20,601
I thought something wasn't right too.

359
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:21,721
Right?

360
00:25:22,081 --> 00:25:23,642
Also, the incident with Snowball.

361
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:26,241
If I saw something like that,

362
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,642
I would want to drown you
with my saliva.

363
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:31,162
Why would she suddenly believe in you?

364
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,601
What was her motive?

365
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,721
It's great that everyone believes you.

366
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,282
You must have suffered.

367
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,241
You're just too kind.

368
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:44,562
You think the best of others.

369
00:25:44,922 --> 00:25:45,601
Look.

370
00:25:45,762 --> 00:25:49,282
She definitely bears you ill will.

371
00:25:51,642 --> 00:25:53,841
Do you think Su Muyun cares about you?

372
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,402
He's only making atonement
for his parents.

373
00:25:57,802 --> 00:25:59,762
Do you know who's Ouyang Yu?

374
00:26:00,402 --> 00:26:02,241
He's my biological brother.

375
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:04,841
You think of her as a nice lady.

376
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:07,682
She's actually a beautiful villain.

377
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:13,121
Thank you.

378
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:14,721
Don't worry.

379
00:26:15,402 --> 00:26:18,121
I won't get bitten by her anymore.

380
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:35,322
You got the name wrong.

381
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:36,779
(Su Nianfeng)

382
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:44,105
(Su Muyun)

383
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,601
Su Muyun.

384
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:50,081
Why do you seem preoccupied lately?

385
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:51,961
The examination is drawing near.

386
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,762
You need to stay focused.

387
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,601
Don't get carried away
just because you have good grades.

388
00:26:56,922 --> 00:26:58,081
I'm telling you.

389
00:26:58,562 --> 00:27:01,241
There's still a long way to go
down this road in doing research.

390
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,802
Xiao Feng, where have you been these days?

391
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:34,802
I'm fine.

392
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,402
Xiao Yun is looking for you everywhere.

393
00:27:36,762 --> 00:27:38,042
He hasn't eaten or slept for days.

394
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:38,961
It's so worrying.

395
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:40,402
Quickly contact him.

396
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:42,841
The movie is about to start. Let's go.

397
00:27:43,001 --> 00:27:44,121
All right. Hold on.

398
00:27:47,162 --> 00:27:48,241
Just a while more.

399
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,241
I have things to do. I'll go first.

400
00:28:05,472 --> 00:28:06,872
(Qin Yao)

401
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,322
Xiao Yun.

402
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:10,562
I saw Xiao Feng.

403
00:28:12,881 --> 00:28:14,402
Sir, something came up at home.

404
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:15,721
I need to take a day off.

405
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:21,522
-Boss.
-Hi, sir.

406
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:22,721
Have you seen a long hair girl

407
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,721
who's about this height?

408
00:28:24,922 --> 00:28:26,042
Long hair?

409
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,601
-She headed to the opposite milk tea shop.
-Thank you.

410
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,721
You're welcome.

411
00:28:55,522 --> 00:28:56,442
Xiao Feng.

412
00:29:00,922 --> 00:29:02,042
Long time no see.

413
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:03,682
Le Diyin?

414
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:06,402
Why did you come back?

415
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:07,762
Are you feeling better?

416
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:09,881
I finally came back.

417
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,642
Aren't you being too cold?

418
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:49,201
Things must be tough, right?

419
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,522
I know about everything.

420
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,361
Excuse me. Please give way.

421
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:02,881
Take it slow.

422
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:17,402
Seriously?

423
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,802
My amazing makeup skills

424
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:21,322
only get me this little amount of fans?

425
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:26,481
Is there a bug in the system?

426
00:30:27,481 --> 00:30:28,241
This is a huge letdown

427
00:30:28,241 --> 00:30:30,162
to my 30 kinds of makeup brushes.

428
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,282
You overthink it. Among these 30 fans,

429
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:38,121
-I'm the only active one.
-Xiao Lin?

430
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:40,402
-You again?
-Xiao Lin rewarded you a plane.

431
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:41,802
It's worth 100 CNY.

432
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:47,361
Xiao Lin, I miss you so much.

433
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:50,442
You went overboard with your ads.

434
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:51,802
That explains the view count.

435
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,922
I had a fight with my family recently.

436
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,162
I'm hard-pressed for money.

437
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,322
I can only make a living
through advertisement now.

438
00:31:01,762 --> 00:31:02,601
Otherwise,

439
00:31:02,802 --> 00:31:04,081
are you going to support me?

440
00:31:05,642 --> 00:31:07,601
Xiao Lin rewarded you
with an aircraft carrier.

441
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:09,201
-I like to watch advertisements.
-It's worth 500 CNY.

442
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:10,282
Keep it going.

443
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:13,481
Thank you.

444
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,922
Except my beautiful face,

445
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:17,762
I have nothing else.

446
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:20,162
What can I do?

447
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:23,922
Do you provide door-to-door makeup service?

448
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:27,001
Darling, you found the right person.

449
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:30,201
Since it's only you and I today,

450
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,481
instead of 1,888 CNY

451
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:34,322
or 1,118 CNY.

452
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,481
You just have to pay 998 CNY
and I'll come right to your door!

453
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:51,562
Ailun.

454
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:53,682
Ailun.

455
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:56,442
Zhang Ailun!

456
00:31:56,841 --> 00:31:57,881
What is it?

457
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:03,562
Buddy.

458
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:05,721
Your eyes

459
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:07,961
are like the bright sun in the sky.

460
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,042
Come on. Can't you stop it for a bit?

461
00:32:12,282 --> 00:32:13,402
Look.

462
00:32:13,961 --> 00:32:15,241
Lend me some money.

463
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,042
Instead of 1,888 CNY,

464
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,322
or 1,118 CNY,

465
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,961
I'm only asking for 998 CNY.

466
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:22,642
Are you kidding me?
You're asking me for money?

467
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:25,922
My mum has frozen my credit card.

468
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,601
Come on.

469
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:32,881
Transfer the amount you want.

470
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,522
Take it as a fee
in exchange for some quiet time.

471
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:36,922
Off you go.

472
00:32:40,601 --> 00:32:42,361
I've earned some money.

473
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:45,121
This way, please.

474
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:55,762
Thank you.

475
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,881
You're welcome.

476
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,562
Hi, are you Xiao Lin?

477
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,442
Lin Di?

478
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,682
We're not suitable for each other.

479
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:15,001
Is there a point to this?

480
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:16,361
Of course there is.

481
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:00,601
This must be expensive.

482
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:01,642
Let's not waste it.

483
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:03,282
I'll take it as my transportation fee.

484
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,322
Aren't you giving me a makeup service?

485
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,882
It's not like I'm not paying for it.

486
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:12,721
I think you're not quite right
in the head.

487
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:15,241
If you want my service, pay for it first.

488
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:16,522
Then, I'll teach you.

489
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,522
Fine.

490
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:33,802
My dear guest, please give me
a five-star rating.

491
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:41,441
Bye.

492
00:34:41,802 --> 00:34:43,082
Bye.

493
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,082
Here we are.

494
00:35:17,161 --> 00:35:18,481
Is this where you're staying?

495
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:21,721
This is just for temporary.

496
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,721
I've found a new place.

497
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:24,842
Where is it?

498
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:26,161
Do you have enough money?

499
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:29,282
Let's not worry about it.

500
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,001
It's definitely better than this.

501
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:40,721
I have no appetite lately.

502
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:42,882
It's more convenient
to take instant noodles.

503
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:57,441
What's your plan?

504
00:35:58,401 --> 00:35:58,961
I know a psychologist

505
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:00,681
who specializes in hypnosis.

506
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,681
Perhaps, he can help you
to recover your memories.

507
00:36:03,122 --> 00:36:04,921
That's too costly.

508
00:36:05,201 --> 00:36:07,562
It's good enough

509
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:09,001
if I can feed myself.

510
00:36:09,282 --> 00:36:10,481
I can help you.

511
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:15,921
Thank you.

512
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:18,921
But I want to rely on myself.

513
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,681
If you want to help me,

514
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,481
please put the garbage at the door.

515
00:36:23,042 --> 00:36:24,721
Then, we'll have a nice meal

516
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,001
to welcome you back.

517
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:28,602
Let me take it.

518
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:29,522
Thank you.

519
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:38,362
Let's go.

520
00:36:48,681 --> 00:36:49,362
Here.

521
00:36:49,602 --> 00:36:51,362
Try it. I made it myself.

522
00:36:53,282 --> 00:36:55,161
Clear broth for you
and the spicy one for me.

523
00:36:55,322 --> 00:36:56,241
All right.

524
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:05,362
It's good.

525
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:07,802
That's my secret recipe.

526
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,282
This sauce is called...

527
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,161
All right.

528
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:16,921
To prevent Su Muyun from ruining my sauce,

529
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,562
I've come up with a name for it.
It's called...

530
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:19,721
It's called poison.

531
00:37:25,082 --> 00:37:26,441
What's the sauce called?

532
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:28,681
Nothing.

533
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:39,282
Right.

534
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:40,762
How's your illness?

535
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,001
You were stammering
when I asked you earlier.

536
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,161
I'm good.

537
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,122
Come on. I major in medicine.

538
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:51,082
It's dilated cardiomyopathy
we're talking about. How can you be fine?

539
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,961
Congestive heart failure cannot be cured.

540
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:55,441
The only way

541
00:37:55,721 --> 00:37:57,362
is to have a heart transplant.

542
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,362
The doctor said
that my situation doesn't look good.

543
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:04,362
I might not be able to wait
until I get a heart.

544
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:05,522
No way.

545
00:38:05,921 --> 00:38:07,441
Go back to the hospital
and continue with the treatment.

546
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,161
Even if I go back,

547
00:38:11,362 --> 00:38:12,921
it's just to create psychological comfort.

548
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:15,322
You major in medicine.
You should know better.

549
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,602
I'll surely do my best

550
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,201
to keep you alive.

551
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:21,362
Well, I'll leave my life

552
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:22,842
in your hands then.

553
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:25,842
I have another request.

554
00:38:26,122 --> 00:38:27,122
Ask away.

555
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:29,082
Look.

556
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:30,762
The tripe is overcooked.

557
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:32,322
Let's get another plate.

558
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,161
Sure. I'll place the order.

559
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:36,201
Okay.

560
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:40,921
Waiter.

561
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,282
Hi, the total is 300 CNY.

562
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,122
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

563
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:07,562
Take care.

564
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,721
Thank you.

565
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:14,241
Let's go.

566
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,201
You said it was a welcome-back dinner.

567
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,882
But you ate more than I did.

568
00:39:24,721 --> 00:39:26,161
There were no leftovers at all.

569
00:39:26,602 --> 00:39:28,282
If I didn't finish it,

570
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:30,802
that would be a letdown
to my unique dipping sauce.

571
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:32,562
I had a great time.

572
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:33,802
Thank you.

573
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,122
Don't mention it.

574
00:39:35,362 --> 00:39:37,082
Where are you going? Let me escort you.

575
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:40,082
Well.

576
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,282
I still have things to do.

577
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:43,762
You can go home first.

578
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:50,522
What else is there to do
at this late hour?

579
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:53,882
Go home and rest earlier.

580
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:00,961
Bye.

581
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,120
(Mum)

582
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,721
Xiao Feng, where have you been?

583
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:02,481
I'm so worried about you.

584
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,441
The weather is turning cold.

585
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:07,241
Remember to put on more clothes.

586
00:41:07,641 --> 00:41:08,641
When you're back,

587
00:41:08,802 --> 00:41:09,802
I'll take you

588
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:11,481
to your favourite Sichuan restaurant.

589
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,241
We'll go ourselves and leave Xiao Yun out.

590
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,562
He doesn't take spicy food.

591
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,721
When are you coming back?

592
00:41:19,122 --> 00:41:20,161
Xiao Feng.

593
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:22,602
I dreamt of you again.

594
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,602
Don't scare me.

595
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,842
Quickly come home now.

596
00:41:29,456 --> 00:41:30,976
