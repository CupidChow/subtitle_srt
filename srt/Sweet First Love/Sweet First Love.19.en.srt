The Days When My Brother And I Live Together)

00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,326
(Episode 19)

25
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,720
I hate such deal.

26
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,839
You can't leave.

27
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,040
Do you know who I am?

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm Ouyang Qingxue.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,239
Since childhood,

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,800
I've always got

31
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,479
what I want.

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,039
Everyone must give in to me.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,639
You're the only one

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,919
that

35
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,080
keep tramping on my self-esteem.

36
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,960
But I've fallen for you.

37
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
I'm outstanding.

38
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,880
Why are you indifferent to me?

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,199
Open the door!

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Open the door!

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,759
Call Su Muyun quickly.

42
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,199
Open the door!

(Zhuo Yifeng)

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,600
Why does she show up again?

45
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,639
What's so good about her?

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,800
She's so ordinary and she is a nobody.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Come out!

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,759
Open the door!

49
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,759
How's it?

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
He doesn't pick up.

51
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,800
Su Muyun, how could you disappear
at such a critical moment?

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
Open the door!

53
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Open it!

54
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't judge her.

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,960
You have no right.

56
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,600
What?

57
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,800
How come I have no right?

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,759
Come out!

59
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,919
Qin Yao, Liu Zihui and I

60
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,479
are stuck in the room.

61
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,679
Help!

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,759
Open it!

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,080
Open the door quickly!

64
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,080
You cannot hide here forever.

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,559
Are they gone?

66
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,759
Where are they?

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,880
Gone?

68
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,119
Gone.

69
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,440
Open the door!

70
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,360
Open! Open it!

71
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,639
The number you've dialed

72
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,360
is busy.

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,440
(Zhuo Yifeng)
Please call again later.

74
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:52,230
(Hunter Bar)

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Mister, please head to this bar.

76
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,759
Open the door!

77
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,240
I can't hold it any longer.

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,479
Stop!

79
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,240
What are you doing?

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,759
Qin Yao, save us!

81
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:24,679
What's the matter?

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,279
They've ordered the wine.

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,760
Don't dream of leaving if they won't pay.

84
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,679
Let them go.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,839
I'll pay for them.

86
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,920
No.

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Pay before they leave. That's the rule.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
Do you mean

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,200
you're afraid

90
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
that you can't defeat me and I will run away?

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,519
Qin Yao...

92
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,920
Where's Su Muyun?

93
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,760
Weren't you chasing after him?

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,040
Why are you here?

95
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,320
I couldn't get to him.

96
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:52,640
He got into Ouyang Qingxue's car.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,399
What are you talking?

98
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,119
Are you paying with cash,
credit card or e-wallet?

99
00:04:58,799 --> 00:04:59,720
It's fine. You two Leave first.

100
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,720
I'll settle it.

101
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,760
Alright.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,959
Get your hands off!

103
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
I have to see

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
what they've ordered.

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,200
You're men.

106
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,160
Don't bully the girls.

107
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,279
Go.

108
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,359
Alright. Give me back my phone.

109
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,079
Go.

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,040
Kid, you've got the guts.

111
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:28,359
Come with me.

112
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,040
Follow me!

113
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,359
What do you want to do?

114
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,480
You wait for Qin Yao at the entrance.

115
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,320
I'll turn the power off.

116
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,279
Alright.

117
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,119
Bill, please.

118
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,880
Here are the drinks.

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Look at it yourself.

120
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,679
The two girls ordered
the most expensive alcohol.

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
No need to see it.

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,679
As for the payment, I'll give you the money.

123
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,920
What's happening?

124
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,079
Why the blackout?

125
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,959
Is anyone fixing it?

126
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,480
Where's he? Chase after him.

127
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,839
Qin Yao!

128
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Get off!

129
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,480
Why are you still here?

130
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,959
Where's Zihui?

131
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,399
Let's go.

132
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,760
There! Chase them!

133
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,000
-Do you think
-Go!

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
you can trick us?

135
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,200
Go!

136
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,440
Help Qin Yao quickly. I'll get someone over.

137
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:53,399
Quick.

138
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,440
What are you doing?

139
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,399
Just wait and see.

140
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,160
Thank you.

141
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,920
Be careful

142
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,679
when you're outside at night.

143
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,200
-Alright. I'll remember it.
-Alright.

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,559
-Go home now.
-Thank you.

145
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,959
You've got the guts now.

146
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,799
How dare you go to the nightclub?

147
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
You left with Ouyang Qingxue.

148
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,000
Why can't I go to the nightclub?

149
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,959
Xiao Feng, I...

150
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,359
Look at you.

151
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,640
You are too close while I'm here.

152
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,600
Have you ever thought of me?

153
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,480
What have we thought of you?

154
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,079
It's what you've thought of me.

155
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,640
You have no right to control me.

156
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,720
Fine.

157
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
I won't look after you

158
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,239
from now on.

159
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,799
Who needs you to?

160
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,559
Arrogant man.

161
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,399
Qin Yao, let's go.

162
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,880
Let's go to the next round.

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
Let's go.

164
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,440
But...

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,279
Bro, I...

166
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,279
I...

167
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,200
Xiao Feng, I...

168
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,679
It's fine.

169
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,719
Thank you. I...

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll get going now.

171
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,080
Even if with tears,

172
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
I have to make up for what I've done.

173
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,880
Where are they?

174
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,119
They have just left.

175
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,679
What happened?

176
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll share with you next time.

177
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Forget it.

178
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,160
(Mum)

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
Mum, do you feel better?

180
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm fine.

181
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,200
How's Xiao Feng?

182
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,760
She is

183
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,679
doing well.

184
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,559
I didn't care much about you lately.

185
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,679
Is everything alright?

186
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,760
What's your plan after graduation?

187
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,960
Start my own business.

188
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,119
That's great.

189
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
What about Xiao Feng?

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,039
I'm tired.

191
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:23,599
I'll hang up.

192
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,359
Mum, have a good rest.

193
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,880
Alright.

194
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,159
You're so young.

195
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,840
Why do you rush to start a business?

196
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,200
Your project

197
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,760
is of great difficulty and takes long time.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,919
The market is pretty small.

199
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,719
You'll fail, lad.

200
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,119
Why not work for others
for a few years first?

201
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,719
I can invest in it. But I want

202
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,159
eighty percent of the shares.

203
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,760
Why do you have to choose such a difficult way?

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,919
Starting a business isn't that simple.

Don't be so indifferent.

209
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,559
It was a misunderstanding.

210
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,479
If you want to talk about Zhuo Yifeng,

211
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,799
then I'll hang up.

212
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:56,200
No. No.

213
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,280
I knew your efforts to court her.

214
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,159
So I hoped
she could make the first move once.

215
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,320
I wanted to give a helping hand.

216
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,359
How would I know that

217
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,799
you'd get into Ouyang Qingxue's car?

218
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,359
Stop it. Don't mention it anymore.

219
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,599
I believe you.

220

That's right.

I'm sincerely concerned about you.

222
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,599
By the way,

223
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,039

Listen to me.

Please don't give up the opportunities

227

for starting a business.

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,799
You should know what I'm talking about.

229
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,599
I'll start to work in these 2 days.

230
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,679
But I'll never give up entrepreneurship.

231
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,799
Alright. Think about it carefully.

232

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,000
the agreement for you

346
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,040
and see if there's any trap.

347
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,760
Are you free on that day?

348
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,400
-Yes.
-I hope you'll go with me.

349
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,560
Alright.

350
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Thank you.

351
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,839
I'll get going

352
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,239
if you have no other things to say.

353
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,920
I have a movie date with Xiao Feng.

354
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,839
I need to buy a bunch of flowers before that.

355
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,959
I'm leaving.

356
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,280
You dare?

357
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,680
Xiao Feng is quite adorable.

358
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,359
The more we get along,

359
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,800
the more I like her.

360
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,599
Are you serious?

361
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,839
Calm down.

362
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,239
You're too serious to have a joke.

363
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,640
What a crap.

364
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,839
About the accident

365
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,880
at the bar last time.

366
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,400
When she bumped into the black bartender,

367
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,280
she called you first.

368
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,760
She called me because she couldn't get you.

369
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,520
So?

370
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,719
So

371
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,520
you're important to her.

372
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,800
Remember it.

373
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,319
She's not what she was in high school.

374
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,680
Xiao Feng is attractive now.

375
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,719
She was too.

376
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,040
If you continue to treat her with silence,

377
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,079
she might choose someone else one day.

378
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,239
You're already an adult.

379
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,439
Still so childish?

380
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,959
There's no point in silent treatment.

381
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,880
It's none of your business.

382
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:21,000
Alright. Treat me as a busybody then.

383
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:22,959

and has been negative.

389
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,959
Look forward to a pleasant cooperation.

390
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,199
Hope we can work well together.

391

394
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,560
It's not right.

395
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,880
There's a problem with the agreement?

396
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,160
There's no problem with it.

397
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,920
That's why it's strange.

398
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,119
Deep Sea Technology
is a well-established company.

399

But all the conditions

400
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,439
are in your favour.

401
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,680
It shouldn't be.

402
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,560
I found it strange too.

403
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,719
The negotiation

404
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,359
has been way too smooth.

Mr. Li,

409
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,079
I have some questions

410
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
about the agreement.

411
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,040
Alright.

412
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,240
Let's discuss at my office tomorrow.

413
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,680
See you tomorrow.

really has good money.

416
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,280
Come on in!

417
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,160
Mr. Li, he's here.

418
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,560
Xiao Su is here?

419
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,439
We meet again.

420
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,160
Xiao Su,

421
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,199
feel free to voice out your dissatisfaction.

422
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,000
We'll be a family soon anyway.

423
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
A family?

424
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,760
Uncle, don't frighten him.

425
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,280
Isn't this something common?

426
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,680
A business marriage.

427
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,640
The key is that Xiao Su is capable.

428
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,880
We will never do business

429
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,319
that loses money. Right, Xiao Su?

430
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,239
If such precondition

431
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,079
exists in our cooperation,

432
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,040
I won't accept it.

433
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:00,560
Su Muyun...

434
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,040
You must think it through.

435
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,319
Not so many companies

436
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,439
in the country can take your project.

437
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,199
If you give up the chance we offered you,

438
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:12,359
you might never
come across another opportunity.

439
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,599
But this is not what I want.

440
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,959
Xiao Su.

441
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Go.

442
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,760
Su Muyun, what are you thinking?

443
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,600
It's such a good opportunity.

444
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,440
Have you lost your mind?

445
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,160
Is it for Zhuo Yifeng?

446
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,199
Are you to sacrifice your future for her?

447
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,560
Think carefully.

448
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,560
How much effort

449
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,239
have you put into this project?

450
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:47,280
A person like you

451
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,959
will never understand it.

452
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:50,680
Zhuo Yifeng isn't worthy

453
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,119
of your sacrifice.

454
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,680
To her,

455
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,199
everything else

456
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,719
is more important than you, right?

457
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm different from her.

458
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,599
I'm not

459
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,199
interested in you.

460
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,439
Su Muyun,

461
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,520
you'll regret it.

462
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,239
How could you treat your poor brother

463
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,479
with a mere bowl of noodles?

464
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,560
We're business partners, aren't we?

465
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,359
I've quitted the cooperation.

466
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:37,400
What's wrong with you?

467
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

468
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
You've got stomachache again?

469
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,119
I'm fine.

470
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,719
I'll get better in one or two days.

471
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,800
Didn't you go to the company today?

472
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,959
How was it?

473
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,479
Ouyang Qingxue was there too.

474
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,439
Who?

475
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,000
Ouyang Qingxue?

476
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Oh, woman.

477
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,520
So

478
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:24,000
did you give up the investment

479
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,239
for Xiao Feng?

480
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,640
It's for myself.

481
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,959
Fine.

482
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,239
You win.

483
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:33,560
Not everyone will have

484
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,119
such a great opportunity.

485
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,599
Looks like

486
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,520
I can be assured
to let you take care of Xiao Feng.

487
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,439
Who do you think you are?

488
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,479
She's mine all along.

489
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,599
Eat your noodles.

490
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,319
Fine, I'll stop talking. Dig in.

491
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,479
Don't think too much.

492
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,640
A gold will shine wherever it goes.

493
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,439
You should work hard at your current job.

494
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:10,000
We'll accumulate the experience.

495
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,199
It's me.

496
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,400
Got it.

497
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,520
What's it?

498
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
I'm sacked.

499
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
What?

500
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:37,520
Don't waste. Finish the food.

501
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,000
You've been sacked.

502
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Why aren't you worried?

503
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,119
You've just said that

504
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,319
a gold will shine wherever it goes.

505
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,959
Uncle Deng.

506
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,000
Hi, Qingxue.

507
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,119
I've sacked Su Muyun.

508
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,959
Thank you, Uncle Deng.

509
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,000
Come over to our house when you're free.

510
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,479
Alright.

511
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,079
The school arranged me to be an intern here.

512
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:39,280
You may call me Dr Zhuo from now on.

513
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,719
You're so busy at Ouyang Group.

514
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,280
Do you still have the time
for internship here?

515

00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:49,359
Thomas has returned to the United States.

518
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,040
The 2nd phase will start soon.

519
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,560
So I have some time now.

520
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,599
Why didn't you go with him?

521
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:56,920
I'm not good enough

522
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,680
to meet the requirements.

523
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,839
That's why I've applied for the internship.

524
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,839
I'll make good use of the free time

525
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,199
to learn and enrich myself.

526
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,119
That's good too. From now on,

527
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,160
I can count on someone
of higher authority then.

528
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:10,959
By the way,

529
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,079
I've read all your reports.

530
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,239
It's progressing in the good direction.

531
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,239
But don't take it lightly.

532
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,479
If you feel unwell,

533
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,839
you must tell me immediately.

534
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,119
Got it,

535
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,599
Dr Zhuo.

536
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,280
Wish us all the best.

537
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,640
Let's take a photo of it.

538
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,560
Alright.

539
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,040
You hold the phone. I'll stand behind you

540
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,239
so I won't look so fat.

541
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,040
What a scheming girl.

542
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:46,920
Done.

543
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,079
Let me have a look.

544
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,880
(1st day internship at hospital. All the best.)
Good.

545
00:29:53,415 --> 00:29:56,375
(1st day internship at hospital. All the best.)

546
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,425
(Zhuo Yifeng)

547
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:24,633
(What are you doing?)

548
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,523
(Discover)

549
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:32,531
(Zhuo Yifeng
1st day interning at hospital. All the best.)

550
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,959
Delicious.

551
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,040
You're in a good mood recently.

552
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,800
It's rare to get the internship.

553
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,640
Since I've got the chance,

554
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,359
I'll definitely work hard
and lift up my spirits.

555
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,199
How's it going between you and Su Muyun?

556
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,319
Haven't you reconciled yet?

557
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,719
Can you not mention him while eating?

558
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,640
You young people nowadays

559
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,479
love cold war so much.

560
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,160
It's so childish.

561
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,520
He ignored me first.

562
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,199
I didn't do anything wrong.

563
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
What about

564
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,079
I talk to him?

565
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,839
What do you want to do?

566
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
If you dare to look for him,

567
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,400
that will be the end of our friendship.

568
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm serious.

569
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,319
If he has the guts,

570
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,719
then don't show up forever.

571
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Such a devil.

572
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,599
I'll see how long you can stand it.

573
00:31:43,055 --> 00:31:44,375
(Emergency Station)

574
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,359
Doctor.

575
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,439
-What happened?
-Doctor, please save him.

576
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,040
-Traffic accident.
-Please save him.

577
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:51,880
Prepare for operation quick.

578
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,319
Xiao Feng, you join me too.

579
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,960
(Operating)

580
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:56,839
Doctor,

581
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:57,959
how's he?

582
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:58,959
We're sorry.

583
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,359
We've done our best.

584
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,880
Is it true?

585
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,439
How could it be true!

586
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,174
(Silence)

587
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,359
Let's go, Xiao Feng.

588
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,199
Doctor, how's it?

589
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,760
(Operating Room)
We failed to rescue them due to

590
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,160
heavy bleeding from the accident.

591
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,239
-Mum!
-Both patients have died.

592
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:13,764
(Su Muyun)

593
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,040
Hasn't Xiao Feng finished the night shift?

594
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,119
Why does she still need to work at day?

595
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,280
It must be an emergency.

596
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,199
That's how she is.

597
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:35,319
She'll forget to eat when she's busy.

598
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,760
Women like us are the most awesome.

599
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,680
We could have earned a living with our look.

600
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,640
But we choose to work hard instead.

601
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
(Inpatient Department)

602
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,040
Here.

603
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,920
Why do you look so pale?

604
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,560
I'll get some hot water for you.

605
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Wait for me.

606
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,320
Came across emergency patient again?

607
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,520
Didn't sleep the whole night?

608
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,320
I'm sorry.

609
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,439
I'm not in a good mood today.

610
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,919
Why are you crying?

611
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,840
What happened?

612
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:38,560
Xiao Feng,

613
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,479
why don't you take a day off today?

614
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,520
Rest for a day.

615
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm fine.

616
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,080
I'm just exhausted.

617
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,040
Thanks for the breakfast.

618
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,360
I'll treat you to a meal

619
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,800
on my rest day.

620
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,040
Forget it.

621
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,520
It's better to

622
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:14,840
sleep more on your rest day.

623
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,600
What's wrong with you two lately?

624
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:19,679
Why are you both so weak?

625
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,040
How's he

626
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,520
lately?

627
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:29,040
Not so good.

628
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,919
He's unable

629
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,760
to get investment for his project.

630
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,959
That's not right.

631
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,520
Didn't he manage
to get the investment a while ago?

632
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,320
The boss of that company

633
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,840
is Ouyang Qingxue's uncle.

634
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:44,199
She wants something else.

635
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,439
What a great opportunity.

636
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,719
That's right.

637
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Although Ouyang Qingxue

638
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,560
is not so beautiful as me,

639
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
she looks good too, right?

640
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,919
Look, the key is that

641
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,679
he can save ten-year efforts.

642
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,679
I did a rough calculation for him.

643
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,719
He'd lost at least

644
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,080
hundreds of millions.

645
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:10,959
Really?

646
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,399
Definitely.

647
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:14,080
What a chaste man

648
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,639
who is desperate for love.

649
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,679
I feel sorry for him too.

650
00:36:17,879 --> 00:36:19,840
He's been working so hard on this project.

651
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,199
He even had stomachache again.

652
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
Stomachache? When did it happen?

653
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:25,879
Was it serious?

654
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,639
Has he got cured at the hospital?

655
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,280
You're worried about him?

656
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,800
Just asking.

657
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,199
It's occupational habit.

658
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,639
Don't worry.

659
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,679
I've asked him to get to the hospital.

660
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,639
Which hospital?

661
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,959
I think it's this one.

662
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,199
Since you are an intern here,

663
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:47,439
why not look for him at the
Gastroenterology Department when you're free?

664
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,639
I think it's better to just forget it.

665
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,879
Thanks for today.

666
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,639
I'll be back on my duty.

667
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,280
Alright. Go back now.

668
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,439
-Just get back.
-Thank you.

669
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,439
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

670
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,199
Come in.

671
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Hi, Dr Chen.

672
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:12,679
I'd like to know

673
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:14,679
the condition of patient Su Muyun.

674
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,439
Su Muyun?

675
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:18,560
Sounds familiar.

676
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,120
I have a deep impression on him.

677
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,919
He's tall and handsome.

678
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,239
He's your...

679
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,760
What's your relationship with him?

680
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,040
He's

681
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,639
my...

682
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,120
Your boyfriend?

683
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,080
You young people nowadays

684
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,199
put work before life.

685
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,159
You should take good care of him.

686
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,879
Alright, got it.

687
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,879
How's his condition?

688
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,760
I'll check it for you. Don't worry.

689
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,239
Here.

(Inpatient Medical Records)

691
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,879
You...

692
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,040
Go and lie down on the sofa immediately.

693
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,239
Alright.

694
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,399

696
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,159

701
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,360
The meat is cooked soft.

702
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,800
It's better for digestion.

703
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,800
You just started your business

704
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,479
and got yourself ill.

705
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,479
You're really something.

706
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,080
Don't eat so fast.

707
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:07,959
That's why your stomach hurts.

708
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,760
Such a nag.

709
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:14,000
You really should cherish my nagging.

710
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,840
I love it when you nag me.

711
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,080
I heard it from Dr Chen that

712
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
you will get stomach ulcer

713
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,600
if you don't take good care of yourself again.

714
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,120
I'll set the alarm for you.

715
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,840
Remember to take your medicine on time.

716
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,479
How did you know which doctor had treated me?

717
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,280
Are you concerned about me?

718
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,199
It is

719
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,840
just a guess, alright?

720
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,840
Last night, a patient died

721
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,120
even after we tried our best

722
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,719
to save him the whole night.

723
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:10,320
So

724
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,040
our life is the most important.

725
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,600
Got it?

726
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,879
Are you

727
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:27,199
all right?

728
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,479
Why didn't you call me

729
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,800
when you encountered such situation?

730
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,479
It's you who gave me silence treatment.

731
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:36,719
It's your fault.

732
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,959
I'll eat properly.

733
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:53,199
I won't lose my temper.

734
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:55,919
Don't be angry.

735
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,679
Alright?

736
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:01,919
I'll just forgive you

737
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:04,399
since you're sick.

738
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,159
I'm leaving.

739
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,479
I'm taking these potato chips away.

740
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,439
You can't eat them now.

741
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,800
Don't waste them.

742
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,879
What a glutton.

743
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,360
Do you understand what gratitude is?

744
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,679
Besides, I was the one who bought them.

745
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
There's porridge in the pot.
Remember to eat it tomorrow.

746
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,040
You don't have to see me out.

747
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm not.

748
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,760
I just want to close the door.

749
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,080
I'll spare your life

750
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:00,479
since you're sick.

751
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:12,919
Su Muyun,

752
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:15,320
Whatever the difficulties are,

753
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:18,199
I believe you can overcome them.

754
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Fighting! You're the best.

755
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,280

756
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,120
