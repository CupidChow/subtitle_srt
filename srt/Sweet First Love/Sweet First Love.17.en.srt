I wasn't feeling well just now.

27
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:04,279
I'm feeling much better now.

28
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,519
I've taken the medicine.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Where does it hurt? How are you feeling?

30
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,919
Are you feeling better?
Has the doctor had checked?

31
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,240
You have too many questions.

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,919
The doctor has come over.

33
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,080
It's fine.

34
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,479
The research and development
of the drug will start next week.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,559
I will definitely find a way to cure you.

How are things between you and Su Muyun?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,279
I've heard it from Liu Zihui

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,880
that there's a huge drama.

42

What?

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
She's talking nonsense.

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
Nothing happened.

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,559
Actually,

46
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,679
you like him, right?

47
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,880
I don't know either.

48
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,240
We are too close to each other.

49
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
I don't know

50
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,360
what kind of feeling I have for him.

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,919

Don't push too hard on yourself.

54
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,320
If your parents were still alive,

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,399
they'd want you to be happy as well.

56
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,399
Look.

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,960
It is called Strong Pig.

58
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,360
Is it amazing? Give me some good words.

59
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,160
You are talented.

60

61
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,919
Stop talking about me.

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,720
The most important thing for you

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,520
is to stay in a happy mood.

64

you have grown up.

67

Please peel it for me.

69
00:03:58,559 --> 00:03:59,440
Sure.

do so much for her?

79

Disgusting.

However crafty she is,

83
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,160
she will be cast out

00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,919
You don't like them?

174
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,559
I never liked French food.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,119
Why did you order so much then?

176
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,400
I like to order much to make the table full.

177
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,640
It looks nice.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,359
You don't like it?

179
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,479
I...

180
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you angry?

181
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,159
Don't bother me next time then.

182
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,359
I'm not.

183
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,960
It's fine if you're happy.

184
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,280
I'll eat everything here.

185
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Bill, please.

186
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Sir, the total is

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
2,680 CNY.

188
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,840
Cash or card?

189
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
By card.

190
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,280
2,680 CNY.

191
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,799
Sir, your card.

192
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,239
Thank you.

193

Remaining Balance, 1.2 CNY)

194
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
Lucky me.

195
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:58,119
Thank you.

196
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:08,159
Let me send you home.

197
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,679
How?

198
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,359
I'm not riding a bike.

199
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,840
Let's call a cab then.

200
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,880
It's fine.

201
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,159
I came here today

202
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,039
only to let you know it.

203
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,080
We are not meant for each other.

204
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,320
Why?

205
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,880
Can't you see it?

206
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,479
I'm pretentious and not a caring person.

207
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:28,919
I spend money irresponsibly

208
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,159
and I'm extravagant.

209
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,320
It's fine.

210
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:32,799
I can accept all of these.

211
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,479
The main problem is

212
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,719
I don't like you.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,640
Please don't bother me again, okay?

214
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,400
Also,

215
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,919
thanks for your flowers.

216
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,599
Sir, are you looking for me?

217
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,640
Thomas sent this over.

218
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,080
The project research and development data.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,119
Okay, I'll translate it immediately.

220
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,919
Let Zhuo Yifeng do it.

221
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,000
It's better to let her familiarize herself

222
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,400
with the project content.

223
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,119
But I'm the one who used to...

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,359
Get them translated in a week.

225
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,239
I don't need a week.

226
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,159
What do you mean?

227
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,479
Four days.

228
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,400
No.

229
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,679
Three days. I can get everything done.

230
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,520
Really?

231
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:17,640
Don't worry.

232
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
I will do my best.

(Manual of Cardiovascular Medicine)

234
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,320
Look at my makeup today.

235
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,000
Isn't it suitable for this season?

236
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,559
So, you have to remember.

237
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:35,119
In the weather like this,

238
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,520
we have to use a light orange eye shadow

239
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,400
and nude lipstick.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,400
Could you please stop it?

241
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,840
I won't give up.

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
I will overcome any obstacle

243
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,679
no matter how tough it is.

244
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,919
I'm impressed by your courage

245
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,320
to bring about your own destruction.

246
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,400
Don't regret it.

247
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,719
I'll stick to my word.

248
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,280
Why are you still sitting there?

249
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm going shopping.

250
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm buying a purse.

251
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:13,599
Are you coming?

252
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,039
Let's go.

253
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,880
Let's go. I'll buy you anything you want.

254
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,880
Hello. Welcome.

255
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
These are the latest products of the season.

256
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
How does this look?

257
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,039
Not bad. It's very cute.

258
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,359
You don't like it?

259
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,520
What about this?

260
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,520
Not bad too. Very ladylike.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,239
You don't like it as well?

262
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,559
Why don't you try this?

263
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,960
It's our latest product.

264
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,239
How is it?

265
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,320
Looks a bit too matured.

266
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,719
You don't like it?

267
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,000
No.

268
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,200
I'll take it.

269
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,119
All right.

270
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,440
Sir.

271
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,119
I've translated these documents.

272
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,359
I've sorted out some questions

273
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:42,640
according to the patients' cases.

274
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,479
I hope they can be helpful to the project.

275
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
Also,

276
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,280
judging from the current information we have,

277
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I think magnesium tartrate is

278
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,200
the key breakthrough of this experiment.

279
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,559

281

Okay.

I will do my best. Thank you, sir.

283

I'm coming.

284
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:26,982
Good news for you.

285

The medication experiment is starting soon.

286
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:29,760

in artificial intelligence as well?

290

Su Muyun was here.

291
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,040
This is the bribe he gave me.

292
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,040
Why was he here?

293
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,880
If it was in the past,

294
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,359
he'd never bring a gift to visit me.

295
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,439
Exactly.

296
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,319
Actually,

297
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,880
I can feel that

298
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,959
he has changed a lot for you.

299
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,839
He really cares about you.

300
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,119
Are you really my friend?

301
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,239
Why are you helping him?

302
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,280
You are my only friend.

303

That is why

304
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,276
I want to help you to overcome the trauma

so you can start a new life.

307
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,199
Otherwise,

308
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,839
I'd be worried about you

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
in the afterlife.

310
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't talk nonsense.

this purse is worth?

331

This is a gift from Lin Di.

I don't think you should sell it.

I think Lin Di is quite nice.

340
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,560
You shouldn't

341

treat him like this.

345
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,000
if I don't pretend to be poor.

346
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,800
Fine.

347
00:20:35,439 --> 00:20:36,119
I'm leaving.

348
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,079
Bye.

349
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,719
I'm leaving, Su Muyun.

350
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,319
I'll get going, Lin Di.

351
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:42,280
Bye.

352
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,359
Bye.

353
00:20:46,439 --> 00:20:47,439
I decided

354
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,920
to sell off

355
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,560
my sneakers

356
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,880
and yeezys.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,880
Help me to sell them.

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,160
(Liu Zihui)
Studying hard at the library with Xiao Feng.

359
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,400
Those are limited editions.

360
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Have you lost your mind?

361
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:03,439
I used my mom's credit card

362
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,119
in order to buy a gift for Liu Zihui.

363
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,760
If she found out about it,

364
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,040
I'd...

365
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,359
What an infatuated poor man!

366
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,040
By the way,

367
00:21:16,206 --> 00:21:17,326
if you find any part-time jobs,

368
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:18,672
let me know.

369
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,959
She must be the Helen of Troy.

370
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,239
Who are you talking about?

371
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Who else but her?

372
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,400
Who are you talking about?

373
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,160
Her.

374
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,439
Why is she the Helen of Troy?

375
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,119
She is.

376
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,359
-Why can't I say so?
-Of course you can't.

377
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,640
What's wrong if I say so?

378
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,119
I won't allow it.

379
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,199
-I'm telling the truth.
-Don't you dare say so.

380
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,881
(Hello! Can you sell it at 500 CNY?)

381
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,640
This guy must be crazy.

382
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
A retard asked me
if I'd sell it for 500 CNY.

383
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,640
Why are you here?

384
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
I'm passing by.

385
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,599
I'll leave both of you alone.

386
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
Liu Zihui.

387
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,719
Lin Di sold all his sneakers

388
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,719
in order to buy a purse for you.

389
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,199
What does it have anything to do with me?

390
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,959
I'm just telling you about it.

391
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,640
Hello, is there anything I can help you?

392
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,719
I want a refund.

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,880
Sure.

394
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,040
Hey.

395
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,760
Where is Lin Di staying?

396
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,719
N104.

397
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,640
Thank you.

398
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,880
( Postgraduate students' dormitory)

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,160
What are you doing?

400
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
What are you doing?

401
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,119
I have something to ask you.

402
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,280
Turn around.

403
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,560
Turn around.

404
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,760
Where's Lin Di?

405
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,119
You've harmed him enough.

406
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,359
I'm asking you, where is Lin Di?

407
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,199
He is working at Children's Palace.

408
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,119
He didn't attend
weekend practice because of you.

409
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:02,119
Great, here.

410
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,880
Play on your own for now.

411
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,959
-All right.
-Here.

412
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,640
What's wrong? Are you angry?

413
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,640
You are a man.

414
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,920
Be patient. Don't cry.

415
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,680
Let me practice with you, all right?

416
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,640
All right.

417
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,640
Let me tell you.

418
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:31,199
In this world, crying

419
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,040
is the most useless thing to do.

420
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,520
Don't be like your mother being a trash.

421
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,239
Come on.

422
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,839
Take aim.

423
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,640
Play on your own.

424
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,400
Why are you here?

425
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,839
You will be a good father in the future.

426
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:10,079
Definitely.

427
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,839
This is the money for the purse.

428
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,920
We'll split the bill for the meal.

429
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:18,560
The purse is a gift and the meal is my treat.

430
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,760
I don't want your money.

431
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,119
Just take it.

432
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,680
Stop talking nonsense.

433
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,800
Although I'm a student

434
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,160
and my ability is limited,

435
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,599
I'll try my best

436
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,800
to give you anything you want.

437
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm serious

438
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,760
about you.

439
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,160
Stop boasting.

440
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:39,560
Go back to your class.

441
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,599
I'm telling you the truth.

442
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Teacher Lin, she is so nasty.

443
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,920
Nonsense, she is very cute.

444
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,239
Is she your girlfriend?

445
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,760
My future girlfriend.

446
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,680
Zhuo Yifeng, come with me to the airport.

447
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,839
Thomas' flight will be here soon.

448
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,680
I have some trouble riding in a car.

449
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,359
Don't you think you should
find a more convincing excuse?

450
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
Haven't you been

451
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,599
focusing on Thomas' project?

452
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,680
Isn't it too late

453
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,000
to escape now?

454
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,479
Are you coming with me or not?

455
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,400
Yes.

456
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,680
What are you waiting for? Get on.

457
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,719
We'll be late.

458
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,319
Zhuo Yifeng.

459
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,640
Get me a pen.

460
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,319
Zhuo Yifeng, are you all right?

461
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,439
Zhuo Yifeng!

462
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,119
Zhuo Yifeng!

463
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,479

(Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University,
Inpatient Department)

465
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,719
Are you feeling better?

466
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,119
Why are you here?

467
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,119
It will send me your location

468
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,359
when you are in danger.

469
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,880
Have I interrupted your class?

470
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,319
To me,

471
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,760
you are the most important.

472
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,520
Honey.

473
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,079
We don't have to be there.

474
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,719
Xiao Yun is taking care of her anyway.

475
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,319
No, I have to see her.

476
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,800
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

477
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,640
We have to think about her.

478
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
She'd be unhappy if she sees us.

479
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,079
I'll just take a peek.

480
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,479
We can leave

481
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,160
when I see that she's fine.

482
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,959
Don't...

483
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,160
Come on!

484
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,199
That's too much.

485
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,479
How can I finish them?

486
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,520
You wanted porridge.

487
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,319
But I realized

488
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:21,520
I didn't know what you liked
when I was buying.

489
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,520
I like this one.

490
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,119
Remember it.

491
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,160
I...

492
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,319
My arms are good. You don't have to...

493
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,599
You can't reject me.

494
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,160
I've had enough.

495
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:43,760
We'd better leave.

496
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,760
All right.

497
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:54,520
Have a good rest.

498
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,439
I'll accompany you here.

The reason why girls have mood swings.

500
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,479
One,

501
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,520
she is testing your resolve.

502
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,400
Two, she's playing hard to get.

503
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
Three,

504
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,719
she doesn't like you.

505
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,800
Four,

506
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,800
she likes you too much.

(Starred)

509
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,119
Look at this too.

510
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,040
Sure.

511
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,473
(The reason why girls have mood swings.)

512
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,880
What's going on?

513
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,959
What a rare occurrence!

514
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
It's an advertisement.

515
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,920
Although my experiment results

516
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,640
are a bit lower than you,

517
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,239
I'm a professional

518
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,280
when it comes to winning a girl's heart.

519
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,199
Handsome, I'm setting off.

520
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,400
Wait for me.

521
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,959
How's it?

522
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,520
Can I have a trial lesson?

523
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
That's an original technique I created.

524
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:17,800
9.0.

525
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,160
Can you show a bit of sincerity?

526
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,400
I'll write your experiment report.

527
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
You also have to put in

528
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,959
some good words for me to the professor.

529
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,479
So I'd be

530
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,199
smarter, better and stronger

531
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,439
in the professor's eyes.

532
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,239
I don't do something that's impossible.

533
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,199
Then...

534
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,479
can you let the professor be fair towards me?

535
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,599
Deal.

536
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,760
Yes!

537
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,857
(Inpatient Department)

538
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,400
(Microsoft Word has stopped working)
My document is corrupted.

539
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,920
Take a look for me.

540
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
First, you have to praise her

541
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,760
so that she thinks that

542
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,199
she is the best in your heart.

543
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,760
It crashed.

544
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,800
You are so great.

545
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,760
How am I great?

546
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,520
You are the best

547
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,520
in my heart.

548
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,280
I...

549
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:25,400
I've written these 30,000 words for nothing.

550
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,560
How could you mock me?

551
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,959
I hate you.

552
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,160
Second.

553
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
Girls like a bossy guy.

554
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,439
You have to know

555
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,680
her wish accurately.

556
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,040
You have to insist

557
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,400
no matter how she rejects you.

558
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Fulfil her wishes wildly.

559
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,800
What are you doing?

560
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,959
Let me go.

561
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,479
Where are you bringing me?

562
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,199
Put me down.

563
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,719
Put me down.

564
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,880
Why did you bring me out here?

565
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,359
Look, there are so many mosquitoes.

566
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:01,439
I was bitten everywhere.

567
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,040
You are so cruel.

568
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:04,000
I thought you wanted to come out

569
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,319
since you've kept looking out the window.

570
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,160
I don't want to come out.

571
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,199
Then...

572
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,639
I'm thinking that

573
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,199
the cloud looks like a crawfish.

574
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:14,959
Thirdly,

575
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,800
it's very important to give gifts.

576
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,159
Many guys give something useless

577
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,760
like flowers.

578
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:22,479
They are pointless and cliche.

579
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,040
You have to give something useful.

580
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,800
She will feel that

581
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,719
you are a practical man.

582
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,080
Are they useful?

583
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,760
Do you like them?

584
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,600
Can you ask me what I want

585
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,560
before giving me a gift?

586
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,719
What do you like?

587
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,840
Flowers.

588
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,639
Where are you?

589
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,639
I'll be there soon.

590
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:04,320
I wore a very cute polka dot dress.

591
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,919
I'm behind you.

592
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,800
You fool.

593
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:44,879
Xiao Feng.

594
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,120
Why are you here?

595
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:49,560
What are you doing here?

596
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,439
Xiao Feng is hospitalized.
I'm here to visit her.

597
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Why are you nervous?

598
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,760
She needs no visits.

599
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,959
You'll have a nightmare. Leave now.

600
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,959
Xiao Feng.

601
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,679
He is chasing me away.

602
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,919
Sit down.

603
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,399
How are you?

604
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,760
I'm fine.

605
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:07,360
It's his fault. This lunatic.

606
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,840
He forced me to stay for another week.

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,159
Why do you need another week?

608
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,840
You will endanger the society.

609
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,959
You...

610
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,360
Get out.

611
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,879
Get out.

612
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,040
Calm down for a while.

613
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,159
That's how he acts. Don't mind him.

614
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,919
I won't.

615
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,760
He's afraid that I'll steal you away from him.

616
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,919
Are you joking?

617
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,600
I'm not.

618
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,360
I've heard it from his classmates

619
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,439
that he didn't finish his graduation paper

620
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,159
in order to make that watch for you.

621
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
If he delays any longer,

622
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,199
it might even affect

623
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,560
his own graduation results.

624
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,439
Really?

625
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,159
To him,

626
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,520
nothing else is important

627
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,479
besides you.

628
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,600
Why are you here?

629
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,439
The tangerines that Qin Yao bought are sweet.

630
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,719

is not what you think...

658
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,000
Mr. Ouyang.

659
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,560
I have some good news for you.

660
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,479
Thomas found a breakthrough

661
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,000
with the information you've sorted.

662
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:07,360
The experiment for

663
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:08,840
the first batch of medicine will start soon.

664
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,120
Really?

665
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
That's great.

666
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,879
How about you?

667
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,479
I'm fine.

668
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,199
I'll back to work as soon as possible.

669
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,199
All right.

670
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,360
Mr. Ouyang told me

671
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,040
the medicine development was very successful.

672
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,919
Le Diyin can be cured.

673
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,040
Well, you were trying to...

674
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
I have to tell this news

675
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,159
to Le Diyin immediately.

676
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,159
When can I be a priority

677
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,520
in your heart?

678
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,520
It's Lv Yang Chun tea,
a speciality of Yangzhou.

679
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
It tastes nice.

680
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,000
Give it a try back home.

681
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,280
I've heard a lot

682
00:39:50,479 --> 00:39:52,719
about the famous Yangzhou tea.

683
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,800
Thanks a lot.

684
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,639
Then,

685
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,679
I'm counting on you

686
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:01,840
as to the research and
development of the medicine.

687
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:05,679
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

688
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,919
All right?

689
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:10,080
Bye.

690
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,120
Bye.

691
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:50,520
Brother.

692
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,679
I've told you.

693
00:40:51,879 --> 00:40:53,639
You're not allowed to be with her.

694
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,000
Brother.

695
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,760
Do you know that

696
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,560
father is very unhappy about you

697
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:04,919
investing in Thomas' project?

698
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,399
I don't have to explain to you

699
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,399
about my business decisions.

700
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,080
Business?

701
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,320
Are you telling me that

702
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:14,959
you didn't invest in this project

703
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,600
because of that girl?

704
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,439
I did it for the Ouyang family.

705
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,679
You are still trying to help her in the end.

706
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,840
Brother.

707
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,679
What do you see in her?

708
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,520
She is not good enough for you.

709
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,439
