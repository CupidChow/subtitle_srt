It doesn't matter. Just cling to me.

00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,039
Excuse me.

32
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,320
Where is ward 213?

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
Over there.

34
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,479
Thank you.

35
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,360
You are welcome.

36
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,199
Hello. Excuse me,

37
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,240
is this Le Diyin's ward?

38
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,559
Yes. I am his father.

39
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello, uncle. I am his classmate.

40
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,639
How is he?

41
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:57,399
They just resuscitated him.
He's still unconscious.

42
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,800
Luckily, he's alive.

43
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,119
That's good.

44
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,600
You are Su Nianfeng, right?

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,679
How do you know me?

46
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,160
Have a seat.

47
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,720
Xiao Yin always mentioned about you.

48
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,399
Because of his illness,

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
he rarely had any friends since young.

50
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,919
Ever since he met you,

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,960
he has become so much more optimistic.

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
Thank you.

53
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,479
Actually, me too.

54
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,759
But I wonder

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,600
what illness does he have?

56
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,080
He's never mentioned it to me.

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,559
Is it very serious?

58
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,320
Dilated cardiomyopathy.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,479
Excuse me.

60
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,839
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,399
Why don't you attend
the PE class?

62
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,399
Rest is good for life.

63
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,919
No wonder he never attended the PE class.

64
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,279
No wonder he always looked so tired.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,000
And he often had to take a deep breath.

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,479
It's because

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,000
he has a weak heart.

68
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,559
Can't he undergo a surgery?

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,519
His heart's condition is too complicated.

70
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,359
All doctor suggested surgery was not an option.

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,839
They can only give him
conservative treatment now.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Now, every day that he's alive

73
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,679
is a blessing for us.

74
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,200
Le Diyin is at ward 213.

75
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,440
I ordered a pair of slippers for you.

76
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,040
Wait outside for a while.

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
Hello, are you Mr. Su Muyun?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
-Yes.
-This is what you've ordered.

79
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:45,959
Thank you.

80
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,239
Have some porridge.

81
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,679
Listen to me.

82
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,160
We don't need another patient.

83
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,160
He's awake.

84
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll call the nurse.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,799
You are awake. How do you feel?

86
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,600
Do you feel unwell?

87
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,959
Why are you here?

88
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Your father has gone to handle
your hospitalisation procedures.

89
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
He will be back soon.

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,399
If you feel unwell,

91
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:51,359
tell me. I'll get the doctor.

92
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:54,679
I'm fine. Don't worry.

93
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,679
You should've told me.

94
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,640
Aren't we best friends?

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,239
It's because we are best friends

96
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,000
that I can't tell you.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,200
If I tell you about it,

98
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,359
it'll only bring you distress

99
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,959
and afflictions.

100
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,399
Have you gone through

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,880
such emergencies many times already?

102
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,679
When I was ten,

103
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,079
the doctors told me I wouldn't live long.

104
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,839
It'll be Xiao Yin's birthday tomorrow.

105
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,279
Let's hold a birthday party for him.

106
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,839
Okay.

107
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
It might

108
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,799
be his last birthday.

109
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,799
Let's buy him the biggest

110
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,519
and the best cake.

111
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,160
Actually, I have a secret too.

112
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,559
I always have nightmare.

113
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,920
And that nightmare is always the same.

114
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:53,559
Same nightmare?

115
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,200
I've read a lot of medical books about it.

116
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,359
They say that it's caused by
post-traumatic amnesia.

117
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,239
I don't remember my childhood.

118
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,279
And I don't remember my biological parents.

119
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,519
I don't know why.

120
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,359
And I'm very afraid to get into a car.

121
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,200
So many times

122
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,880
it might be better

123
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,399
if you don't know the truth.

124
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,959
But I want to know it.

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,920
That's why I want to study medicine

126
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,600
to unravel this mystery.

127
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,160
But,

128
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,040
dream doesn't always come true.

129
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,160
My grades are not that good.

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
Look at me.

131
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,640
I was nearly dead

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,359
for so many times.

133
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,239
But I'm still alive.

134
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,760
So,

135
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,000
as long as you persevere,

136
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,839
miracle will happen.

137
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Are you okay now?

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,880
I've already asked the nurse.

139
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,440
You can have some liquid food.

140
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
You need to eat something.

141
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:08,720
Thank you.

142
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,119
This is for him. Why are you thanking me?

143
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,799
Eat your porridge now.

144
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,200
Su Nianfeng.

145
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,599
I'll warn you one last time. Stop laughing.

146
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,159
Do you like the slippers I bought for you?

147
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,359
Shut up.

148
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,200
These are the only slippers available
in nearby shops.

149
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,039
Just put up with them for a while, okay?

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,039
Su Nianfeng.

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,039
Stop taking photo.

152
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,840
No!

153
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
Delete it now!

154
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,719
No.

155
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,039
Delete it.

156
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,159
It's until just now that I realized

157
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,559
you actually look so handsome.

158
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,919
So pretty.

159
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,559
You look like a model

160
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:39,960
in Paris fashion show

161
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
even with these slippers on.

162
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,520
So dishy.

163
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,239
I must have saved

164
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,640
the whole galaxy

165
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
to have such an attractive brother like you.

166
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,159
Where did you find

167
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,640
your long-lost aesthetic?

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,080
From garbage bin in the hospital?

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
No matter what,

170
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,919
I'm a cultured and good person.

171
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,280

339
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,160
the Yellow River seawards flows.

340
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,160
You will enjoy a grander sight

341
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,959
Stand straight and raise your head.

342
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,839
by climbing to a greater height.

343
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:50,280
You will enjoy a grander sight
by climbing to a greater height.

344
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,119
You will enjoy a grander sight

345
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,400
Have some breakfast.

346
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,839
You want to eat it?

347
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,920
A mouthful of burger means much fat on me.

348
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,280
This will only make me fat.

349
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:16,520
No.

350
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Hurry up and eat it up.

351
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
Don't waste your time.

352
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,959
I haven't cooked for you for a long time.

353
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,280
You realized it. Not bad.

354
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Le Diyin.

355
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
Doctor said that you had to rest more.

356
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,800
Reading is bad for your health.

357
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,160
Tomorrow will be the school anniversary.

358
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,520
How's your recital?

359
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,040
Now, I can't wait the school anniversary.

360
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,280
So I don't need

361
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,079
the training hell of the devil.

362
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,239
With his help,

363
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,079
you'll be fine on the stage tomorrow.

364
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
He's too much.

365
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,640
He dragged me to the field

366
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,680
to exercise vocal cords before dawn.

367
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,160
It's just a school anniversary,
not the New Year Gala.

368
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,119
Don't blame him.

369
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,599
I think that's

370
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,280
because he likes you.

371
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,400
What? He likes me?

372
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
We are siblings.

373
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:24,400
Let me get you some warm water.

374
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,959
You need more water.

375
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,839
You are not blood relations anyway.

376
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,160
So what?

377
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,959
Stop.

378
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,719
What are you doing?

379
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,680
Your neck is so thick.

380
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,839
Don't you feel choked?

381
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,319
That's enough!

382
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,199
It's the school's anniversary.

383
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,359
It's best to wear the school uniform.

384
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,439
No! I'm rebelling!

385
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,359
It suits you well.

386
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,800
My brother insisted I wear
school uniform with bare face.

387
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
I hate him.

388
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,880
Don't worry.

389
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,479
I'll transform you into a fairy soon.

390
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,479
Let's go.

391
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,359
I'm already used to it.

392
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,400
I'm always the fish on his chopping board.

393
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,400
Liu Zihui.

394
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,359
Your make-up today looks quite delicate.

395
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
It suits you a lot.

396
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,719
Su Nianfeng.
I think the colour of this lipstick

397
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,560
suits you quite well.

398
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,760
A school uniform for the naturalism recital.

399
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,640
It suits you.

400
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,119
What are you talking about?

401
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,560
What do you mean by that?

402
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,719
Forget it.

403
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:41,520
Where's the script? Let's take a look.

404
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,560
It's here.

405
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,719
Girls.

406
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,479
Officials from the Ministry of Education

407
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,760
will join our school's anniversary today.

408
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
No make-ups.

409
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,479
Change your outfits too.

410
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,760
Make-up is forbidden.

411
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,359
Hurry up!

412
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,160
I just did my make-up!

413
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
Hurry up!

414
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,839
We are out of time! Calm down!

415
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:10,439
I really envy you for
having such a troublesome brother.

416
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:19,839
I really envy you.
You look the same even with make-up.

417
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,319
What is wrong with her?

418
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,439
Forget it. I'm fine.

419
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:28,160
Listen to me.
I won't let her off the hook so easily today.

420
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,160
Stop.

421
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,520
-What are you wearing?
-Sir.

422
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,079
Change it!

423
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,239
Here. Put it on.

424
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,199
Thank you.

425
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,839
Do you think I can put on

426
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,119
some matte eyeshadow now?

427
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,239
Not bad.

428
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,680
Is it going to make you look like
you are not wearing make-up?

429
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,320
Why are you here?

430
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,680
You are not performing anyway.

431
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,920
I brought him here.

432
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:04,920
Are you ready?

433
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,199
Yes.

434
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,319
Let's do a rehearsal.

435
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,359
Adversity is the flame from which
the phoenix resurrects.

436
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,239
Adversity is the sand that...

437
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,079
You haven't memorized it?

438
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,719
A recital requires no recitation.

439
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,239
That's right.

440
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,239
Where's my script?

441
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,280
It's gone?

442
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,520
Mine is gone too.

443
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,479
(Let Your Dream Fly, Youth)
Next is a duet recitation,

444
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,400
with Liu Zihui and Su Nianfeng as performers.

445
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,239
I have your script.

446
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,079
Why do you have one?

447
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,680
Because I wrote it for her.

448
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,439
What about me?

449
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,520
Don't panic yet.

450
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,839
Think about it carefully.

451
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
When is the last time

452
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,040
you see it?

453
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,520
Where did you see it?

454
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,280
The last time.

455
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,520
Inside the make-up room.

456
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,079
Liu Zihui, Su Nianfeng.

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,599
What are you doing?

458
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:09,479
It's your turn.

459
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,560
I...

460
00:26:10,719 --> 00:26:11,520
What should I do?

461
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,599
Hurry up!

462
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,000
Good day, my fellow teachers and students.

463
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:34,479
I am Liu Zihui.

464
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280
I am Su Nianfeng.

465
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:40,119
We'll give you a recital show today.

466
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,400
The title is,

467
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,079
Adversity is The Precious Gift of Life.

468
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,520
If you've never experienced
the gale and snow in winter,

469
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,119
you'll never understand
the joy of harvest in autumn.

470
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
If you've never borne with the biting wind,

471
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
you'll never be as tough as the cypress.

472
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,479
Adversity is the flame from which

473
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
the phoenix resurrects.

474
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:39,000
Adversity is the sand that
forms the pearls in shells.

475
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,839
Sima...

476
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
Si...

477
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,560
Sima...

478
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,239
How can she recite like this?

479
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,000
When we talk about adversity,

480
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,079
we often think of Sima Qian.

481
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,439
But he was from more than 2,000 years ago.

482
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,880
His life is too far away from us.

483
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,160
Today, I want to share with you

484
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
a story of mine.

485
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,040
My grades are not good.

486
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,239
I'm common in every aspect.

487
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Nobody thinks that I'll do well in
the College Entrance Examination.

488
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,839
I always doubt myself too.

489
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,920
A few days ago,
I found out that my friend...

490
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:29,520
He has dilated cardiomyopathy.

491
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,439
Since young,

492
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,520
for so many times he was nearly dead.

493
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,920
But he's still doing his best
to stay alive now.

494
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,560
He told me that

495
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,719
as long as I could persevere,

496
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,040
miracle would happen.

497
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:48,760
After that, my brother
asked me to watch a movie.

498
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:51,079
There's a line in the movie

499
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,760
which I couldn't agree more.

500
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,239
Usually, it is the underdogs

501
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,560
who will achieve the impossible.

502
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,719
So, for me, adversity

503
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,160
is not a hardship.

504
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,920
It's a gift.

505
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,199
Only by facing adversity courageously

506
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,280
can we be able to find our better selves.

507
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,079
Thank you.

508
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:40,119
Good performance.

509
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,160
Your performance just now was so great.

510
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,680
It was awesome.

511
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,119
Not bad. Your training did not go to waste.

512
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,839
I can testify that

513
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:56,680
her performance was amazing just now.

514

Excuse me.

515
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

516
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,319
I got a little bit slim lately.

517
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,920

Don't you think that

519
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,719

This is your first mock test result.

523
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,800
What happened?

524
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,920
Did you neglect your studies
because of the performance?

525
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,560
If you don't work harder,

526
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,119
you might not go to a college.

527
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,719
Sir, do I have any hope to change?

528
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,599
Get prepared.

529
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,000
It'll be very hard to repeat the grade.

530

531

Mr. Li, you are looking for me?

534
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,040
You did very well in your exam this time.

535

537
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,959
Go back and reflect on yourself.

538
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,199
Thank you, sir.

539
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:10,920
Listen up,

540
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,439
go back and prepare a speech

541
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,800

542

Thank you, sir.

545

You are welcome.

546
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,319
I'll go back to my class then.

547
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,479
Is it a raging tempest?

548
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,239
How do you know that it's a tempest?

549
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,119
Maybe my results are not that bad.

550
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,079
Hop on first before blather.

551
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,839
It's because you always put me down

552
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,239
that I flunked in exam.

00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:16,719
Eat first. I'm going to visit Le Diyin.

677
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,159
Luckily, she didn't eat it.

678
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,760
Or else, she'd laugh at me.

679
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,159
You are here.

680
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,719
How are you feeling?

681
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,919
I'm feeling much better now.

682
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,800
I have good news and bad news.

683
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,800
Which one do you want to hear first?

684
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,679
I haven't heard any good news in a while.

685
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:03,000
Tell me good news so that
I can be happy about it too.

686
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,879
(Life Without Limits)

687
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
There's a hospital in United States

688
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,679
that can treat me.

689
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I've decided to go there.

690
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,439
Really? That's great!

691
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,919
But when are you going to go there?

692
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,239
This is the bad news
that I want to tell you.

693
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:26,439
I'm going to quit school in two days.

694
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:30,320
So, I won't be able to see you

695
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:32,320
for a long time?

696
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,520
Don't be upset.

697
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,239
We can video call each other.

698
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,959
We can talk through mails.

699
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:39,639
By the way,

700
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:41,679
I want to thank you

701
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,399
for your speech
during the school anniversary.

702
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,840
It has given me strength and encouragement.

703
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:47,159
You...

704
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,159
How did you know?

705
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,120
Your brother sent it to me.

706
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,360
When we talk about adversity,

707
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:02,479
we often think of Sima Qian.

708
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,840
But he was more than 2,000 years ago.

709
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,560
What are you doing?

710
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,040
The lamp is broken.

711
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,199
Well...

712
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
I'm not waiting for you.

713
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,159
The television is not turned on.

714
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:52,479
