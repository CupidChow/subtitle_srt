(Adapted from the novel
The Days When My Brother And I Live Together)

24
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,326
(Episode 8)

25
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,519
Which school is she from?

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,879
She should be expelled.
Stop putting Mingxian University to shame.

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,239
It's not true.

28
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,239
Snowball had a fracture. I was saving it.

29
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,760
Yes, we explained later on.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,319
I've asked the girl
to delete the video immediately.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,239
Why didn't she record
the part we're saving it?

32
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,639
This video

33
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,960
was edited.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,639
Someone did it on purpose.

35
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,600
I didn't offend anyone.

36
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,440
Who's this?

37
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,800
Su Nianfeng, is that you?

38
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:33,279
You look innocent and harmless.

39
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,839
But it turns out that you're just pretending.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,920
I've never thought that

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,919
you're such a psychopath to abuse cats.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
Please get out of Mingxian University.

43
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,039
Don't put shame on us.

44
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,679
You're the smear

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,440
of Mingxian University.

46
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,399
Turn off your phone for the time being.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,919
Don't go to crowded places.

48
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,039
I still have to go to school.

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,080
You should apply for leaves.

50
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,080
Or I'll send you to school and pick you up.

51
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,679
Safety first.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
She was wronged.

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,759
Why should she hide herself?

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,119
Will anyone come to look for trouble?

55
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,880
I won't get expelled, right?

56
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:13,720
What did all these happen to me?

57
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,440
There must be a way out.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,759
Let's record a video.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,720
Let's clarify everything to the netizens.

60
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,520
Let's show them the cat is very healthy now.

61
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:28,839
That'll do, right?

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,039
That's what happened.

63
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,399
I'll be taking care of Snowball
for the time being.

64
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
After it's healed,

65
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,360
I'll find a new home for it.

66
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,360
Thank you for your concern.

67
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,679
You're just trying to find an excuse
and hide the truth.

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,039
How dare her to clear her name?

69
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,880
Su Nianfeng doesn't look like

70
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
a girl who'd abuse animals.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,919
Don't judge a book by its cover.

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,800
Shame on you.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,199
Shame on you.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,279
Hang in there.

75
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,200
Everyone will forget about it soon.

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Everything will be fine.

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,480
Thank you.

78
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,720
She was wronged.

79
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,600
People will forget about it
as the time goes by.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
But she was still wronged.

81
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,200
Let's go home.

82
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
You better

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,959
stay away from me in campus.

84
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't want you to get involved.

85
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,640
You can go home yourself.

86
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,559
If I don't protect you,
who else will protect you?

87
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,640
Will this work?

88
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,880
Just demonstrate the first-aid procedures

89
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,880
in this live broadcast

90
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,600
and restore the situation.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's give it a try.

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,799
It's better than doing nothing, right?

93
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Come on.

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,640
It's recording now.

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,640
If your pet is suffering a bone fracture,

96
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,839
first, you have to stop the bleeding.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,760
Then, wipe the wound with alcohol.

98
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
Stop pretending. We won't believe in you.

99
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,320
It's obvious that this live broadcast
is planned by a team.

100
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,119
Are you taking this opportunity to
raise your popularity?

101
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,079
Are you Su Muyun's sister?

102
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,799
You're such a vicious girl.

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,760
It's okay.

104
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,559
Don't be afraid.

105
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,519
I won't let it happen again.

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,799
I promise.

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,399
Isn't she the one who abused the cat?

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,559
You've read the news.

109
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,519
Yes. I watched the video too.

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,239
This is a vicious event.

111
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,119
This is a serious matter.

112
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,079
What we should do is to face it.

113
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:34,679
Find a solution to it.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
If we want to prove that
Su Nianfeng is innocent,

115
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,359
we have to make it look serious.

116
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,760
Maybe we can make a documentary.

117
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,079
A documentary might help

118
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,640
to tell the truth to the public.

119
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
Trust me.

120
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
You must be brave.

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,399
I'll be by your side

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,959
no matter what happens.

123
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,600
There's

124
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,799
nothing much we can do for you.

125
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,119
Your sister is known as the cat abuser.

126
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,119
We'll get ourselves in troubles
if we defend for her.

127
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,640
Don't trick us into doing that.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Besides that, why should we help you?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Liu Zihui and Su Nianfeng are best friends.

130
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,279
Why are you bringing that up?

131
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,519
Liu Zihui told us that she's your girlfriend.

132
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,320
There's no way I'd be with Liu Zihui.

133
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,399
I'm in love with another girl.

134
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,440
Just think about it.

135
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,200
If you can step forward

136
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,880
at such a critical moment.

137
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,839
We're helping our mate.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
We can't sit on and watch
an innocent person be wronged, right?

139
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,279
I'll handle this.

140
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,079
Su Nianfeng is my classmate.

141
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,519
I trust her.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Su Nianfeng, I trust you.

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,920
The angel who saved the cat,

144
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,160
your name is cleared.

145
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,359
After I examined it carefully,

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,839
I sent Snowball to the hospital.

147
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,119
Su Muyun,

148
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,320
you're my lovely and caring brother.

149
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,839
Thank you.

150
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,519
I've got good news, someone wants
to adopt Snowball.

151
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,880
Snowball is so famous now.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,359
Many people come here just to see it.

153
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,440
Really?

154
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:18,239
Right.

155
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,200
It's not completely recovered yet.

156
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,399
You must apply medicine
to its wound every day.

157
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:23,959
And you've to put the calcium tablet

158
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,559
into its mouth every day.

159
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,119
Or else it'll spit out.

160
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,679
Since you care so much about it,

161
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,799
(We're hiring.)
you should come and work here.

162
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:33,840
Are you still hiring?

163
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,679
Yes.

164
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,359
The probation period is one week.

165
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,200
And you won't get paid.
Is that okay?

166
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,719
No one knows Snowball better than you do.

167
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,159
No problem.

168
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,840
All right.

169
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,119
I'll get the contract ready tomorrow.

170
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,359
Just come and sign it.

171
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,280
Thank you, Boss.

172
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,400
All right.

173
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,400
Boss,

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
I'd like a cup of latte.

175
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,280
All right.

176
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,479
I saw your documentary.

177
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,119
I'm glad that everyone believes in you.

178
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:05,479
You're wronged.

179
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm fine.

180
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,679
I want to thank you

181
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,359
for comforting me when no one believed in me.

182
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,520
It's okay. We're friends, aren't we?

183
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,679
We're friends?

184
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,320
I had a very good impression on you

185
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,280
when I first met you.

186
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,119
Let's meet up more in the future.

187
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,320
Of course.

188
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Here's your latte.

189
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,520
Thank you.

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,640
I've got to attend my class. Goodbye.

191
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,919
All right. Bye.

192
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,012
(The cat abuser from Mingxian University,
Su Nianfeng, is exposed.)

193
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,799
This little fairy

194
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,520
said she wanted to be my friends.

195
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,000
Stay away from her.

196
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,320
Why?

197
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,960
It's my intuition.

198
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,640
You're not a girl.

199
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,080
What do you know about sixth sense?

200
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000
It's cute, right?

201
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,320
Look at it.

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,400
It's delicious.

203
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,200
Thank you for your help in the video.

204
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,599
I've been meaning to thank you for that.

205
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,119
These dishes are expensive.

206
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,960
I usually don't eat.

207
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,000
You're a grateful and righteous person.

208
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,159
That's great!

209
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,119
Your dark circles are getting worse.

210
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,479
Is your brother acting up again?

211
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,880
No.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
Recently, I'm working in a cafe.

213
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,320
So I have to stay up late
to finish my assignments.

214
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,840
Little boy,

215
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,719
you can't cut a cat's whiskers.

216
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,479
They are protecting the cat.

217
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,359
So you can't cut them off, okay?

218
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,359
No. Return the scissors to me.

219
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,200
What are you doing?

220
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,919
Are you bullying my son?

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,880
What did you do to make him cry?

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
What's wrong with you?

223
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,039
You're a waitress.

224
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,719
I want to talk to your boss.

225
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,640
It's our fault.

227
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,880
Su Nianfeng, apologise to our customer now.

228
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,320
No.

229
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,359
Give it to me.

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,640
What's wrong with you?

231
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,799
-Hey.
-Little boy,

232
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Don't be sad.

233
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,799
Here are your scissors.

234
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
It's just a cat.

235
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,479
What harm can he do to the cat
by cutting off its whiskers?

236
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,679
It'll grow back in a few days.

237
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,479
That's right. Mind your own business.

238
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,119
What's wrong with you?

239
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
Baby, let's go back.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
-The boy doesn't get it.
-Let's go.

241
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,119
But don't you get it?

242
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,359
A cat's whiskers can't be cut off.

243
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Well, now I know.

244
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:15,880
You don't want to take care of Snowball.

245
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,200
You just want it to help you
make more money, right?

246
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,479
What did you just say?

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,840
I'm your boss.

248
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,479
You have to follow my orders.

249
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,679
You're not worthy of taking care of Snowball.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I quit.

251
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,159
I'll bring it home.

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,119
You can leave if you want.

253
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,440
Snowball has to stay.

254
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,799
And according to the contract,

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,159
you're in breach of the contract.

256
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:37,960
You've to compensate me RMB50000.

257
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,479
Pay it and you can leave.

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,280
What? I have to compensate you RMB50000.

259
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,359
I'll go up and present this part later.

260
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,479
I will give a presentation of

261
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,840
the first five slides.

262
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,159
And you do the rest.

263
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,119
Okay.

264
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,719
Muyun.

265
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,760
Good morning, Sir.

266
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,320
You've done a good job
in preparing the presentation.

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,119
Today's presentation is very important.

268
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,080
The two top scientists in the world,

269
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
will be there.

270
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,440
Give it your best.

271
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,679
Got it.

272
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,400
Okay. Here, please.

273
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,280
This is one of my best students.

274
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,919
If we can finish this presentation properly,

275
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,640
we'll be qualified to take part in
the Global Underwater Robot Competition

276
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,159
in San Diego in the US.

277
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,679
Don't worry.

278
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,320
This is my dream too.

279
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,880
Su Muyun, come and save me.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,799
The owner of the cafe wants me to compensate him
for the breach of contract.

281
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,159
He won't let me go.

282
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,320
You'll present first.

283
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,799
I've got an emergency.
I'll be back in a minute.

284
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,280
No.

285
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,039
You've prepared for this presentation

286
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,000
for a long time.

287
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,719
This is your opportunity to shine.

288
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
I trust you.

289
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,640
You're conducting a fraud and coercion.

290
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,400
You can either compensate me,

291
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
or neither of you can leave.

292
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm not afraid of you.

293
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,320
I won't let anyone bully Snowball.

294
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:10,640
You fool.

295
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Go away.

296
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:16,599
This ice cream can't be eaten anymore.

297
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,919
I won't let anyone bully my brother.

298
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,520
You signed on the contract voluntarily.

299
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,440
I didn't force you to do that.

300
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,719
If you don't compensate me,

301
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,159
I'll sue you.

302
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,719
You'll be locked up in the jail.

303
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,159
Based on the contract law,

304
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:36,200
when a fraud and coercion

305
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
are conducted upon a contract,

306
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,840
it'll be void.

307
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,119
It's revocable.

308
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,440
You can bring this to court whenever you like.

309
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,280
We'll be waiting for the subpoena from court.

310
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,840
Let's go.

311
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:48,760
Who conducted a fraud and coercion?

312
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,440
She signed the contract voluntarily.

313
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,799
Don't you dare to bluff me.

314
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
None of you can leave
if you don't compensate me.

315
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,799
You're holding us
in captive against our will.

316
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,919
I'll call the police now.

317
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,719
You can explain it to the police later.

318
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,280
Stop. Let's talk it through.

319
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,400
We shouldn't bother the police.

320
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,760
Thank you for saving me just now.

321
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,119
Right.

322
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,400
Why are you so familiar with the laws?

323
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,840
I gave Qin Yao a call on the way there.

324
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,200
Slow down. I can't keep up.

325
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:26,640
You can come close to me.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it can't.

327
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Don't be afraid of it.

328
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:31,760
Just touch it.
Its fur is so soft.

329
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,799
It won't hurt you.

330
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,280
And it can heal your heart.

331
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,039
You'll feel better when you touch it.

332
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,479
You'll feel the world getting better
if you hold it for a day.

333
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
Just touch it.

334
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,320
Your hair

335
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,960
works better that a cat's fur.

336
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,280
Just touch it.

337
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,479
Touch it.

338
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,599
Su Nianfeng,

339
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,919
Stay away from me.

340
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,520
-Stay away from me.
-Just touch it.

341
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,599
The basketball team of Mingxian University

342
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,599
had missed the chance

343
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:30,039
to enter the university basketball league
for three consecutive years.

344
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,080
Their new member Su Muyun,

345
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,280
is a great basketball player.

346
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
He's led the team all the way

347
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,119
to the provincial university
basketball league.

348
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,960
Su Muyun has also been selected as

349
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,400
the Most Valuable Player in the school team.

350
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,840
We're looking forward to

351
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,479
his best performance in the league.

352
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,039
Look, it's him.

353
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,679
I can't eat them up

354
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,280
while looking at Su Muyun's good-looking face.

355
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,559
I want to be slim.

356
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:56,520
I want to be a fairy matching him.

357
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,479
I've heard that he has a sister.

358
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,080
But she looks average.

359
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,479
I saw her on the news. What's her name?

360
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,079
Su Nianfeng.

361
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,599
You scared the hell out of me.

362
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,719
I'm looking for you.

363
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,119
Stop telling me about Su Muyun.

364
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,640
I found an owner for Snowball.

365
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,599
Really?

366
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,280
Good job!

367
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,319
Of course.

368
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:38,079
This time, I went through
a very thorough selection.

369
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
And this person has the ability

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,760
and sincerely wants to adopt it.

371
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,479
This person comes
from the upper-class society.

372
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,719
Good job!

373
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,119
Sister,

374
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,680
listen to me.

375
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,880
All the heroes and heroines in dramas

376
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,959
start to fall in love in universities.

377
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Well, Su Muyun and I will fall in love
with each other too, right?

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,959
It's about him again.

379
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,439
Whenever I recalled,

380
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,439
I fell in love with him at first sight
on the basketball court.

381
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,560
Come and watch him play basketball with me.

382
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,479
Say something nice about me
in front of him, please.

383
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,959
Look, is that Liu Zihui?

384
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,359
I think so.

385
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,199
It's her. Let's go.

386
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,520
Just help me.

387
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
Liu Zihui, what a coincidence.

388
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,359
Let's have lunch together.

389
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,280
What are you talking about?

390
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,160
This is Su Nianfeng, Su Muyun's sister.

391
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,439
Listen to me.

392
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,400
Don't try to disturb our family union.

393
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,280
Didn't I tell you last time that

394
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,280
Su Muyun doesn't have any feelings for you?

395
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,319
Who told you that?

396
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,000
Your information isn't accurate at all.

397
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,040
Go away.

398
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
Don't disturb us. We're having lunch.

399
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,560
I've got other things to do.

400
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,920
I'll get going now.

401
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,079
Bye.

402
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,640
Bye.

403
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,079
-Su Muyun.
-Eat your lunch.

404
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,560
Is that sour?

405
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,000
Cool.

406
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
The influence of
the university basketball league

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,959
is only second to CBA.

408
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,920
If you can get excellent results

409
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,479
in this league,

410
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,439
it'll benefit

411
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,119
not only you

412
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,680
but also the university.

413
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,160
Our goal this year

414
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:43,959
Is to get into the divisional series,

415
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,760
and then the national final.

416
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,000
Got it?

417
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:48,359
Got it!

418
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,640
Su Muyun,

419
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,239
you performed well in the first few games.

420
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,359
From now on, you'll be

421
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:55,640
the team captain.

422
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,199
Yes, Coach.

423
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,199
Hold on.

424
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,920
Lin Di has always been our team captain.

425
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,079
Lin Di.

426
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,880
Look at him.

427
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,599
What did he do in the first few games?

428
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:08,199
Did you even focus on the games?

429
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,760
Zhang Ailun, mind your own business.

430
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,359
All right. Go back to your training.

431
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:19,800
Didn't you

432
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,560
hear me?

433
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,119
Go back to your training.

434
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's go.

435
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,400
Let's train.

436
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,680
Move over.

437
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:37,119
Hey you. You're dating Liu Zihui.

438
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,239
But you deliberately denied about it.

439
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,920
What do you have in mind?
Are you trying to play some tricks on me?

440
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,520
My junior,

441
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,079
stop playing dumb here.

442
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,599
Lin Di has always been nice to you, right?

443
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,160
That's not good.

444
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,199
You lied to him in the love affair.

445
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,119
And now you took over as the team captain.

446
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,599
I'll say this for one last time.

447
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,040
Liu Zihui has nothing to do with me.

448
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,719
And about the position of team captain,

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,359
you can always get it back on the court.

450
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,079
How dare you?

451
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,199
Stop being pretentious.

452
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,800
He just scored a few more points.

453
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,239
What is so great about that?

454
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,280
I really don't like him.

455
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
What are you doing in my home?

456
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,280
Su Muyun,

457
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,000
do you feel that

458
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,319
I've changed since high school?

459
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,560
You've become more annoying.

460
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,040
I changed my make-up today.

461
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,959
It is the most popular
peach blossom colour of the season.

462
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,680
Do I look gentle and soft?

463
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,520
Step aside.

464
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,839
Su Nianfeng, I'm hungry.

465
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,560
Dinner will be ready soon.

466
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,640
Su Nianfeng, is dinner ready yet?

467
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,760
It'll be ready soon.

468
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,040
This is the 'Finding Nemo'.

469
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,719
I bought the seafood online.

470
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,119
It's very fresh.

471
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:49,719
So, delicious food is more tempting

472
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,079
than a beautiful girl?

473
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,760
The coach has gone to
the pre-match joint meeting.

474
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,800
I'll lead the team in training today.

475
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:01,040
Today, we'll be focusing on
waist and abdomen training.

476
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,599
Pair up with a teammate and do sit-ups.

477
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Three hundred times.

478
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
The coach isn't here anyway,

479
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,079
don't be so serious.

480
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:10,800
Let's have fun.

481
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,479
After completing the sit-ups round,
we shall practice lay-ups.

482
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,959
Well, just do it.

483
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,319
Come on.

484
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:17,479
Let's do it.

485
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,920
Let's do it.

486
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,959
Let's do it.

487
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,359
After completing the sit-ups round,
we shall practice lay-ups.

488
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,680
(Fresh Mart)
Let's go back.

489
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,040
We shouldn't disturb them
during their training.

490
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,640
We're not disturbing them.

491
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,079
We're showing them our support.

492
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,400
Look at my ace make-up today.

493
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,239
Do you think Su Muyun
will fall for me this time?

494
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,959
I feel like I'm about to cry.

495
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,479
You really know me well.

496
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:47,560
You're touched by my make-up.

497
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,119
Come on. Pass the ball.

498
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,199
Su Muyun.

499
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,560
We're here to see you.

500
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,040
What is she doing here?

501
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,079
Look here.

502
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,359
We'll continue our training later.

503
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,040
Please leave the drinks somewhere

504
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:09,319
and go home.

505
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,280
You guys have been training so hard today.
Come and get some drinks.

506
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,079
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

507
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,880
Well,

508
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,160
Su Muyun might be

509
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,520
a bit cool.

510
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,640
So please forgive him.

511
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,280
Get Liu Zihui out of here after this.

512
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,119
I didn't want to come here
at the first place.

513
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,800
I haven't even finished my assignments.

514
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,599
She kidnapped me.

515
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,839
Here you go.

516
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,079
Su Muyun,

517
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,040
This is specially for you.

518
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,319
It's very delicious.
Eat it when no one is noticing.

519
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,719
We'll continue our training later.

520
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,160
You both please leave.

521
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,079
Right.

522
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,839
Su Nianfeng,

523
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,359
I want to eat spicy hot pot.

524
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,680
As usual, don't make it too spicy.

525
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,280
Got it.

526
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,040
I'll see you after your training.

527
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Let's go.

528
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,000
Eat it up.

529
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,560
I'll always go home early when you're here.

530
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,640
Spicy hot pot.

531
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,719
Are you a walking Chinese cookbook?

532
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,800
This is a must-have survival skill

533
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,959
to live with the evil Su Muyun.

534
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,839
If you want to capture someone's heart,

535
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,079
you should attract him with your cooking.

536
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,599
Sister,

537
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,000
please teach me how to cook.

538
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,880
It almost takes up all my time to handle him.

539
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,319
Will you spare me, please?

540
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,319
Come on.

541
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,319
Focus on your training.

542
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:11,400
The training will end before 6.00 p.m.

543
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
Pass the ball.

544
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,560
Defend the ball.

545
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,680
Ailun, stop.

546
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,959
Stop practicing the attacking skills.
Just focus on your defending skills.

547
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,239
We just don't practice. What can you do?

548
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,839
Let it go.

549
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,680
Let's train in groups.

550
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,719
I'll lead a team and
Su Muyun will lead another team.

551
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,079
I'm fine with it.

552
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,079
I'm okay with it.

553
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,959
Su Muyun,

554
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:55,359
you really think
that you're the team captain.

555
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,119
Do you think anyone here
will ever follow your orders?

556
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,400
You just do it yourself.

557
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,479
Su Nianfeng,

558
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,000
am I looking

559
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,359
good and virtuous?

560
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,400
You asked me to teach you how to cook.

561
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,479
But you didn't let me buy some ingredients.

562
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,959
So we just see this with dinner?

563
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,199
Let's order takeaway.

564
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,800
No, takeout is unsanitary.

565
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,359
Su Muyun will get stomachache if he eats it.

566
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,599
Never mind. I'll just use the ingredients
we have in the fridge.

567
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:24,599
Let me try.

568
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,479
All right.

569
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,760
Be careful.

570
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,160
All right.

571
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,760
Stir it slowly. Don't spill it.

572
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,719
What are you doing here?

573
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,439
I'm here to cook for you.

574
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:49,880
You don't have to do this.

575
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,400
Su Nianfeng, please inform me in advance

576
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,599
if there are guests in our house.

577
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,079
It's so delicious.

578
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,040
Really? You should eat more.

579
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,079
What an idiot.

580
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,680
Su Muyun,

581
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,319
I've heard that you've become
the basketball team captain.

582
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,800
Will you invite us to watch your matches?

583
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,439
No.

584
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,800
Su Nianfeng told me that

585
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,839
you're amazing on the basketball court.

586
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,319
She was eager to see it.

587
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,359
I didn't...

588
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,719
All right.

589
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,520
I'll get two tickets for you.

590
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Here you go.

591
00:29:55,239 --> 00:29:56,959
Where's my fruit? I have to eat it
while watching the basketball match.

(Recruitment Guidelines)

593
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,959
Why are you so keen on looking for a job?

594
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,719
You just want to move out, right?

595
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,119
Well

596
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:11,079
I just want to gain more

597
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,640
social and working experience.

598
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,920
Really?

599
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,359
Yes.

600
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,439
I swear to the ceiling.

What jobs are you looking for?

602
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,479
All these have nothing to do with your major.

603
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,839
They're recruiting part-timer.

604
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,839
None of them respond to my application.

You won't take this one, will you?

607
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,400
Do you dare to go?

608
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,920
I'd be glad if they accept my application.

609
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,280
I'm nobody.

610
00:30:44,479 --> 00:30:46,560
I can't be picky.

611
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,359
You can try applying for housekeeping jobs.

612
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,359
You've lots of experience in this.

613
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,079
Get out of my room.

614
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,760

(The origin of artificial intelligence)

617
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:37,719
I've made you some chicken soup.

618
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,880
It's in the thermos.

619
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,239
Remember to take it.

620
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:41,959
I don't like chicken soup.

621
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,280
I don't want to take it.

622
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,920
No. You must take it.

623
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll check it when I come back.

624
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,079
If it's still in the thermos,

625
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,800
I won't prepare your dinner tonight.

626
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,040
I'm away for a day

627
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:56,959
and you all forgot about

628
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,400
the rules in the basketball team?

629
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,880
I'll not let you leave

630
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,719
if you can't finish
the three hundred push-ups.

631
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:03,560
Sir,

632
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,719
Su Muyun doesn't deserve to be our captain.

633
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,839
If he doesn't,

634
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,199
then you think you do, right?

635
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
Zhang Ailun, 100 more push-ups.

636
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,560
Yes, sir.

637
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,359
Su Muyun will be in charge of

638
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,479
your training from now on.

639
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:18,520
Those who are not satisfied can leave now.

640
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,800
Su Muyun,

641
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,319
I'll not let this go.

642
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,000
Dad!

643
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,280
Don't call me dad!

644
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,400
Lin Di started the quarrel

645
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,079
and impeded the training progress.

646
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,079
Go and run for 2 km in the field

647
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:38,199
after finishing the push-ups.

648
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,319
Su Muyun,

649
00:32:44,959 --> 00:32:46,920
I know it's not easy for you

650
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,319
when I appointed you to be the team captain.

651
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
I'm sorry to put you through all these

652
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,319
so that the team will be able

653
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,119
to enter the next round of the competition.

654
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,160
It's fine.

655
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:55,920
But I've never thought that

656
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,800
you're Lin Di's father.

657
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,920
Yeah.

658
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,119
I have to be stricter to him

659
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,839
because he's my son.

660
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,920
If something goes wrong,
I'll question him first.

661
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,280
Actually, the forward of the team

662
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,520
is quite good.

663
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,359
But the defense is too weak.

664
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,319
Zhang Ailun and Mu Fei

665
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,280
didn't give their best in the recent games.

666
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:16,680
We have to hurry

667
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,599
and improve the defending skills.

668
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,359
All right.

669
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,359
Lead the training.

670
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,599
I believe in you.

671
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,160
Don't worry about it, sir.

672
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,479
Chen,

673
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,920
I just took over the arts department.

674
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,599
There are still a lot of things
that I'm not familiar with.

675
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,520
I might need your help in this.

676
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:49,439
It's all right.

677
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,000
Just ask me

678
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,239
if you have any problems.

679
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
Thank you.

680
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,079
Su Muyun.

681
00:33:58,199 --> 00:34:00,760
This is the president of the Student Council,
Chen Weiran.

682
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:03,040
Nice to meet you, Su Muyun.

683
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,719
It's getting late now.

684
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,919
Shall we have dinner together?

685
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,439
I might need your help from now on.

686
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,679
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,040
I'm not free tonight.

688
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:22,548
(Xiao Feng)

689
00:34:23,959 --> 00:34:25,199
I've got an interview.
I'll be late.

690
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,199
What interview?

691
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,159
When will you come back?

692
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,360
I'll be back after the interview.

693
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:29,960
All right.

694
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,239
Go home on time and cook the dinner.

695
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
Qingxue, who is he?

696
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,199
How can he treat you in this way?

697
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,000
He's so rude.

698
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,159
It's okay. Let's go.

699
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,120
I'll check it when I come back.

700
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,479
If it's still in the thermos,

701
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,239
I won't prepare your dinner tonight.

702
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,959
Didn't your interview go well?

703
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,639
They're not recruiting part-timers.

704
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:49,080
I've been rejected for 15 times this month.

705
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,560
How do you know what I feel?

706
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,439
They're stupid.

707
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,159
It was delicious.

708
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,320
You finished it. That's great.

709
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:29,668
(Notifications of recruitment)

710
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,320
(Part-time personal assistant of
the CEO of Ouyang Group)

711
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:33,368
(Sent.)

712
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,080
Guys, let's call it a day.

713
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,120
Goodbye.

714
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,959
Su Nianfeng, come and see me.

715
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,040
You've done a great job in your paper.

716
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,639
Thank you, Sir.

717
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,479
I'm working on

718
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,399
a key medical research.

719
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,719
It's about heart disease.

720
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,320
Do you have any interest?

721
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,679
Me?

722
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,399
This is too good to be true.

723
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
All right. Go and get ready.

724
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,320
We might have the chance

725
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,840
to attend a seminar in the US later.

726
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,520
It's a very grand seminar.

727
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Thank you, Sir.

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,959
Su Muyun's in trouble in the hall
in the basketball training.

729
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,560
Su Nianfeng, where are you going?

730
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,639
Sir, I'll explain to you
when I come back later.

731
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,679
Su Muyun,

732
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,639
you really think that
we won't do anything to you

733
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,560
with the coach be your back?

734
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,520
I can give up the position

735
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:34,919
as long as we can win the competition.

736
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,159
What are you waiting for?
Let's beat him up.

737
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,360
What are you doing?

738
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,040
What's wrong?

739
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,679
Stop it, don't touch Su Muyun.

740
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,800
Stop fighting! Guys, stop fighting.

741
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:42,560
What are you doing?

742
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,360
Knock it off.

743
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,800
Who are you?

744
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,439
Just take a look at the logo on your clothes

745
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,719
and you'll know.

746
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,800
What you just did was so indecent.

747
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,959
If it happens again,

748
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,639
it'll bring bad impact

749
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,919
on Ouyang Group.

750
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,840
We might defund you.

751
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,560
Ouyang Group

752
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,919
is one of our sponsors?

753
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,000
Is this for real?

754
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Let me do it.

755
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,520
I saved you from troubles today.

756
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,879
You better be thankful to me.

757
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,639
I just want to help you.

758
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,399
Last time when you offered your help,

759
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,320
you broke three bowls.

760
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,840
And you broke two plates the other time.

761
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,679
And you broke a cup before the other time.

762
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:40,560
I'll be more careful today.

763
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:42,600
Alright then.

764
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,919
Do the washing-up properly.

765
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,040
Today, I offended Professor Fang

766
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,560
to save you.

767
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,719
I'm such a great sister.

768
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:52,040
I gave up on my bright future
in order to save my brother.

769
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,040
It's so touching.

770
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
Why are you so afraid of
offending that professor?

771
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,840
Well,

772
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,159
he wanted to bring me along
to attend a seminar in the US.

773
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,080
Well, I think I won't be going now.

774
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,239
Do the washing-up.

775
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:17,840
Thanks, Zhuo Yifeng.

776
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,520
This is our tactic for
the second-half of the game.

777
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:44,439
Yunhai University team is good at attacking.

778
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,239
But our defense is the weakest.

779
00:39:46,439 --> 00:39:47,280
What do you know about anything?

780
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,080
Shut up.

781
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,360
Su Muyun, go on.

782
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,800
I did some analysis.

783
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,280
You catch the ball that he passes

784
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,080
and shoot the ball here.

785
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,639
Their passing speed
is always slow at the beginning.

786
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,879
Every time after one of their players
pass the ball to someone else,

787
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,520
the one who has the ball
will try to make a fake shot.

788
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,399
You must pass the ball to him when he's here.

789
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,399
The height and speed of this player

790
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,639
All right.

791
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:05,959
Give it your best.

792
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,120
Play the game

793
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,919
based on Su Muyun's strategy.

794
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,879
Let's do this.

795
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,320
Nice shot!

796
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,600
Mr. Ouyang,

797
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,199
