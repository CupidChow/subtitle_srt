(Adapted from the novel
The Days When My Brother And I Live Together)

24
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:50,326
(Episode 3)

25
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,680
Su Nianfeng,

26
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:55,877
this is a sample question from our textbook.

27
00:01:56,036 --> 00:01:57,637
Have you done your revision at home?

28
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:04,116
Sir, it's because I...

29
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:13,797
Sir.

30
00:02:15,476 --> 00:02:16,797
Let us continue our test first.

31
00:02:16,997 --> 00:02:18,157
So other students will not be disturbed.

32
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:19,476
If she has any problems,

33
00:02:19,637 --> 00:02:21,116
I can teach her after class.

34
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:22,756
You should

35
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,676
learn from Le Diyin.

36
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:26,516
Come to my office after class.

37
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,316
It's fine.

38
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,478
(Year 3 Class 5)

39
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:45,837
So, the answer is A.

40
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:51,236
Why is it A and not B?

41
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:52,837
Calculate it first.

42
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,316
Then circle this

43
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:55,997
and do the division.

44
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:58,116
Then add it here.

45
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:02,760
Have a try first.

46
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,797
Ask me if you have problems.

47
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:05,036
Okay.

48
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:09,797
Let's go, Su Muyun.

49
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,797
Do you still remember the formula
I've taught just now?

50
00:03:12,157 --> 00:03:13,197
Let's play basketball.

51
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,917
I'm not going, you go yourself.

52
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:17,516
-What's wrong?
-The solution of this question

53
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:19,116
and the last question is the same.

54
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,917
Look, I'll show you.

55
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,036
Pay attention to the steps.

56
00:03:24,236 --> 00:03:24,997
Use this formula

57
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:26,516
-and you can solve this question.
-That is

58
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:28,197
Xiao Feng's new desk mate?

59
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:29,956
Not bad.

60
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:43,516
Su Nianfeng.

61
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,516
I've heard that you're feeling unwell.

62
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,277
Here.

63
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,437
Drink some hot water.

64
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:55,277
Do you...

65
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:57,236
know how to solve that sample question?

66
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:58,557
Shall I teach you?

67
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:00,036
I knew it. Thank you.

68
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,557
Le Diyin has taught me.

69
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,277
It's okay.

70
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:07,596
Next time,

71
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:08,956
if you have any problems,

72
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,157
you can ask me.

73
00:04:10,797 --> 00:04:11,876
I can teach you.

74
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,356
She couldn't solve it because
she didn't pay attention.

75
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,037
It's none of your business.

76
00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,877
Puppy love is not allowed.

77
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,757
You're distracted. Of course
I have to be cautious.

78
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,997
Su Muyun, you're too much!

79
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:36,477
Let's go and play basketball.

80
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:38,997
No.

81
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,317
Xiao Feng, don't listen to him.

82
00:04:41,757 --> 00:04:43,236
It's not like that.

83
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:55,157
What were you doing?

84
00:04:57,356 --> 00:04:58,796
She's actually quite smart.

85
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,477
Teach her once and she'll get it.

86
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:09,757
Are you alright?

87
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,356
What are you thinking?

88
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:23,837
Xiao Feng was distracted
because she's taking care of you.

89
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,396
That's why her grades couldn't get better.

90
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:01,717
Thank you for earlier.

91
00:06:01,956 --> 00:06:03,157
Are you okay?

92
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:05,960
Su Muyun always picks on me.

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,356
He's so annoying.

94
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:09,877
Everyone has his own strength

95
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,516
and weakness.

96
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:13,717
Maybe he just focused on your shortcomings

97
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,597
and didn't see your strength.

98
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:17,516
But...

99
00:06:18,076 --> 00:06:19,396
Looking at my grades

100
00:06:19,516 --> 00:06:22,236
it seems like all subjects
are my weaknesses.

101
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:25,557
You won't be defeated easily, right?

102
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:27,236
I won't.

103
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,757
I'll let Su Muyun know that

104
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,437
on the next mathematics test,

105
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:32,717
I'll surely turn it around!

106
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:33,516
That's right.

107
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:34,676
Such tenacity

108
00:06:34,837 --> 00:06:36,437
is exactly your strength.

109
00:06:37,516 --> 00:06:38,717
Is there anyone

110
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,636
who wants a math tutor?

111
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:45,636
I want to work this out by myself.

112
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:48,516
Let's go.

113
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,236
What are you doing?

114
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:14,916
Sorry, I didn't see it.

115
00:07:15,757 --> 00:07:16,796
Also,

116
00:07:18,597 --> 00:07:19,877
I'm watching you.

117
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:22,956
Stay away from Su Nianfeng.

118
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,437
Ridiculous.

119
00:07:28,277 --> 00:07:29,157
You!

120
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,877
Sorry, I still didn't see you.

121
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:33,956
By the way.

122
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,557
Take your thermos away.

123
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:51,956
That's enough.

124
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:55,757
Why didn't you go after Xiao Feng?

125
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:57,837
What for?

126
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:00,437
But you...

127
00:08:33,157 --> 00:08:34,996
Thank you for today.

128
00:08:35,677 --> 00:08:37,797
We are friends,
you don't need to say thanks.

129
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:38,956
Friends?

130
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:40,157
Are we not?

131
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,556
Yes we are.

132
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:45,636
Sorry.

133
00:08:45,797 --> 00:08:47,277
Because earlier you said that

134
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,636
you didn't like to make friends.

135
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:51,677
So, I'm out of my mind a little.

136
00:08:58,157 --> 00:08:59,516
Here, eat the drumstick.

137
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:04,876
Do you normally cook?

138
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,717
That's awesome.

139
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:12,797
Isn't it just a drumstick?

140
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,157
You have it too.

141
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,797
That is my drumstick.

142
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,636
Be quiet.

143
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,117
Here.

144
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:46,717
Try it.

145
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:56,996
Delicious!

146
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,956
This was prepared for Su Muyun.

147
00:10:00,157 --> 00:10:01,237
But I decide not to care about him today.

148
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:02,837
and let him be.

149
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:05,996
Don't bother, let's eat.

150
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:12,797
Why not sit over there?

151
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:14,636
No.

152
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,597
Thank you.

153
00:10:26,436 --> 00:10:27,556
You guys are back.

154
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,876
Xiao Feng. Xiao Yun.

155
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,157
Come and eat.

156
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:38,956
We're having pizza today.

157
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:40,837
Your favorite pizza.

158
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,277
It's so hot.

159
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:43,996
Mom, I'm not hungry.

160
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:46,917
I'll eat after Xiao Yun finishes.

161
00:10:53,477 --> 00:10:55,677
Xiao Feng.

162
00:10:59,237 --> 00:11:00,956
Xiao Yun, let's eat first.

163
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:02,196
I've saved some for Xiao Feng.

164
00:11:02,316 --> 00:11:03,436
She can eat when she's hungry.

165
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:09,485
(Study, don't disturb)

166
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:13,837
You eat.

167
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:15,237
I'll wait for her.

168
00:11:20,717 --> 00:11:22,917
-What...
-What happened to them?

169
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,717
I don't know either.

170
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:40,737
(Mathematics Improving Battle)

171
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,640
(Go for it!)

172
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:44,477
For the sake of defeating Su Muyun,

173
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,076
for the sake of my good image
in my prince's heart,

174
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:49,196
for the sake of preventing the world
from being destroyed,

175
00:11:49,396 --> 00:11:51,477
and for the sake of protecting world peace,

176
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:53,797
I, Su Nianfeng,

177
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:56,556
the enchanting and hard-working student,

178
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,180
(Fighting)

179
00:11:58,956 --> 00:11:59,837
come on!

180
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:00,996
Study hard!

181
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:01,732
(Year 3 Class 5)

182
00:12:01,756 --> 00:12:03,396
Set a Cartesian coordinate system.

183
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,756
Set the origin of the
coordinate system to be the vertex.

184
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,556
The first step of study plan.

185
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,636
Listen carefully in the class, no sleeping.

186
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,436
Connect all the three points ABC to
form a triangle.

187
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,157
Then set the three points as

188
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,797
A(x1 y1), B(x2 y2),

189
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:23,196
and C(x3 y3).

190
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:26,717
The barycentric coordinate system is (xm ym).

191
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,357
Taking xm into account,
choose any two points

192
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,917
and set as A and B.

193
00:12:32,237 --> 00:12:35,477
The center of mass is on the axis of A and B.

194
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:41,316
The center point of AB
whose x-axis is (x1+x2)/2.

195
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:45,837
The center of mass is at the middle line,
one third of the distance from AB point.

196
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,117
Okay, class end.

197
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,956
Study plan, step two.

198
00:12:57,117 --> 00:13:00,357
Do revision after class, cover everything.

199
00:13:07,117 --> 00:13:08,436
Are you doing the revision?

200
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:13,677
Revision does not exist to me.

201
00:13:13,917 --> 00:13:16,597
Every page to me is previewing.

202
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:20,837
I've heard of
one motivational quote which said,

203
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:23,677
if you don't push yourself,

204
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,636
you won't know your potential.

205
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,996
I thought anyone
who was pushed to the verge,

206
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,756
could do anything.

207
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:32,396
But I realized

208
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:35,717
it was not effective in math.

209
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,956
Study plan, step three.

210
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,277
Practise more, do more.

211
00:13:44,677 --> 00:13:46,357
Learn it if you don't know.

212
00:13:52,477 --> 00:13:54,076
Should we give up?

213
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,597
Being happy is the most important.

214
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,076
Don't force yourself.

215
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,956
Think of those who look down on you.

216
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:08,516
You have to prove yourself with hard work.

217
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:10,396
You can do it!

218
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:24,876
Are you not going to have lunch?

219
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:26,076
No.

220
00:14:26,316 --> 00:14:27,516
Mathematics makes me happy.

221
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:29,037
Knowledge enriches me.

222
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,396
I love mathematics.

223
00:14:35,196 --> 00:14:37,477
Such a good kid has got crazy just like that.

224
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:48,516
Let's eat together.

225
00:14:58,477 --> 00:14:59,677
What's wrong with your sister?

226
00:14:59,837 --> 00:15:00,556
She's doing math practices so hard

227
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,556
in the classroom as if she's mad.

228
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:04,037
Has she spelled by the teacher?

229
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:05,756
None of my business.

230
00:15:05,917 --> 00:15:06,677
Then,

231
00:15:08,396 --> 00:15:09,516
can you approve

232
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:10,876
my friend request?

233
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:12,357
If you always don't add me as a friend,

234
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:14,556
it will be a disgrace to me.

235
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:24,797
Give me that vegetable

236
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:25,996
and the drumstick.

237
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:26,597
Okay.

238
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:28,597
Choose a big one.
I'll take away, thank you.

239
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,357
Hey.

240
00:15:31,357 --> 00:15:32,237
-I...
-Get lost.

241
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:33,636
It's only just lunch.

242
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:35,157
Don't...

243
00:15:35,516 --> 00:15:36,597
Get lost.

244
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:41,756
I'm not angry.

245
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,917
Life is just like a drama.

246
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,917
It's lucky if you get together.

247
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,037
It's not pretty when you get angry.

248
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,157
I'm not angry.

249
00:15:57,396 --> 00:15:58,996
He's humiliating me.

250
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:16,316
You should eat.

251
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,277
You'll get low blood sugar.

252
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:19,797
I've heard that later in PE class,

253
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:21,436
girls are going to run 800 meters.

254
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,756
It's okay, I'll go later.

255
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:26,117
I'm going to solve this soon.

256
00:16:27,076 --> 00:16:29,917
You really don't need help?

257
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,076
If I can't solve it in a derivative way,

258
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:35,516
I'll try it from the aspect of set.

259
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:37,837

It's nothing serious,

00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:03,956
just low blood sugar level.

296
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,117
Moreover, she's having her period
and ran for a long distance.

297
00:19:06,316 --> 00:19:08,316
So she got severe response.

Miss, does she

need medication?

00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:12,517
No.

00:19:12,637 --> 00:19:14,196
But don't attend PE class anymore.

302
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:16,117
Go back and have some rest.

Go and play your basketball.

You're asking so many questions.

Go back and rest more.

308
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,796
Thank you, Miss.

309
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:41,877
Why are you coming back again?

310
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:44,837
Miss.

311
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:46,717
She has returned to her class.

You are good at taking care of classmates.

315
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,316
Thank you, Miss.

316
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:19,237
Why did you come back?

317
00:20:20,237 --> 00:20:21,877
I'm not feeling well.

318
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:24,757
You didn't attend PE class, either?

319
00:20:25,436 --> 00:20:26,517
I've asked for leave.

327
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:07,517
Solving the problem with just a glance.

328
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,316
You've found your ways,

329
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,076
just need more practices.

help you?

332
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,036
It's not that good.

333
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:19,757
We're in the senior year.
No one has extra time.

334

I don't want to trouble you.

It's fine.

336
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,276
I'll take it as revision.

337
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:25,477
Moreover,

338
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,276
I'm not giving you tuition for free.

339
00:21:28,517 --> 00:21:29,877
I'm exchanging it with your special lunch.

00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:36,597
Okay, deal.

342
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,117
Here.

343
00:21:42,076 --> 00:21:43,196
I need to know well about

344
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:44,436
your mathematical level.

345
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,956
Try to do this question.

346
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,249
(Mathematics Questions)

347
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:57,837
It seems like

348
00:21:58,036 --> 00:21:59,877
we have to start from grade one.

349
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:03,117
Su Muyun is right.

350
00:22:03,316 --> 00:22:04,556
Lessons that I missed,

351
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,637
even Nuwa couldn't make it up.

352
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:09,357
I'm very curious

353
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:12,156
where do you spend your time?

354
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,276
My parents were always not at home.

355
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,357
My time

356
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:17,956
were all spent cooking for Su Muyun.

357
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:20,997
Sometimes, I even stayed up late to study.

358
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:24,637
I ended up sleeping in class,
a vicious cycle.

359
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,357
Do you have any goals?

360
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,316
As long as I stay away from Su Muyun,

361
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:34,036
I'm even willing to go all the way

362
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:35,357
to university in Antarctica.

363
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,117
You only have this goal?

364
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,717
And...

365
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,156
That's it.

366
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,637
I'm writing you a book list.

367
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:57,637
Actually, mathematics is not so difficult.

368
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,556
As long as we start from logical thinking.

369
00:23:02,196 --> 00:23:03,196
Here.

370
00:23:04,603 --> 00:23:05,683
(Book List)

371
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:10,276
There're so many, can I do it?

372
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:11,837
Your comprehension skill is very strong.

373
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:13,556
You just need a little more focus.

374
00:23:16,036 --> 00:23:17,477
Okay, let's do it.

375
00:23:24,556 --> 00:23:27,117
Are you sure you want so many books?

376
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:28,117
Yes.

377
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:35,477
Sir, my head teacher is looking for me.

378
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:36,757
I'll collect those books later.

379
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,237
Are all students in their first year

380
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:43,837
so passionate in learning?
They've borrowed all.

381
00:23:49,517 --> 00:23:50,316
I'll try to gather all materials

382
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:52,237
in these two days.

383
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,036
Thank you for giving me tuition.

384
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:55,517
I have all these materials.

385
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:56,796
Are you free this weekend?

386
00:23:56,916 --> 00:23:58,916
We can go to the cafe
in front of the school.

387
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,036
Okay.

388
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:42,956
(Circulation Desk)
Hey.

389
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,076
Please be quiet in public.

390
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:00,517
Let go of me.

391
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:01,796
What is it?

392
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:04,117
Su Nianfeng.

393
00:26:04,637 --> 00:26:06,237
You can't go tuition this weekend.

394
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,076
How did you know this weekend...

395
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:10,997
Su Muyun, you spied on me!

396
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,397
You are not allowed to go.

397
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:14,156
Le Diyin is my friend.

398
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:16,156
I won't allow you
to mess with our friendship.

399
00:26:16,316 --> 00:26:18,237
There is no pure relationship
between boys and girls.

400
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:21,076
I need to take good care of you
when parents are not around.

401
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:23,196
In order to take care of you,

402
00:26:23,357 --> 00:26:24,837
I don't even have enough time to study.

403
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:26,517
Let alone make friends.

404
00:26:26,717 --> 00:26:29,196
It's rare for me to study and
have friends at the same time.

405
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:30,877
You can't destroy them.

406
00:26:34,597 --> 00:26:35,397
Only I

407
00:26:35,556 --> 00:26:38,477
can improve your grades.

408
00:26:40,436 --> 00:26:42,036
You are nowhere near Le Diyin.

409
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:43,276
What?

410
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:45,676
I think you are jealous.

411
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,916
Yes, you're jealous.

412
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:49,676
Le Diyin is better looking than you.

413
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:50,956
He is gentler than you.

414
00:26:51,117 --> 00:26:53,556
It's a delight to be with him.

415
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,916
It's like hell to be with you.

416
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:58,316
Are you blind or stupid?

417
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,436
In any case, I won't give up.

418
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:05,837
And stop following me.

419
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:09,757
What a fool.

420
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:16,717
I'm back.

421
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:17,477
You're back.

422
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,556
Xiao Feng, have some fruits.

423
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:21,637
Xiao Feng.

424
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:23,757
Your mom's best cooking

425
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,156
is washing the fruits.

426
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:25,916
Hurry up and try some.

427
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:27,237
Here, have an apple.

428
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:28,477
You really are.

429
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:30,517
I don't want it.

430
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:32,076
What's wrong, Xiao Feng?

431
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:33,637
Have you two quarreled again?

432
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,357
Dad. Mom.

433
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,117
Su Muyun is too much.

434
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:40,156
We've got a genius in our class.

435
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:42,117
He said he wanted
to help me with mathematics.

436
00:27:42,316 --> 00:27:44,796
But Su Muyun always prevented us.

437
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:47,036
If he continues to be like that,

438
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,276
I really would be the one

439
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:51,556
with the lowest education level
in our family.

440
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,237
Mathematics tuition?

441
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,276
You can ask Xiao Yun to help you.

442
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:56,276
That's right.

443
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:57,637
Xiao Yun's mathematics result

444
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:59,316
is top in the class.

445
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,637
He surely has no problem.

446
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:03,517
In every exam,

447
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:05,796
his method of
solving questions is beyond me.

448
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:08,237
If I follow his method,

449
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:10,436
I might pass away

450
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:11,956
even before the entrance exam.

451
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:14,237
What nonsense are you saying,
you foolish child.

452
00:28:15,196 --> 00:28:16,237
Xiao Feng,

453
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:17,916
studying

454
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,357
is like eating an apple.

455
00:28:20,796 --> 00:28:23,156
You have to taste it yourself

456
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,357
otherwise you won't know it's sweet

457
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:26,717
or not.

458
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:28,517
You don't take advantage of

459
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,196
the whizz at home,

460
00:28:30,357 --> 00:28:31,436
what a waste.

461
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:34,757
You should learn
to use your favorable position.

462
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:35,997
That's right.

463
00:28:36,436 --> 00:28:38,637
Forget it, enjoy the fruits.

464
00:28:38,796 --> 00:28:40,916
I'm going back to my room to do homework.

465
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:15,956
(Liu Zihui sent a friend request to Su Muyun)
We are desk mates, let's get to know each other.

466
00:29:16,076 --> 00:29:17,316
I am Liu Zihui.

467
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,877
I have a problem in English.

468
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:21,837
(Liu Zihui)
What do the "sin" "cos"

469
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,717
and "tan" mean?

470
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:26,117
I've saved your sister twice.

471
00:29:26,237 --> 00:29:28,156
(Liu Zihui's messages)
You should know how to repay kindness.

472
00:29:45,597 --> 00:29:46,597
I think my solution

473
00:29:46,717 --> 00:29:48,877
for this problem is correct.

474
00:29:49,036 --> 00:29:50,676
You should use this formula,
I'll write it down for you.

475
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,676
Are these two questions
using the same formula?

476
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:56,436
You can substitute and try again.

477
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:00,556
You followed me?

478
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,477
Don't flatter yourself.

479
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:03,676
What?

480
00:30:04,377 --> 00:30:05,177
(Exercises)

481
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,757
You need to start from elementary level.

482
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,796
Hi.

483
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:14,717
Why are you here too?

484
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:16,717
The teacher asked me help her with her study.

485
00:30:16,956 --> 00:30:18,597
You're giving tuition to others?

486
00:30:18,877 --> 00:30:20,237
I guess the world has changed.

487
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:24,997
What is it?

488
00:30:28,997 --> 00:30:29,956
Why did...

489
00:30:32,076 --> 00:30:33,196
Solve this later.

490
00:30:34,757 --> 00:30:36,276
Are we doing this for real?

491
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:41,036
This too.

492
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:42,196
This question

493
00:30:42,196 --> 00:30:43,477
uses derivative formulas.

494
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:44,757
You don't need a formula.

495
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:46,276
Draw an auxiliary line

496
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:47,997
and everything is solved.

497
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:54,556
I'm not saying this to you.

498
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:01,276
This is the derivative formula.

499
00:31:02,117 --> 00:31:03,597
Why bother using derivative formula?

500
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:04,717
So troublesome.

501
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:06,237
Do you know L'Hopital's rule?

502
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:07,517
Although it's not in the syllabus,

503
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:10,036
it's applicable in multiple choices
and fill in the blank.

504
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,597
It can be settled any minute.

505
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:15,036
One, two, three, then solved.

506
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,397
Like this, understand?

507
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:23,956
It might be difficult to learn,

508
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:25,757
but I'll teach you step by step.

509
00:31:25,997 --> 00:31:27,036
Look at what I write.

510
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:30,276
Hypocrite.

511
00:31:30,436 --> 00:31:32,717
He doesn't behave like this
when he gives me tuition.

512
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,196
Do you understand when I put it this way?

513
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:41,036
Inequation x2-4x-2-a>0.

514
00:31:41,156 --> 00:31:42,997
Answer is in the interval (1,4).

515
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:45,916
So the answer for a<x2-4x-2

516
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,036
is in the interval (1,4).

517
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:49,757
You're really the best math teacher
I've seen so far.

518
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:51,676
The one and only.

519
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,397
Use monotonic increasing on (2,4).

520
00:32:01,956 --> 00:32:03,117
Other than the answer,

521
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,156
all others are wrong.

522
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:07,997
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

523
00:32:11,436 --> 00:32:12,556
You'd

524
00:32:13,036 --> 00:32:14,436
forget about getting tuition.

525
00:32:20,276 --> 00:32:21,676
That's enough.

526
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:24,117
Do you want to die from hunger?

527
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,597
You can try.

528
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,036
You!

529
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,956
How did they end up arguing?

530
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,316
Let go of me.

531
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:41,556
-Let go of me!
-We have family problems

532
00:32:41,556 --> 00:32:42,556
that need to be settled.

533
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,196
I'm leaving Liu Zihui to you.

534
00:32:45,156 --> 00:32:46,717
Su Muyun.

535
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,196
Are you happy now?

536
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,757
What Le Diyi knows,

537
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:13,837
I know too.

538
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:14,717
No need.

539
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:17,117
I'd rather give up the exam.

540
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:24,717
We have to go on a business trip.

541
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:25,877
Take good care of yourself and brother.

542
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:26,517
Love you.

543
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:27,556
-Kiss.
-We have to go on a business trip.

544
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:30,436
Don't make Xiao Feng angry,
you might get hungry.

545
00:33:37,597 --> 00:33:39,076
My stomach,

546
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:41,357
why does it suddenly hurt?

547
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,837

Su Muyun, get out of here!

576
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:03,597
Too noisy.

577
00:37:03,756 --> 00:37:05,276
Get out! Get...

578
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,837
It's too noisy.

579
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:16,877
Here.

580
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:18,316
Add it in here.

581
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,117
Then it's solved.

582
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:22,996
Understand?

583
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:25,036
I still couldn't get it when you
repeated it for the seventh time.

584
00:37:25,236 --> 00:37:27,076
But it's the eighth time now,
I get it now.

585
00:37:27,276 --> 00:37:28,437
Thank you, teacher.

586
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:37,957
For me?

587
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:39,996
I've improved by ten places
in the trial exam.

588
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:40,996
Your great kindness

589
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:43,236
will never be forgotten no matter what.

590
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:52,236
This is called

591
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:55,276
"teacher's kindness is higher than the sky
and deeper than the sea" cookie.

592
00:37:55,437 --> 00:37:56,637
I baked them this morning.

593
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,917
Are you sure you don't want to give it a try?

594
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:26,917
Is it so bad that makes you cry?

595
00:38:27,677 --> 00:38:30,556
Someone must have done something
when I'm not around.

596
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:38,796
It's crunchy and delicious.
It should be fine.

597
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:41,837
Don't worry.

598
00:38:42,157 --> 00:38:43,917
I'm not feeling well, that's all.

599
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,476
Do you want to go to the clinic?

600
00:38:46,756 --> 00:38:47,756
No need.

601
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:49,276
I'm used to it.

602
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,357
Don't worry, let's continue to
solve the problems.

603
00:38:52,837 --> 00:38:53,917
I only have you as a friend.

604
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:55,316
You should be safe and sound.

605
00:38:58,877 --> 00:39:00,117
I'm really fine.

606
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:04,637
Long live our friendship.

607
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:14,851
(Huiming Senior High School)

608
00:39:16,236 --> 00:39:17,236
Okay, thank you Teacher Zhang.

609
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,236
Never mind.

610
00:39:18,597 --> 00:39:19,437
Teacher.

611
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:20,476
Come in.

612
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:25,157
Sir, are you looking for me?

613
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:29,076
The school has a few quotas for
recommendations to Tsinghua University.

614
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,437
We have a few candidates.

615
00:39:30,637 --> 00:39:32,756
The competition is fierce.

616
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:33,957
I believe in you.

617
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:35,357
You are good in all aspects.

618
00:39:35,516 --> 00:39:37,556
Go back and get prepared,
the sooner, the better.

619
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:39,476
Sir, I...

620
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,837
Why do you hesitate?

621
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,917
Do you know how good this opportunity is?

622
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:46,316
Thank you.

623
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,796
I've made my decision.

624
00:39:50,397 --> 00:39:51,716
Is it because of your sister?

625
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:56,597
To be honest

626
00:39:56,996 --> 00:39:58,437
your sister, Su Nianfeng,

627
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,476
her problem is not
about going to which university

628
00:40:00,677 --> 00:40:02,516
but whether she can get into one.

629
00:40:02,716 --> 00:40:03,556
Do you understand?

630
00:40:03,877 --> 00:40:05,076
It matters your future.

631
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:07,397
Don't ruin yourself because of your sister.

632
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:08,957
I'll give her tuition.

633
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:10,677
She can surely get into a university.

634
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:15,516
Think about this recommendation seriously.

635
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:16,716
Give it a deep thought.

636
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:17,996
Give me your parents' number.

637
00:40:18,197 --> 00:40:19,516
I'll talk with them.

638
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,516
My parents are usually abroad.

639
00:40:21,677 --> 00:40:22,877
It's hard to meet them.

640
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:24,996
Why don't we ask Su Nianfeng to come over?

641
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:27,877
My parents are not around,
so she is considered my guardian.
