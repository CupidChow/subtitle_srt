from the drug store last time

30
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:48,529
suits me well.

00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:49,930
Thank you.

32
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,689
I have an emergency.

33
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,249
Talk later. Bye.

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,210
Do you have to work so hard?

35
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:10,769
When did you get here?

36
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,450
Knock it off.

37
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,249
This is the experiment report of Thomas.

38
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,129
It's very helpful for Le Diyin.

39
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,889
I have to get it to the best.

40
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,529
You've changed.

41
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,689
It's a smartwatch.

42
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,609
If you get into trouble,

43
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,049
it will notify me right away.

44
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:16,809
You have only two options.

45
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:18,490
Either you accept it,

46
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,369
or you come home with me.

47
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,129
I won't go with you.

48
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,290
You live so far away that

49
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:26,890
you have to ride to work

50
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,730
as if it's a cycling marathon.

51
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,089
I can surely find a place near the company.

52
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,450
Xiao Feng.

53
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,450
Are you looking for a place to stay too?

54
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:38,529
Yes.

55
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:39,570
That's great.

56
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,050
I'm looking for a roommate.

57
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,770
How about living with me?

58
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,490
By the way, aren't you doing

59
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,850
your internship at Ouyang Group?

60
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,890
I live nearby.

61
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,770
Really?

62
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:48,809
That's great.

63
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,409
Come and have a look when you're free.

64
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:52,330
If you think it's suitable,
we can live together

65
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,610
and look out for each other.

66
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,610
Sure. Thank you.

67
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:57,850
Su Muyun.

68
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,730
Why not come with us?

69
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:01,809
No need for him to come.

70
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,129
He's quite busy lately

71
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,809
with his paper.

72
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,649
Lucky you.

73
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,369
I've just submitted my paper.

74
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,689
Let's go.

75
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,969
Let's go. Come on.

76
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,610
Here is my place.

77
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,689
It is my puppy, Du Du.

78
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:33,890
I haven't cleaned up my room.

79
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,249
So we can skip that.

80
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,450
There is a second bedroom.

81
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,770
But it doesn't have windows.

82
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,129
And that's the only downside.

83
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:41,450
Come on.

84
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,089
Look around.
The environment is not bad, right?

85
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,369
No.

86
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,969
She likes a bedroom with windows

87
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,290
to get sunlight.

88
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,529
The monthly rent is 2,000 yuan.

89
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,249
But if you were to live with me,

90
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,409
1,000 yuan would do.

91
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,209
Forget about the windows.

92
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,929
I think it is pretty good.

93
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:14,290
So shall we sign the contract?

94
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,490
Come with me. Let's get a contract.

95
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:58,050
I've brought you the things from home.

96
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,770
Thank you.

97
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:20,730
You shouldn't seal it this way.

98
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,249
Don't you have any common sense?

99
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,249
I'll help you with that.

100
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,330
Here's how to seal a box.

101
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,290
I'm more experienced, right?

102
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,170
If you say another word,

103
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,850
it's your mouth that will get sealed.

104
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,129
Don't misunderstand me.

105
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,730
It would be a waste to throw it away.

106
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,490
You still keep the torn shirt?

107
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:11,290
I've patched up the hole.

108
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,850
Please show some respect to it, all right?

109
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,089
Eat more vegetables.

110
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,890
It's spicy. You shouldn't have it.

111
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,969
Such a picky eater.

112
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,449
Here's the chicken soup. Finish it.

113
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,449
Why does he still keep it?

114
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:00,889
Are you all right?

115
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,730
Does it still hurt?

116
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,370
I'm fine.

The opposing center was too strong.

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,449
Get Su Muyun to deal with him next time.

194
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:17,770
Why?

195
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:19,089
It'll be so interesting.

196
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,809
Whatever, I won't defend anymore.

197
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:23,169
Qin Yao.

198
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,929
I'll get going now.

199
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,809
Let's have a talk, all right?

200
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,490
We have nothing to talk.

201
00:17:44,209 --> 00:17:46,490
We should at least get things straight
even if we're breaking up.

202
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,169
Fine.

203
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,410
Let's get things straight then.

204
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,370
Don't come looking for me anymore.

205
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,370
As for the past,

206
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:01,010
could you forgive me?

207
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,689
Qi Yuan.

208
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,329
I'm not an idiot.

209
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,490
Look, we've been together for so long.

210
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,250
I don't believe
there are no feelings left between us.

211
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,890
Have we ever been together
in the first place?

212
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,730
In your heart,

213
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,569
I'm just a fallback guy, isn't it?

214
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:13,730
I...

215
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,530
It's not like that.

216
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,890
Qin Yao, listen.

217
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:18,809
Hear me out, Qin Yao.

218
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:20,730
Hear me out.

219
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:22,689
Let go of me.

220
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,010
I won't.

221
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,169
Qin Yao, hear me out.

222
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,569
I broke it off with him already.

223
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,049
I do care about you.

224
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:32,530
Believe me, will you?

225
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:34,770
All right.

226
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,169
Let me show you something.

227
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,361
This is your account, right?

228
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,890
It belongs to you, right?

229
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:48,969
Last night,

230
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:50,289
you were still posting seductive photos.

231
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,370
How am I supposed to believe you?

232
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,049
How did you find out?

233
00:18:57,089 --> 00:18:58,730
Did you peek at my phone?

234
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,250
Don't do it
if you don't want others to know.

235
00:19:04,689 --> 00:19:06,650
How could you do such sneaky thing?

236
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,689
You really let me down!

237
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:09,809
Whatever.

238
00:19:11,209 --> 00:19:13,209
Let's pretend we've never met, all right?

239
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,010
Take care.

240
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:16,209
Qin Yao.

241
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,209
Qin Yao.

242
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,010
Stop touching me!

243
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,544
(Co-Tenancy Agreement)

244
00:19:42,329 --> 00:19:44,689
I have something to discuss with you.

245
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,370
I'm busy now. Leave it to tomorrow.

246
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,370
By the way, help me walk the dog.

247
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,449
Zhou Sang, let's continue.

248
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,610
By the way, the suncream I want...

249
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,049
The report is done. Submit it.

250
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,890
You...

251
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:21,890
Why are you still here?

252
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,449
In case you sleepwalk
and jump off the building.

253
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:25,530
I won't.

254
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,410
There's no window in my room. Remember?

255
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,130
Well...

256
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,610
No need to care for me. I'll walk the dog.

257
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,770
Why do you have to walk her dog again?

258
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,370
Where's your roommate?

259
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,169
What do you mean?

260
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,650
How did you know
I have been walking the dog?

261
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,449
Today

262
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,370
and each time I passed by,

263
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,809
I happened to see you
walking the dog.

264
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,130
You don't stay around here.

265
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,770
How could you pass by?

266
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:12,730
Just now,

267
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,890
you haven't answered my question.

268
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,890
There are so many mosquitoes?

269
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,569
Du Du, are you tired?

270
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:29,689
Su Muyun, Du Du said that it's tired.

271
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,049
I'm taking it home.

272
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,730
I'll give you some time.

273
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,969
I'll wait for you.

274
00:21:41,689 --> 00:21:42,650
Good night.

275
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,921
(Ouyang Group)

276
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,689
Monica, please sign here.

277
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:01,250
Monica, this is the investigation report

278
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,169
for Thomas's experiment. It's done.

279
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,370
All right.

280
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:16,089
The report

281
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,530
is nicely done.

282
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,530
I'm surprised.

283
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:20,770
That's great.

284
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,209
Next,

285
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:24,010
we can proceed as planned now.

286
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:25,089
Is the chairman inside?

287
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,169
He's in the office. You may go inside.

288
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:30,089
This is great.

289
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:31,289
My days of writing the report

290
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,929
weren't in vain.

291
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,209
I've been exhausted for it.

292
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,370
Monica.

293
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,329
Were you the one who did this report?

294
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,130
If it wasn't me,

295
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,089
could it be you then?

296
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,169
You're just an intern.

297
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,289
How could you possibly write
such a professional report?

298
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,890
If so, answer me.

299
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,329
Why the seminar location is set at Tianyi

300
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,730
instead of our research institute?

301
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,281
(Seminar location: Tianyi Group)

302
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:10,010
Why should I answer you?

303
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,410
You're in no position to question me.

304
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,650
I think it's

305
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,650
a good question.

306
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:20,650
I would like to know more.

307
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:23,809
I...

308
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,010
That's because

309
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,929
Tianyi has been studying
dilated cardiomyopathy for many years.

310
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:27,770
They have more comprehensive data

311
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,969
on cardiac resynchronization therapy
and heart transplantation.

312
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,130
Thomas also hopes

313
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,370
we can cooperate with Tianyi for data sharing

314
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,809
through the seminar.

315
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,089
It is of great help to
the research and development of the drug.

316
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:41,809
You did well with the report.

317
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:44,610
Thank you.

318
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:46,969
I would like to seek your permission

319
00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:48,730
on another thing.

320
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,770
What is it?

321
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:52,010
I would like to go to the data room again.

322
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:53,490
There are some supplementary materials

323
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,809
that I haven't found yet.

324
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,010
Sure.

325
00:23:58,329 --> 00:23:59,329
But

326
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,490
you look exhausted.

327
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:03,410
Why don't you take a week off?

328
00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:04,890
It's fine.

329
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,209
Thank you.

330
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,770
Sir, I...

331
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,410
I don't want something like this

332
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,289
to happen again in the future.

333
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:24,089
All right.

334

(Zhuo Yifeng)

335
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:43,969
Are you Le Diyin's relative?

336
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,010
Please come to the hospital.

337
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:46,089
Le Diyin wants to be discharged.

338
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,169
Discharged?

339
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:48,610
Please come as soon as you can.

340
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,010
Why do you want to be discharged?

341
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,770
My condition is stable. I'm good now.

342
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,929
Stable? Are you sure?

343
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,089
I know my own condition.

344
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:06,850
There's no point staying here.

345
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,650
No way.

346
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:10,929
You can't give up.

347
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,730
Thomas's project will kick-start soon.

348
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,370
I'll surely do my best.

349
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,890
It's time to take medicine.

350
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,650
Be good.

351
00:25:20,449 --> 00:25:22,049
Please give it to me. Thanks.

352
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,890
Come here and take the medicine.

353
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,209
Here.

354
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,049
Xiao Feng.

355
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,370
Have you been having trouble at work lately?

356
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:42,569
You seem to have lost weight.

357
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,689
Not really.

358
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,530
Qin Yao and Qi Yuan broke up.

359
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,689
Also...

360
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,410
Su Muyun confessed his love to me.

361
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,250
What? What do you think about it?

362
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,530
Qin Yao talked a lot with me.

363
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:04,569
I liked him so much.

364
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,410
But after the talk,

365
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,449
I felt like I was listening to a long story.

366
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,449
Have you ever thought about it?

367
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,410
Perhaps you didn't like him
that much as you thought.

368
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:16,530
You merely envisioned him

369
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,289
as a perfect lover.

370
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,289
Someone said the same thing too.

371
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,650
Was it Su Muyun?

372
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,130
Xiao Feng.

373
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:30,730
Do you realize that

374
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:32,890
you only treat Su Muyun differently?

375
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:36,569
And Su Muyun is frank

376
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,929
with his feelings for you.

377
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:41,329
You shouldn't talk so much.

378
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,410
Get some rest.

379
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:43,730
I'll get going now.

380
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:49,449
By the way,
don't try to run away again, okay?

381
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,569
All right. I know.

382
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,809
Dr Feng, may I ask

383
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:02,770
about Le Diyin's condition?

384
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,929
It's not optimistic.

385
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:08,370
Without the right medical treatment,

386
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,730
I'm afraid...

387
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,049
All right. I get it.

388
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,169
Thank you.

389
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,969
It's not optimistic.

390
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,449
Without the right medical treatment,

391
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,650
I'm afraid...

392
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:26,650
Why are you here?

393
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:36,049
I'm getting over my ex.

394
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,969
I wanted to grieve alone for a while.

395
00:28:38,209 --> 00:28:39,850
But still, I ran into a familiar face.

396
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,209
Eat up.

397
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,010
I'll send you back after you finish them.

398
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,890
It's not safe being alone at night.

399
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,209
No, thanks.

400
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,089
I can go back on my own.

401
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,049
Talk with me.

402
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,410
It's my first breakup.

403
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,010
I don't have much experience.

404
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,089
Excuse me, I'd like ten chicken wings, please.

405
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,250
And I want them super spicy.

406
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,530
Sure. A moment, please.

407
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:25,490
You can still eat more?

408
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,530
This is my secret weapon.

409
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,089
I'll feel better after eating.

410
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,730
Give it a try.

411
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,370
It's quite good.

412
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,289
Xiao Feng.

413
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,770
Thank you.

414
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:37,289
Thank you for liking me once.

415
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:38,969
Thank you

416
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:41,130
for being with me
at my saddest moment.

417
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,689
Aren't we friends?

418
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,730
Don't mention it.

419
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,010
Xiao Feng.

420
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,370
Can I hold you?

421
00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:00,890
Perhaps

422
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,089
I don't like Qin Yao
as much as I thought

423
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,650
You may have envisioned

424
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:06,410
Qin Yao

425
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,689
as a perfect first love.

426
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,370
Xiao Feng.

427
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,890
Do you realize

428
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,049
you only treat Su Muyun differently?

429
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,130

You don't seem to be doing well.

453
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:16,490
I broke up with her for good.

454
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:18,969
She's been calling me in the past two days

455
00:33:19,089 --> 00:33:20,289
but I didn't answer.

456
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,329
We've been together for years.

457
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,010
I was indeed upset.

458
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:30,289
Do you want water?

459
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:31,569
No, thanks.

460
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:42,650
Why is it with you?

461
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,089
I went for a walk yesterday
and ran into Xiao Feng.

462
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,130
She dropped it when she left.

463
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,410
So I picked it up.

464
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,449
Really?

465
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,250
You ran into each other?

466
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,730
She wasn't in a good mood either.

467
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,209
Qin Yao.

468
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:58,490
She's neither a substitute for anyone

469
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:01,890
nor the fallback girl.

470
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:09,049
What do you mean by that?

471
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,370
Nothing.

472
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,930
I'll return it to her.

473
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:15,690
Whatever.

474
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,329
How about another round?

475
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,450
Of course.

476
00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:25,890
As for the makeup base,

477
00:34:26,049 --> 00:34:27,489
I'll keep it neat.

478
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:29,529
So I'll use the duck egg powder

479
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,329
to set the makeup.

It's so hot while you're
wearing so many clothes.

That's really professional of you.

I'm the one with nothing in life.

00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,410
I'll help you tidy up the things.

511
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:22,650
Let's see.

512
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:26,809
I'm bloated.

513
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:29,089
Look at how thin you've gotten lately.

514
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,769
Didn't Su Muyun care about you?

515
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:34,529
I'm a new independent woman. Get it?

516
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,970
Don't depend on anyone.

517
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,170
Rely on yourself,
and you'll have a good future.

518
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,489
Did Su Muyun give it to you?

519
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,610
I've heard from Qin Yao
that in order to make it,

520
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,769
Su Muyun worked tirelessly

521
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,650
and experimented for
over 100 times.

522
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,489
So it was meant for you?

523
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,289
How do you feel?

524
00:36:57,529 --> 00:36:58,650
Don't you feel touched?

525
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,569
Give it to me if you don't like it.

526
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:10,650
I've been staying single

527
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,529
so long just for him.

528
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,970
My beauty and youth were wasted.

529
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,370
I need to use the washroom.

530
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,450
Come on in.

531
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:04,769
Have some fruits before you leave.

532
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,009
Thank you.

533
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:07,650
I have to go.
I still have things to do.

534
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:16,170
Look.

535
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,170
Let's add each other in WeChat.

536
00:38:19,729 --> 00:38:20,970
Sure.

537
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:29,690
If anything happens to Su Nianfeng,

538
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:30,729
you can let me know.

539
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:31,610
Sure.

540
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,049
Thank you.

541
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,930
So he's been working on the painting?

542
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,249
I never thought

543
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,289
that Su Muyun could be such a

544
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,249
warm-hearted boy with a poker face.

545

(Don't lose it again.)
