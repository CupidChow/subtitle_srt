(Episode 10)

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,959
Bye.

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,559
How is it?

27
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,519
Le Diyin is doing well.

28
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,680
I mean your work today.

29
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
It's excellent.

30
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,519
What did Ouyang Yu say?

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,519
He said a lot. What do you want to know?

32
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,119
If you insist on working for him,

33
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,960
you'll regret for sure.

34
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,520
Yes, I do regret.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,279
I regret that I didn't go there earlier.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
He taught me much practical experience,

37
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:19,240
and even gave me

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,039
the chance to intern at
the company headquarter in the US.

39
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,160
He's even sending me to

40
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,279
the US seminar that I missed because of you.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,559
Do you envy me?

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Don't you think it's strange?

43
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,199
Why?

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,759
Do you think it's not good enough?

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,320
No...

46
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,679
It's the opposite. It's too good.

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,720
Too good to believe it.

48
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,199
Why did he all of a sudden

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,039
treat you so good for no reason?

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,800
How could you come across
so many good things in a row?

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,479
Don't you think it's weird?

52
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,960
Trust me,

53
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,479
don't go.

54
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,730
(Dad)

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,480
(Dad)

56
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,199
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,679
Come in quick!

58
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:27,880
What's the matter?

59
00:03:28,119 --> 00:03:29,080
Zihui!

60
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,160
What's wrong?

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Su Muyun, Su Muyun!

62
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,160
My pajamas are quite old.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,399
And it's not of a luxury brand.

64
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,199
Just make do with it.

65
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,800
Luxury brand

66
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,720
is the most useless thing in the world.

67
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,399
It's too late.

68
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,519
Why don't you call your parents?

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,119
I've had enough.

70
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,359
What's your parent's number?

71
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,920
I'll call them for you.

72
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,519
Here, have some.

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,679
This one is to prevent from catching a cold.

74
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,040
That one is to sober you up.
You have to drink both.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,119
Be good.

76
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,160
After taking them,

77
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,880
you can take a rest here

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,640
and text your parents.

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,320
Otherwise, they'd be worried.

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
What are they doing?

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,760
It's raining so heavily

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,880
and they don't even call to care about you.

83
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't bring up my father.

84
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,679
He doesn't even care if I'm dead or alive.

85
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,200
Dad,

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,799
I don't feel well.

87
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,839
It's alright.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,799
Have some alcohol to warm yourself up.

89
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,760
No, I can't have alcohol recently.

90
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
This is my daughter.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,640
Pretty, right?

92
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,600
Honey, help me

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,079
give three toasts to Mr. Zhao.

94
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,480
You could dress up so nicely,

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,440
and study in such a good university,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
all thanks to Mr. Zhao.

97
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,079
No, you'd call him Uncle Zhao.

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,799
Come on.

99
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,880
Take it.

100
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,679
Hurry up.

101
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,399
Come on now.

102
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
Drink it.

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,320
Drink it up.

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,359
Hurry up.

105
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,079
Come on.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,119
Good.

107
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,519
Stupid girl.

108
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
You'd be doomed back home.

109
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,959
Get up!

110
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,880
You left as you wish.

111
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,040
Have you ever thought of me?

112
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,399
Dad,

113
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,239
I'm really feeling unwell today.

114
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,839
You're just like your mother.

115
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,119
You're useless good-for-nothing!

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,799
Am I really your daughter?

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,760
Or do you only care for money?

118
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,079
How dare you stare at me?

119
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,119
Every cent you spend

120
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,320
is earned by me!

121
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,880
What are you doing?

122
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,200
From now on,

123
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,239
I won't use a single cent of yours.

124
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,359
Stand right there!

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,959
I don't even know where my mom is.

126
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,720
In this world you are the only one

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
who cares about me.

128
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,679
The one who kept me company when I was young

129
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,880
was just a dog.

130
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:48,760
Give it to me.

131
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,280
Return it to me.

132
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Sit there!

133
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,599
What are you crying about?

134
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,119
Do not cry!

135
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,799
Listen up.

136
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,280
In this world, crying

137
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,239
is the most useless thing to do.

138
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,559
Don't be like your mother being a trash.

139
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,280
My mom used to have her own career,

140
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:26,719
but my dad asked her to quit
and be a full-time housewife.

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,239
Then, he despised
that she wasn't making money.

142
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,479
When his business didn't go well,

143
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,719
he beat her up and scolded her.

144
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,039
My mom often cried at night.

145
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,440
When she couldn't take it anymore,

146
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,719
she abandoned me and left alone.

147
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
After that, my dad drank a lot.

148
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,599
He vented his anger on me

149
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,880
because he was upset with my mom.

150
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,599
Whenever he got drunk,

151
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:03,359
he wouldn't treat me as a human being.

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,880
(Mingxian University)

153
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,799
Alright, let's call it a day.

154
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,359
Class is dismissed.

155
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,159
Bestie, let's go eat.

156
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Are you going
to keep addressing me like this?

157
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,000
You're the first one

158
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,000
to get that honored call.

159
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Upon the decision of the
Department of Art of Student Council,

160
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:07,320
a revival round will be added.

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,919
For debaters who are previously eliminated,

162
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,159
in the afternoon of this Sunday,

163
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,559
please gather at the hall
for the competition.

164
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,159
To that hall,

165
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
I've already had a trauma.

166
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,400
Besides, why have I been picked?

167
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,000
Are they waiting
to watch me embarrass myself?

168
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,599
You weren't fully prepared last time.

169
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:22,719
It's different now.

170
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,640
We have four or five days for preparation.

171
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,239
Let's show them what we're made of.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,200
No.

173
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,440
I'm honestly not good at debating.

174
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,520
Hmm, the prize is RMB10,000.

175
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,280
Give it your all for the money.

176
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's go.

177
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,987
(Mingxian University Xingyi Cup
Debate Competition Revival Round)

178
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,440
According to the rules for the revival round,

179
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:44,919
teams are formed by drawing lots.

180
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,840
Two in a team.

181
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,239
(Guest)
The one picked shall not make another draw,

182
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,359
and will be teamed up with
the one who draws the lot.

183
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,359
(Judge)
Your opponents will be assigned on random.

184
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,719
Time for drawing lots.

185
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,159
The competition will start
half an hour later.

186
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Participants please come
to the participant area

187
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,159
to draw your lots.

188
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,919
Let's go, let's draw the lots.

189
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,919
I wonder who I'd team up with.

190
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,719
I hope my partner would be capable.

191
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Xiao Lin,

192
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:11,919
we're a team.

193
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,479
Really?

194
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,559
-Look.
-Let me see.

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
It's true.

196
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,159
That's great.

197
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,720
(Ding Xiaoqing)

198
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:19,880
Xiaoqing.

199
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,679
Hey, have you seen Xiaoqing?

200
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,719
No.

201
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:26,640
Hey, please move aside.

202
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
You're blocking people at the back.

203
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,599
Okay.

204
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,640
Done.

205
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,400
How dare she bully our fairy-like leader?

206
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,039
It serves her right.

207
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,000
Su Nianfeng, where's your teammate?

208
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,200
(Ding Xiaoqing)

209
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,559
Hello, the number you dialed
cannot be reached.

210
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,520
(Ding Xiaoqing)

211
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,599
Hello, the number you dialed
cannot be reached.

212
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,440
Where's her teammate?

213
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,240
Then she has to go one versus two.

214
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,039
According to the rules,
if you don't have a teammate,

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
you have to go one versus two,

216
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,640
or give up directly.

217
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll pick one versus two then.

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,320
One against two?

219
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,719
How dare she choose one versus two?

220
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,799
-One versus two?
-Everyone gets two versus two?

221
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,320
(Judge)
How can she deal with the two?

222
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:27,760
That's too difficult.

223
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:31,479
I'm her teammate.

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,760
But you aren't in the revival round.

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,119
Everyone,

226
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,159
if the opponents win without a fight,

227
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,559
it's not a worthy victory.

228
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,919
To be fair,

229
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,200
and to keep the competition going,

230
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:48,960
we can be democratic.

231
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:51,200
If you support me to join,
please raise your hand.

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,640
I think it's okay.

233
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,240
It's fair that two versus two.

234
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,280
Then I agree. I agree.

235
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
Me too.

236
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,599
I agree.

237
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:04,080
According to poll,
we'll make an exception for you

238
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,359
to join the revival round.

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
Thank you, sir.

240
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:08,400
The debate theme is that

241
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,200
whether immortality to be something good?

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,679
Debaters, please come to me
and draw your lots

243
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,039
to pick your stance.

244
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
( The Opposition)
We don't think that

245
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,080
immortality is something good.

246
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,640
Life is limited. Aging is terrifying.

247
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,440
That's why we should cherish time,

248
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,599
work hard to create endless possibilities.

249
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
Then we wonder

250
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,679
(The Proposition)
the reason why people work hard

251
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,559
is that everyone lives

252
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,280
in fear of limited time, isn't it?

253
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
We've got the result now.

254
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,280
The final score is

255
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,000
78 to 22.

256
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,280
The Opposition wins!

257
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,239
Congratulate the debaters
from the Opposition.

258
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Congratulations.

259
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,679
I'm going to prepare
a good meal today to celebrate.

260
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,400
What are you making?

261
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,000
The first dish is called

262
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,559
"Causing troubles to my brother every day".

263
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,479
This will be it.

264
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,760
The second one is named

265
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,640
"Not following my brother's words

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,880
will make me suffer".

267
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,159
I want ice cream.

268
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,520
Only kids have ice cream.

269
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,599
I'm a kid to myself.

270
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,080
I want the durian flavored ice cream.

271
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,239
It stinks.

272
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,760
I can't help it.
Because you stink.

273
00:15:43,803 --> 00:15:47,282
♪ You told me that there's a rainbow ♪

274
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,159
There's none.

275
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,640
Durian is the most delicious fruit
in the world.

276
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,400
Will there be...

277

♪ You're the one with light inside ♪

278

281
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,679
Thank you.

282
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,000
Congratulations.

283
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,919
You did a good job in the revival round.

284
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,400
Thank you.

285
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,520
I've heard that

286
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,239
you're the one
who recommended me to join.

287
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,479
I was looking for a chance to thank you.

288
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,840
It's nothing.

289
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,280
I've always thought that you're talented.

290
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,640
Also,

291
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,159
I really want

292
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,479
a friend like you.

293
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,719
Me?

294
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,719
It's my birthday party tonight,

295
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,359
a more private one.

296
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,559
Only my friends are invited.

297
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
Would you like to come?

298
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,400
Tonight?

299
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,799
But I don't know your other friends.

300
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
I feel a little awkward.

301
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,039
I'm there, am I not?

302
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,719
Don't worry.

303
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,119
It's fine. We're free anyway.

304
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,760
I'll go with you tonight.

305
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,439
Whether it's a bunny or a wolf,

306
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
we'll only know it when we go there.

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Sure, of course you're welcomed.

308
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,439
Xiao Feng's friend

309
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,160
is mine too.

310
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
See you tonight then.

311
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,040
Let's go.

312
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,439
You're the first

313
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,079
girl who I've brought home.

314
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,520
Really? Thank you.

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,280
By the way, Qingxue said

316
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,760
It's a private party.

317
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:39,599
Don't let others know.

318
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,199
Why do you address her so close?

319
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,680
Listen up,

320
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,800
she is definitely not someone easy.

321
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,239
Be careful.

322
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,839
I know.

323
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,079
How about this one?

324
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,439
It looks beautiful.

325
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,359
I've never worn something like this.

326
00:18:08,479 --> 00:18:10,199
Let's go, let's go meet them.

327
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:18,373
(BHG Market Place)

328
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:35,496
(Hualian Market Place)

329
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,680
What do you think?

330
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,880
I think so.

331
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
Beautiful dress.

332
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,560
-You look gorgeous today.
-Thanks

333
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,719
Will she like this gift?

334
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,439
Don't worry.

335
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,359
Don't you have confidence in my taste?

336
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,400
Hi everyone.

337
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Welcome to my birthday party.

338
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,959
All the alcohol and drinks today

339
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,839

Help yourselves.
Drink as much as you want.

341
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,199
-Okay. Happy birthday!
-Let's have fun.

342
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:27,760
Thank you.

343
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,839
-That's blatant bragging.
-Cheers!

344
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,079
I won't make it easy for her.

345
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,680
Happy birthday.

346
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,199
Xiao Feng.

347
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,199
It's great to see you.

348
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,439
I was worried that you wouldn't come.

349
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,280
Happy birthday. This is for you.

350
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,520
Thank you.

351
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,520
Oh yeah, have you made a wish?

352
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,439
The first wish of this year is...

353
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Follow me.

354
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,560
Liu Zihui, she...

355
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,479
Don't be afraid.

356
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
I'll send you back safe and sound.

357
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,400
Let's go.

358
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,277
(Durian flavored ice cream)

359
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,959
Come on.

360
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,640
I want to surprise her.

361
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,640
I've searched eight supermarkets
to find you.

362
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,199
Su Muyun,

363
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,319
we're at Ouyang Qingxue's birthday party.

364
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:37,680
Your sister is taken away.

365
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,160
-Come in and have a seat.
-Okay.

366
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,760
Have a seat here.

367
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,359
Sit.

368
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,479
Let me give you a present first.

369
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,079
Present?

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,880
Mr. Zhuo.

371
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
Why did the fund chain of the Zhuo Group

372
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,719
go wrong?

373
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,880
I've made a wrong decision.

374
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,199
I believed in the wrong people.

375
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,239
Mr. Zhuo, do you mean...

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,280
They're my best friends,

377
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr. and Mrs. Su Zijian.

378
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
No...

379
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,680
This... It can't possibly be true.

380
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,959
I don't believe it.

381
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,199
Zhuo Yifeng,

382
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,439
you're clever.

383
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,359
Think about it on your own.

384
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,920
Why did the Su Family adopt you?

385
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,520
Su Muyun's parents and yours

386
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,479
were college friends.

387
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,119
They started a business together afterwards.

388
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,920
But when the company
met a severe financial crisis,

389
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,319
your parents got into a car accident.

390
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:41,800
Both of them passed away,

391
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,199
leaving you alone.

392
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,520
Are all these just a coincidence?

393
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,280
Why do you think
the Su Family would adopt you?

394
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,479
Is it because of guilt?

395
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,359
Why would they feel guilty then?

396
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,000
No.

397
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,479
That's impossible!

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
It's impossible.

399
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,839
They'd never kill my parents.

400
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,079
Impossible.

401
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,439
I've said that

402
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,640
this alcohol is wonderful.

403
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,800
She can't drink.

404
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,959
Stop drinking.

405
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,479
Stop drinking.

406
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,479
Why do you think
the Su Family would adopt you?

407
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,239
Is it because of guilt?

408
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,400
Why would they feel guilty then?

409
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,079
Qingxue, are you alright?

410
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,880
Do you know how pathetic you are now?

411
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,719
Do you think
that Su Muyun cares about you?

412
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,880
He's just atoning for his parents' sin.

413
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,280
Do you know who Ouyang Yu is?

414
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,880
He's my biological elder brother.

415
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,319
Why do you think he's so nice to you?

416
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,199
Because you're so pitiful.

417
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,560
He's just taking pity on you.

418
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,920
I really can't bear

419
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,680
to see you being bluffed,

420
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,160
imaging that you're loved.

421
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:29,160
That is the worst tragedy.

422
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,400
But...

423
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,000
It's your fate.

424
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,439
Don't be scared. Let's go home.

425
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,199
Take good care of Xiao Feng.

426
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,359
I'm very worried about her.

427
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,599
No matter how lavishly you dress,

428
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,680
how elegant and proper you behave,

429
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,119
the ugliness of your heart
cannot be concealed.

430
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
You disgust me.

431
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,959
You'll never understand how good she is,

432
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:20,760
just like you'll never understand
what kindness is.

433
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,400
I hope that you can stay away from us.

434
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,040
I don't want to see you ever again.

435
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,959
Behave yourself.

436
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,359
Don't gloat.

437
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,439
You won't have a good end.

438
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,359
I...

439
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,079
Qingxue, Qingxue.

440
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,719
What do you know?

441
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,199
Tell me.

442
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,439
What is the truth?

443
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,640
Xiao Feng, calm down first.

444
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,319
Don't touch me!

445
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,239
If you knew that your biological families

446
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,599
were killed by

447
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:36,959
those who adopted you

448
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,880
and lived with you every day,

449
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,920
how could you ever calm down?

450
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,280
That's not true.

451
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,439
Don't come over!

452
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,400
I've always thought that

453
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,280
I'm loved.

454
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,439
I see all of you as

455
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,839
my most beloved family.

456
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,560
But it's all fake.

457
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,640
Tell me, why!

458
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,520
I...

459
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,959
I beg you.

460
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,079
I'm begging you.

461
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,199
Please,

462
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:08,520
tell me.

463
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,880
How did my parents die?

464
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,800
I beg you to tell me.

465
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,439
Xiao Feng, calm down.

466
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,560
-Calm down first, Xiao Feng.
-Why?

467
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,640
Tell me.

468
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,719
Why did you treat me like this?

469
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,199
Why?

470
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,479
Sorry.

471
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,880
Dad and mom didn't hurt your parents.

472

Lucky.

511

00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,800
Let's go, we're going home.

513
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,000
Don't run away anymore.

514
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,280
I see...

515
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,599
I'm the only one without a home.

516
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,479

519
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,479

Stop it, stop hitting him.

559
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
Mr. Zhuo, do you mean...

560
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,800
They're my best friends,

561
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
Mr. and Mrs. Su Zijian.

562
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,679
Isn't that interesting?

563
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,919
This is the photo
of your biological parents

564
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,919
with Mr. and Mrs. Su.

565
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,080
This is vehicle assessment report

566
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,879
(Vehicle Maintenance Agreement)
your parents' accident.

567
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,239
The report said that

568
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,719
the car was tampered with.

569
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,159
This

570
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,479
is even more interesting.

571
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,479
The equity transfer agreement

572
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:45,439
(Equity Transfer Agreement)
was drafted before they got into an accident.

573
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,199
Think about it.

574
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,800
Who got your parents' share in the end?

575
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,679
Stop.

576
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,479
I don't believe it.

577
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,280
Xiao Feng,

578
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,919

579
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,439
How could I see you being deceived?

580
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,439
I don't want to know.

581
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,000
The equity was obtained by Mr. and Mrs. Su.

582
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,399
Do you think

583
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,360
it is a coincidence,

584
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,199
Zhuo Yifeng?

585
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,159
It's impossible.

589
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,520

Let's go to the hospital.

592
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,159
I'll call the doctor to our house.

593
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,639
House...

594
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:43,520
