00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,519
The television is not turned on.

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,559
Are you playing the games in your mind?

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Thank you.

28
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,559
I really want to thank you.

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Thanks for sending the video to Le Diyin.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,399
It has not only motivated him,
but also me.

31
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,399
Stop fidgeting.

32
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,039
Don't be shy.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,639
I'm not.

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,800
You're the best Su Muyun in the world.

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,160
Do you know

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,279
Le Diyin will head to America for treatment?

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,320
Wish him good health.

38
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,720
I've never thought you'd say something nice.

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,279
Same to you.

40
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,559
Hope you'll feel better soon.

41
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,520
I feel demotivated not because of
my poor exam results.

42
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,240
It's because
whenever I think about my future,

43
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:33,199
I feel lost as if it's an illusion.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
Think about what you really want to do.

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,399
Perhaps I'm not confident in myself.

46
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,199
Aren't you so eager to study medicine?

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
It's not easy

48
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,000
to get into the medical college.

49
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,080
Getting into a medical college

50
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,960
is of too much difficulty to me.

51
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,240
How do you know if you don't try?

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,919
I can't get into the medical college

53
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,639
is just like you can't cook.

54
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,080
Everyone has his own weakness.

55
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,839
Go to sleep.

56
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,399
It's not a dream.

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,720
If it was, it would be an
invincible sweet dream.

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Takeout service began so early?

59
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,959
Look carefully.

60
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,640
I made it.

61
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm not eating.

62
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,079
I'm not eating.

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
Did you ask others to help you?

64
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,119
Look.

65
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,600
I did it.

66
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,760
What?

67
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,519
As long as we put in efforts,

68
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
we can turn our weakness into strength.

69
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:50,839
I can cook delicious meal.

70
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,799
You can get into medical college too.

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Have you been awake the whole night?

72
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,000
To be precise,

73
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,799
I slept for 2 hours.

74
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,559
Why do you think you can't make it?

75
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,519
Let's have a try.

76
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,359
It begins today.

77
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,079
What are you looking at?

78
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,720
Why are you getting more handsome?

79
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm handsome all along.

80
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,279
Speaking of the essay titled "My Future",

81
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,959
everyone has written well,

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,559
particularly Su Nianfeng.

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,559
She aspires to become a doctor.

84
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,959
Her essay is very touching.

85
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,679
You may have a look after the class

86
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,079
and learn from each other.

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,399
Su Muyun.

88
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
No one has the right

89
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,239
to despise the dreams of others.

90
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,119
A person shines

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,079
not when he talks about his dream,

92
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,239
but in the process of making efforts.

93
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,320
I believe that Su Nianfeng can realize it

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,359
because I've personally witnessed

95
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,600
her growth and transformation.

96
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,839
Well said. Please sit down.

97
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,559
Su Nianfeng is courageous.

98
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,959
Keep it up. I believe in you.

99
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,200
Su Nianfeng

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,880
amazed everyone
with the impromptu recitation.

101
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,000
Not to mention
the College Entrance Examination.

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a piece of cake, right?

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm everyone. I can prove it.

104
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,160

(My Love from the Star)

108
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,479
This is the past perfect tense,

109
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,919
indicating something was done
before another point in the past

110
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,719
Got it!

111
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
So the answer is D.

112
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,640
You do it yourself first.

Alright.

115

Haven't I taught you

116
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,000
it yesterday?

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,559
That was at 2:30am.

118
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,359
I was too sleepy to remember.

119
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,960
What's the use of teaching a sleepy me?

120
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
Just leave if you don't want to stay.

121
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,919
Why you followed me here, stalker?

122
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,599
I'm here to supervise your study.

123
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,159
Younger brother, you're too radical.

124
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,159
You don't suit an old woman like me.

125
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,960
If you don't work hard in your senior year,

126
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,119
you'll suffer in college entrance examination.

127
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,559
Le Diyin, I don't know
how to solve this question.

128
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,440
I'll teach you.

129
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,760
I've taught you

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,280

When we're asleep, our body functions,

136
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,919
except the central nervous system,

137
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,880
are generally lowered down.

138
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,679
It's too complicated to get it.

139
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,239
I've looked into the matter

140
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,840
you mentioned earlier in the ward.

141
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,239
The symptoms are very similar to sleepwalking.

142
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,599
To put it simply,

143
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,960
your mind is asleep

144
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,679
but your body is still awake.

145

Trying to frighten me again?

148
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,719
Are you mad?

149
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,359
You're so noisy.

150
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,200
You sneaked into

151
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
my private space.

152
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,840
Do you think I want to?

153
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,679
Where are my slippers?

154
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,479
The symptoms are very similar to sleepwalking.

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Su Muyun,

156
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,679
did I sleepwalk at night?

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,640
I don't know.

158
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,359
What should I do?

159
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,280
Watch less K-drama.

160
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,159
Don't read too much of web novels.

161
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,280
You're thinking too much.

162

Sleeping in class again?

163
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,080
I didn't sleep.

164
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
Who saw it?

165
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,400
Do you have proof?

166
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,119
The school organises a museum trip tomorrow.

167
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Let's go together.

168
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:41,400
Museum? What time is it?

169
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,080
It was mentioned in the class just now.

170
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,599
Do you still refuse
to admit you slept in class?

00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,919
It's an entrapment.

172
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,200
Wipe your saliva away.

173
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,743
(Yangzhou Science & Technology Museum)

174
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:09,840
Where are they?

175
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,311
(Qin Yao.)

176
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,039
Where are you?

177
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,679
We're at the Life and Science Museum.
How about you?

178
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,840
You got mistaken.

179
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,400
The trip is to the Natural Science Museum.

180
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,679
Su Muyun.

181
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,919
Anyway, you know nothing of the two.

182
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,479
I will go to Natural Science Museum.

183
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:50,347
(About sleepwalking)

184
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,280
Have you been here before?

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

186
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,719
Su Nianfeng,

187
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,799
read it out for me.
I can't see it clearly.

188
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,559
You've a better eyesight.

189
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,640
And you asked someone
with poorer eyesight to read for you?

190
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,119
Have you got no shame?

191
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,359
There are 2 processes

192
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,799
in brain activity,
excitement and suppression.

193
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,840
When we're asleep,

194
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,119
the cells of the cerebral cortex

195
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:24,280
are in the suppression state.

196
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,960
If one or several groups of nerve cells
for body movement

197
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,400
are active at this time,

198
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,640
it'll cause a state of excitement,

199
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,960
leading to sleepwalking.

200
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,119
Sleepwalking.

201
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,679
The sleepwalker won't be aware of it.

202
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,578
(Sleepwalking should be prevented and treated.)

203
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,880
Mingxian University, Department of Medicine,

204
00:14:54,888 --> 00:14:55,608
(Hi! I'm Su...)

205
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,520
Hi, I'm Su Nianfeng.

206
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,719
What are you doing?
Are you photographing me behind?

207
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,080
Why would I do so?

208
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,159
Whatever, as you like it.

209
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,479
Can you take a picture of me with the book?

210
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,080
I want to send it to Le Diyin.

211
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,320
The battery is dead.

212
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:25,320
I've seen that

213
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,080
there's still 85% of battery left.

214
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,359
Give me your phone.

215
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,239
Give it to me.

216
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:36,039
(Le Diyin)
I went to Life and Science Museum today.

217
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
I've decided to get into medical college.

218
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Thank you.

219
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm confident in you. Fighting!

220
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:52,760
I didn't manage to take the picture.

221
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,320
What should I give him before he leaves?

222
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,128
(Little eyes)

223
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,880
Little eyes.

224
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,119
Super seller, I need your advice.

225
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,640
What's the most meaningful farewell gift

226
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,679
for a friend?

227
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,400
Give what he likes.

228
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:24,559
An e-reader.

229
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,960
It's so expensive.

230
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,320
A friendly reminder.

231
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,239
You might get a brand-new one

232
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,840
at the online second-hand stores.

233
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,280
You can get to see if you're short of money.

234
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,200
Thank you so much.

235
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,760
Remember to give me
exclusive information about your brother.

236
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,400
We can win-win.

237
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,119
Okay.

238
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,839
RMB500 should be enough.

239
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,319
RMB500?

240
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,000
Isn't it only 600CNY left
for living expenses?

241
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:35,920
You and your brother
can eat leftovers and barks.

242
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,400
You can eat soil If it doesn't work out.

243
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,800
It can supplement
various vitamins and minerals.

244
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,479
You won't die.

245
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,680
Older sister should love her younger brother.

246
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,400
Besides, embezzlement of
public funds is a crime.

247
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,800
Dad and mom might spare you.

248
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,119
But can you forgive yourself?

249
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,920
Are you still thinking about the money?

250
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,239
What can be solved with money

251
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,560
is not a problem.

252
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,119
I'll lend it to you.

253
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,599
Lending money can hurt relationship.

254
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
What about

255
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,640
you choose a cheaper gift?

256
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Make do with it.

257
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,400
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

258
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,000
No, he's my best friend.

259
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,520
I can't make do.

260
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,160
Where can I get RMB500?

261
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,319
Have a look.

262
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,839
(Character model)
The art studio is looking for models.

263
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,239
No limit to age, appearance,

264
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,439
weight and height.

265
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,400
Able-bodied. RMB250 for 4 hours.

266
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,560
Only a fool will believe this.

267
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,040
Able-bodied.

268
00:18:48,199 --> 00:18:49,760
I'm able-bodied. I can have a try.

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
RMB250 for 4 hours.

270
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,839
RMB500 for 8 hours.

271
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,719
There is always a way out.

272
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,719
Didn't you watch the news recently?

273
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,079
Many young girls
have mysteriously disappeared.

274
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,760
All of them are innocent like you.

275
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,839
Lovely and adorable.

276
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,680
Easily tricked.

277
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,239
Forget it. Let's talk about something good.

278
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
Let's have a drink.

279
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,359
Renmin East Lane No. 25.

280
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,640
1209.

281
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,199
You got 3 answers wrong
in multiple choice questions in physics.

282
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,000
Come over.

283
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,359
I'll teach you.

284
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,560
Liu Zihui and I

285
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,359
have formed a learning support group.

286
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,119
I'm heading out to teach her.

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You're teaching Liu Zihui?

288
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,199
Does she lose her mind learning from you?

289
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,719
Do you want to come along?

290
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,880
Liu Zihui will surely welcome you.

291
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,920
Goodbye.

292
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Hi.

293
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,680
Are you Su Nianfeng?

294
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,439
I'm Tang.

295
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,959
I'm the person-in-charge.

296
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,680
Doesn't it start at 10am?

297
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,439
It's already 9.55am.

298
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,319
Just in case you'd be late.

299
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,719
So we'll start at 10.30am sharp.

300
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:54,479
The students will arrive soon.

301
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,959
Take a seat there.

302
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,920
The teacher will share more
specific requirements.

303
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,119
Alright.

304
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,520
Do you want a drink?

305
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,839
No, thank you.

306
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,800
Look for me if you need anything.

307
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,439
Let's settle the payment.

308
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,479
This is today's reward.

309
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,880
RMB500 for 8 hours. Check it out.

310
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,599
Thank you.

311
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
By the way,

312
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,719
we have

313
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,680
a high-end art studio upstairs,

314
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,199
open only to professional artists.

315
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,920
If you're interested...

316
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,280
No, there's no need.

317
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,319
My class schedule is tight.
I don't have much time.

318
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,359
Besides, I only need RMB500.

319
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,520
It's getting late.

320
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,119
It's quite remote here.

321
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,199
What about I send you home?

322
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,719
It's dangerous to go home alone.

323
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,640
Wait a moment.

324
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,160
I'll take a small gift for you.

325
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,079
Be careful.

326
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,319
Many young girls

327
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:30,400
have mysteriously disappeared recently.

328
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,120
Be alert.

329
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,800
This sort of advertisement is a trap.

330
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,719
Where's Su Nianfeng?

331
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
I don't know.

332
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,119
She's not with me.

333
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,599
She's not with you?

334
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,000
It can't be.

335
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
Has she gone to the art studio for modelling?

336
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,640
What?

337
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:05,719
Recently, many young girls

338
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
have mysteriously disappeared.

339
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,880
(Young girls disappeared at night)
The police is investigating the case

340
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,839
and would like to remind everyone

341
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,239
(Qinghe Art Studio)
to avoid going out alone late at night.

342
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,439
If you need to head out,

343
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,199
you must be careful.
Or get someone to go together.

344
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,400
This is your childhood favorite.

345
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,040
I lost my doll once

346
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,800
and you gave this to me.

347
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,640
It's a proof for our sibling affection.

348
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,959
No one is in the art studio.

349
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:03,400
Does it belong to Xiao Feng?

350
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,199
Has she bumped into a pervert?

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,439
Why are you mad at me?

352
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,119
Let's find her separately.

353
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,319
Miss.

354
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,359
Miss, wake up.

355
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,439
Hi, did you see a girl of this height,

356
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,959
wearing a white blouse

357
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,880
and carrying a backpack?

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,800
No.

359
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,439
Hi, did you see a girl of this height,

360
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,800
wearing a white blouse

361
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,880
and carrying a backpack?

362
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,199
No, I never saw her.

363
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,068
(Su Muyun)

364
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:49,493
(Share real-time location)

365
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,040
Did you see

366
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,520
-a girl with a backpack?
-No.

367
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,400
Mister, thank you.

368
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
It's fine. She fainted

369
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:15,680
once she got into the car.

370
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,160
I don't know what happened.

371
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,560
So I decided to send her to the hospital.

372
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,479
Thank you.

373
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:21,599
It's fine.

374
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,479
You're awake.

375
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:48,920
Su Muyun, I'm sorry.

376
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,359
It's good that you're alright.

377
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,280
Su Nianfeng,

378
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,800
it's good that you're alright.

379
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,760
Did you know

380
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,280
Su Muyun was worried about you so much?

381
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,839
I'm fine. Let me down.

382
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,479
I'll get inside.

383
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,239
She's fine. Go home.

384
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,560
Call for me if there's anything.

385
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,239
Don't turn the light off.

386
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
I'm afraid.

387
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,959
Don't be afraid.

388
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:05,079
I'll keep you company.

389
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,520
You don't need to.

390
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,199
I want to cool down alone.

391
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,479
I'll turn the light off when I sleep.

392
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,008
(English)

393
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,239
Help me.

394
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,079
Su Muyun.

395
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,239
Su Muyun.

396
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,560
Help me.

397
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,079
Help me.

398
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
I'm here.

399
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,119
I'm sorry.

400
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:32,040
I shouldn't have lied to you yesterday.

401
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,959
Do you feel better now?

402
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm fine.

403
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,839
Yesterday, the head of the art studio

404
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,800
offered to send me home.

405
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,880
I felt a little scared.

406
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:47,640
So I took a taxi home.

407
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,920
Never lie to me again.

408
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:55,040
I just wanted to earn RMB500

409
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,400
to buy a gift for Le Diyin.

410
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,880
I only have this one friend.

411
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,520
He'll be leaving soon.

412
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,119
I don't know

413
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,920
when I'll see him again.

414
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
Don't do it again.

415
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,880
Got it.

416
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
I promise.

417
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,920
Let's head home together tonight

418
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,280
and video call dad and mum.

419
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,560
Really? That's great.

420
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,319
Did you

421
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,800
tell on me?

422
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,479
I don't give it a damn.

423
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm just asking. Don't be angry.

424
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,199
I'll cook delicious dinner, alright?

425
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
Su Nianfeng,

426
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,680
with such a younger brother,

427
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,920
I guess you don't need
the air-con in the summer.

428
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
Xiao Feng,

429
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,560
are you stressed out in your study?

430
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:01,640
Why do you look so haggard?

431
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,439
No, I'm fine.

432
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,920
Although study is important,

433
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,719
you should take care of yourself.

434
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,760
It doesn't matter if you flunk.

435
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,079
We will take care of you.

436
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:12,079
Right, Su?

437
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:13,479
Yes, we'll hang up.

438
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:14,359
Alright.

439
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,880
I'll do revision in my room.

440
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:35,199
The formula for straight line equation is

441
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:39,439
Ax+By+C=0

442
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:44,079
-The coordinate of point P is (x0 y0).
-She has improved.

443
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:46,400
Connect the point outside the line

444
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,040
with the points on the straight line

445
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,479
(Don't worry. I'll take care of her.)
to get the shortest vertical line.

446
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,199
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

447
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,640
How's it? Not bad, right?

448
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,560
It looks average.

449
00:32:22,479 --> 00:32:23,920
You cannot taste it.

450
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,280
This cake is called "To Old Friend".

451
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,920
It's for Le Diyin.

452
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,119
I'm going to the hospital.

453
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,800
Where are you going?

454
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:48,920
The hospital.

455
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,839
I will not bring you here.

456
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,280
I want to visit the patient too.

457
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,800
Are both of you that close?

458
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,839
Here,

459
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,359
a farewell gift for you.

460
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,719
Open it.

461
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,079
Do you like it?

462
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Yes.

463
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,119
She almost lost her life

464
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,800
to earn money to buy this gift.

465
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,439
Shut up.

466
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,079
I made

467
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,280
this cake.

468
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,839
Let's take a picture?

469
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,439
It looks unappetizing.

470
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,439
It's not for you.

471
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,560
I saw Liu Zihui's post

472
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,280
few days back. She was looking for you.

473
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,359
What's the matter?

474
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,560
It is

475
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,199
just a blunder.

476
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,880
But I'm particularly worried
about another thing.

477
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,359
At that day,

478
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,520
I fainted in the taxi

479
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,280
and dreamt of a car accident.

480
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,560
It felt like I'd personally experienced it.

481
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,560
Read less

482
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
trash novels.

483
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,120
What trash novels are you talking about?

484
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,760
The ones I read are serious literature.

485
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't say anything if you don't know.

486
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,199
What are you doing?

487
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,280
Living with an Overbearing Devil.

488
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,040
Is this serious literature?

489
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:36,919
Give it back.

490
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,520
-The Most Respected Man.
-Give it back.

491
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,479
-The Overbearing CEO Has Fallen for Me.
-Give it back, Su Muyun.

492
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,560
Give it back to me.

493
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,199
Are you giving it back or not?

494
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,800
Where's mine? Don't stand before me.

495
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:51,959
I'll take the exam at our school.

We won't be in the same room
for the examination.

502
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,639
We can't give our three-year high school

503
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,040
a perfect end.

504
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,199
I'm really sorry for that.

Loosen it.

523
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:14,439
Are you going to listen or not?

524
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,479

531
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,399
Everyone,

532
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,679
please be quiet.

533
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,520
These custom folders are bought

534
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,639
with our remaining class fund.

535
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,159
Wish everyone

536
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:53,760
a smooth journey in your youthful dream.

537
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:56,520
Great!

538
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,080
I'll hand them out now.

539
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,199
Su Muyun.

540
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,120
Su Nianfeng.

541
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,280
I'll put them here.

542
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Monitor, where's mine?

543
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,959
Don't worry. Everyone has one.

544
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,199
That's mine. You mistook it.

545
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,040
Exchange it with me. Any question?

546
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,479
Su Muyun's folder

547
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,840
is way more powerful than the amulet.

548
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:17,800
Give it to me if you don't want it.

549
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,479
No, I want it.

550
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,159
Why so messy?

551
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,520
I'll tidy them up for you.

552
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,199
Why did you leave so many blanks?

553
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:31,399
There's no need.

554
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,879
What's so strange about this?

555
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,479
I have a few new books too.

556
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,399
Do you want them?

557
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,399
Do you want them?

558
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
A genius relies on

559
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,439
one percent of effort

560
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,600
and 99 percent of talent.

561
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,959
We ordinary ones won't understand it.

562
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,080
Sis.

563
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,320
Me?

564
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Come over.

565
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,560
Sister, this is our graduation gift

566
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,600
for Su Muyun.

567
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
We've carefully prepared for them.

568
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll relay your best wishes to him.

569
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,639
But you may keep the gifts.

570
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,919
He doesn't deserve your gifts.

571
00:38:11,399 --> 00:38:12,959
No, sis.

572
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,199
I've no hope
to get into Tsinghua University.

573
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,000
But look at this doll.

574
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,760
It looks so much like me.

575
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,120
I hope it can keep Su Muyun company

576
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,560
at Tsinghua University.

577
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,639
Sis, please.

578
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,879
Tsinghua University?

579
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
Su Muyun got into Tsinghua University?

580
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,760
Su Muyun

581
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
is very likely to
be recommended into Tsinghua.

582
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,199
We got a peek at the dean's office.

583
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,719
Sis, please keep it to yourself.

584
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,679
Please help us with the gift.

585
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,719
I'm leaving now.

586
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,000
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

587
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,760
Tsinghua University?

588
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,719
I'd never get into that university.

589
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,399
What sudden happiness.

590
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,919
I heard that you've been
recommended to Tsinghua.

591
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Who told you?

592
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,800
Fine, you're hiding the good news from me.

593
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,719
Su Nianfeng,

594
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,000
do you want me

595
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,800
to study at Tsinghua?

596
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,239
That...

597
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:37,479
Of course.

598
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:40,280
Tsinghua is the dream of many people.

599
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,600
I wish you'll stand out
from the rest and succeed.

600
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,479
How about you?

601
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:46,760
Me?

602
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,439
Are you going?

603
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,439
My results are way below the requirements.

604
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,360
You should

605
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:55,800
take care of yourself when you're there.

606
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,919
Be nice to others.
Don't cause trouble.

607
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,399
Such a long distance between us.

608
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,520
We can only contact each other
via the phone.

609
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,639
I don't know if I'm accepted yet.

610
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,679
Don't get so excited now.

611
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,560
Dad, mum.

612
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,639
When did you come back?

613
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,800
Xiao Feng.

614
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:18,679
-You're home.
-I miss you so much.

615
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,679
Your College Entrance Examination
is around the corner.

616
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,679
I told your dad that

617
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,120
whatever things we have,

618
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,040
we must come home to cheer for you.

619
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,679
How's the preparation?

620
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:28,919
What a nuisance.

621
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,600
Why did you ask them like that?

622
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,360
She'd be stressed.

623
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,439
Alright.

624
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,439
Come, sit down.

625
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,360
Come, give me your bag.

626
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:41,879
Alright.

627
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,719
Xiao Yun, sit down.

628
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,080
Dear, bring the dishes over.

629
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,280
Here.

630
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,239
Sit.

631
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,360
Here.

632
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,679
Since we're gathering here today,

633
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:56,000
we'd like to celebrate
for both of you in advance.

634
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:59,080
Wish you a smooth examination
and good results.

635
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,399
-Cheers.
-Smooth examination.

636
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,639
Get good results.

637
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,760
98

638
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,159
99

639
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,360
Wouldn't it be great if it was a movie?

640
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,439
Ten years would pass with a scene cut.

641
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,239
Su Nianfeng is now one of the
top ten doctors in the city.

642
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,840
Benevolent, super skilled in treatment.

643
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:31,399
I've already decided to rest.

644
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Let's talk about it after
the College Entrance Examination.

645
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,639
Open the door quick.

646
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,080
Otherwise, I'll kick it open.
