[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,009
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Your wife's face was so pale.

4
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,530
Yeah.

5
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,160
Our brother was living,
breathing, and energetic.

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,480
And he's gone just like that.

7
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,470
When Kaizhi died,

8
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,060
were you at the scene or not?

9
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,810
Are you suspecting me?

10
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,630
Answer me.

11
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,160
Were you

12
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,110
there or not?

13
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,900
Would you believe me if I said no?

14
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,290
We're both well aware that

15
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,870
only one person wanted Yang Kaizhi dead

16
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,130
more than anyone else.

17
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,220
That was your Mr. Yuan.

18
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,490
Nope.

19
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
If Kaizhi had succeeded and made

20
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,560
the Sixth Division join forces

21
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,750
with Zhang Shaozeng, Lan Tianwei,

22
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,290
and Yan Xishan in Shanxi,

23
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,570
upholding the uprising banner

24
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,600
and marching straight to Beijing,

25
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,110
would you, Liang Xiang, Liang Tufang,

26
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,310
have tolerated that?

27
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,730
Didn't you want to get rid of him too?

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,280
That's true.

29
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,710
Ever since I met Kaizhi,

30
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,950
he had been living on the edge.

31
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,750
After all these years,

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,360
he still didn't let go of his obsession.

33
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,600
What could we do about it?

34
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,250
There was nothing we could do.

35
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,020
I tried my best to persuade him,

36
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,460
but he never listened.

37
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,430
Actually...

38
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,240
Actually, I knew this day

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,770
would come sooner or later.

40
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,620
I knew it long ago.

41
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,050
I hinted to him so many times that

42
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,459
he must abandon his ideals.

43
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,630
He said

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,760
he wasn't afraid of death.

45
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,960
They're just that kind of people

46
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,190
who'd rather sacrifice their lives

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,000
than give up their lofty faith.

48
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,960
If they're deprived of it,

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,680
they won't survive even a day.

50
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,870
You're so right.

51
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah, that's it.

52
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,990
Yang Kaizhi was fortunate, you know.

53
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,910
He never gave up

54
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,070
his pious belief till his last breath.

55
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,460
Could you and I do that?

56
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,460
Could you, Li Renjun, do that?

57
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,080
Is it necessary?

58
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,220
I, Li Renjun, live a simple life.

59
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,950
Where there are benefits,

60
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,680
you'll find me raking in money.

61
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,950
So you switched sides to serve

62
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,220
Mr. Yuan again, huh?

63
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,460
Since my first day
in the Wuwei Corps Right Division,

64
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,580
my heart

65
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,590
has never betrayed him even once.

66
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,150
What do you mean
by "switched sides to serve"?

67
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,740
Then you bet on the right one.

68
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,030
Tufang,

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,710
let me speak from the bottom of my heart.

70
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,040
The reason I came all the way to Beijing

71
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,040
and hurried to your house
without going anywhere else

72
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,520
was to tell you one thing.

73
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,580
What's that?

74
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,040
Be more flexible.

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,710
We've already lost one brother.

76
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,210
I, Li Renjun, don't want to lose you too.

77
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Flexible?

78
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,630
How can I be flexible?

79
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,680
You seriously still

80
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,610
can't tell from the situation now?

81
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,750
Who can save the world

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,830
is already self-evident.

83
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,710
Your Mr. Yuan again?

84
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,290
Didn't Kaizhi's death

85
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,530
hit you hard enough, Tufang?

86
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,340
What do you mean?

87
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,200
Be more flexible.

88
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,659
You know what I mean.

89
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,440
Brilliant talent draws
envy and the urge to destroy.

90
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,470
A proud and unyielding spirit
finds no place in the world.

91
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,070
By decree of the Empress Dowager.

92
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,630
According to
the Prince Regent's personal report,

93
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,630
it's been three years since he

94
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,750
assumed the regency.

95
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,240
His appointments and governance
have often gone against public opinion.

96
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,870
The establishment of a constitution
ended up mere empty talk,

97
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,870
causing abundant malpractices
and maladies,

98
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,390
leading to the disintegration of people

99
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,870
and the fall of national strength.

100
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,030
One person's misguided measures

101
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,510
caused terrible misfortune
to the entire nation.

102
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,030
In deep grief and agony,
he found it too late to regret.

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,390
If he continues to hold onto power

104
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,870
and remains regent

105
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,120
without considering stepping down,

106
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,240
his imperial edicts won't work

107
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,390
since he's lost people's trust.

108
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,810
How can politics be expected to improve?

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
He tearfully requests to resign

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
from the position of Prince Regent

111
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,000
and will no longer interfere
in state affairs.

112
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,240
The Prince Regent is kind, gentle,

113
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,150
cautious, and careful.

114
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,270
Though his desire for good governance

115
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,240
and his lack of flexibility

116
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,870
[Emperor Xuantong, Aisin Gioro Pu Yi]

117
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,630
has led to him being deceived and misled,

118
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,230
bringing harm to the masses,

119
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,870
his request should still be fulfilled.

120
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,330
[Empress Dowager Longyu, Yehe Nara Jingfen]

121
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,480
Approve his resignation
from the position of Prince Regent.

122
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,390
The seal of the Prince Regent shall be

123
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
returned and destroyed in no time.

124
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,870
He shall return to his residence
as Prince Chun, with no more right

125
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,270
[Prince Qing, President of Privy Council]
[Aisin Gioro Yi Kuang]

126
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,850
to interfere in state affairs.

127
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,550
He's awarded an annual salary
of 50,000 taels of silver,

128
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,090
to be paid
from the imperial household expenses.

129
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,870
Henceforth, appointments and governance

130
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,120
shall be handled by the Prime Minister
of the Imperial Cabinet,

131
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,920
with each minister being responsible
for their respective duties.

132
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,850
[October 16, the third year of Xuantong
(December 6, 1911),]

133
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,870
[the Prince Regent Zaifeng
abdicated at the age of 29.]

134
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,360
As the dignified Prince Regent,

135
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,620
the Emperor's father,

136
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,170
he just threw in the towel and resigned,

137
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,630
leaving behind such a perilous mess

138
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,830
and staying out of it?

139
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,080
He doesn't care about

140
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,680
his people and his men at all!

141
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,070
What the heck is this, Mother?

142
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,030
Huh?

143
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,490
How could he do that?

144
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,240
Zaifeng's always been
such a good-for-nothing,

145
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,630
not going anywhere.

146
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,570
His resignation is not surprising.

147
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,790
But our Empress Dowager Longyu

148
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,390
was so autocratic this time.

149
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,120
Not only did she not convene a meeting,

150
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,030
but she also didn't consult

151
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,230
with any lords from the imperial family

152
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,290
before making that decision.

153
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,640
She approved it within a day!

154
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
She's even

155
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,380
surpassed her aunt, Cixi,

156
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,300
in boldness and decisiveness.

157
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,870
How dare she act

158
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,260
in Cixi's style?

159
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,240
Does she really think

160
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,900
she can be in charge?

161
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,320
Anyone with a bit of sense

162
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,910
wouldn't bring the disgrace of wrecking

163
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,150
the whole country

164
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,280
to his or her family.

165
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
You mean

166
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,320
Zaifeng saw the Qing dynasty

167
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
heading to collapse,

168
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,750
so he seized the chance to leave

169
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,390
and avoid being blamed

170
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,050
as the one causing the country's downfall?

171
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,880
A hollowed-out great tree

172
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,090
can't withstand even the slightest breeze.

173
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,610
Zaifeng has been in power for three years,

174
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,820
No way he doesn't know
how bad things have become.

175
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,480
Son,

176
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,750
listen to my advice.

177
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,160
Don't meddle in affairs
that aren't our business.

178
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,360
Zaifeng and his two brothers

179
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,610
have all washed their hands of it.

180
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,410
Why are you still trying to help?

181
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,080
It's beyond your ability!

182
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,550
Just let that

183
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,550
shallow and vain woman take charge.

184
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,960
Let's see what she, a widow,

185
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,300
and her son can do.

186
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,630
She, Longyu,

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,390
is not Cixi.

188
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,510
And Yuan Shikai

189
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,870
is certainly not like Guangxu.

190
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,450
Mother, you're right.

191
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,440
Just today,

192
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,830
she granted Yuan Shikai full authority

193
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,080
to go negotiate with the revolutionary party

194
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,540
in the south

195
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,670
and discuss the bigger picture.

196
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,050
Oh,

197
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,150
our Qing dynasty, after two centuries

198
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,480
of power and glory,

199
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,630
there's no bigger picture
left for us anymore.

200
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,150
As I've said before,

201
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,350
we should see things through to the end.

202
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,980
In our Liang family,

203
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,150
we all stand on our own feet.

204
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,790
Do your job

205
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,380
within your duties.

206
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,490
As for the rest,

207
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,210
it's out of your control anyway.

208
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,120
Just as you said, Mother,

209
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,370
it's about to be out of my control.

210
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,480
Yuan Shikai has already
reorganized his guards

211
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,010
into the Defending Guards.

212
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,800
They'll take over the responsibility

213
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,760
for Beijing's security.

214
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,790
The official handover ceremony

215
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,250
will take place tomorrow.

216
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,020
After that,

217
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,150
the Imperial Guards will all be reassigned

218
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,750
to station outside Beijing.

219
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,380
I'm going to

220
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,930
visit the Prince Regent later

221
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,870
and settle things

222
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,130
with him properly.

223
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:41,930
Okay.

224
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,760
Draw nicely,

225
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,870
or Uncle Duanfang will scold you.

226
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
Welcome back.

227
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,030
But I have to leave soon.

228
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,150
Puck up my

229
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,720
daily items

230
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,850
and have them loaded in the car. Hurry.

231
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,210
Why such a rush?

232
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,320
Here, take it.

233
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,550
So what's going on?

234
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,410
What assignment has Mr. Yuan given you?

235
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,670
Brigade commander of the Defending Guards,

236
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,360
responsible for guarding Beijing

237
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,240
and ensuring

238
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,550
Mr. Yuan's safety.

239
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,820
That's a significant position.

240
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,090
It's also a duty
assigned in times of crisis.

241
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,550
The Imperial Guards in Beijing

242
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,010
are feeling down and lost.

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,140
I was asked to cooperate with Tufang

244
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,850
to pacify the Imperial Guards

245
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,880
in case of any accidents.

246
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,510
Complete your last shift well tonight.

247
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,040
Yes, sir.

248
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,660
Come on, Pujie, come here.

249
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,890
Your Highness.

250
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,770
You came just in time.

251
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,400
Light some incense for Duanfang as well.

252
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,440
Mr. Duanfang?

253
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,480
We've finally got confirmed news.

254
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,680
Half a month ago, Duanfang

255
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,080
was killed by the rebels.

256
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,260
He died a terrible death.

257
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,230
If I hadn't asked him
to come out of retirement,

258
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,360
this tragedy wouldn't have happened.

259
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,770
He was beheaded

260
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,700
with his corpse dumped in the wilderness.

261
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,970
How tragic.

262
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,070
My son was still waiting for him

263
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,270
to come back and teach him painting.

264
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,310
Son?

265
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,810
How come I've never heard you
mention your son before?

266
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,830
Well, you were

267
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,380
busy with countless state affairs,
Your Highness.

268
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,310
Of course you had no time to listen
to a subordinate's domestic trivia.

269
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,690
Now I have plenty of spare time.

270
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
How are you doing?

271
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,600
I heard from Zaitao that

272
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,400
he left the messy affairs of settling down

273
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,150
the Imperial Guards all to you.

274
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,810
This is exactly what I came here for.

275
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,400
I'm sorry to inform you,

276
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,290
Your Highness, that your guards

277
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,150
will be sent
to the Three Outer Battalions tomorrow.

278
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,180
I will no longer

279
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,410
be able to serve

280
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,860
and protect you in the future.

281
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,860
Don't worry about it.

282
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,530
Without the Imperial Guards,

283
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,170
perhaps it will be even safer.

284
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,150
No one will be wary of me anymore.

285
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,660
Attention!

286
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,240
Brigade Commander of the Defending Guards,

287
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
I, Liang Xiang of the Imperial Guards,

288
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,710
officially hand over
the guard duties to you.

289
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,640
Please accept the banner.

290
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,870
Forward, march!

291
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,100
About face!

292
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,960
Brigade Commander of the Defending Guards,

293
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,420
the safety of the capital,

294
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,180
a responsibility of historic importance,
is now entrusted to you.

295
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,110
I sincerely hope

296
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,430
you will treat it seriously.

297
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,760
Mr. Liang, please rest assured!

298
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,600
I will take this responsibility seriously

299
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,360
to keep the capital
and His Majesty safe and sound.

300
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,690
I wish you, Mr. Liang, to take care as well.

301
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,310
Thank you, Brigade Commander.

302
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,080
Tufang.

303
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,450
no need for formalities between us, right?

304
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,160
I've booked a table at Taifeng Restaurant

305
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,200
tonight.

306
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,150
Join me for a few drinks.

307
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,680
Seriously,

308
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,870
I want to have a private talk with you.

309
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,560
You must come.

310
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,690
[The Qing Dynasty's feudal rule fell
as part of history's unstoppable tide.]

311
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,060
[The imperial clan clinging to feudalism
like Liang Xiang was doomed to fail.]

312
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,790
Wild grass and idle flowers
cover the ground with sorrow;

313
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,830
dragons and tigers have been
grappling for years.

314
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,920
Look back at the Wu, Yue,
Qi, Qin, and Chu dynasties;

315
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,750
in the blink of an eye, it moved on
to the Liang, Tang, Jin, Han, and Zhou.

316
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,480
Bravo!

317
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,440
Today, I'll tell a story about Wu Song,

318
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,110
the second eldest in the Wu family.

319
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,510
Good evening, officers.

320
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,920
My surname is Li.

321
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,420
I booked a table here earlier.

322
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,860
Commander Li of the Defending Guards?

323
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,730
Yes.

324
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,970
Please follow me, Commander Li.

325
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,720
Another officer has already arrived.

326
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,330
His brother's called Wu Tianling.

327
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,200
And he's called

328
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,440
Wu Tiangang.

329
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,750
His elder brother was
all about literature and books,

330
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,190
yet Wu Song loved martial arts.

331
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,890
Wu Song often trained with swords
and spears in the back garden.

332
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,880
And he also learned boxing
in the Shaolin Temple.

333
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,270
Only after practicing kung fu
for over eight years

334
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,830
did he start to learn
the Eagle Claw technique.

335
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,550
On the wall, he practiced
the Iron Palm technique,

336
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,200
Power-suction technique,
and Pristine Qigong.

337
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,510
With stronger skills than others,
he had defeated

338
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,970
everyone in the Shaolin Temple
three times.

339
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,150
Rumors are spread in Beijing, saying that

340
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,820
I, Liang Xiang, sent someone
to kill Kaizhi.

341
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,790
Do you believe it?

342
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,960
No, of course.

343
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,660
Why?

344
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,080
The night he was assassinated,

345
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,010
I had a talk with him.

346
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,720
The gun went off

347
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,180
when I was just

348
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,930
leaving Zhentou.

349
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,550
So,

350
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,200
you were near the scene?

351
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,340
You could say that.

352
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,640
Don't look at me like that.

353
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,150
I, Li Renjun, have got nothing
to feel guilty about.

354
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,150
I didn't stop trying to hold him back

355
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,250
until the very last minute.

356
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,650
So you mean

357
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,650
you know all the details?

358
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,960
That's right.

359
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,440
I know the details.

360
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,450
Details are
the vivid expressions of history.

361
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,270
When the gunshot rang out, I realized

362
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,170
this was history taking its course,

363
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,940
not entirely

364
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,560
a conspiracy of anyone else.

365
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,220
Everyone was held accountable,

366
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,140
including Kaizhi himself.

367
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,670
Your take

368
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,490
is quite interesting.

369
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,200
Do you think you, Tufang,

370
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,600
bear no responsibility?

371
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,550
Me?

372
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,500
You knew he was a member
of the revolutionary party.

373
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,030
You could have tried

374
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,240
to stop his appointment.

375
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,070
Even in the days before his death,

376
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,830
you were still able

377
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,110
to pull him back from the brink

378
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,790
of death.

379
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,960
But you didn't do so.

380
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,430
You needed him to stay in the Sixth Division

381
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,840
to hold your political enemies in check,

382
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,340
right?

383
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,100
Qianli,

384
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,070
how come you seem like

385
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,170
a different person all of a sudden?

386
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,570
No longer naive and simple, right?

387
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,370
No,

388
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,520
you've become even more sophisticated.

389
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,510
Let's cut to the chase, Tufang.

390
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,070
It's not necessary for us

391
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,870
to have a moral discussion here.

392
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,550
We cannot measure history

393
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,830
by morality.

394
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,070
Let's only discuss

395
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,990
how to deal with the current mess.

396
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,810
You've really changed.

397
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,950
Who sent you to talk to me?

398
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,140
Mr. Yuan, of course.

399
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,430
It's your Mr. Yuan again.

400
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:22,990
No,

401
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,480
he's not only my Mr. Yuan

402
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,200
but also the Prime Minister

403
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,230
of this country.

404
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,180
What does he want you to tell me?

405
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,510
Everyone knows that you, Tufang,

406
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,310
built the Imperial Guards.

407
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,190
The stability of the Imperial Guards

408
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,440
is the key to the security
of the capital region.

409
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,570
And this security is

410
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:46,390
a prerequisite for peace negotiations
between the North and South.

411
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
There's no way for

412
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,110
a Prime Minister who even

413
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,570
can't keep the capital region
under control

414
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,070
to represent the court

415
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,740
and secure an ideal future
from the Southern

416
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,200
revolutionary party
on behalf of the court.

417
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,230
I think

418
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,610
this also explains why Kaizhi's death

419
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,760
was inevitable.

420
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,130
It's said that

421
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,350
Sun Wen's back in Shanghai

422
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,500
from overseas.

423
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,240
Is this information

424
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,370
reliable?

425
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,250
Yes, it's been confirmed.

426
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,720
That means from now on,

427
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,440
the Southern revolutionary party

428
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,640
has a leader to unite their revolution.

429
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,310
That's why

430
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,520
Mr. Yuan earnestly hopes to end

431
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,880
the factional disputes

432
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,350
within Beijing as soon as possible

433
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,510
so that we can join forces

434
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,180
to confront the South.

435
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:44,120
[Governor's Mansion of Shanghai Army]

436
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,920
Shuhong.

437
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Shuhong!

438
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,870
Yifan?

439
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,750
You're back from Germany?

440
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,410
Yeah.

441
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,420
Your sister is back too.

442
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,150
Where is she?

443
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,960
She's at home.

444
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,750
I'm here for a meeting
at the Ministry of Education.

445
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,380
That's great.

446
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,160
Wait for me. I'll find you
after I finish my business.

447
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,030
Where's your child?

448
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,050
Who's taking care of him?

449
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,690
Xueqing and I miss him so much.

450
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,440
It's a long story.

451
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,900
Let's talk about it later.

452
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,260
What do you mean by "a long story"?

453
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,440
That's right.

454
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,200
360,000 taels of silver

455
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,860
is indeed a huge sum.

456
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,240
But to get it, the bankbook

457
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,550
is necessary.

458
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,690
Yingshi,

459
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,790
it's not that I insist on this.

460
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,510
It's the bank

461
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,240
that sticks to their old rules.

462
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,070
No bankbook with an official seal from

463
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,240
the circuit intendant of Shanghai,

464
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,790
no release of the funds!

465
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
What can we do?

466
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,930
Everyone's anxious!

467
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,730
I'm anxious too.

468
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,230
There's a shortage of money everywhere!

469
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,720
360,000 taels of silver

470
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,190
can help a lot!

471
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,230
Yingshi,

472
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,960
you're now
the Governor of the Military Government.

473
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,830
It has brought changes

474
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,070
to our relationship.

475
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,900
How dare I try to fool you?

476
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,790
What?

477
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,430
Arrest the bank owner?

478
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,720
You...

479
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,790
Yingshi,

480
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,010
you can't do this!

481
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,000
You can't!

482
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,880
Shuhong,

483
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,200
it's been years since the last

484
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,060
heavy snow like this in Shanghai.

485
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,070
Here are all the banknotes issued

486
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,070
by the Bank of China on behalf of

487
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,860
the Military Government.

488
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,720
350,000 silver dollars in total.

489
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,690
Can't believe it.

490
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
What's going on?

491
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Is this much money still not enough?

492
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,540
Shuhong,

493
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,110
do you know how much
the daily military expenditure is

494
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,440
for the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area?

495
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,550
Do you?

496
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,480
This amount of money

497
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,590
can only last three days.

498
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,110
Moreover,

499
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,480
they're currently discussing the election

500
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,740
of a provisional government in Nanjing.

501
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:32,970
Is that so?

502
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,200
Things have come to this point.

503
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
That's going to be a big expense.

504
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,920
Expenses.

505
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
Expenses,

506
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,570
There are expenses everywhere.

507
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,200
How can one just ask for money

508
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,810
without giving any reasons?

509
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,540
After so many years in finance,

510
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,540
I've never seen money spent like this.

511
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,360
From managing a division or a brigade

512
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,410
to providing meals or lodgings,

513
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,920
they need endless money everywhere.

514
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,750
My experience is that

515
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,610
revolution

516
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,920
is super expensive.

517
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,489
If you want to go bankrupt,

518
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,350
just come and do my job right now.

519
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,290
Get me the Belgian Consul on the line.

520
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,310
Alright, I'll be waiting.

521
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,520
The Belgian Consul?

522
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,420
It's a big mess.

523
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,400
The government
of circuit intendant of Shanghai

524
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,670
deposited the Boxer Rebellion indemnity

525
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,590
of 360,000 taels of silver

526
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,870
in a bank.

527
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,270
But the circuit intendant

528
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,600
fled to the Settlement.

529
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,679
He handed over the bankbook

530
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,409
to the Belgian Consul.

531
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,710
Now we have to ask them

532
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,000
for this bankbook.

533
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,400
Not sure if they'll

534
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,880
give it back to us.

535
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,770
Because after all,

536
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,360
they haven't recognized

537
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,040
our Military Government yet.

538
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,060
Without the bankbook,

539
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,440
the bank won't release the funds.

540
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,780
Even if you arrest the owner,

541
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,840
you still can't get this money.

542
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,340
For them, credibility

543
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,750
and old rules even outweigh their lives!

544
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,160
Alright, put him through.

545
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,340
I'll leave you to it
and step out for a sec.

546
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,650
Yifan is outside.

547
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,720
Oh, right.

548
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,850
There's a letter for you.

549
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,050
[To Xie Shuhong]

550
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,520
It's from Zhentou.

551
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,070
James,

552
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,640
this is Song Baoquan.

553
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,920
No, no.

554
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,140
I absolutely don't mean to trouble you.

555
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,050
Yes, yes.

556
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,340
It's about that money.

557
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,890
You see,

558
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,040
could we discuss it?

559
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:38,990
Shuhong,

560
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,070
forgive me for bringing you

561
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,430
this bad news.

562
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,490
At 2:17 AM,

563
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,130
at Zhentou Station,

564
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,970
Commander Kaizhi

565
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,630
was assassinated by reactionary forces.

566
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,280
Kaizhi, my dearest,

567
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,150
I can't wait

568
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,610
to rush into your arms

569
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,690
and tell you this exciting news

570
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,470
in person.

571
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,470
Yes, dear Kaizhi,

572
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,030
post-revolution Shanghai

573
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,320
is full of vitality

574
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,190
as well as restlessness.

575
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
People of all kinds

576
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,030
are on the streets,

577
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,710
stepping onto

578
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,710
the public stage.

579
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,480
They breathe the air of freedom,

580
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,480
grab their guns,

581
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,320
and loudly proclaim

582
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,920
their political views.

583
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,630
They argue and quarrel

584
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,440
yet stand shoulder to shoulder,

585
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,040
marching forward together.

586
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,920
I don't know what

587
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,670
lies ahead for us,

588
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,070
nor do I know if this

589
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,070
is what you

590
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,190
really wanted.

591
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,630
But one thing

592
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,030
is for sure now.

593
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,370
Our heads

594
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,330
and legs are no longer

595
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,550
made

596
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,880
for kowtowing,

597
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,550
but for thinking

598
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,150
and walking.

599
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,110
In this case,

600
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,770
you are the person I'm missing like crazy.

601
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,100
I'm thinking about our future.

602
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,750
I imagine us

603
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,510
holding each other's hands

604
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,510
and growing old together.

605
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:10,290
Shuhong,

606
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,920
Kaizhi, with his sacrifice,

607
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,450
fulfilled our initial aspiration

608
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,640
to save China.

609
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,250
It carries immense weight,

610
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,910
pitiful but not regrettable.

611
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm only worried about

612
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,880
the impact on you.

613
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,780
You were his soul mate

614
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,710
who witnessed his hesitation,

615
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,710
his exploration,

616
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,220
and his quest for a bright path.

617
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,970
When Kaizhi was still alive,

618
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,880
I always wanted to share with him

619
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,030
an advanced theory

620
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,320
I had discovered.

621
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
It comes from Germany.

622
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,260
A man named Marx

623
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,000
envisioned a truly

624
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,320
bright future.

625
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,590
I believe

626
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,190
this theory

627
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,480
called communism

628
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,570
will take root in the land of China.

629
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,750
To save an era of decline,

630
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,290
Shuhong,

631
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,550
I hope you don't stop

632
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,480
and keep moving on

633
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,410
to witness

634
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,630
our generation seeking new light.

635
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,830
Who are the people attending it?

636
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,850
The one taking the lead

637
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,320
is Yuan Shikai's negotiation representative,

638
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,110
Tang Shaoyi.

639
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,970
He's followed by the one who got off

640
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,600
the car behind,
the Southern revolutionary party's

641
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,070
representative, Wu Tingfang.

642
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,050
Aren't the North-South peace talks

643
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,070
supposed to take place
in the council hall in the Settlement?

644
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,400
That's the front stage.

645
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,920
This

646
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,200
is the backstage.

647
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
Zhang Jian?

648
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,550
It's him.

649
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,290
Why is he here too?

650
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,840
He's the big shot tonight.

651
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,400
Has he also accepted the revolution?

652
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,920
He just hopes to end

653
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,920
the turmoil in a peaceful way

654
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,320
as soon as possible

655
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,200
and stabilize the whole country.

656
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,300
Yuan Shikai's teacher
is indeed impressive.

657
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,920
That's why

658
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,100
he's the main character tonight.

659
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,230
No wonder Mr. Song's been

660
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,430
so sneaky these days.

661
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,910
So he's been working
on behind-the-scenes deals.

662
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,590
Unlike me, my father

663
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,780
has dealt with money all his life.

664
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,320
He knows better than anyone that

665
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,690
if the revolution continues

666
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,490
at this rate, it won't last long.

667
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,250
What about Kaizhi then?

668
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,720
Did he die

669
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,340
for nothing?

670
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,230
Don't put it that way.

671
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,390
History is still unfolding.

672
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,600
No one can predict

673
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,320
where the future will lead.

674
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,960
No one can foresee how it

675
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,290
will turn out in the end.

676
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,400
Follow me.

677
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,870
I'll show you something.

678
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,370
This is a Zeiss camera

679
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,670
purchased by Duanfang,

680
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,670
the former Viceroy

681
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,670
of Liangjiang.

682
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,670
We seized it when we occupied

683
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,440
his office.

684
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,110
My father wants you

685
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,030
to keep it

686
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,880
and do the photography work
here in Shanghai

687
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,880
from now on.

688
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,670
Me?

689
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,510
Yes.

690
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,880
You'll be responsible
for recording history,

691
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,140
the history that's unfolding right now.

692
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,150
You can start using it tonight.

693
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,340
After the meeting wraps up,

694
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,320
representatives from both sides
will take a group photo.

695
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,510
This job suits you well.
