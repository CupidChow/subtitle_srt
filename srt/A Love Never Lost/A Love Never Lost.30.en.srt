00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,940
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,050
Look at you, Li Renjun.

4
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,840
You're pulling such a long face.

5
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,790
Tufang, you've brought in
all those arrogant men.

6
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,280
You just broke our hearts.

7
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Oh, Qianli,

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,130
you did give me a lesson.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,750
I saw this coming the moment I hopped

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,310
in the car at the front gate.

11
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,360
How tough

12
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
the days were

13
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,760
in the Inukai Regiment!

14
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,310
It was like hell for us back then.

15
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,980
Looking back now, it wasn't so bad

16
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,170
without all these messy affairs.

17
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,590
Just look at the mess
the army has been forced into now.

18
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,800
Who would risk their lives for you?

19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,530
Have you ever thought about it?

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,110
Tell me

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
how Yuan Shikai

22
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,460
treated you guys back then.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
He also spent

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,530
a whole lot of money, didn't he?

25
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,980
That's true,

26
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,800
But Mr. Yuan had one good point.

27
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,570
He didn't check our official expenses.

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,130
Without these incomes,

29
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,080
how can the men make their livings?

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,590
Who doesn't have

31
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,430
a handful of capital to make use of?

32
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,360
Big fish feed on small fish;

33
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
small fish feed on shrimps;

34
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,650
shrimps feed on mud.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,310
But after

36
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,510
your investigation,

37
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,000
the shrimps have no mud to eat,

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,730
ending up as mere food for fish.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When the shrimps are eaten up,

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,870
I think even 10 or 20 army divisions

41
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,930
won't be of any use.

42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,550
As for wars,

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
you military ministers

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,370
go fight on your own.

45
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,520
So,

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,960
as you can see,

47
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,870
I've been recruiting

48
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,070
military talents who studied in Japan.

49
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,510
We can't rely on the current batch of people

50
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,510
to lead troops?

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,990
A major overhaul is necessary.

52
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,650
Otherwise,

53
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,000
no one will listen to me.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,050
If they don't listen to me,

55
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,710
how can we reform Yuan Shikai's

56
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,079
Beiyang Army?

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,720
It must be reformed.

58
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,390
Qianli.

59
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,620
Come on, Bugu.

60
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Say goodbye.

61
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,159
Goodbye, sir.

62
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,159
Go back home,

63
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,040
naughty boy.

64
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,710
And take off my socks too.

65
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,960
Didn't you just go have fun?

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
What took you so long?

67
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,270
I think the Old Madam must

68
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,680
be longing for a grandchild like crazy.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,480
It's been a while

70
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
since Liang Xiang got married.

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,720
How come they still...

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
Can you mind your own business?

73
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,630
Come on.

74
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,120
Today,

75
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,720
I got news from Zaizhen.

76
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,610
Qing's approved of my appointment.

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Now it's up to the Prince Regent.

78
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,480
That's still progress.

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,210
It's the best we could hope for.

80
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:35,770
For Zaifeng,

81
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,210
Liang Xiang should be able to
talk sense into him.

82
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,090
I've finally figured it out today.

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,480
The only one Liang Xiang really listens to

84
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,430
is his mother.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,920
That Old Madam is really something.

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,909
She is so sharp-eyed

87
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:50,190
and can see through everything.

88
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,190
Come on, lie down.

89
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,720
When did you become so close

90
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,240
to her?

91
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,920
When? Seriously?

92
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,450
We were neighbors in Tokyo.

93
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,940
Oh, I totally forgot that.

94
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,750
Then she

95
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,310
also knows Mr. Wu?

96
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,480
So I didn't want to visit her.

97
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,680
But I was forced to go.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,750
Does she know what

99
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,630
Mr. Wu did?

100
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,970
I just found out today that

101
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:21,710
she was also there
when the Tokyo police raided the house.

102
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,380
Oh no, oh no.

103
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,110
I forgot that.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,900
It really got messed up this time.

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,310
This Old Madam

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,310
must've thought a lot about it.

107
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,190
I told you,

108
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,920
that Old Madam is really smart.

109
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,800
You can't hide anything from her.

110
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,310
This will definitely affect

111
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,170
Liang Xiang's appointment of me.

112
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,120
It definitely will.

113
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,750
No wonder he kept avoiding me

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,190
at the class reunion.

115
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,200
He wasn't like that before.

116
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,060
Did you mention me to her today?

117
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,880
Yes, of course.

118
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,080
The Old Madam didn't say anything?

119
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,720
I guess she

120
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,510
was thinking about our relationship.

121
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,800
Our relationship?

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,000
What else could there
possibly be between us?

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,750
Doesn't she know that my cousin

124
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,750
is your brother-in-law?

125
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,480
Does that help explain anything?

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,190
A man and a woman shack up together.

127
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,360
As a conservative old madam,

128
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,020
of course she'd overthink it.

129
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,310
So what?

130
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,040
What does it have to do with her?

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,750
What if it does have something
to do with her?

132
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,510
Shuhong,

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,070
I, Yang Kaizhi,

134
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,040
have been wrongly

135
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,570
accused of being a playboy.

136
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,310
We've lived together for days,

137
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,870
yet I haven't done anything.

138
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,750
This is not what I want.

139
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,480
Not what you want? Fine.

140
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,190
D-Didn't you say that she thought

141
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,040
there was something between us?

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Did I say that?

143
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,000
That's what you implied.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,940
That's her guess.

145
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,400
Then...

146
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,310
Did she think

147
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,630
he's our child?

148
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,909
That's a wild guess of yours.

149
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,200
Don't drag me into something I didn't do.

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't worry about that.

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,090
Someone else has been dragged into it.

152
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,200
Wait, Shuhong.

153
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,840
What do you mean by that?

154
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,920
Mommy, I'm thirsty.

155
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,830
To be honest with you,

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,600
that Old Madam suspects that

157
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,660
Bugu is her grandson.

158
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,630
From the moment I stepped
into her house today,

159
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,760
she had been beating

160
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,530
around the bush to test me.

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,230
Come on.

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,050
That Old Madam's got

163
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,190
some serious intuition like a lioness,

164
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,190
sniffing out

165
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,870
truths and lies

166
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,160
with ease.

167
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,210
Wait, what?

168
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,920
She suspects that you

169
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,490
and Liang Xiang are Bugu's parents?

170
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,750
This is absurd.

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,840
Fortunately, Mr. Wu is gone.

172
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,970
Or this would have become a big issue.

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,950
I was being paranoid.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,270
This Old Madam

175
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,360
is just dying for a grandchild.

176
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,580
Well,

177
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,000
from now on,

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,620
if she invites you over again,

179
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,950
do not go no matter what.

180
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,690
I can't believe it.

181
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,590
Sour plum juice.

182
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,790
It helps to cool down.

[Shouzhen Photo Studio]

184
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
This way, please.

185
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,550
How is it?

186
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
This darkroom of ours

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
meets the standards, right?

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,030
Then let's move upstairs

189
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,690
to check out the photo studio.

Please.

191

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,370
Wang Zhaoming has come to Beijing?

193
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,780
How do you know?

194
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,020
He named the studio, didn't he?

195
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Shuhong, you're really something.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,750
At the sight of the character, "Shouzhen,"

197
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,380
I knew

198
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,150
Wang Zhaoming had arrived in Beijing.

199
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,320
Let's put this aside for now.

200
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,580
Look at our equipment,

201
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,840
the set, the lighting,

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,320
and the darkroom downstairs.

203
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
Everything is ready.

204
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,080
Now,

205
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,270
we're only waiting for your camera.

206
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,870
The camera will be here tomorrow.

207
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,630
Let's take a few test shots tomorrow.

208
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,200
Good!

209
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,050
Then tomorrow,

210
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,910
let's have our internal opening.

211
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,770
During this trip to Baoding,

212
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,170
we were like locusts.

213
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,410
We set off with an empty train

214
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,670
and returned to Beijing
with it fully loaded.

215
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,440
At this rate,

216
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,480
we'll be hit by a barrage of curses.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
I also have some news to tell you.

218
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,830
What news?

219
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
Do you know Shuhong?

220
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,070
On our wedding night,

221
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,460
you told me

222
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,410
you had a woman in Tokyo,

223
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,470
a Han woman.

224
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,070
You did everything together.

225
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,200
We've been married for so long.

226
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Why are you bringing this up now?

227
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,840
Was that woman Shuhong?

228
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,040
Hey,

229
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,870
you're saying such random things.

230
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,600
How am I supposed to answer you?

231
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,710
Weird, huh?

232
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,010
The moment she walked into our yard

233
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,460
I knew

234
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,000
at first glance that

235
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
she was the woman

236
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,770
you mentioned before.

237
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,010
Shuhong came to our house?

238
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,790
Just tell me the truth.

239
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,670
Yes

240
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,050
or no?

241
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,330
Why do you have to bring this up?

242
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,590
What's the point?

243
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,170
You don't even ask

244
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,100
what I've been through these days.

245
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,860
I've been totally shameless

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,870
and exhausted

247
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,330
physically and mentally.

248
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,960
Don't beat around the bush.

249
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,420
You can't avoid it anyway.

250
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Even if you don't tell me,

251
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,150
you still have to confess
to the Old Madam.

252
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,700
Wait,

253
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,150
why do we have to talk about this?

254
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,160
Shuhong came to our house two days ago.

255
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,360
What did she come for?

256
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,830
You wouldn't believe it.

257
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,330
She's Kaizhi's relative,

258
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,970
that boy's mother.

259
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,320
Xiang.

260
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,200
Xiang!

261
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,610
Come over here!

262
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,870
Off you go.

263
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,610
The Old Madam's been

264
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,940
waiting for your return

265
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,930
like crazy these past two days.

266
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,090
Did your wife tell you?

267
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,000
I only knew they were relatives,

268
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,080
but I didn't expect it to have
anything to do with Shuhong.

269
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,150
Then you're too careless.

270
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,150
I'm like a hero hitting rock bottom now

271
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,200
with no time to spare

272
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,330
for love or romance.

273
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,150
Have you met her since you two

274
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,520
returned to China?

275
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,810
Yes.

276
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,430
In Shanghai, she opened

277
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,550
an electrical appliance store, didn't she?

278
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,550
When we purchased

279
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,080
communication devices

280
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
for the Imperial Guards,

281
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
she did me a favor.

282
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,670
I knew this girl

283
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,120
didn't tell me the truth.

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,320
Come on, Mother.

285
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,070
What's the point of asking about this?

286
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,400
Not until today did Duo Mei tell me that

287
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,320
you once had a woman

288
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,840
in Tokyo.

289
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,480
Was it her?

290
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,650
Mother,

291
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,170
can you let me have some privacy?

292
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
Do you have to ask about this?

293
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,920
So it was her.

294
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,510
Mother,

295
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,000
are you suspecting

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,630
that I'm still

297
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,160
in a relationship with her?

298
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
Your mother never

299
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,150
makes baseless guesses.

300
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,590
Great.

301
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,600
I have nothing else to say then.

302
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,440
Son,

303
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,160
tell me.

304
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,880
When you first saw that boy,

305
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,810
how did you feel?

306
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,570
What are you talking about,

307
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Mother?

308
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm asking you.

309
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,830
Auntie, I'm hungry.

310
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,750
Why did you run out?

311
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,950
It's cold outside. Go back indoors now.

312
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,080
This boy is interesting.

313
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,750
Bead, bead!

314
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,270
Auntie, I want the bead!

315
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,720
This one?

316
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,400
If you like it, it's yours.

317
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,460
The first time I saw this boy,

318
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,599
I felt

319
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,130
he somewhat looked
like your maternal grandfather.

320
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,120
To be honest with you,

321
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,680
later I

322
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,920
checked his ears and armpits.

323
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,420
The same smell.

324
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,850
He also has oily ears.

325
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,910
Then I was wondering

326
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,200
if he could be my grandson.

327
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,920
When I saw

328
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,790
this boy's mother,

329
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,760
I just knew it.

330
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,650
He's definitely my grandson.

331
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:38,880
Mom,

332
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,700
we're not going to Mr. Fan's house today

333
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,770
to learn to read?

334
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,310
No, we're not.

335
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,880
The photography studio
is testing a new device today.

336
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,540
Mom will take you to try it out.

337
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
Come on, put this on.

338
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,290
What's this?

339
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,310
This?

340
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,860
This belongs to your biological father.

341
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,540
Don't lose it.

342
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,650
Your Highness,

343
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,930
Long time no see, Tufang.

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
It's indeed been a while.

345
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,920
I heard from the Sixth Lord that
you've been to Baoding.

346
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,550
How was it?

347
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,820
I've been too busy
to attend to military affairs.

348
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
It's a long story,

349
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,930
Your Highness.

350
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,880
Is that so?

351
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,330
Then let's find time to talk it through.

352
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,730
Just give me a rough idea.

353
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,590
Are the Sixth Lord and the Seventh Lord

354
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,920
qualified for the jobs?

355
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,940
They are both working hard.

356
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,650
As their teacher,

357
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,000
you should remind them

358
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
whenever necessary.

359
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,550
One naval commander.

360
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,450
One army commander.

361
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,680
Urge them to take responsibility.

362
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,310
Have you eaten?

363
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,860
Let's have dinner together.

364
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,400
No, thank you, Your Highness.

365
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,430
The imperial mansion

366
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,360
is guarded by the Imperial Guards.

367
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,920
There are some security matters

368
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,160
I need to clarify.

369
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,790
I'll leave you to it.

370
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,710
I'm a bit tired.

371
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,840
I only had half a bowl for lunch.

372
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,410
Oh, by the way.

373
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,490
There's one more thing.

374
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,240
The position of the Sixth Division's
general commander is vacant.

375
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,310
There is a nomination

376
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,370
that draws mixed reviews though.

377
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,410
And it's about something serious.

378
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,170
I'd like to know your take on it.

379
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,830
What do you think of Yang Kaizhi?

380
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,020
You were classmates.

381
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,790
I agree with this nomination.

382
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:44,650
Good.

383
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,220
As for his possible connection
with the rebels

384
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,010
and his complex background...

385
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,510
During the study in Japan, all the cadets

386
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,280
were inevitably

387
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
influenced by foreign ideologies.

388
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,030
Under these circumstances,

389
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,780
I'm afraid it's common to all.

390
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,200
But the point is that

391
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,550
Yang Kaizhi

392
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,440
underwent

393
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,030
the trial
of the Sino-Japanese Yanji Incident.

394
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,010
His outstanding performance proved

395
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,300
his love for the country

396
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,030
and resolve to defend national interests.

397
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,750
Moreover,

398
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,000
he boasts extraordinary military talent.

399
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,840
Indeed.

400
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,920
When the court

401
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,480
awarded him the title
of Border Defense Hero,

402
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,520
no one mentioned his background.

403
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
But once it comes to granting
real power and benefits,

404
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,310
the old issues are all

405
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,220
being dug up.

406
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,630
For you, Your Highness,

407
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,400
among the current commanders
of the six Beiyang Divisions

408
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,930
which one doesn't have
a complex background?

409
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,640
Which one can guarantee

410
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,380
absolute loyalty to you, Your Highness,

411
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,930
without being manipulated by others?

412
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,270
Tufang,

413
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,030
your sharp comment

414
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,860
reveals the key to the problem.

415
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,900
I see.

416
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,170
Coming.

417
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,480
Are Shuhong and the child here?

418
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,320
How can your mother

419
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
be so delusional?

420
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,770
Let me in first. Let's talk inside.

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,760
They went to Li Renjun's place?

422
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,580
Renjun's wife

423
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,030
is from a brothel.

424
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,430
Anyone with even
a slight connection to Renjun

425
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,130
can soon get familiar with others

426
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,590
in a super passionate way.

427
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,470
Shuhong had no choice but to go

428
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,330
to make dumplings at their house.

429
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,040
Oh, right.

430
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,510
The Prince Regent

431
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,200
just asked me about your appointment.

432
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,440
I offered my full support

433
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,570
and spoke up for you.

434
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,800
When will it be finalized?

435
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,550
Someone brought up

436
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,920
a whole lot of stuff

437
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,640
with every word hitting the point.

438
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
If I were a rebel,

439
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,400
I'd send a bomb

440
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,790
to each of those bastards who framed me.

441
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,310
Like, directly to their houses.

442
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,920
I wouldn't let those jerks enjoy

443
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,200
their success even at the cost of losing

444
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,730
the position of commander.

445
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,060
But seriously,

446
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,950
does your mother

447
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,430
really believe

448
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,750
you and Shuhong are that boy's parents?

449
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,950
Who told you this?

450
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,490
Who else could it be?

451
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,010
Shuhong told me after she returned

452
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,240
from your house.

453
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,440
But my mother didn't say it out...

454
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,250
How did she...

455
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,790
In Beijing,

456
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,200
are there any other elders

457
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,400
who can play the roles
of both a matriarch and a patriarch?

458
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,160
Not to mention

459
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,750
the others,

460
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,920
her glances

461
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,640
are even more powerful

462
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,420
than a German-made

463
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,850
nine-shot Mauser gun.

464
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,090
You really think it's impossible?

465
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,680
What's this question?

466
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,440
As the saying goes,

467
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,440
you reap what you sow.

468
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,200
You should be well aware
of this, Liang Xiang.

469
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,170
Back when we were in school,

470
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,130
Shuhong

471
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,330
was living with Mr. Wu the whole time.

472
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,100
What if I also planted

473
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,430
and sowed?

474
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,640
As a matter of fact,

475
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,770
this also had something to do with you.

476
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,900
You were the one who enlightened me.

477
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,010
"Make hay

478
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,830
while the sun shines."

479
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,410
Oh my God.

480
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
So that Golden Straw was...

481
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,160
Shuhong.

482
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,680
I also think

483
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,080
my mother was talking nonsense.

484
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,250
How could it be possible?

485
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,820
Just that one and only time,

486
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,950
and it really resulted in a child?

487
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,490
But my mother is convinced

488
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,440
of his bloodline.

489
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,200
She smelled his armpits

490
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,400
and checked the ears.

491
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,940
What can I say?

492
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,530
Congratulations then.

493
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,790
Two flowers on one branch,

494
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,080
each pretty and spectacular.

495
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,520
Seriously, Kaizhi,

496
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,050
could you ask Shuhong for me tonight

497
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,630
whether

498
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,930
it's true or not?

499
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,270
Don't bother asking who

500
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,400
the boy's father is.

501
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,090
It must be you.

502
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,230
How can you be so sure?

503
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,530
Liang Xiang, don't forget

504
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm a man too.

505
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,440
Shuhong's been off

506
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
since she came back

507
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,880
from your house that night.

508
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,910
Now that I think about it,

509
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,150
she already told me the truth.

510
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,450
You are the father of that boy.

511
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:45,860
Really?

512
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,670
Why should I lie to you?

513
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,030
I suggest you

514
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,410
handle this matter properly.

515
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,600
Don't hurt her again.

516
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,720
This woman

517
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,230
has been through too much.

518
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Renjun's wife is such a chatterbox.

519
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,260
She refused to let me leave.

520
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:15,310
When she got excited,

521
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,910
she could even sing an opera.

522
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,840
Quite impressive and authentic.

523
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,010
When she knew I could do Western-style

524
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,750
tailoring, she just

525
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,640
asked me to make her a dress

526
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,530
like those worn by foreign women

527
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,130
in the Shanghai Settlement.

528
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,040
What's wrong?

529
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,360
Come out with me.

530
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,120
It's bedtime. Come on.

531
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,830
Be good and lie down.

532
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,100
What's the matter?

533
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,640
Liang Xiang was here.

534
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,910
He just left.

535
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,660
I told him that

536
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,400
he's Bugu's father.

537
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,710
Am I right?

538
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,540
It was not your place to say that.

539
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,700
But I spoke the truth.

540
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,650
Told the truth to someone like him?

541
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,610
How sincere,

542
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,270
how loyal,

543
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,750
how caring,

544
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:44,280
and how fawning you are!

545
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,090
You're not happy that I said that?

546
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,890
You want me to be grateful to you?

547
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,230
You're too conceited,

548
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:52,990
Kaizhi.

549
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,720
What's the beef

550
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,670
between you and Liang Xiang?

551
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,860
How'd you end up like this?

552
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,930
You really see me as
a resentful woman, don't you?

553
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,030
Listen, Kaizhi.

554
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,110
Yes,

555
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
all these years, I've been

556
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,640
living a restless and unsettled life,

557
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,880
going through

558
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,540
all trials and tribulations.

559
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,880
Tianbai died,

560
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,200
and I even

561
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,800
wanted to end my life as well.

562
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,310
But the last thing I want is to have

563
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,000
any connections with that person.

564
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
Otherwise, all my past efforts

565
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
would become worthless.

566
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,790
Think about it.

567
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,440
Who changed me,

568
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,030
influenced me,

569
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:35,550
and led me

570
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,880
to where I am today?

571
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,160
If I end up

572
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,290
back with his enemy,

573
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,640
I'll be a jerk.

574
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,790
Wait,

575
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,570
I didn't mean this.

576
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,400
Really.

577
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,830
I know you are so desperate
for that position

578
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,090
in the Sixth Division.

579
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,920
That's your cause.

580
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,310
That's your platform

581
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,200
for future achievements.

582
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,310
But don't take it way too seriously.

583
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,920
You know what kind of person

584
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,550
Liang Xiang is better than I do.

585
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,270
In no case will I

586
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,670
believe he's on our side.

587
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,200
He is our enemy.

588
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,160
You and I

589
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,110
should never

590
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,840
forget this.

591
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,880
Interesting.

592
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,090
You certainly have a clear stance.

593
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,920
But if you knew it would come to this,

594
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,850
why did you do it in the first place?

595
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,700
Don't you think you're so mean?

596
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,160
How am I the one being mean?

597
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,270
Are you

598
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,840
going to conclude it
with that verse again?

599
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,270
"If life could remain the way it was
when we first met."

600
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,680
Right?

601
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,920
Get lost, Kaizhi!

602
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,790
I can't stand

603
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,520
that cynical look on your face.

604
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,830
Me, cynical?

605
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,160
You truly treated

606
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,620
my kindness like garbage!

607
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,699
[Military Advisory Council]

608
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,440
Just because you and I

609
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,920
are representing the Army
on a visit next month

610
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,760
to two more countries

611
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,820
than his last trip,

612
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,489
he made a big fuss about it!

613
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,800
He made a scene

614
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,060
and smashed a cup in front of Zaifeng!

615
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,760
Tufang, you know what?

616
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,770
In this family, he, Zaixun,

617
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,110
has tried to outdo me in everything

618
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,310
since we were little!

619
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,630
It all stems from

620
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,420
my mom's doting on him.

621
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,780
When Zaifeng and I were born,

622
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,810
my mother was in poor health

623
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,110
with little breast milk.

624
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,760
She nursed us

625
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,790
for less than a month

626
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,570
before we were entrusted to a wet nurse.

627
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,310
But when it came to Zaixun's birth,

628
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,760
my mother had plenty of milk.

629
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,489
Yet Zaixun was the weak one.

630
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,760
My mother, feeling sorry for him,

631
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,320
nursed him herself

632
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,440
for over six months

633
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,240
before giving him to a wet nurse.

634
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,440
Just because of these five

635
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,590
more months of mother's milk,

636
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,030
he's found himself so special!

637
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,400
He's been arrogant since he was little.

638
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,590
When sharing fruits,

639
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,400
he always picked the biggest one!

640
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,480
He got used to it over time.

641
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,110
I don't mind.

642
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
He's my elder brother,

643
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,280
two years older than me,

644
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,440
ahead of me in order.

645
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,510
But he even fights with Zaifeng
over many things!

646
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,310
That doesn't make sense, right?

647
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,850
Zaifeng can't do anything

648
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,110
about him even now
when Zaifeng's already the Prince Regent.

649
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,920
Yes.

650
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,770
I know

651
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,110
a vice formed since childhood

652
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,640
can't be fixed that easily.

653
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,880
Tufang,

654
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:35,760
don't laugh.

655
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,740
This is real.

656
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,690
Zaixun drank

657
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,880
five more months of our mother's milk.

658
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,440
Wow,

659
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,170
how amazing.

660
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,210
He's a bully in our own family.

661
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,440
But in the current situation,

662
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,700
how can he still keep this up

663
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,300
even with the Prince Regent?

664
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,030
No distinction
between family and the outside?

665
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,960
No regard for grace or reputation?

666
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,280
He can't do this,

667
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,360
right?

668
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,550
My Brother Zaifeng

669
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,360
is also indecisive.

670
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,150
Why can't he just put on a stern face

671
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,150
to talk to Zaixun?

672
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,820
If he can't even handle family matters,

673
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,880
how can he address the court affairs?

674
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,790
The Navy only has a few ships

675
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,490
sailing in inland waters.

676
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,880
How could

677
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,230
Zaixun ask for

678
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,630
such a huge expenditure?

679
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:25,970
How could he?

680
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,490
With no money to give him,
the Prince Regent just

681
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,890
approved him to collect taxes,

682
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,250
the naval taxes.

683
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,370
But what about our army?

684
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,170
Doesn't the Army need money too?

685
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,510
Our army, in terms of current strength,

686
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,110
matters much more

687
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,000
than his navy,

688
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,860
which is still a work in progress.

689
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,190
You, Tufang, are an army expert.

690
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,630
You should know this, right?

691
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,690
Why no funding increase for the Army?

692
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,230
Why not let the Army collect taxes?

693
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,860
I didn't complain to them about this.

694
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,590
Just because of a visit

695
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,590
to two more countries than him,

696
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,050
he started cursing first!

697
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,110
If I were the elder brother
of you two, I'd also

698
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,570
find it a hard nut to crack.

699
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,960
It's hard for even a wise judge
to settle family disputes.

700
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,320
I think...

701
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,440
I see.

702
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,110
I get it.

703
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,810
Why do you two brothers have to

704
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,150
fight over it?

705
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,550
What's the point?

706
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,150
But he's gone too far, hasn't he?

707
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,590
Just because he smashed a cup,

708
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,550
you sulked?

709
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,060
Well, not exactly.

710
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,400
Alright.

711
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,510
I think you need to

712
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,370
consider the fundamental issue.

713
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,570
Don't blame me for speaking harshly.

714
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,320
What's the point of your fight?

715
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,460
In my point of view,

716
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,760
you are where you are now

717
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,280
all thanks to your nephew

718
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,190
who succeeded to the throne.

719
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,840
Right?

720
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,560
Without this, what else would you have?

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,150
You'd lose everything,

722
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,400
I think.

723
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,060
Is the Army important?

724
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,960
Yes, it is.

725
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,700
Is the Navy important?

726
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,970
It's important too.

727
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,610
But what matters the most?

728
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,920
The most significant thing is

729
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,110
whether this throne of yours

730
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,360
can be secured.

731
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,840
If not,

732
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,760
you'll lose power.

733
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,700
Then what's the use

734
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,920
of your navy and army?

735
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,770
The status quo of the Qing dynasty

736
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,780
is treacherous.

737
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,030
The revolutionary party,

738
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,000
the constitutional party,

739
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
and the court.

740
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,070
The court is further divided
into the Elders,

741
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,400
the Westernization Clique,

742
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,280
and the new leader

743
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,610
like the Prince Regent.

744
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,550
Everything's

745
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,510
a total mess

746
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,710
awash with issues.

747
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,490
Just think about it.

748
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,030
The Prince Regent is where

749
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,510
Empress Cixi

750
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,630
was back then.

751
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,530
And things are even harder.

752
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,210
Be it political support or prestige,

753
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,900
can he match Empress Cixi?

754
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,290
No, he can't.

755
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,400
But he's even

756
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,880
shouldering

757
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
more responsibilities.

758
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,510
If you two, his own brothers,

759
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,110
can't help share his burden,

760
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,280
who else can the Prince Regent rely on?

761
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,440
I was just complaining to you
to vent a little.

762
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,160
Tell me.

763
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,270
What's the most

764
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,420
pressing issue for the Army right now?

765
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,850
The shortage of funds.

766
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
What can we do without money?

767
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,840
Wrong.

768
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,920
There's something more urgent than that.

769
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,110
One world,

770
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,350
loyalty.

771
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,720
Loyalty?

772
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,400
For my Imperial Guards,

773
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,110
the first priority

774
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:46,240
is to make sure
every member is loyal to the Qing dynasty.

775
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,930
That's true.

776
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,070
So do you think

777
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,270
the six Beiyang Divisions
can guarantee this?

778
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,030
It's hard to say.

779
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
But right now,

780
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,100
Yuan is hiding in his hometown in Zhangde

781
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
as a fisherman.

782
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,050
"A lonely fisherman fishing snow in a boat."

783
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,250
It's in the newspaper.

784
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,360
Those who hide and bide their time

785
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,970
like Jiang Ziya fishing by the river

786
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,830
are not rare throughout history.

787
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,020
Mr. Liang,

788
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,240
Sir,

789
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,670
we've spotted two suspicious persons

790
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,730
from a photography studio

791
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,030
on the outer street of East Straight Gate.

792
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:42,840
For the past two days,

793
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,550
they've been monitoring

794
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,150
the Prince Regent's convoy.

795
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:51,030
Don't do anything to those two.

796
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,840
Have someone keep a close eye on them.

797
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,440
See if they have any contacts

798
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,250
out of the photography studio.

799
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,460
Try to find out what exactly
they're up to.

800
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,230
Zhaoming,

801
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,470
is your copper wire long enough?

802
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,320
Yeah,

803
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,050
but where should I connect it?

804
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,250
Wait there.

805
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,260
I'm coming over.

806
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,270
Catch the thief!

807
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Thief!

808
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,840
There's a thief! Catch him!

809
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,880
Catch the thief!

810
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,110
Where's the thief?

811
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,590
Outside the alley entrance,

812
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,880
under the small stone bridge!

813
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,280
Hurry up!

814
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,880
Grab your weapons!

815
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,480
Follow me to catch the thief!

816
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,150
Thief! Catch the thief!

817
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,840
Coming, coming!

818
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,320
Where is he?

819
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,150
Outside the alley entrance,

820
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,150
under the small stone bridge!

821
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,070
Let's go! Go!

822
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,670
Hurry up!

823
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:04,360
Hurry!

824
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,670
Thief! Catch the thief!

825
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,250
Mr. Liang.

826
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,490
This way, please.

827
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,190
At first, we only

828
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,030
notified the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

829
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,050
But then we realized a problem.

830
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,040
This small stone bridge

831
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,320
is on the Prince Regent's daily route

832
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,050
to the court.

833
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,590
It concerns the Prince Regent's safety.

834
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,440
So we must inform

835
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,900
you, the Imperial Guards.

836
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,540
Be careful, Mr. Liang.

837
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,830
What is this telephone for?
