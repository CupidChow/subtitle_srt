[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,940
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,640
Let me look at you.

4
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,009
A fine-looking little rebel.

5
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,990
But that look
in your eyes is still the same.

6
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,920
One can never guess

7
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,450
what's really underneath.

8
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,039
Back when you came to me

9
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,170
scamming for money,

10
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,020
you had that same look.

11
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,280
When I saw you,

12
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,710
I was touched.

13
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,840
You reminded me of myself when I was young.

14
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,040
I was all alone,

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,430
making my way in Shanghai.

16
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,830
Not a penny to my name,
but a lot of ambition.

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,110
I had that same look in your eyes.

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,240
Master,

19
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,850
I've always worked hard to learn from you.

20
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:15,870
I'm trying to have

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,470
that same spirit you've got.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,770
Even if you're stuck in a matchbox,

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
you're still the master of infinite space.

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
When did I ever say

25
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,960
that?

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,079
Hamlet said it.

27
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,520
Who is Hamlet?

28
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,920
Master,

29
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,000
l-let's not get into

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,890
all that today.

31
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,520
I'm here to see you

32
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
because

33
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,480
I want to ask…

34
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,140
if you could help me

35
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,270
find a job.

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
I originally

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
hitched my wagon to a classmate.

38
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
I thought he had a bright future.

39
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,560
Turns out he didn't.

40
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,079
The court only gave him a lowly post,

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,280
and he's not doing so well himself.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,940
So here I am,

43
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,680
asking you for help.

44
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,510
First Homer's Epic Poems,

45
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,750
then Hamlet.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,630
You learned all that

47
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,360
Western knowledge
at the Tokyo Military School.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,000
With all that talent of yours,

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,960
you still need me

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
to help you find a job?

51
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,690
What's the use of that?

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,710
You're the vice president
of the Shanghai Business Association.

53
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,080
Your influence knows no bounds!

54
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,590
What influence?

55
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
Just one lowly eunuch

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,560
in charge of palace supplies

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,150
has me running around

58
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,550
like a headless chicken.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,079
I even have to put on a smile later

60
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,810
and invite him over for dinner.

61
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,750
A eunuch?

62
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,430
What for?

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,960
Same old palace mess.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,190
Empty promises; fickle as ever.

65
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,360
Why else do you think I'm investing

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
in you hotheaded revolutionaries?

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,329
You're investing in me?

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Every businessman

69
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,690
is gambling these days.

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Everyone is placing their bets

71
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,290
and hedging their bets.

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Without you rebels,

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,370
the court would be even more arrogant.

74
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,730
Don't leave yet.

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,910
Eunuch Zhang is coming soon.

76
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,310
Wait till you see

77
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,430
how smug he is.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,870
Okay.

79
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,820
Great. Great.

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,750
Great.

81
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,920
It melts right in my mouth.

82
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,770
Great.

83
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,450
This is shrimp soup?

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,190
Yes.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,510
Great.

86
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,430
I'm afraid

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,440
even the Empress Dowager
has never tasted something so good.

88
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,510
Baoquan,

89
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,600
your family chef is amazing.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,600
As long as you enjoy it.

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,670
I have something to tell you.

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
Baoquan, go ahead.

93
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,480
Tell me. What is it?

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,000
This young man here

95
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,920
just graduated
from the Tokyo Military School.

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,920
He's eager to serve the court,

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,480
but sadly,

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,430
he hasn't been given a post yet.

99
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,160
Japan's all the rage these days.

100
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,870
Yes.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,950
Back from Tokyo?

102
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,070
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,000
A cadet from the Tokyo Military School,

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,730
Yang Kaizhi.

105
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,159
You really have good timing.

106
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,000
The Japanese

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,190
just knocked the Russians flat.

108
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,190
Now all the ministers are busy petitioning,

109
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,450
demanding

110
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,750
we learn from Japan
and start constitutional governance.

111
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,310
Yeah.

112
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,520
They're even planning
to send officials abroad for study tours.

113
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,510
Really?

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,430
One can't fight the trend.

115
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,640
Even the Empress Dowager

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,870
has to go with the flow.

117
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,710
The higher-ups are wise.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,560
They've got guts.

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
There's an opening—

120
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,190
a ready-made post.

121
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,430
Do you dare to take it?

122
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,730
Your timing is perfect.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,750
The other day, the Empress Dowager

124
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,210
offered condolences to the widow

125
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,040
of a recently killed
deputy commander from Yanji.

126
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,110
I was there too.

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,480
Poor girl,

128
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,390
widowed at just 20.

129
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,060
Her husband,

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,190
that deputy commander,

131
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,830
was killed by Japanese border troops

132
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,409
stationed in Korea.

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,390
The Japanese army is arrogant,

134
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,320
constantly stirring up
trouble at the border.

135
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,000
Three deputy commanders have already died.

136
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,920
This would be the fourth.

137
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,000
So you mean...

138
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,120
Boy,

139
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,860
do you dare take this job?

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,070
It's vacant.

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,750
If you dare,

142
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,240
I can put in a word for you.

143
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,460
[Summer, 31st Year of Guangxu, 1905 AD]

144
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,110
Don't go downstairs yet.

145
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,480
I need to talk to you.

146
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,700
Head back to Shanghai for me.

147
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,750
Leave tonight.

148
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,910
Sure.

149
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,610
Almost six months, right?

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,160
Just a few days short.

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,170
You can do it?

152
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,080
I think so.

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,000
Good.

154
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,750
Take this bomb

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,130
back to Shanghai and give it to Kaizhi.

156
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,600
He'll pass it on

157
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,440
to our comrades
from the North waiting there.

158
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,000
Got it.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
This bomb is safe.

160
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,030
It's still missing one step.

161
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,030
They'll complete it before using it,

162
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,240
so it poses no threat

163
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,240
to you or the baby.

164
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,740
This is the manual.

165
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,560
You're considerate.

166
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,590
I'll say it again—

167
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,960
no matter

168
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,850
who the father of this child is,

169
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,360
a child is a child.

170
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,030
I, Wu Tianbai,

171
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,180
will be this child's father.

172
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,420
I'm truly happy for the child

173
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,790
to have such a kind father.

174
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,490
Don't be sarcastic, Shuhong.

175
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,870
This will be a bomb

176
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,000
that shocks the world,

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
a bomb that goes down in history.

178
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,670
Precisely because it's so important,

179
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,980
we need your help

180
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,770
to send it back to China.

181
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,030
With your current situation,

182
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,490
you're the perfect person

183
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,480
to hide it
if there's any search along the way.

184
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,030
I'm so honored.

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
You should be.

186
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,140
We're having Western food today too.

187
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,220
You don't recognize me?

188
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Ms. Shuhong.

189
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,720
I'm Li Renjun,

190
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,730
Kaizhi and Liang Xiang's classmate.

191
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,870
We've met before—

192
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,840
that time at the Tokyo Police Station.

193
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,900
You've forgotten?

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,970
It was for that Korean girl.

195
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,730
I remember now.

196
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,250
You do?

197
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,510
Actually, we came to Japan

198
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,550
on the same ship back then.

199
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,680
This one right here.

200
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,390
Four years flew by.

201
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,870
I still remember you sitting

202
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,320
in this very spot back then.

203
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,550
Kaizhi, Liang Xiang, and I

204
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,080
were sitting at that table.

205
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,670
Back then,

206
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,600
you were even more lovely than now.

207
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,480
Now I just look

208
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,760
bloated and awkward.

209
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,480
Not at all.

210
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,500
Every mother-to-be

211
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,360
looks radiant,

212
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,320
just like you.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,170
Why are you only just heading back?

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,690
They had me stay in Tokyo

215
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,150
to accompany the military inspection group.

216
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,790
So I got delayed

217
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,390
and didn't go back
with Kaizhi and Liang Xiang.

218
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,910
Ah, the inspection group.

219
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,710
That's all the craze these days.

220
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
They're studying military affairs here,

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,030
and in Beijing, the Five Ministers

222
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,760
will go abroad
to study constitutional systems.

223
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,180
That bearded one is Gao Rongting,

224
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
a general from Guangdong.

225
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,600
He was a bandit in his early years,

226
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,790
later recruited by the court.

227
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,440
He still carries that bandit air.

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,480
They say he's in Japan
to study military affairs,

229
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,360
but the truth is,

230
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,210
he's only interested

231
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,210
in the red-light district of Ginza.

232
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,700
Any news from Liang Xiang?

233
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,650
How's he doing?

234
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,690
Not too great.

235
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,750
The court only made him

236
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,120
an officer
at the Military Education Department.

237
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,600
An officer
at the Military Education Department?

238
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,530
To put it plainly,
he's a military school inspector.

239
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,950
But don't worry.

240
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
He's from the imperial clan.

241
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,010
With his roots,

242
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,970
he'll become
a high official sooner or later.

243
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Worry about him?

244
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,030
Why should I?

245
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
I was just saying.

246
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,180
I've noticed he really cares about you.

247
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,840
Always asking Kaizhi about you.

248
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,240
Why would he ask about me?

249
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,900
Bannermen are more
direct than the Han people.

250
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,790
They don't sweet-talk
when they're chasing girls.

251
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,870
If they like someone,

252
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,870
they just show it with real actions.

253
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,440
What's wrong, Ms. Shuhong?

254
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,580
Sorry, I have to use the bathroom.

255
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,670
Renjun.

256
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,910
Stop flirting.

257
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,240
You scared her away.

258
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,150
Sir,

259
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,970
she's my classmate's sister.

260
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Your classmate

261
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,200
has such a beautiful sister?

262
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,010
Good. Good.

263
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,190
Feeling unwell?

264
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,550
Seasick, maybe?

265
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,910
I'm afraid so.

266
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,850
Then just sit still.

267
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,810
Do you have any luggage?

268
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,320
I'll carry it for you
when we reach Shanghai.

269
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,910
Our delegation has a carriage.

270
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,480
I can take you

271
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,080
straight to Kaizhi's place.

272
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,340
That's very kind of you.

273
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,660
Let me help you.

274
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,330
No need.

275
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,100
I have to go back to work.

276
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,440
Please tell Kaizhi

277
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,030
I'll get in touch with him another day.

278
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,910
Okay, bye.

279
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,290
Goodbye, Ms. Shuhong.

280
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,480
Why are you here?

281
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,600
Where is Kaizhi?

282
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:06,079
[Song Chen,
son of the vice president of the Shanghai Business Association]

283
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,550
My father

284
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,240
helped him secure a post—

285
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,829
deputy commander
of the Yanji Border Defense.

286
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,920
He left for Jilin this morning

287
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,980
to take up the post.

288
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,790
Is that so?

289
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,900
He told me to wait here for you.

290
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,210
So this is the thing?

291
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,869
Leave it to me.

292
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,520
I'll handle everything from here.

293
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,450
Wait, Song Chen.

294
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,440
Why are you

295
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,480
involved in all this too?

296
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,810
What's wrong with that?

297
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,839
You still look down on me?

298
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,829
I mean,

299
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,589
weren't you in Anqing,

300
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,200
studying at the New Knowledge Academy?

301
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,790
Well, people come and go,

302
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,680
and times change.

303
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,070
Back then,

304
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,720
you waited for me outside the school gate,

305
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,830
holding a parasol

306
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
and a handkerchief,

307
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
so full of charm.

308
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,110
Look at you now,

309
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,020
already pregnant.

310
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,300
Seriously,

311
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,150
who's the father of this child?

312
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,790
Kaizhi never mentioned

313
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,850
anything about it.

314
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,030
You still haven't moved on?

315
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,830
Of course not.

316
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,790
I just don't get it.

317
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,440
Why did you…

318
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,070
Enough.

319
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,830
Let's be serious.

320
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,960
Who's this for?

321
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,370
A revolutionary

322
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,250
from Baoding called Wu Yue.

323
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,260
Wu Yue?

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,270
From Baoding?

00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,940
carrying a bomb

571
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,639
with a trigger device,

572
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,340
disguised himself as a servant

573
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,630
and boarded

574
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,880
the ministers' train.

575
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,320
However,

576
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,889
before he had the chance

577
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,780
to throw the bomb,

578
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,810
the baggage car was attached.

579
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,949
The train jolted violently,

580
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
accidentally triggering the bomb.

581
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,030
The explosion

582
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,199
killed three people on the spot.

583
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,469
Minister Zaize

584
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,889
was slightly wounded.

585
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,969
Shaoying suffered serious injuries.

586
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,960
The assassin Wu Yue

587
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,030
died instantly.

588
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,190
Using one man's death

589
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,110
to awaken all under heaven,

590
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,520
to open their eyes
to this hypocritical court—

591
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,680
it's worth it.

592
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,210
What's wrong, Tianbai?

593
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,890
I thought

594
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,880
I could burst this big illusion,

595
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,710
but things didn't go as I wished.

596
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,540
Indeed.

597
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
The court

598
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,630
doesn't seem to have wavered at all

599
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,240
in its resolve

600
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,720
to send officials abroad.

601
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,280
What's wrong, Shuhong?

602
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,920
Shuhong?

603
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,190
Shuhong!

604
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,130
Tao, hurry! Help her!

605
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,310
Shuhong!

606
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,840
Shuhong!

607
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,920
Nurse,

608
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,110
how is she?

609
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,860
She's given birth.

610
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,940
Congratulations.

611
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,110
It's a boy.

612
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,800
And…

613
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,150
how is she?

614
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,320
Mother and child are both safe.

615
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,630
Great!

616
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Great!

617
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,670
Nurse,

618
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,330
thank you.

619
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,170
Thank you.

620
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,630
Take a look.

621
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,630
What a beautiful baby.

622
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,750
Shuhong.

623
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,110
Shuhong.

624
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Wake up.

625
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,150
Eat something.

626
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,080
You have no idea. You scared me to death.

627
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,880
Falling down that long staircase.

628
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,480
I saw you lying there,
and my legs just gave out.

629
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,360
Believe it or not,

630
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,820
in that moment,

631
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,630
I literally felt

632
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,560
my legs shaking.

633
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,630
Everything went dark.

634
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,960
I thought I'd lose you.

635
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,800
But right then,

636
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,410
I figured it out.

637
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,440
In this world,

638
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,840
the one thing I absolutely can't lose

639
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,480
is you.

640
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,640
What's wrong?

641
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:16,760
Milk.

642
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,630
Milk?

643
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,030
Right.

644
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,150
Tomorrow morning,

645
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,750
you can breastfeed the baby.

646
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,130
So quickly?

647
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,230
Of course.

648
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,950
Life itself is a miracle,

649
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,910
precise and perfect.

650
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,900
Nothing surpasses it.

651
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:48,970
Shuhong,

652
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,090
we've got to raise him well

653
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,440
and watch him grow

654
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,550
into a big, strong boy.

655
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,750
Do you agree?

656
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,220
My son.

657
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,360
Don't shout at him. You'll scare him.

658
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,810
He's not that delicate.

659
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,440
Right, son?

660
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,970
I have to give you a name.

661
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,950
A good name.

662
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,880
There's a saying:

663
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,900
"When a dragon holds a pearl,
it ignores the fish around."

664
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,230
Let's use the two characters
that mean "ignore."

665
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,150
Wu Bugu.

666
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,190
Wu Bugu?

667
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,280
Yes.

668
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,440
I, Wu Tianbai,

669
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,630
am a dragon—

670
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,950
full of ambitions and ideals!

671
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,150
I'll ignore all those small fries.

672
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,840
That doesn't sound like a name.

673
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,880
A name should be unique,

674
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,920
right?

675
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,250
It's settled then.

676
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,630
Wu Bugu!

677
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,630
Wu Bugu! Wu Bugu!

678
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,920
Wu Bugu! Wu Bugu!
