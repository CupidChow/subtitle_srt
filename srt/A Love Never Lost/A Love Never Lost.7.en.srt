[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,900
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,340
This is it.

4
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,289
Liang Xiang.

5
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,310
You go first.

6
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,990
Why should I go first?

7
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,430
Look.

8
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,510
The important guests are here.

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,280
They are here for you, Tufang.

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,840
For me?

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,590
Why me?

12
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,080
They are from your main family.

13
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,580
Don't you recognize them?

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,380
The one leading them is Prince Qing's son.

15
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,590
Young Prince Zaizheng.

16
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,590
The one behind is the Japanese envoy.

17
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,920
Young Prince Zaizheng?

18
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
I don't know him.

19
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,710
Aren't you here in place

20
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,840
of someone from Prince Qing's family?

21
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,490
You've never seen him?

22
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,829
I don't know him.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,900
Your ancestor was Prince Rui.

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,360
His father is Prince Qing.

25
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,150
You took his place

26
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,079
to study abroad.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
It doesn't matter if you don't know him.

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,260
You'll know him once you go in there.

29
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,520
Why should I meet him?

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,570
Is it necessary?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,590
I'm not going.

32
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,790
You can go if you want.

33
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,240
I already told him you were coming.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,000
If you don't show up now,

35
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,710
what do I tell him?

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,370
Did I ask you to contact him?

37
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,960
You got yourself into this,

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,260
sort it out on your own.

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,150
Are you going to a restaurant with me,

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,610
or will you stick with him?

41
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,310
Look at what you've done.

42
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,600
Even if both of you don't go,

43
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,510
I have to go in and settle things.

44
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,240
Okay.

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,680
The two of you can go and socialize.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,960
I'm going to eat alone.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,910
Tufang!

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,120
My goodness.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Why are you so bad-tempered?

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,079
Fine.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,800
I, Li Renjun,

52
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,980
will sacrifice myself to appease the lord.

53
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,680
Go in by yourself.

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,810
I'll accompany him to the restaurant.

55
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:24,730
Tufang!

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,490
Qianli, my friend.

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't you think Kaizhi

58
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,360
is such a strange guy?

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,560
He's just a military student.

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,960
But instead of studying,

61
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,870
he insists on getting involved

62
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,000
with the officials visiting Japan.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,870
He's even dragging me along with him.

64
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,120
What does he want?

65
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,120
Enjoy.

66
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
His spoken Japanese

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,870
is awful.

69
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,710
But he insists on being the tour guide,

70
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,590
But he's eager to follow

71
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,190
anyone and everyone around.

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,960
Tell me.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
What does he want?

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,240
We call that

75
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,000
walking the tightrope with a blindfold.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,399
Too bold for his own good.

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,800
Among us military students in Japan,

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
Yang Kaizhi is the most daring.

79
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,600
He's not afraid of anyone

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,260
and interacts with everyone.

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,870
Who else did he hang out with?

82
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,070
Last month,

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,360
in Kanda.

84
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,120
Guess who he met.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Who?

86
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360
A whole bunch of rebels.

87
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,400
Really?

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,920
That day,

89
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,350
he dragged me to see Liang Qichao.

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,409
From Kang's party!

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,370
Can I meet Liang Qichao?

92
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,159
Absolutely not!

93
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,050
I was recommended by Mr. Yuan.

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,610
Mr. Yuan is rivals with Kang and Liang.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,040
If he keeps this up,

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
sooner or later, his name will show up

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,450
on the court's wanted list.

98
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,330
His name was on that list

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,070
ever since he left Shanghai.

100
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,070
Really?

101
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,750
However,

102
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,520
the imperial officials

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
can't do anything to him.

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,920
Somehow,

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,600
he hooked up with the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

106
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,160
Liu Kunyi personally recommended him for this program.

107
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,870
Besides,

108
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,990
for some reason, Mr. Song of the

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Shanghai Business Association

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,100
is also secretly supporting him.

111
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
Where else did he get the money

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,560
to fool around in Tokyo?

113
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,630
There sure are some impressive individuals

114
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,630
hidden among us military students.

115
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,560
Tufang.

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,850
Look who's here.

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,650
Young Prince Zaizheng came to meet you in person.

118
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,790
I've heard a lot about you, Brother Tufang.

119
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,810
Your Highness.

120
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,600
Call me Zaizheng.

121
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,700
We're family, there's no need for formalities.

122
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,860
Renjun.

123
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,570
Let's go.

124
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,210
Have a seat.

125
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
I came from Osaka.

126
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,510
[Son of Prince Qing, Yikuang, the Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs]
[Aisin Gioro Zaizheng]

127
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,600
They are holding

128
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,310
the National Industrial Exhibition over there.

129
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,890
The night was lit by colorful lights, and the roads were wide and even.

130
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,630
Western buildings with eight-sided window lattices were everywhere.

131
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,750
The glass has five colors,

132
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,010
and carriages and horses chase the wind.

133
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,830
Father told me about you,

134
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,270
someone from the imperial clan,

135
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,120
studying

136
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,800
military affairs in Japan.

137
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,120
Prince Qing?

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,950
Yes.

139
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,120
He found your name

140
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,120
in the clan book

141
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
of the Imperial Clan.

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,159
That’s why he sent an order

143
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,159
to pick you out from the Banner Battalion in Jingzhou.

144
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,870
I see.

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
For this,

146
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,159
he even reported to the Empress Dowager.

147
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,830
Her Majesty showed great approval

148
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,030
of this arrangement.

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,310
I didn't know that was what happened.

150
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,840
I neglected your kindness.

151
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,160
My sincere apologies.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,600
Actually, your spot

153
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
belonged to my younger brother.

154
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
I know.

155
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
He's not as good as you.

156
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,659
He was very spoiled when he was young.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,530
If we had given him the spot,

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,060
it would have been wasted.

159
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,510
So Father didn't agree.

160
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,800
He thinks highly of you.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,130
When I came to Tokyo,

162
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,830
he specifically asked me

163
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,060
to meet you

164
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,960
and evaluate you in person.

165
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,000
He has chosen the right person.

166
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,690
You hold a fiery gaze in your eyes,

167
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,490
and you look like a man of skills.

168
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,400
When I go back,

169
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll report to him.

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,450
He will be happy to know.

171
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,870
This is...

172
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,360
Father asked me

173
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,830
to bring you this money.

174
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I can't accept it.

175
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,650
Absolutely not.

176
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
The court issued this money.

177
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,900
Father approved it.

178
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
He wants you to use it

179
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,480
to recruit military talent in Tokyo.

180
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,230
He wants me to do it?

181
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,270
The rebels in Tokyo

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,929
are fighting for military talent.

183
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,080
We can't win without money.

184
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,440
Currently, the imperial court

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,039
is reorganizing the military

186
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,320
and establishing a new army.

187
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,980
We lack reliable individuals

188
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
who can lead the army.

189
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,090
Use this money

190
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
to pay for meals and solve problems.

191
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,630
Gather some popularity.

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,490

don't think of yourself

196
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,530
as a soldier.

military leader of the imperial court.

199

The imperial clan

I'm here. Nice to meet you.

You're here.

204
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,840
Have you eaten?

205
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,790
I've eaten.

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,030
What should I call you?

207
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,530

210
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,390
Wait here.

211
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,600
Here.

212
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,480
It's red too.

213
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,770
Yes, but it's much prettier than me.

214
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,680
Cai Guangqi, too.

215
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,340
This is also Mr. Cai's work?

216
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
He's good.

217
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,360
I like black and red.

218
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,910
He uses them well.

219
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,640

Understood.

It's the content and size of the art piece.

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Wait, Tianxiang.

Look at you.

255
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,160
I was just about to gather my thoughts.

What can he do?

257
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,980
Shuhong had washed her hands of the matter.

258
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:28,960
Where did she go?

259
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,030
She went to the ink painting place.

260
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,640
Ink painting?

261
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,550
She's working for painters now.

262
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,790
Painter?

263
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560

Painters like Cai Guangqi.

265
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,770
There are dozens of them.

266
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,680
Dozens?

267
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,910
Coming.

268
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,830
Are you Mr. Zhu Wentong?

269
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,550
Yes.

270
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,610
I'm from Mr. Kanyama's stationery store.

271
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,670
Come in.

272
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,690
I've never seen you before.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,930
Are you new here?

274
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,910
Yes.

275
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,120
Mr. Kanyama would like to congratulate you.

276
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,000
Another order for

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,330
a four-foot painting of a crane has arrived.

278
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,190
What's there to congratulate me?

279
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,200
I've already talked to him.

280
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,000
I won't make

281
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,960
any more

282
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,440
traditional realistic crane paintings.

283
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,030
But...

284
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,940
Isn't this a forced purchase?

285
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm not short of money.

286
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,120
This is a whole sheet of Shuxuan paper.

287
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,850
I can tell by a single touch that

288
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,000
this is an authentic product

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,030
from Xuancheng County.

290
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,150
How can Japan make this?

291
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,120
Don't you need

292
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,110
Shuxuan paper for traditional realistic paintings?

293
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,420
My father paints too.

294
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,310
He layers the ink strokes all the time,

295
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,480
so he has to use Shuxuan paper.

296
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,940
How can we use other paper?

297
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,600
Here are the paints that you

298
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,860
prefer painting with.

299
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,860
Chinese-green, vine-yellow, and powder-white.

300
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,000
I saw the cranes you drew

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,930
at the shop.

302
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
You like to use lotus-flower mauve.

303
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,120
My father likes that color too.

304
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,520
He doesn't call it the lotus-flower mauve.

305
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,930
Instead, he calls it Xueqing.

306
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,240
The most interesting thing is,

307
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,560
the name he gave my sister

308
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,670
is Xueqing.

309
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,910
Where did Mr. Kanyama

310
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
find such a shop assistant

311
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,030
like you?

312
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,150
Actually, drawing a lot of cranes

313
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,010
is always a good thing, never bad.

314
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Just look at how well you look.

315
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,200
The crane is a symbol of longevity.

316
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,130
How could the Japanese understand

317
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,880
the delicacy of our ancestors?

318
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,910
Am I right?

319
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,910
Young lady,

320
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,860
you're really good at doing business.

321
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,750
What price did he offer?

322
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,550
Let me see.

323
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,910
Mr. Kanyama said

324
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,550
he'll only offer the best price for you.

325
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
Have a look.

326
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,210
How can I see

327
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,150
without glasses?

328
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,630
Well...

329
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,750
Alright.

330
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,670
Go back and tell Mr. Kanyama.

331
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,240
This is the last time.

332
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,260
I won't ever draw it again.

333
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,120
You are my lucky star.

334
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,440
You completed my first order.

335
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
Your name is Shuhong?

336
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,880
Yes, it's very old-fashioned.

337
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,680
It's not that old-fashioned.

338
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,270
Do you really think

339
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,120
my cranes are good?

340
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,630
They're not good.

341
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,360
They're the best!

342
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,670
The cranes are dancing.

343
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,940
Red ink colors the clouds

344
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,480
and deep green dyes the land.

345
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,910
It's as if the painting is alive.

346
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,170
Who would have thought

347
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,440
that you understand my work so well?

348
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,520
The Captain of the Inukai Regiment told me that

349
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,710
he was very satisfied with

350
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,620
your recent performance.

351
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,160
What's wrong?

352
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
You have always

353
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
appeared moody lately.

354
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,360
Tell me what happened.

355
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,230
It's about my mother.

356
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,280
Your mother?

357
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,280
Yes.

358
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,090
I'm very worried about her.

359
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,810
Her asthma is acting up again.

360
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,720
Is that so?

361
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,640
My mother and I care for each other deeply.

362
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,790
At 17, she married into the Banner Battalion.

363
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,190
Then she gave birth to me.

364
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,030
Later, my father passed away.

365
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,910
She raised me alone.

366
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,740
It was very difficult for her.

367
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,910
The close relatives of the Imperial Family

368
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,240
suffered such a fate...

369
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,910
It is truly saddening...

370
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,670
Is it possible for her to stay in Tokyo

371
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,060
for a month or two?

372
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
I know a doctor

373
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,050
who is good at treating asthma.

374
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,109
Tufang.

375
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
You bought so many things.

376
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,490
Why? Are you treating someone?

377
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,690
My mother is coming to Tokyo.

378
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,550
I need to make some preparations.

379
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,950
I'll get it for you.

380
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,109
Your mother is coming to Tokyo?

381
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,310
When is she arriving?

382
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,830
Within the next few days.

383
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,580
Laixi, the battalion commander in Shanghai,

384
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,440
just bought a boat ticket for her.

385
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,500
Where will she live?

386
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,810
Your mother is a princess.

387
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,580
She can't live in a shabby place.

388
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,400
I found a place

389
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,460
for her in the city.

390
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,400
When the time comes,

391
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,590
you and Kaizhi can come and visit.

392
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,350
Sure.

393
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,740
Do you need to buy anything else?

394
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,520
Another new customer?

395
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,320
Shuhong.

396
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:04,870
Yes.

397
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,550
Did you say anything to him?

398
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,720
No.

399
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,950
I didn't say anything.

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,110
Why does it feel strange?

401
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,790
Strange?

402
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,680
He didn't even smile at me.

403
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,860
It made me feel like I owe him something.

404
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,630
That's strange.

405
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,400
We're here, sir.

406
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,480
Thank you.

407
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
Good work.

408
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Nice to meet you.

409
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,160
This way, please.

410
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,260
Watch your step.

411
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,480
Welcome.

412
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,810
You must be tired.

413
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,230
There are steps here.

414
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,000
Please be careful.

415
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,830
It's right here.

416
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,920
I specially reserved a room for you.

417
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,640
I hope you can rest well.

418
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,310
Ma'am.

419
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,490
Please take off your shoes.

420
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,700
What is she saying?

421
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,710
They have rules here.

422
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,520
You can only enter after taking off your shoes.

423
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,720
Put them here on rainy days.

424
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,690
I don't understand a word.

425
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,880
This is the place.

426
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,830
Have a good rest.

427
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,320
Thank you very much.

428
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Have a good rest.

429
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,810
A guest is here?

430
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,110
Business is good.

431
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,640
Yeah.

432
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,440
Sister Yoko can't stop smiling.

433
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,400
When did you start

434
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,930
calling that woman sister?

435
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,790
My son.

436
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,380
Give me some water.

437
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,650
The journey made me so thirsty.

438
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,000
You didn't drink any water on your way here?

439
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,970
I didn't dare to.

440
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,400
You have to go to the toilet if you drink too much.

441
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,110
Let me tell you.

442
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,550
The latrine on the boat...

443
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,010
It's...

444
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,440
It's uncomfortable to sit on.

445
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,450
When I sit on it,

446
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,920
I feel like I can't pee.

447
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,550
You are really...

448
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,790
The saying was right.

449
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,320
Everything is good at home,

450
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,680
everything is difficult outside.

451
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,280
My son.

452
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,830
Why don't I see a bed

453
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,510
in this room?

454
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,410
Where should I sleep tonight?

455
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,770
I'll make it for you.

456
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,110
Make it?

457
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,480
I have to sleep on the floor?

458
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,280
That's the Japanese habit.

459
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,440
Does Duke Ayakura

460
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,480
own this shop?

461
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,200
No.

462
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,640
Duke Ayakura

463
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,100
has hired a doctor for you.

464
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,880
I can't bother him anymore.

465
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,090
So I found this room myself.

466
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,770
Besides, there are many Chinese nearby.

467
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,790
It's convenient for you to stay here.

468
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,350
Okay.

469
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,030
Good idea.

470
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,960
We can be at ease.

471
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,400
Mother.

472
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,860
I can't accompany you tonight.

473
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,350
I have to go back to the team.

474
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,160
Tomorrow, I have to spend the whole day

475
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,490
training with the team.

476
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,200
School admission day is coming.

477
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,680
It's time for the carp to leap over the dragon's gate.

478
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
If it leaps over,

479
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,550
it's a dragon.

480
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,320
If I can't leap over the gate,

481
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,450
I'll still be a fish.

482
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,810
A chubby fish.

483
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,710
Go.

484
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,600
Don't worry about me.

485
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,940
I'm old.

486
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,810
It doesn't matter where I die.

487
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,700
Besides,

488
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,510
don't you know

489
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,840
how capable your mom is?

490
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,750
Girl,

491
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,110
are you Chinese?

492
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,880
Come here.

493
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,410
I want to ask you something.

494
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,490
Well, I can't step on this.

495
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,720
Come here.

496
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,920
Old Lady, what is it?

497
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,160
Well,

498
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,250
you just called me Old Lady.

499
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,270
Am I that old?

500
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,400
No, no, no.

501
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,680
You're not old at all.

502
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,290
Call me Madam Liang.

503
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,160
My son is a military student.

504
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,350
We came from Hubei.

505
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,080
We arrived here last night.

506
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,970
I don't understand Japanese.

507
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Look at me.

508
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,880
I don't even know

509
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,200
where I should go to eat.

510
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,070
Well.

511
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,480
Don't worry, Madam Liang.

512
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,740
I'm going to ask Madam.

513
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,510
You stay here.

514
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm going to ask her now.

515
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay.

516
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,270
Girl, thank you.

517
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,750
Come in.

518
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,510
The food has been prepared for you.

519
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,110
She didn't expect you to get up so early.

520
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,720
Here, have some first.

521
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,440
Madam will be here soon.

522
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,020
Girl,

523
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,310
the winter in Japan

524
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,740
is much colder than the winter in Jingzhou.

525
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,030
According to bannermen's habits,

526
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,640
there should be a cup of hot tea

527
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,310
to moisten the throat before breakfast.

528
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,650
Well, the tea...

529
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,920
No wonder they say bannermen are poor.

530
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,830
We spit

531
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,290
in brick joints.

532
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,830
When we buy some tea,

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,890
we display it to show off.

534
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,720
Fine.

535
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll go back to my home

536
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,880
and get you a cup of tea.

537
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,400
Okay.

538
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,520
Girl, wait.

539
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,350
Don't you Japanese people have a chair

540
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,720
in your room?

541
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,940
Tell Madam.

542
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,830
I'm old.

543
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
If I always sit on the floor,

544
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,310
I can't take it.

545
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,510
You should at least

546
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,400
get me a stool.

547
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,680
I'll find one for you.

548
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Thank you.

549
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,960
Do you adapt to the life in Japan?

550
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,590
Do you feel cold?

551
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,790
Please take care of yourself.

552
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,510
Come in.

553
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,960
Japanese sounds nice.

554
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,700
But I can't understand it.

555
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,790
Girl, thank you.

556
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,200
There's no stool.

557
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,110
I brought you this.

558
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,140
This will do.

559
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,920
No.

560
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,240
This is not for sitting.

561
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,270
She wouldn't let you sit on it.

562
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,270
Really?

563
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,350
Can I sit on it after she leaves?

564
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:24,880
Yes.

565
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,400
Okay, take it away.

566
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,000
This old lady is really high-maintenance.

567
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,350
There are so many rules.

568
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,350
Let me tell you, she is a bannerman.

569
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,450
A bannerman?

570
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
You are not from the same ethnic group?

571
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:40,910
No.

572
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,930
She's a noble.

573
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,400
Maybe

574
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,000
her identity is Gege.

575
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,240
Gege is...

576
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,320
Gege?

577
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,290
What?

578
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,640
They also have Gege.

579
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,160
Gege is a counterpart

580
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
of your princess.

581
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,470
Princess?

582
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
She is a princess?

583
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,110
So

584
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,350
you should provide better breakfast.

585
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:03,970
Yes.

586
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,000
Sorry.

587
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,560
She's acting strangely.

588
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,920
I really can't stand it.

589
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,440
Madam Liang, I have to go to work.

590
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,170
I'm leaving.

591
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,800
Can you take her with you?

592
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,200
Son,

593
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,990
how much do they cost?

594
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,010
The money for the people should be spent by the people.

595
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,610
Then the world will be yours.

596
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,400
What kind of tone is this?

597
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,270
Back then,

598
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,910
Prince Qing gave me some money

599
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,640
and asked me to recruit more talents for the country.

600
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,830
Prince Qing?

601
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,660
Yes.

602
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,800
It's the Qing dynasty's money.

603
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,060
If I don't use it now, when should I use it?

604
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,140
By the way,

605
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,080
I have invited

606
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,710
dozens of military students

607
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,980
to our place on Sunday.

608
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,880
On that day,

609
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,400
you must help me keep up appearances.

610
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay.

611
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Just invite them.

612
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,130
These Japanese foods

613
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,350
are nothing special.

614
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,590
We should make something special to show our sincerity.

615
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,270
I'll ask

616
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,750
the girl in the opposite room

617
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,880
to buy some fresh meat for me.

618
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,990
Let's cook some steamed buns.

619
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,670
Okay.

620
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,750
Why is it so lively

621
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,600
in that old lady's room?

622
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,680
Who are they?

623
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,750
So beautiful.

624
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm asking you.

625
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,540
Why would I know?

626
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,560
I don't have time for that.

627
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,160
Come here.

628
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,270
Have a look.

629
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,270
Does the banknote look nice?

630
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,910
All banknotes look nice.

631
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,350
It's more than that.

632
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Within the square inches lie a myriad of atmospheres.

633
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
Look at the lines and images.

634
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,310
What? Are you not done?

635
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,610
What if I

636
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,790
draw one

637
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,510
that is identical to this?

638
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
They say

639
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,870
every line drawn

640
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,260
and every color used by Cai Guangqi are valuable.

641
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,920
Wu Tianbai is more impatient.

642
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,570
You want to draw a banknote.

643
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,270
Why not?

644
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,160
Do you really want to draw a banknote?

645
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,240
What does the revolution in China

646
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,640
lack the most currently?

647
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,400
Money.

648
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,110
I'm also short of money.

649
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,310
Everyone is short of money.

650
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,120
You can't make counterfeit banknotes just because you're short of money.

651
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,340
Shuhong, you can't say that.

652
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,270
Do you think it's easy to make counterfeit banknotes?

653
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,000
Do you think anyone can do that?

654
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,340
Shuhong.

655
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm coming in.

656
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,480
Are you done?

657
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,390
Come on.

658
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,930
Take a closer look at this.

659
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,590
Is this

660
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,790
a beautiful picture?

661
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,570
Let me tell you.

662
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,140
Every country's currency

663
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,870
is the most beautiful picture.

664
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,640
Come. Come here.

665
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,300
Use this.

666
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,010
Look at this portrait.

667
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,790
How many lines

668
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,970
does the portrait consist of?

669
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,660
Shuhong, you have to find me

670
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,210
a top brushwork artist.

671
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,110
Only a top brushwork artist

672
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,690
can draw this.

673
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,680
Especially the portrait

674
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
on the banknote.

675
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Do you know why they use human portraits

676
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
as the main patterns

677
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,070
on banknotes?

678
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:40,830
Because human eyes

679
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,920
are the most accurate in recognizing humans.

680
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,400
Even an old lady who sells vegetables

681
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,350
can see

682
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,270
the differences in the faces.

683
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,790
You can't fool her.

684
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,440
This is our natural

685
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
recognition capability.

686
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,750
Let's... Let's talk about

687
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,950
this portrait again.

688
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,240
If we want to copy it precisely,

689
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
we have to copy tens of thousands of lines

690
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,920
accurately.

691
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,320
No one

692
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,500
but a top Chinese brushwork artist

693
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,480
can do it,

694
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,790
you know?

695
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,110
You know so many painters.

696
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,110
Help me find one.

697
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,650
Think about it.

698
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
This is a serious matter.

699
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,110
Which painter has the guts to help you?

700
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,350
It depends on

701
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,950
your revolution publicity.

702
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,760
Publicity

703
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
must come before a revolution.

704
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,110
With publicity, you will have an organization.

705
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,030
With an organization,

706
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,110
there will be armed operations.

707
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,360
With armed operations,

708
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
you can overthrow the Qing dynasty.

709
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,240
Do you think you can ask someone

710
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,110
to make counterfeit banknotes for you merely through revolution publicity?

711
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,000
An armed revolution in China

712
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,820
requires a large sum of money.

713
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,430
Making counterfeit banknotes is the best way.

714
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,400
First,

715
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
it can solve the financial problem.

716
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,410
Then it can disturb the finance of the Qing dynasty.

717
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,830
Japan's banknote-making technology is excellent.

718
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,480
We have found

719
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,740
an expert in this field

720
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,210
and are making a template.

721
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,720
Now,

722
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,750
all we need

723
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,240
a top brushwork artist.

724
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,920
Turn around.

725
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:42,690
[X-ray room]

726
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,160
Here.

727
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,640
Your mother smokes, right?

728
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,640
Yes.

729
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,400
Her lungs are fine.

730
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,510
But she'd better stop smoking.

731
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,750
Tobacco will cause asthma.

732
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,840
I see.

733
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,920
No.

734
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,550
You don't have to pay.

735
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,750
Duke Ayakura

736
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,250
has paid the fees.

737
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,830
Girl.

738
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,640
Come in.

739
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,110
What is this?

740
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,400
They say it's for treating an illness.

741
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,880
Something good in Japan.

742
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,550
The Japanese doctor said

743
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,360
I should stop smoking

744
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,270
because it's bad for my health.

745
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,470
I thought

746
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,160
he should say that

747
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,510
when he is at my age.

748
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,640
Where is your son?

749
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,310
He went to the army.

750
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,450
He said he'll enter the school the day after tomorrow.

751
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't understand.

752
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,070
Right. Girl,

753
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,160
do me a favor.

754
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,720
Go to the market

755
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,180
and buy me some fresh meat.

756
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,990
I'll cook steamed buns for you.

757
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,790
Okay.

758
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,170
Thank you.

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,720
Steamed meatballs,

760
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,510
fried cabbage,

761
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,610
braised noodles, pancakes,

762
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,400
fried Chinese leek dumplings,

763
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,170
fried fritter, and steamed buns.

764
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,230
They're all bannermen's favorites.

765
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,870
Bannermen don't call soju soju.

766
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,760
They call it fur-lined jacket.

767
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,480
If you drink some,

768
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,670
it can make you warmer than wearing a fur-lined jacket.

769
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,400
Literally.

770
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,610
Son, you're back.

771
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,880
Come on.

772
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,000
Let me introduce.

773
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,880
Mother.

774
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,480
You don't need to introduce.

775
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Madam Liang, I have something to do.

776
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,030
Don't go.

777
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,320
The guests will be here soon. Let's eat together.

778
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,070
Mother.

779
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,370
What's going on?

780
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,070
We met each other

781
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,199
on the ship to Japan.

782
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,070
She and her Mr. Wu

783
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,360
mind my identity as a member of the royal family very much.

784
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Really?

785
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,650
Why would I lie to you?

786
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,620
Since she minds,

787
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,770
we don't need

788
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,110
to be

789
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,900
so enthusiastic.

790
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,860
Loser.

791
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,550
Can you be more ambitious?

792
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,699
Ethnic groups don't matter.

793
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,620
You can't even handle a girl.

794
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,159
How can you recruit talents?

795
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,080
Forget it.

796
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,429
You have to be ambitious,

797
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,320
just like the old Taikhan.

798
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,020
Without his ambition,

799
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,350
how could he cross the border back then?

800
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,110
Understand?

801
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,690
Here. This is it.

802
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
We're here.

803
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,710
-Tufang.
-Tufang.

804
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,630
Coming.

805
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,420
Madam.

806
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,070
Kids. Hello.

807
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,320
Hello, Madam.

808
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,170
Hello.

809
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,980
Hello, Madam.

810
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,000
Don't mind it.

811
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,850
Bannermen

812
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,140
call boys "kids".

813
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,650
Then I'm a Shandong kid.

814
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,230
Go in. Hurry.

815
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,320
Take your time.

816
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,400
Come in.

817
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,460
Thank you, Madam.

818
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,550
It smells good.

819
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,030
It smells so good.

820
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,320
I can smell it.

821
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,070
What are they doing next door?

822
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,480
Why would I know?

823
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,400
Coming.

824
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,930
You're urging me again.

825
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,590
I haven't finished yet.

826
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,230
It's okay. Take your time.

827
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,240
Can I go in and take a look?

828
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,990
Just one look.

829
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,240
You little girl.

830
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,130
I don't want anyone

831
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,300
to disturb me while I'm drawing.

832
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,950
It's so vivid.

833
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,350
Look at the feathers.

834
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,720
You're impressive.

835
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,220
It's nothing.

836
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Back then,

837
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,050
when the empress dowager celebrated her 60th birthday,

838
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,840
the imperial family received a painting of mine.

839
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,070
The painting has nine cranes.

840
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,710
Really?

841
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,110
Awesome.

842
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,320
Your painting

843
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,320
was given to the empress dowager as her birthday gift.

844
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,950
It took me

845
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,920
half a year

846
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,840
to draw the nine cranes.

847
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,860
That's really something.

848
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,070
My hand was swollen.

849
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,320
I see.

850
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,710
You're as good as an imperial painter.

851
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,170
The money the shop gave you

852
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,840
is far from enough.

853
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,670
That's why I said

854
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,580
I didn't care about the money.

855
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,760
I have an idea.

856
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,920
What?

857
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,960
There's another way.

858
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,030
If you don't draw cranes,

859
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,030
can you draw people?

860
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,880
Portraits.

861
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,480
People?

862
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,150
Who?

863
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,630
The person on this.

864
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,400
Draw him?

865
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,920
He's an honorable man.

866
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,610
Only an honorable painter

867
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,570
like you can draw him.

868
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,070
That's a good idea.

869
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,120
I don't need to draw paintings anymore.

870
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,880
I can just draw banknotes.

871
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,190
That's right. It can save a lot of trouble.

872
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,990
Even if I spend the rest of my life

873
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,470
drawing banknotes,

874
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,130
how many can I draw?

875
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,360
They are not even enough to cover the time I spend.

876
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,550
You don't need to draw too many.

877
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,610
Just one is enough.

878
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,710
Good.

879
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,360
Just one.

880
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,730
We can print as many as we want.

881
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,330
By that time, we'll become a bank. Right?

882
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,190
It can save a lot of trouble.

883
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030
Just draw one,

884
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,090
and we don't need to worry about money for the rest of our lives.

885
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,370
You little girl.

886
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,630
You're really imaginative.

887
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,280
Is there such a good thing?

888
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,840
Just draw according to the rules.

889
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,880
Someone else will take care of the rest.

890
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,580
Other painters

891
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,310
are not as

892
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,860
meticulous as you, right?

893
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:05,480
Who are you talking about?

894
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,320
Have you heard of the Revolutionary Party?

895
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
Party members?

896
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,630
Revolution?

897
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,710
That's right.

898
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,830
They asked me to ask you

899
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,280
to draw just one banknote

900
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
of 10 yuan

901
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,380
of Imperial Bank of China.

902
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,400
Okay?

903
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,920
Little girl,

904
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,760
how old are you?

905
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,630
My nominal age is 19.

906
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,320
You are young

907
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,460
and pretty.

908
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,800
What a pity.

909
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,780
It's really a pity.

910
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,840
Take this.

911
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,860
Consider it my donation to your revolution.

912
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,070
This...

913
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,120
Take this two-crane painting too.

914
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,760
But...

915
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,070
tell Mr. Kanyama,

916
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,840
from now on,

917
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,710
I won't sell

918
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,600
any crane painting again.

919
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,240
Take it.

920
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,970
You haven't stamped your seal.

921
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,020
Let me help you.

922
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,490
What? He doesn't want to draw?

923
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,070
How can you be so straightforward?

924
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,150
You'll scare

925
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,080
old Mr. Zhu away.

926
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,430
When it comes to such a scary deal,

927
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:33,400
you will scare even the donkey away

928
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,860
when you tell him about it.

929
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,590
You should have reasoned with him

930
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,320
and treated him with kindness.

931
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
How should I reason with him?

932
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,240
Not to mention kindness.

933
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,680
You should have argued the case for revolution

934
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,610
and expressed the grief of people.

935
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:53,360
Where is my digest?

936
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,840
What digest?

937
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,410
It's Brother Zou Rong's new work.

938
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,990
Yes.

939
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,030
It's here.

940
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,170
Let me read a paragraph to you.

941
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,590
Listen to this. Just one paragraph.

942
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,800
To sweep away

943
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,710
thousands of years of authoritarianism.

944
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,050
To shed away

945
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,000
thousands of years of slavery.

946
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,110
To wash away

947
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,550
the shame of

948
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,410
260 years of cruelty and abuse,

949
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,840
and make mainland China a clean land.

950
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:39,050
The Emperor's descendants continue to live on prosperously.

951
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,150
Some resurrected,

952
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,360
and returned to their senses.

953
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,590
They got out of the 18 layers of hell,

954
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,150
ascended to the 33 levels of heaven,

955
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,280
and are full of zeal and vigor.

956
