[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,979
[Episode 18]

3
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,870
Here you are.

4
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,199
Mother asked me to bring you some oranges.

5
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,600
The wisteria is so fragrant.

6
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,590
It's like the scent is alive.

7
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,050
It keeps floating inside.

8
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,590
Yes.

9
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,930
It does smell good.

10
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,270
The grapes are most likely ripe.

11
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,110
The birds pecked at them so much.

12
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
Yes.

13
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,680
Your trip to Japan

14
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,540
must've

15
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,100
filled you with knowledge.

16
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,870
Nonsense.

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,000
What knowledge do I need for night watch in the government office?

18
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,680
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:51,910
How about

20
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,430
I tell Rong Ge and Luo Ge

21
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,430
to accompany you?

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,590
Why call them?

23
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,650
They are working.

24
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,940
Do you think they're like you,

25
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,140
looking for trouble?

26
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,040
What else can a woman do?

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,030
If I can find something out of nothing,

28
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,830
that's skill.

29
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
But the thing you found for me

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,630
is too big.

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,280
How big?

32
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,730
You want me to calculate it for you?

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,430
Go ahead.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,060
Listen carefully.

35
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,829
There are 3,700 German Mannlicher rifles,

36
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,800
around 100 pistols,

37
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,680
and 12 Glissement cannons.

38
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,390
What does this have to do with me?

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,160
How is it none of your business?

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,960
At first,

41
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,560
I could

42
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,220
at least be an imperial guard.

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,000
But because of you,

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,130
they wouldn't let me

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
and left me alone

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,310
in that Archives Room,

47
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,570
holding a pile of documents all day long.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,300
You must feel lost.

49
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,360
I'm lost?

50
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,590
You are

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
unable to eat or drink,

52
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,160
drawing your sword but looking around, lost.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
You know your poetry.

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,630
I think

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,590
the Heavenly Emperor's sword you brought back from Japan

56
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,850
is really a good sword.

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
Not at all.

58
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,950
I'm just a military education student from the Bureau of Military Training.

59
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,680
Wouldn't it be more ridiculous

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,920
if I had that fancy sword?

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,430
That's why I said

62
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,040
you draw your sword and look around, lost.

63
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm not the only one.

64
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,190
The whole Qing dynasty is lost,

65
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,310
dazed,

66
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,390
and uncertain of the end.

67
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,000
Sir!

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,430
Sir!

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,010
Big news!

70
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,720
Sir!

71
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,040
What is it?

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,280
The palace...

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,290
The carriage from the palace is parked outside.

74
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,750
The eunuch that came said...

75
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,920
He... He said...

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,780
What did he say?

77
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,070
The Empress Dowager...

78
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,700
The Empress Dowager wants to see you.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,540
The Empress Dowager?

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,980
Yes.

81
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,310
The Empress Dowager wants to see me?

82
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,750
Summoning Liang Xiang, cadet who studied abroad,

83
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,770
Military Education Department student of the Bureau of Military Training,

84
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,580
to have an audience with the Empress Dowager.

85
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,920
I, Liang Xiang, greet Your Highness.

86
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,860
[Cixi, Empress Dowager of the Great Qing Dynasty]

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,430
When did you cut your braid?

88
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,640
Your Highness,

89
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,200
I cut it in the second year of studying in Japan.

90
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,170
Is there anyone else in the imperial clan who did so?

91
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,780
Your Highness,

92
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,290
this is the only case

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
in the imperial clan.

94
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,070
What an anomaly.

95
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,750
Today, I want to hear your insights.

96
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,520
Liang Xiang was born in the imperial clan,

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,960
but he grew up in the Banner Battalion.

98
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Let him speak.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,510
Yes.

100
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,040
Someone told me

101
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,230
the capital will be in chaos.

102
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,840
It's all because of the bomb that killed the five ministers.

103
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,310
What do you think, Liang Xiang?

104
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,750
I...

105
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
don't believe so.

106
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,040
Your tone is

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,500
more certain than the Minister of Police's.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,240
When I was in Tokyo,

109
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,409
I interacted with the rebels.

110
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,630
You met them?

111
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,789
Yes.

112
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,480
They

113
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,909
often had regular meetings.

114
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,510
There were all kinds of people.

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,460
I don't think they're a developed force.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,510
Have you seen Kang Youwei?

117
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,790
No.

118
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Among the rebels,

119
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,390
he is the most despicable.

120
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,510
I believe

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,550
the most destructive of the rebels

122
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,780
are the most radical ones.

123
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,440
They support

124
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,630
using assassination as a means.

125
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,270
However,

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
they are not capable

127
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,670
to create chaos in Beijing.

128
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,510
I finally met a wise man today.

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
My profession

130
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,120
is actually military affairs.

131
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,500
Military affairs?

132
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,550
Zaifeng.

133
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,520
Yes, Your Highness.

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,210
Did you establish the military school

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
for the imperial clan

136
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,260
you suggested before?

137
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,130
Your Highness,

138
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
this matter

139
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,400
is handled by Prince Qing, Minister of

140
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,340
Chief Grand Council

141
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm just a student.

142
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,610
I just want to know if the class has started.

143
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,550
No.

144
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,000
I heard that he lacks teachers.

145
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,320
Tell Prince Qing

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,800
to start the class immediately.

147
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,560
Is it so hard to find a teacher?

148
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,670
I think the one before me is good.

149
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,130
For many years, the imperial clan

150
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,840
has completely ignored military affairs.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
How can that be?

152
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,320
Yes.

153
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,950
Do you know which word

154
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
you said that won over the Empress Dowager?

155
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,290
I was just spouting nonsense.

156
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,270
It seems

157
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,380
you really are an anomaly.

158
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,970
Did I say something wrong?

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

160
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,280
Wisdom is hidden in simple language.

161
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,320
You spoke well.

162
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,390
You don't know,

163
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,630
but the Empress Dowager is very annoyed recently.

164
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,290
After Japan defeated Russia,

165
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,630
so many new ideas

166
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,840
came flooding.

167
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,870
Constitutional monarchy,

168
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,400
abolish the Imperial Exam,

169
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,760
train new soldiers,

170
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,630
establish police, develop schools...

171
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,270
All of these

172
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,070
are new words.

173
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,090
The old woman

174
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,750
doesn't understand

175
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,870
these new ideas.

176
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,230
But I still don't understand

177
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,390
why the Empress Dowager

178
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,000
only summoned me.

179
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,270
It's a long story.

180
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,240
When I met the German emperor in Berlin,

181
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,080
he kindly reminded me,

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,530
saying the royal family must have an army.

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,480
The royal descendants

184
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,000
must be able to be military officers.

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,840
That's how Germany's

186
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,110
royal family is like.

187
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
After I came back,

188
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,490
I told Her Highness

189
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,110
what the German emperor said

190
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,080
and suggested to establish a military school for the imperial clan.

191
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,080
The Empress Dowager attached great importance to it.

192
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,510
But due to all kinds of problems,

193
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,270
the matter was delayed.

194
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,870
Recently,

195
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
the rebels' revolution is booming,

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,320
while military power

197
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,890
is completely in the hands of outsiders.

198
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,080
Therefore, my plan back then

199
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,660
was mentioned to the Empress Dowager again.

200
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,000
Everyone in the court can tell

201
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
that this matter

202
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,200
directly targets

203
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,130
Yuan Shikai of the Beiyang New Army's six garrisons.

204
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
Thus,

205
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,900
the Imperial Military Academy for the Nobility

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
was established in name.

207
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
Prince Qing, who is in charge of this,

208
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,320
was originally Yuan Shikai's support

209
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,630
in the palace.

210
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,550
How could he embarrass himself?

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
Coincidentally,

212
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,010
you appeared at this time.

213
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,320
You are the rare new military talent

214
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,870
of the imperial clan.

215
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,510
You were also recommended

216
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,120
by Prince Qing from the Imperial Clan Court's

217
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,320
family lineage book.

218
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
So,

219
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,360
the Empress Dowager wanted to hear your opinion.

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's been so many months since

221
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,670
the Imperial Military Academy for the Nobility was founded,

222
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,400
but there's never been a class.

223
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,630
It was my suggestion,

224
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,380
but as the first student,

225
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,070
I can’t say anything.

226
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,180
Now,

227
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,100
there's the imperial decree.

228
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Let's see if Yi Kuang dares to neglect this matter.

229
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,690
[Imperial Military Academy for the Nobility]

230
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,840
Sirs.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
Sirs, look over here.

232
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,080
Look here.

233
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,870
Sirs,

234
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,530
get ready for the photograph.

235
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,840
Stand still.

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,700
Ready. Come on.

237
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,890
One, two...

238
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,750
Sorry, sirs.

239
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,600
My apprentice forgot to put in the film holder.

240
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,400
Sorry.

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,550
Are you kidding me?

242
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,000
Can you do it or not?

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,440
We're all grand councilors,

244
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,770
princes, and lords.

245
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,630
Even the lowest ranked are regional generals.

246
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,870
That's right.

247
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,000
It's winter. Hurry up.

248
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,870
Hurry up. It's winter.

249
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,350
It'll be ready soon.

250
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,770
Sirs, it's ready.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Sirs, look here.

252
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,370
Look here.

253
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,510
Prince Qing.

254
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,440
Could you

255
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,530
give me a smile?

256
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:14,270
[Chief Grand Council Minister, Prince Qing] [Aisin Gioro Yi Kuang]

257
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,120
You are so auspicious.

258
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,870
One, two, three.

259
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,510
Sirs,

260
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,720
it's done.

261
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,090
You can relax.

262
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,080
Are you done?

263
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes, it's done.

264
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,090
Please relax.

265
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:31,930
Students, listen.

266
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,200
Students,

267
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,410
you study for the nation

268
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,320
and love yourself.

269
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Er,

270
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,990
don't just smile.

271
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,700
[The second son of Yi Kuang, Prince Qing, Chief Grand Council Minister] [Second Prince]

272
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,010
Do well for me.

273
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,390
Also,

274
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,770
Liang Xiang?

275
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,670
Teach well.

276
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,570
Your Highness, please.

277
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,670
Sirs,

278
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,200
please come to the restaurant

279
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,630
and eat to celebrate the school's opening.

280
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,120
Let's go and eat.

281
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,810
I'm really hungry.

282
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Hurry up.

283
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,510
I won’t eat.

284
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
Although I’m the first student,

285
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,830
I’m afraid I can’t take many classes.

286
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,710
I'm busy.

287
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,510
I know you're busy.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,740
You're the Minister of Military Review,

289
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,320
Minister of Imperial Escort,

290
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,950
General of Manchuria Plain Red Banner,

291
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,080
and you manage the Peking Field Force,

292
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,040
and the new and old barracks.

293
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,770
You coming today is already...

294
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,420
It's not that I don't want to take classes,

295
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,580
but that I can't.

296
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,440
So many people are

297
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,210
watching someone like me.

298
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,170
If I take anything seriously,

299
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,970
they'll feel sore about it.

300
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,880
"You really want to learn military affairs?“

301
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,140
”Really want to lead the empire's army?"

302
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,200
If I really did,

303
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,430
they'd be shaking.

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,960
Wouldn't they be

305
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,319
finding an opponent for themselves?

306
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,200
So,

307
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,329
I can only come for roll call.

308
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,740
Do you understand?

309
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,750
Must you be like this?

310
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,710
There's no other choice.

311
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,440
This is the court.

312
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,030
Fortunately, Zaixun and Zaitao are in the class.

313
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,680
You just

314
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,940
focus on teaching.

315
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,440
My two brothers will tell me.

316
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,940
Tufang, no need to wait.

317
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,960
Where are they?

318
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,130
Where'd they go?

319
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,000
Once they finished the meal,

320
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,660
they wiped their mouths

321
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,960
and ran off.

322
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,850
Ran off?

323
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,550
How could they?

324
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,400
Of course they ran.

325
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,750
These people

326
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,070
even dare to insult people before Prince Qing.

327
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:48,250
Who cares about you, Drillmaster Liang Xiang?

328
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,880
Who would really come to class?

329
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
They all went to do whatever they do.

330
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,310
Fortunately, the kitchen cooks well.

331
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,000
Otherwise,

332
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,210
they would've run away after the photo.

333
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,840
Tufang, forget them.

334
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,710
It's none of your business.

335
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,070
With me

336
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,640
and Seventh Lord here,

337
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,490
teach what you should teach.

338
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,670
Both of us

339
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,440
have to support you,

340
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
even if it's

341
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,640
just for

342
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,370
our Fifth Lord's sake, right?

343
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,590
Then I must thank Prince Chun.

344
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,130
We're family. You're welcome.

345
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,410
However,

346
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,670
Sixth Lord and I

347
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,570
are amateurs.

348
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,450
Don't make it too complicated.

349
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,510
Talk about some...

350
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,060
interesting things.

351
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,010
Yes.

352
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,700
Otherwise, your two students will run away too.

353
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Fine.

354
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,920
Don't sit so far away.

355
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,920
Sit closer

356
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,510
so I can keep my voice down.

357
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,480
The room is so empty.

358
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
If I shout as well,

359
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,250
I'll look even sillier.

360
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,120
No, Tufang.

361
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,710
Don't try to slack off.

362
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,840
You should

363
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,950
shout out as you should.

364
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,640
You need to train your vocal chords.

365
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,510
As for me,

366
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,350
I'll train my butt.

367
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,670
War

368
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,210
is the nation's great matter.

369
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,080
It pertains to people's lives and the nation's survival.

370
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,130
Importance must be placed upon it.

371
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,330
War is the nation's great matter.

372
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,250
It pertains to people's lives and the nation's survival.

373
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,330
Importance must be placed upon it.

374
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,690
War is the nation's great matter.

375
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,180
It pertains to people's lives and the nation's survival.

376
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,930
[Lecture Hall]

377
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,370
Importance must be placed upon it.

378
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
Accordingly, five points were summarized

379
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,350
for comparative calculation.

380
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,370
Are you alright?

381
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,420
Prince Qing doesn't care?

382
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Prince Chun doesn't care either?

383
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,060
He couldn't run away fast enough.

384
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,640
Then why do you, a mere
Military Education Department student,

385
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,270
care about this?

386
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,550
Forget it.

387
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,840
The eunuch is anxious instead of the emperor.

388
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,640
Just let it be.

389
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,350
Nowadays,

390
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,110
no one takes even the imperial edict seriously.

391
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,000
It's like the nation is dead.

392
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,270
But Mother,

393
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,310
I can't accept this.

394
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,330
After all, I've studied hard for years.

395
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,390
How can I while my days away like this?

396
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,270
Then what's your plan?

397
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,220
I want to rectify the academic atmosphere

398
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,620
and fight against these spoiled noblemen.

399
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,830
Fight?

400
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,770
Fight against them?

401
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,620
Fight against your students?

402
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,680
How can I

403
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,210
be played by these rascals?

404
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,340
Then I'd really be

405
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,270
failing the expectations

406
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,330
the Empress Dowager and Prince Chun.

407
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,210
I think you're like your grandfather.

408
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,510
You have that

409
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,240
unyielding stubbornness too.

410
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
I was born a descendant of Dorgon

411
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,600
and successor of Baturu.

412
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,310
Duo Mei.

413
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,110
Go and rest.

414
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,470
Sit.

415
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,400
My son.

416
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,630
Go and fight.

417
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,210
Just remember, don't fight with your mother.

418
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,920
Hurry up and get married.

419
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,310
Right?

420
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,090
She's such a good girl.

421
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,220
Why don't we wait a little longer?

422
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,570
After this passes.

423
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,740
You said that.

424
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,670
You agreed?

425
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,550
Yes.

426
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,720
I agreed.

427
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,140
We're starving.

428
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,270
Hurry up.

429
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,650
Only you guys are eating.

430
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,890
Where's my portion?

431
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,830
Hurry up and bring it to me.

432
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,290
I have important things to do after I'm done.

433
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,680
Second Lord, you haven't eaten yet?

434
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,200
Come on.

435
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,430
I just had a few bites.

436
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,390
Sit down and let's eat together.

437
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,510
Officer Liang, enjoy your meal.

438
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,460
Don't stand on ceremony.

439
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,270
There's even braised meat!

440
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,230
It smells so good.

441
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,970
This tastes

442
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,590
even better than my cook's food.

443
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,780
You're welcome.

444
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,530
I'm sorry, Second Lord.

445
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,030
Today's lunch

446
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,200
was made according to the number of students.

447
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,550
It's not for you.

448
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Officer Liang.

449
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,070
I showed you respect.

450
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,060
Are you trying to mess with me?

451
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,800
Second Lord,

452
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,840
you're being too formal.

453
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,200
I came here

454
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,270
because of the Empress Dowager's decree.

455
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,710
I'd love to get close to you.

456
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,970
How can I mess with you?

457
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,330
The Empress Dowager didn't ask me to do that.

458
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,430
She only asked me to teach military affairs.

459
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,760
It's fine as long as you don't mess with me.

460
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,790
In that case,

461
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,400
bring the food here.

462
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,440
My meal allowance

463
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,600
was rewarded by the Empress Dowager.

464
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,270
You can't embezzle it.

465
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,270
Right?

466
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,030
Yes, exactly.

467
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Hurry up.

468
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
Listen, Liang Xiang.

469
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,910
If you don’t give me lunch today,

470
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,200
don't blame me for being rude.

471
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,720
If we can't eat it, we'll smash it.

472
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,590
Then no one can eat it.

473
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,810
That's right. Don't provoke me.

474
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,790
Right?

475
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes.

476
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Take a piss and use it as a mirror.

477
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,400
Take a look at yourself.

478
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,310
You should go and ask

479
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,030
who we are.

480
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,070
As I said,

481
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,140
the school's food

482
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,750
is made according to the number of students.

483
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,310
If you want to enjoy the food,

484
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,070
please come early tomorrow.

485
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,910
The school rules are the rules.

486
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,590
School rules? Sounds interesting.

487
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,200
Officer Liang,

488
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,790
you really don't show me any respect.

489
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,860
I respect you.

490
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,060
That's why I'm explaining to you.

491
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,920
What a phrase!

492
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,610
But I don't understand

493
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,550
your Japanese words.

494
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,920
Look at your head.

495
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,070
You really are a fake foreigner.

496
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,530
You want to eat?

497
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,400
Eat!

498
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,790
Eat!

499
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,510
Eat your ass!

500
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,510
Guys, what are you doing?

501
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,190
Someone wants to mess with me.

502
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,310
I can't let them do it for nothing.

503
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,680
Well said.

504
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,920
Second Lord,

505
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,890
impressive.

506
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,330
Straightforward!

507
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,180
Did you see it clearly?

508
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,440
Remember who smashed what.

509
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,230
Write it down later,

510
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,100
so we know

511
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,410
where to get the compensation.

512
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,270
Good idea.

513
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:09,020
I'm going back to ask for money.

514
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,200
If you dare,

515
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,630
come with me to get it.

516
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,250
Let's go.

517
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,160
If this place doesn't want me,

518
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,130
then I'll go to a place that wants me.

519
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,370
See you.

520
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,960
Guys, let's go.

521
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,160
Let's go eat.

522
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm waiting for you.

523
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,590
Let's go.

524
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,610
This...

525
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,270
What should we do?

526
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,400
We must make a scene.

527
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,210
When it gets to Prince Qing,

528
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,070
that's what we want.

529
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,350
[Prince Qing’s Mansion]

530
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,310
Ridiculous.

531
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,440
Ridiculous.

532
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,680
That's ridiculous.

533
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,720
Er took the lead?

534
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,590
Yes.

535
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,310
He was the leader.

536
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,550
Where is he?

537
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,610
He went to the villa in the suburbs.

538
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,590
This bastard

539
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,030
humiliated me

540
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,310
in my old age.

541
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,170
Does the Empress Dowager know?

542
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:32,960
Liang Xiang is sensible

543
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,950
and didn't report it up.

544
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,990
He only told me.

545
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,510
It must be hard for him.

546
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,920
Did Zaifeng

547
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,680
say anything?

548
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
He should've taken care of it.

549
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,440
Zaifeng only attended the roll call.

550
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,210
He didn't go to class at all.

551
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,960
Didn't he advocate for this school?

552
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,220
What's the matter?

553
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,890
He doesn't care about this.

554
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,730
Then what does he care about?

555
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,600
His consort

556
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,480
gave birth to a boy last night.

557
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,960
He's named Puyi.

558
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,200
Really?

559
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,440
He really had a boy.

560
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,180
This is serious.

561
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
It's too serious.

562
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,830
Having a son

563
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,290
is not a big deal, right?

564
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,610
What do you know?

565
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
What do you know?

566
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,030
Yes.

567
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,400
I'm ignorant.

568
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,830
Have the Grand Council draft an edict

569
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,500
to promote Liang Xiang to Deputy Delegate
of the Military Education Department

570
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,560
and manage the affairs
of the Ministry of War's school.

571
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,800
Father, you want to help Liang Xiang?

572
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,680
I'll help him.

573

We're just a small army.

Why did we send you out if you won't change?

642
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,990
What a waste of government expenses.

643
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,570
Then, I changed a bit.

644
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,750
I changed on the inside but not the outside.

645
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,950
After all, I've studied for a few years.

763
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,260
More importantly,

764
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,290
you must be loyal to the Qing dynasty.

765
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,550
In terms of weapon performance,

766
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,320
actually,

767
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,840
the six garrisons of the Beiyang New Army

768
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,640
are already at the same level as the Japanese army.

769
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,450
But

770
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,920
good weapons have no combat power

771
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,480
without a loyal army.

772
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,800
Good weapons

773
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,440
need to be in the hands of us clansmen.

774
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,000
I think

775
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,550
you probably know by now

776
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,190
the court is facing internal and external problems.

777
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,030
The rebels are lawless.

778
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,630
I witnessed all this

779
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,880
in Tokyo.

780
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,540
Those people only have

781
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,230
empty dreams.

782
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,840
But

783
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,320
we still can't underestimate

784
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,280
them.

785
00:38:59,190 --> 00:38:59,840
The gun

786
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,030
must be in our hands—

787
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,320
What's that sound?

788
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,650
I think it was a gunshot.

789
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,690
It was a gun. Who dares to shoot?

790
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,670
Second Lord,

791
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,510
you're good at shooting.

792
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,590
Of course.

793
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,470
I've never seen

794
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,400
anyone shoot as well

795
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,320
as you.

796
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,810
Take a look.

797
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,300
Everyone look.

798
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,110
Let me show you.

799
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
What do you think? Pretty good, huh?

800
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:30,420
What's going on?

801
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,770
Deputy Delegate Liang.

802
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,850
Look at my marksmanship.

803
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,550
What can you teach me?

804
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,810
Save it.

805
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,440
Well done, Second Lord.

806
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,280
You taught yourself.

807
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,510
I'm not bragging,

808
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,920
but I have 100% accuracy.

809
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,710
100% accuracy?

810
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,910
You don't believe me?

811
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
Where did you get the gun?

812
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,550
It's mine.

813
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,760
Here.

814
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,550
See?

815
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,920
The latest .38 Hand Ejector Model

816
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,480
the American legation gifted my father.

817
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,300
Don't touch it.

818
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,630
You're so petty.

819
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,630
You have one? Nope.

820
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,510
Luo Ge, Rong Ge.

821
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,920
-Yes.
-Yes.

822
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,630
He's so petty. He won't let me touch it.

823
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,530
Confiscate his gun.

824
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,480
Do you dare?

825
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,860
What are you doing?

826
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,920
What are you doing?

827
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,000
What are you doing?

828
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,830
How dare you!

829
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,810
Liang Xiang, you bastard!

830
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
You bastard!

831
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,520
He really slapped the Second Lord.

832
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,760
Deputy Delegate Liang!

833
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,060
Deputy Delegate Liang.

834
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,150
What happened?

835
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,460
How can you shoot?

836
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,760
The Empress Dowager

837
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
is on the lake enjoying the lotuses.

838
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,360
She was frightened

839
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,640
and sent me here to ask about it.

840
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,490
What happened?

841
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,570
Eunuch,

842
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,580
please report to the Empress Dowager

843
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,230
that a student accidentally

844
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
discharged his gun.

845
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,490
I've reprimanded him.

846
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,160
We'll be careful from now on.

847
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,040
Don't be careless.

848
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,480
Deputy Delegate Liang,

849
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,140
this is forbidden imperial grounds.

850
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,070
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you

851
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,480
to wave guns around.

852
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,850
Look.

853
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,070
So many weapons.

854
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,190
Deputy Delegate Liang,

855
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,550
didn't we say

856
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
we'll only do theoretical learning?

857
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,780
If you want to use weapons,

858
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,840
go to the shooting range of the Three Outer Battalions.

859
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,190
We are doing theoretical learning.

860
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,760
These teaching tools

861
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
were borrowed from the Peking Field Force

862
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,940
with the firing pins removed.

863
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,240
Please forgive us.

864
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,410
In the future,

865
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,620
this will never happen again.

866
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,730
Don't worry.

867
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,740
Take care.

868
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,710
Okay.

869
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:37,680
Class dismissed.
