[Episode 20]

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,000
[Liang Residence, Guangming Alley]

4
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,030
Though the Ministry of War is

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,509
the combination of the Board of War and the Bureau of Military Training,

6
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,560
the manning quotas

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,070
basically remain unchanged.

8
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,120
Therefore, I'm afraid

9
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,300
I can't get you a position

10
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,650
in the Artillery Department.

11
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,810
There is no vacancy.

12
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,590
I'm sorry to let you down.

13
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,070
Mr. Liang,

14
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,470
well...

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,430
Oh, I've written down your address.

16
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll let you know if anything comes up.

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,650
I'll see you later.

18
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,810
Goodbye.

19
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,830
Goodbye.

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,590
Greetings, Mr. Liang Xiang,

21
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,190
commander of Military Education Department.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,960
Mr. Li Rejun, my friend Qianli.

23
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:33,950
What?

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,590
Did they also make you queue outside?

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,840
Come on. Have a seat.

26
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,350
Do I look silly to you?

27
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,930
Everyone asked to see you.

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,800
Only I requested to meet your mother.

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,260
You see, those dummies are

30
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,590
still waiting outside.

31
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,730
I was talking with

32
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,329
your mother in another room.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,740
She is a real chatterbox.

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,240
I tried so hard to get rid of the chat.

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
You're clever, Renjun.

36
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,400
What now?

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,420
Do you also want

38
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,450
to ask me for a job?

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,100
No, no, no.

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,590
I know you well.

41
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,490
If there's a good opportunity, you'd give it to me

42
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,550
without me asking.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,380
That's right.

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,360
Things aren't finalized yet.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,680
People are already rushing to meet me

46
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,140
after getting a tip or two.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,240
In fact,

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,710
I don't have much power.

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
I'm just a proxy for the upper officials

50
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,590
who hate to be bothered.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,580
I do all the chores,

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,060
but I don't get any credit
or the right to appoint officers.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
Tufang,

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,350
the commander-in-chief of the 3rd Division

55
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,680
told me to come meet you.

56
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,329
Any messages from him?

57
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,490
It's good news.

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,210
Good news.

59
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,240
What does this mean?

60
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,150
Don't you know me well?

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,240
This is a big fortune.

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,220
How dare you...

63
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,240
The commander-in-chief

64
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,640
asked me to give you this.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,230
It's a wedding gift for you

66
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,790
from the 3rd Division.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Qianli...

68
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,150
Listen up, Tufang.

69
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,360
The money symbolizes

70
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,870
that he has placed bets

71
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,630
on you.

72
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,910
That is to say,

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,870
he'll zealously

74
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,870
help you climb up the career ladder.

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,550
The higher your position becomes,

76
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,480
the more benefits he will receive.

77
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,160
But if you rejects the money,

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,790
he won't help you, will he?

79
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,590
For the sake of the thousands of

80
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,250
soldiers in the 3rd Division,

81
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,149
you must take the money.

82
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,200
Since when do you

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,800
become so diplomatic?

84
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,510
Tufang,

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
even Yuan Shikai

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,750
needs money, let alone you,

87
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,210
who was newly promoted to manage

88
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,190
the Military Education Department.

89
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,190
Could Mr. Yuan have

90
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,360
survived his trip to Beijing without paying bribes?

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Qu Hongji and his fellows

92
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,760
would've taken him down.

93
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,780
To be honest,

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
a few days ago,

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,750
I sent a gift to Mr. Yuan too.

96
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,440
So you finally

97
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,330
met with Mr. Yuan,

98
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,080
who you had craved to see?

99
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,720
Did he remember you?

100
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,900
How could he not?

101
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,920
He personally selected me as a cadet,

102
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,720
so I could study in Japan.

103
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,560
Mr. Yuan has a good memory.

104
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,750
He even sent regards to my mom.

105
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,280
He remembered we came from the same hometown.

106
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,720
Qianli,

107
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,480
here is my reply to

108
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,940
the commander-in-chief.

109
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,690
I'm not being stuck-up.

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm only observing my family rules.

111
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,230
As my mother says,

112
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,860
ever since Prince Rui's generation,

113
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,320
my family has relied

114
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,730
on no one but ourselves.

115
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,470
Fenglan, I need your advice.

116
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,190
How do I solve this problem?

117
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,960
If I return the money to the commander-in-chief,

118
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,350
[Lee Renjun's residence]

119
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,520
he'll punish me, won't he?

120
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,950
It's like I failed a battle or something.

121
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,190
That schoolmate of mine

122
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,040
is such a hypocrite.

123
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,800
So hoity-toity.

124
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,450
In fact, back in Tokyo,

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,330
he often paid bribes to others.

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,920
Why did he say no

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,320
when I offered him money?

128
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,190
Done.

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,160
I have a question.

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,750
Are you two very close?

131
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,220
Yes. When we were in Tokyo,

132
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,430
honestly,

133
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
no one was closer with him than I was.

134
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,870
That's what I'm talking about.

135
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,160
Two gentlemen's friendship should be as pure as water.

136
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,180
By offering him that money,

137
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,160
you've dirtied the water.

138
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,510
That is not

139
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,000
the correct way to treat a gentleman.

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,930
If I were him, I would get angry too.

141
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,100
Put your feet here.

142
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,970
Dirty? How come?

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
Who wouldn't like money?

144
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
Try throwing cash on the street.

145
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm sure people will fight for it.

146
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,430
This note

147
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,190
is good enough

148
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,870
to buy half a brothel.

149
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
What now?

150
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,310
Are you still thinking about brothels?

151
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,870
Listen up, Li Renjun.

152
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,950
I quit my old job

153
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,270
because of you.

154
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,070
Tread lightly, or I will...

155
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,070
My goodness.

156
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,510
How could you hurt me?

157
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,360
Let me make this clear, Li Renjun.

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,190
If I ever catch you cheating on me,

159
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,190
I'll use these scissors

160
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:56,909
to...

161
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
Come on. Please.

162
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,160
We should be talking

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,630
about Liang Xiang

164
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,920
instead of me.

165
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,350
Oh.

166
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,290
You did say something useful.

167
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,430
I have an idea now.

168
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
You should

169
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,360
keep the money.

170
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,090
I'll tell the commander-in-chief

171
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,950
that Liang Xiang has accepted it.

172
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,560
Meanwhile, we'll keep

173
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,020
this note for Liang Xiang.

174
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,040
Maybe one day he will

175
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,100
be in need of money.

176
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,830
But before that, you make good use of it.

177
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
Loan it out at high interest rates.

178
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
That should keep you busy

179
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,020
when I'm away in Baoding.

180
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,640
Okay?

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,190
Sounds nice.

182
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,780
People get paid by selling their labor.

183
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,670
But being a loan shark is a much

184
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,090
more lucrative job.

185
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,950
What a long day.

186
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,820
Who were those people?

187
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,240
I wish I had a choice.

188
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,940
So many visitors today.

189
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,789
Oh, the hustle and bustle.

190
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,179
But on the bright side,

191
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,549
I got to know many secrets

192
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,870
about Beijing

193
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,720
without leaving home.

194
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,550
What's the point, though?

195
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,440
Do you know

196
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,120
how many departments in Beijing

197
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,870
are involved with military affairs?

198
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,510
How many officers

199
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,170
are there in each department?

200
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,610
Shocking numbers.

201
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,160
Despite these many officers and institutes,

202
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,080
we still lack

203
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,880
an operational command system,

204
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,300
like Japan's General Staff Headquarters.

205
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,080
How awful.

206
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,810
I don't get it.

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Even I don't understand why,

208
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,280
let alone you.

209
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,170
The structure builders

210
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,870
deliberately

211
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,200
planned for the officials

212
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,600
to restrict one another,

213
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,200
thus inducing incoordination.

214
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,130
Nobody can start a military reform.

215
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,330
You see, without a proper military reform,

216
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,270
we stand zero chance of winning battles.

217
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,000
That is why

218
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,440
the Eight-Nation Alliance could reach Tianjin,

219
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,750
and invade the capital city

220
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,320
with only dozens of their mere

221
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,520
20,000 soldiers becoming casualties.

222
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,820
You think about that all the time?

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,750
What else can I think about

224
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,550
as an army man?

225
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,750
The government let me study

226
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,010
abroad, so I could figure out a solution.

227
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,960
You think it's easy

228
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,290
to reorganize the army?

229
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,840
First, we need to appoint commanders.

230
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,670
That means we have to

231
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,670
observe each candidate carefully.

232
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm getting more worried

233
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,530
as I go deeper into this topic.

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,050
Had better talk to a confidant.

235
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Exactly.

236
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,490
And you said you didn't get it.

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,420
I used to

238
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,420
think highly of Li Renjun.

239
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,720
But he tried to bribe me on his superior's behalf

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
with 5,000 taels of silver today.

241
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,870
What a disappointment.

242
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,890
[Ministry of War]

243
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:31,010
[In the 32nd year of Emperor Guangxu reign (1906), the Board of War was renamed as the Ministry of War, which then merged with the Bureau of Military Training and the Court of Stud, as it managed all military affairs in the country,]

244
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,080
[commanded the troops outside Beijing, the Banner and Green Standard Forces, as well as issued statutes about salaries. It reviewed all major events about the army for the good of national defense.]

245
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,940
Mr. Liang Xiang,

246
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,720
your speech was wonderful.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,880
Who are you?

248
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,160
The commander-in-chief of the 3rd Division.

249
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,680
Pleasure to meet you.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Glad to hear that.

251
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm just a rough army man

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,530
whose friends are cannons.

253
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,080
Your schoolmate Li Renjun

254
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,120
has told you about me, right?

255
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,200
Yes.

256
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,040
Qianli spoke

257
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
highly of you.

258
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,900
Li Renjun is like a lark.

259
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,080
Everything he says sounds

260
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,340
as beautiful as a song.

261
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,750
Forget about his flattering comments.

262
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,870
His visit was actually unnecessary.

263
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,840
The 3rd Division

264
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,940
is the best of the best

265
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,190
in the entire army.

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,750
It is of significant importance.

267
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,330
Whoever in charge of the army

268
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,930
would treat this division with utter respect.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,240
Mr. Liang,

270
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,510
didn't Li Renjun

271
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,700
give you my message?

272
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,700
Enlighten me, please.

273
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,510
Well, you see,

274
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,090
the Ministry of War has recently purchased

275
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,820
24 German-made mountain guns.

276
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,150
Why don't you

277
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,060
just

278
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,690
allocate all of them to my division?

279
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,790
They'll be wasted in

280
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,510
someone else's hands, right?

281
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,840
Can the 8th Division handle them?

282
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,720
No, they cannot.

283
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,340
I'm afraid I can't do that,

284
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,600
Commander-in-Chief.

285
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,960
I have given my advice

286
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,890
to Mr. Tieliang.

287
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,830
The new army in the south is weak.

288
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
Rebels are rampant.

289
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,630
New military supplies

290
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,320
must go to the 8th Division.

291
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,940
[The 3rd Division of Beiyang New Army in Baoding]

292
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,650
Commander-in-Chief, you...

293
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Li Renjun,

294
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,510
did you keep count?

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,670
How many times did I shoot?

296
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,520
Five in total, Commander-in-Chief!

297
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,010
Not bad.

298
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,530
You do know how to count.

299
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,110
Which would you choose,

300
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,440
5,000 taels of silver

301
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,460
or five bullets?

302
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,860
I don't know what you're talking about, sir.

303
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,870
How dare you

304
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,080
try to fool me?

305
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,510
You think you can

306
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,770
deceive me, silly boy?

307
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Now, tell me.

308
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,080
How did you spend

309
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,650
that 5,000 taels of silver?

310
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
Commander-in-Chief,

311
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,590
I spent it as you instructed.

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,690
As I instructed?

313
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes, exactly.

314
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,520
What was my instruction?

315
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,270
To show a gesture of benevolence.

316
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,200
And I did.

317
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
Did you offer Liang Xiang the money?

318
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes, I did.

319
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,030
So...

320
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm just being paranoid?

321
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,190
But...

322
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,870
But what?

323
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,870
He looked a bit uneasy.

324
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,440
What are you trying to say?

325
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,260
I think he had never received

326
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,570
such a massive bribe.

327
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,480
Given his position,

328
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,550
is 5,000 a lot?

329
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,550
Back in Tokyo,

330
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,270
Lord Zaizhen

331
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,510
only gave him 3,000.

332
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,620
So he does take bribes.

333
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,610
He accepted Zaizhen's money?

334
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,840
In that case,

335
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,880
he should know the relationship

336
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,340
between Prince Qing and the 3rd Division.

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,750
Tufang is very intelligent.

338
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,630
He sure knows it.

339
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,510
Renjun,

340
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,010
5,000 taels of silver mean nothing to me.

341
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,630
Do I look like a stingy guy?

342
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,190
I’ve spent much

343
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,870
more money on Mr. Yuan.

344
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,340
You know that, don't you?

345
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,000
Y-Yes, I do.

346
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,230
I had high hopes for you,

347
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,390
so I let you handle this matter.

348
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But how did it end?

349
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,310
Sir, I'm sorry.

350
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,950
Liang Xiang is stuck-up.

351
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,530
My woman is keeping that money now.

352
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,190
I'm looking for a chance to...

353
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,270
Oh, Li Renjun.

354
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,520
You have no idea how this game works.

355
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,480
You made a huge mistake.

356
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,000
You clouded my judgement

357
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,610
about Liang Xiang.

358
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,090
You know what?

359
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,530
There are three types

360
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,540
of officials nowadays.

361
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,090
Some

362
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,530
do others' bidding after taking bribes.

363
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,910
Mr. Yuan

364
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,670
is an example.

365
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,750
Some do nothing even after taking bribes,

366
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,920
like Prince Qing.

367
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,369
Officials of the third type

368
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,810
get the work done without being paid.

369
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,440
But I've never

370
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
seen such officials,

371
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,109
since that work pattern simply wouldn't pan out.

372
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,680
If that schoolmate of yours

373
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,099
goes down this path,

374
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,500
he'll end up tragically.

375
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,510
Why are you so quiet?

376
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,870
You didn't even smile when you came home.

377
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,430
Well,

378
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
what can I say?

379
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,830
Aren't you curious

380
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,340
who I loaned that money to?

381
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,070
I don't care.

382
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
Putting on airs, aren't you?

383
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,510
5,000 taels of silver mean nothing to me.

384
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,110
That doesn't sound like you.

385
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,550
What now?

386
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,000
That money belongs to your friend.

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
We must be extra careful, right?

388
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,270
How short-sighted.

389
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,400
He rejected that money.

390
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,400
How can he become a military leader

391
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,510
in the future?

392
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,280
What are you mumbling about?

393
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,070
Go get the door.

394
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,070
It must be Maichen.

395
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,740
I'll be right back.

396
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,440
Coming right up!

397
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,160
Renjun!

398
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,160
Renjun!

399
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:30,640
Hurry up.

400
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,150
There are guests. Get up!

401
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,880
Hurry, hurry.

402
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,440
Li Renjun, you're hiding

403
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,290
a beauty in your house.

404
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,270
I can't believe you never

405
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,800
told me you came to Beijing.

406
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,510
If I hadn't

407
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,680
run into Maichen...

408
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,920
Duo Mei,

409
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,310
this is Li Renjun,

410
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,070
who knocked down

411
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,600
Sergeant Yamashita for me.

412
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,680
He's sophisticated and skilled in martial skills.

413
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,680
Have a seat.

414
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,120
Fenglan, make some tea.

415
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,640
Don't bother.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,220
I just wanted to introduce

417
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,240
Duo Mei to you today.

418
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,750
Let's

419
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,160
dine together some day.

420
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,270
It is only polite

421
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,030
to invite you in...

422
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,680
Duo Mei，

423
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,610
Renjun's house seems nice.

424
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,850
Why not let Fenglan show you around?

425
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,310
Come with me. I'll give you a tour.

426
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,030
Do you have liquor here?

427
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,400
I certainly do.

428
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,000
Renjun,

429
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,960
my job is the worst.

430
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,700
I miss

431
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,960
our school days.

432
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,750
Oh,

433
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,240
don't say that, Tufang.

434
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,550
I'm honored with

435
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,920
patronage in Baoding

436
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
because of your reputation.

437
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,850
You profit from our relationship?

438
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,000
I sure do.

439
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,520
You're a high-profile figure.

440
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,610
All the cadets who have studied in Japan see you as...

441
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,680
Right, "the torch."

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
You're passionate and inspiring.

443
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,940
The flames are still shining bright.

444
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,610
But my life is hard.

445
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,680
Even a slight

446
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,920
misstep

447
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,030
can get me killed.

448
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,310
The autumn military drill will soon happen in Zhangde.

449
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,200
The south army will fight the north army.

450
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,880
The 3rd Division will be up against the 8th Division.

451
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,180
I'm assigned to be the referee.

452
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,990
I already got to know it.

453
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,920
That's why

454
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,000
the commander-in-chief

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,550
made me come to Beijing.

456
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,010
You didn't bring that money here, did you?

457
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,310
You know what?

458
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,420
In the past few months,

459
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,030
countless people have

460
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,090
offered me bribes.

461
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,000
I had no choice

462
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
but to decline them all.

463
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,160
Because of that,

464
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,750
I've offended many people,

465
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,310
including you.

466
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,530
Right?

467
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,970
Five days ago,

468
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,210
a bullet went out of the commander-in-chief's gun,

469
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,310
passed right beside my head,

470
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,440
and hit a vase.

471
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
It was this close to my skull.

472
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,110
I believe you.

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,400
I met him in a convention.

474
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,400
He asked me for a favor,

475
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
and I refused him.

476
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,350
But I immediately regretted it.

477
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,160
You were nearly

478
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,640
shot because of me.

479
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,550
Tufang,

480
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,790
I have some advice.

481
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,030
Spill it.

482
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,920
You're reluctant

483
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,050
to dirty your hands.

484
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,330
I understand that.

485
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,220
But you can get yourself a scapegoat.

486
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,790
A scapegoat?

487
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,350
Invite Yang Kaizhi to work

488
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,030
in Beijing.

489
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,270
He can be of help.

490
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,960
That guy is bold

491
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,920
enough to do anything.

492
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,760
He can be a human shield for you.

493
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,510
Is he eligible?

494
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,640
Will there be problems,

495
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,640
given his background?

496
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,240
What could possibly happen?

497
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,270
The court sees him as a hero

498
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,920
for guarding the borders in Yanji.

499
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,780
His ugly past has been put behind.

500
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,250
Nobody would dare to sully

501
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,950
his good name, right?

502
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,030
I'm glad I came here today.

503
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,070
You're right.

504
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,400
I can use

505
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,610
his reputation to my advantage.

506
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:06,700
[Shanghai]

507
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,100
Kaizhi, do you know why

508
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,000
I asked you to come to Shanghai

509
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,920
before you headed for Beijing?

510
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,750
Because I thought your perspective

511
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,400
could be widened here.

512
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,620
When your mind is open,

513
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,330
you'll be clearer about your mission.

514
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,480
Right.

515
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
I wonder why Liang Xiang

516
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,580
would transfer me to Beijing.

517
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,820
He knows better than anyone

518
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,280
about my former identity.

519
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,610
He seems not to care about it at all.

520
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,410
This is where the problem lies.

521
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,270
Do you think this transfer

522
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,720
is relevant to

523
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,590
the court's new policies?

524
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,160
What is the use of

525
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,310
establishing new policies

526
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,400
at this point?

527
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,720
You're also skeptical about

528
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,450
their so-called new policies?

529
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,570
So you're actually

530
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,590
on the same page with Wu Tianbai.

531
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,720
I've never had high hopes for

532
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,760
the court's remedial measures.

533
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,460
How can a new system

534
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,790
be instituted until the old one is wiped out?

535
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,120
Truth won't be revealed

536
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
unless unrealistic prospects are erased.

537
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,550
On this matter,

538
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,510
Tianbai and I

539
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,720
always see eye to eye.

540
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,790
The radical political reforms in Japan

541
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,920
and the Russian Empire are compelling

542
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,480
us to reflect on our tactics.

543
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,550
Is assassinating

544
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,880
those in power

545
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,920
the only thing we can do?

546
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,350
The Czar was coerced into concessions

547
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,480
by the large-scale political strikes

548
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,090
organized by local revolutionaries.

549
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,370
So you're exploring new political approaches

550
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,300
to overthrow the Qing government?

551
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,920
Over the past year,

552
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,480
I've read a lot of

553
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,070
theoretical works written by Russian revolutionaries.

554
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,270
I'm deeply inspired.

555
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,110
Little rebel,

556
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,350
you're really good.

557
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you know how you're praised

558
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,890
on the newspapers in Shanghai?

559
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,000
Why?

560
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,990
Just for what I did in Yanji?

561
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,120
It did show an admirable quality.

562
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,310
What we Chinese lack

563
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,880
is your toughness.

564
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,080
Back in the Sino-Japanese War,

565
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,540
things would've been different if Li Hongzhang

566
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,010
had stood firm for a bit longer, like 15 days,

567
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,510
till the Japanese finance collapsed.

568
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,360
It's a shame that he didn't.

We collapsed before the enemy did.

570
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,590
As a result,

571
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,270
we've been reduced to this situation.

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,680
Master.

573
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,640
How can the little incident

574
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,370
in Yanji be compared with the Sino-Japanese War?

575
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,920
You're wrong.

576
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,050
It was no little incident.

577
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,960
A county leader should have

578
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,070
a provincial leader's vision.

a national leader's vision.

581
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,270
A national leader must see

Yes.

in the Russian Empire.

A strong third party like that

597
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,740
is needed if our country's

If they can prevent a revolution,

00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,360
it will be great news.

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,240
a penny pincher.

762
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,830
I'm telling you,

763
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,480
I've never eaten

764
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,070
with him at the same table.

765
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
Then what's the point of

766
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,590
sticking around with him?

767
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,590
You can't get money or love from him.

768
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,520
He's involved with many women.

769
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,960
So my mother

770
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,290
never goes to Shanghai.

771
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
At least he recognizes

772
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,620
your mother as his legal wife.

773
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm sure

774
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,160
you'll be included in your father's will.

775
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,670
Honestly,

776
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,850
why didn't you ask him to

777
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,640
get you a job in a bank

778
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,880
in Shanghai, instead of

779
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,420
coming here for military studies?

780
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,159
Get ready.

781
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:14,290
One, two, three!

782
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,900
All done!

783
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,310
Are you sure?

784
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,480
I...

785
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,920
What more do you want?

786
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:25,920
I already got

787
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,190
the mountain peak in it.

788
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,920
Plus the uniform you're in,

789
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
no one will realize you're in Shanghai.

790
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Put it on your tab, right?

791
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,320
Pay me back

792
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,389
when you receive money.

793
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,550
Is Song Chen here?

794
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,760
Tell him to come upstairs!

795
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,949
It's me, Mr. Wu.

796
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,139
Hurry up.

797
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,100
He's been longing for a listener.

798
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,060
Go.

799
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,690
Welcome.

800
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,320
Mr. Wu,

801
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,920
have a seat.

802
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,960
Pull the curtains open.

803
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,670
There are

804
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,470
chemical products everywhere.

805
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,250
I'm what people call as a geek.

806
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,570
Hope you don't mind.

807
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,400
There are outstanding people

808
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,880
in all walks of life.

809
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,360
Mr. Wu, you're

810
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,960
using chemistry as a key

811
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,770
to open the door of history.

812
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,300
You're outstanding too,

813
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:16,960
Mr. Cadet.

814
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,230
I've heard that you're Song Baoquan's son.

815
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,300
Are you?

816
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,120
Did Yunhong tell you that?

817
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,410
Look at you,

818
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
you could've stayed

819
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,150
in Shanghai

820
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,680
and led a comfortable life.

821
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,150
Why did you come here

822
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,350
to be a cadet?

823
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,710
My father did try to persuade me to run

824
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,610
our family business in Shanghai.

825
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,960
He even hired maths

826
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,440
and English tutors for me.

827
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,920
But I'm not

828
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,620
interested in money.

829
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,030
Not interested in money?

830
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,500
Then what are you interested in?

831
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,930
Don't be like me,

832
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,080
penniless but concerned about the society.

833
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,620
You are my hero.

834
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
I came to Tokyo

835
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,630
to learn

836
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,820
to be a revolutionary like you.

837
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,900
C-Cut it out.

838
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,230
Now, I don’t need

839
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,920
anything

840
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,070
but money.

841
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
Seriously?

842
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,020
Is money more important than revolutions?

843
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,420
Let me ask you something.

844
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:17,400
Does it take money to learn lessons about military?

845
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,190
Schooling isn't free.

846
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,920
I'm not sponsored by the government.

847
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,520
I don't...

848
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,440
I don't mean

849
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,670
school lessons.

850
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,500
I mean

851
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,710
violent revolutions.

852
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,190
Can those be carried out without money?

853
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,440
Tao Chengzhong and Qiu Jin

854
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,360
want a revolution,

855
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,470
but they're short of money.

856
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,860
Now, they're struggling

857
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,340
for funds in China.

858
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,650
They wish they could rob a bank.

859
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,370
Guns and bullets

860
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,670
need to be paid for.

861
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,630
Officials ask for bribes.

862
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,760
Getting in contact with certain party members incurs costs.

863
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,920
As Napoleon said,

864
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,190
three things matter most for military.

865
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,850
The first thing is money.

866
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,470
What's the second thing?

867
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,110
Money, too!

868
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,650
So is the third.

869
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,760
You're born with a silver spoon.

870
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,480
Your father is rich.

871
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,070
Why did you come here

872
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,150
for military studies?

873
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,760
That just

874
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,440
doesn't make sense, does it?

875
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,110
But...

876
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,920
Why must I live the life

877
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,650
that my father arranges for me?

878
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
He and I are different individuals.

879
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,140
I want to pursue my own ambitions.

880
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,920
In my opinion,

881
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,150
your father is

882
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,410
an excellent teacher.

883
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,880
You should learn from him

884
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,210
about how to make money.

885
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,440
Turn his experiences

886
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,410
into your knowledge.

887
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:29,890
Then...

888
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,000
Then you can become

889
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
more than a cadet.

890
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,550
You'll possibly manage

891
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
the finances in every revolution.

892
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,960
The alliance is in desperate need

893
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,220
of financial talents.

894
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,200
It's time to eat.

895
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,760
It can wait.

896
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,020
Eat with us, Song Chen.

897
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm afraid not.

898
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,820
I'll eat at school.

899
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,760
Do you have to turn me down?

900
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,130
I'm just too embarrassed

901
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,260
to accept a free meal

902
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,900
after getting a free photo.

903
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,070
Mr. Wu,

904
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,820
I'm leaving now.

905
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,690
I'll visit you again when I have time.

906
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,600
You must come.

907
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,400
I sure will.

908
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:02,920
You had better

909
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,450
change your views on money.

910
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,290
What an interesting lad.

911
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,190
Song Chen has

912
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,590
always been timid.

913
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,860
If he had shown more masculinity,

914
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,380
I guess I would've

915
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,670
married him

916
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,670
long ago.

917
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,160
What did you just say?

918
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,840
Good heavens!

919
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,670
You...

920
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,400
You used to be engaged

921
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,590
to... to that guy

922
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,310
Song Chen?

923
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,070
I nearly married him.

924
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,000
I finally know the truth.

925
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,510
Shuhong,

926
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,670
listen.

927
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,840
You must talk some

928
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,190
sense into Song Chen.

929
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,110
What do you mean?

930
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,390
Hold onto him.

931
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,230
You can dip into Song Baoquan's

932
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,360
pocket through him.

933
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,150
Oh, you.

934
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,390
Can't you stop thinking about money?

935
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,000
But can we live without it?

936
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
We still owe Mr. Kanyama

937
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,530
a large sum of money.

938
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,380
Because I'm poor,

939
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,560
I have to be around with

940
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,590
nitroglycerin all day long.

941
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,380
I would've bought those

942
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,000
yellow explosives if I could afford them.

943
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,070
Do you know their price

944
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,280
on the black market?

945
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,240
They cost more than gold!

946
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,170
Hey,

947
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,310
you'll sleep with the kid tonight.

948
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,240
I'll have to burn the midnight oil.

949
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,810
A bomb order is to be shipped

950
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,270
to Guangzhou in a few days.

951
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,490
Come on, wash your feet.

952
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,520
Daddy...

953
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,040
"Daddy."

954
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,140
Daddy!

955
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,810
Yes. Daddy is busy.

956
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,840
Can you say "busy"?

957
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,200
"Busy"!

958
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,740
Right. You just learned a new word, "busy."

959
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,430
Son, don't move.

960
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,150
Let Mommy take a photo of you.

961
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,640
Mommy. Mommy!

962
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,630
Mommy, give me a wash.

963
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:45,140
Mommy, a wash.

964
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,960
What a handsome little boy.

965
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,320
Perfect photographic skills.

966
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,800
Not developed well enough, though.

967
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,450
Bugu, look at me.

968
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Look at me.

969
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,590
Tianbai!

970
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,890
What happened?

971
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,550
Shuhong,

972
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,300
leave with Bugu!

973
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,970
Mommy!

974
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,490
Mommy, come here.

975
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,060
Run!

976
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,300
Run! It's going to explode!

977
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,760
Mommy!

978
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,630
Mommy!

979
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Mommy!

980
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,920
Mommy!

981
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,850
Mommy! Mommy!

982
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,030
Forget about me!

983
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,000
Our son!

984
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,940
Get our son!

985
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,830
I want Mommy!

986
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,760
I want Mommy!

987
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,440
I want Mommy!

988
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,230
Mommy!
