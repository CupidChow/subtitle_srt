[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,920
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,630
He's just a child.

4
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,810
He can't always be drifting outside.

5
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,150
He still needs education, doesn't he?

6
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,070
If anything happens in the future,

7
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,700
it would involve him again, wouldn't it?

8
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,820
So, Shuhong,

9
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,570
tonight,

10
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,630
go home and think it over.

11
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,570
See if this child

12
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,470
can stay with

13
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,040
our Liang family.

14
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,290
Let Duo Mei and me help raise him

15
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,070
and find him a good school.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
This way,

17
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,270
everything will be taken care of.

18
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,520
Come.

19
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:05,680
Mr. Yang,

20
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,080
Liang asked me to give this to you.

21
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,190
Thanks, Luo Ge.

22
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,990
Alright then.

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,910
Liang Xiang and Old Madam,

24
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,920
both mentioned the photography studio.

25
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,820
They are clearly threatening us,

26
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,350
wanting to keep the kid
with the Liang family.

27
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,030
What did you leave

28
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,030
at the photography studio?

29
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,310
I thought about it.

30
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,710
All they can find

31
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,620
is a photo of me

32
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,590
and my son,

33
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,070
taken during the trial run.

34
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,579
What can one photo really prove?

35
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,800
Bugu, come wash your face.

36
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,620
What are you...

37
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,310
going to do?

38
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,430
Why should I give my son

39
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,690
to their Liang family?

40
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,540
He's mine.

41
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,550
For five years,

42
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,270
Tianbai and I raised him
through all kinds of hardships,

43
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,270
watching him grow little by little.

44
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,380
In the end,

45
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm not qualified to raise him?

46
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,220
Just because of one photo,

47
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,339
and they want to

48
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,070
take away my rights as a mother?

49
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,730
They're clearly threatening me, right?

50
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,660
Go to sleep now.

51
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,080
Go on, keep talking.

52
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,150
What's this?

53
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,540
It's the same kind of situation as yours.

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,600
It's also a threat.

55
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,950
A threat to you?

56
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,260
It seems...

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,340
tonight,

58
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,780
they've really set up

59
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,180
a trap for both of us.

60
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,390
Mommy, my tummy hurts.

61
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,630
I need to poop.

62
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,950
Go back to sleep quickly, okay?

63
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm coming.

64
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,710
Bugu, what's wrong?

65
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,790
Come here and let Mommy have a look.

66
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,020
You have a bit of a fever.

67
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,740
Hold on.

68
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,140
I will get you some water.

69
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,470
Alright, Bugu,

70
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,940
go to sleep.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Okay, sleep now.

72
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,310
What's wrong?

73
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,570
Kaizhi.

74
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,180
Come quickly and take a look.

75
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,780
My son vomited
and his forehead is burning hot.

76
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,830
Acute gastroenteritis.

77
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,280
He ate too much,

78
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,920
and it was all cold food.

79
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,980
There's stomach medicine on my nightstand.

80
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,690
Go grab it.

81
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,630
Is this it?

82
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,270
Water.

83
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,170
Here, open your mouth.

84
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,030
Don't worry.

85
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,840
I guarantee he'll be fine by tomorrow.

86
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,909
I was so scared.

87
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,210
Let him sleep.

88
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
Do you want to go to my place for a bit?

89
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,870
So, raising a kid isn't easy.

90
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,470
You mean...

91
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,660
The Liang family likes this kid,

92
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,130
it's only natural.

93
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,220
No.

94
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,150
I won't send him

95
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,280
to the Liang family.

96
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,710
Of course,

97
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,980
you're his mother.

98
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,500
But there's one thing

99
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,170
you need to think clearly.

100
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,710
Liang Xiang has almost figured out

101
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,830
our identities.

102
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,120
These accusation letters

103
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,419
feel like blades

104
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,820
hanging over my head.

105
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,590
Each one is sharp and deadly.

106
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,440
Why would Liang Xiang do this?

107
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,590
It might not be Liang Xiang's idea.

108
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,750
They just need someone,

109
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,480
like me, a border defense hero,

110
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,760
to keep the Yuan party in check.

111
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,150
Are you willing to do this?

112
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,060
Let's play along with it.

113
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,280
They need me,

114
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,890
and I need them too.

115
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,780
Yuan Shikai's Sixth Division

116
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,240
has been around for years.

117
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,750
Those die-hard Beiyang loyalists

118
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,300
why would they take orders

119
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,940
from an outsider?

120
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,110
Much less follow him

121
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,230
into a revolution.

122
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,270
So,

123
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,350
to truly

124
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,950
control the Sixth Division,

125
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,390
you can't do without

126
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,320
Liang Xiang and Zaitao's support.

127
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,940
This is also the subtlety of it.

128
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,820
This is too dangerous, Kaizhi.

129
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,760
It is dangerous.

130
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,370
I've already prepared

131
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,400
for the worst.

132
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,120
But what isn't dangerous?

133
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,520
Everything is dangerous.

134
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,160
Love is also dangerous.

135
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,050
What nonsense are you talking about?

136
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,670
I'm not talking nonsense.

137
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,240
Don't look at me like that.

138
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
I insist on looking at you like this.

139
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,130
You're breaking the rules, Kaizhi.

140
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,740
Between us,

141
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,700
there shouldn't be
any other kind of relationship.

142
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,500
Shuhong,

143
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,030
what's wrong with breaking the rules?

144
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,450
Did I break heavenly rules

145
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,490
or human rules?

146
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,110
Are you a white snake fearing Fahai,

147
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,510
or a fairy fearing the Jade Emperor?

148
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,700
What nonsense are you talking about,
Yang Kaizhi?

149
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,160
I'm not talking nonsense.

150
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,590
Throughout history,

151
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,240
there are so many

152
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,440
love stories passed down through time.

153
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,270
A white snake loving a scholar,

154
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,960
a fox longing for the human world,

155
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,870
and farmer Dong Yong
loving the Seventh Fairy.

156
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,510
They all

157
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,630
defied the world,

158
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,580
overcame everything

159
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,940
just to pursue love.

160
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
I, Yang Kaizhi,

161
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,630
also pursue love.

162
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,630
Is it not allowed?

163
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,660
Stop it.

164
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,650
It's getting late. I have to go back.

165
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,530
Shuhong,

166
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,260
am I dangerous?

167
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,110
You're very scary.

168
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Do you believe

169
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,910
what I say?

170
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,510
I do.

171
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,660
Really?

172
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,510
I never knew

173
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,910
love could be so beautiful.

174
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,150
No way.

175
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,290
See?

176
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,820
You just don't believe me.

177
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,230
Could it be

178
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,480
Mr. Wu and Liang Xiang...

179
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm done talking to you.

180
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,110
Actually, I noticed it a long time ago.

181
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,510
Clearly, you're a mother,

182
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,320
but you still...

183
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,820
have that shy, girlish look.

184
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,060
I just didn't know why.

185
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,550
You don't have to ask about everything.

186
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
Actually,

187
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Liang Xiang and I

188
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,410
are fundamentally

189
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,800
different kinds of people.

190
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,780
Can we not mention him?

191
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,940
Shuhong,

192
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,580
do you know?

193
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,800
I've experienced life and death.

194
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,820
At seventeen,

195
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,180
I was on the guillotine.

196
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,910
By sheer luck,

197
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,270
I escaped.

198
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,150
Indeed,

199
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,390
even if I died a thousand times,
I wouldn't regret it.

200
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,460
I watched

201
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,060
my friends...

202
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,390
beheaded right before my eyes.

203
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,230
And the executioners

204
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,680
happened to be
from the Jingzhou Banner Battalion,

205
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,910
which means,

206
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,390
they're Liang Xiang's uncles.

207
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,120
Let me send you back.

208
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,460
I'm familiar with the soldiers
of the Banner Battalion.

209
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,630
There's no way

210
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,910
I could ever walk the same path

211
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,110
as Liang Xiang.

212
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,630
I know

213
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,820
anything could happen

214
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,750
on the path

215
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,910
I've chosen.

216
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,030
But I'm determined to keep going,

217
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,910
like a silkworm,

218
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,760
a...

219
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,460
spring silkworm spinning silk.

220
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,380
Don't talk nonsense.

221
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,780
How inauspicious.

222
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,510
No, no, no.

223
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,300
Being a silkworm isn't bad.

224
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,910
They constantly eat mulberry leaves

225
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,520
and excrete waste.

226
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,510
Do you know?

227
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,390
When a silkworm spins silk,

228
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,600
it stops eating.

229
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,780
Once it's cleared all the waste

230
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,630
from its body,

231
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,480
it turns almost completely transparent.

232
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,920
That's the most beautiful moment

233
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,940
of a silkworm,

234
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,420
so clear,

235
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,840
it's nearly ethereal.

236
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,470
You're quite the romantic.

237
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,940
I hope...

238
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,780
after I leave tomorrow,

239
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,350
you can stay here.

240
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,440
I really need you to stay here.

241
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,240
If you’re here,

242
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,560
you can keep me in touch

243
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,270
with the Northern Party.

244
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,720
That way, I'll feel more at ease

245
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,070
while I'm in the Sixth Division.

246
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,350
It's also easier to explain things

247
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,150
to the Liang family
if you stay in Beijing.

248
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,430
As for the kid,

249
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,230
he can spend time here and there.

250
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,589
That shouldn't be a problem.

251
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,599
Don't make things
too tense with Liang Xiang,

252
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,079
it's not good for the bigger picture.

253
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,640
Once I get things going
in the Sixth Division,

254
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,790
I'll send someone

255
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,870
to bring you and your son over.

256
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,910
What do you think?

257
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,150
Is that okay?

258
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,550
I promise you.

259
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,570
Scissors to grind, knives to sharpen!

260
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,610
Wait for my message.

261
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,790
Listen to Mommy.

262
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,690
I'm leaving.

263
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,660
The flower is beautiful.

264
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,780
Let's go home.

265
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,360
Let's go.

266
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,740
Are you Miss Shuhong?

267
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,590
Yes, I am.

268
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:02,790
And you are?

269
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,110
I'm from the Six Nations Hotel.

270
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,440
Vice Chairman Song
asked me to pick you up.

271
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,590
Vice Chairman Song?

272
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes.

273
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,790
He's back from Shanghai,

274
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,650
staying at the Six Nations Hotel.

275
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,020
This time, Shuhong,

276
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,110
you look great.

277
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,910
Hello, Chairman Song.

278
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,590
Hi, there.

279
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,890
Hi, Chairman Song.

280
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,590
The one on the left is Tang Hualong,

281
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,260
the head of Hubei provincial assemblies.

282
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,110
The one on the right is Pu Dianjun.

283
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,660
What kind of conference is this?

284
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,070
A joint conference
of provincial assemblies.

285
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,590
We're holding a national assembly

286
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,920
to draft a new petition.

287
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,850
Those rallies and sit-ins in Beijing

288
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,140
were all instigated by you?

289
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,340
Don't talk nonsense.

290
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,590
Spies from

291
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,460
the Investigation Bureau

292
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,320
of Ministry of Civil Affairs
are all over the hotel.

293
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,840
Watch what you say.

294
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,150
Coming to Beijing

295
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,610
has really refreshed you.

296
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,400
Did you see you your kid?

297
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,460
That's good.

298
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,070
Beijing really has a way
of lifting people up.

299
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,910
Why did you come

300
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,910
to petition here?

301
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,310
Because the Emperor is here.

302
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,070
No, I mean,

303
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,020
someone with your status,
petitioning like this?

304
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,150
What does status matter now?

305
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,320
When disaster strikes,

306
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,510
the world could fall apart any moment.

307
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,590
While we are alive,

308
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,980
we have to plan

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
and not just watch it perish.

310
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,260
Is it working?

311
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,470
This floor is full of

312
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,950
people from everywhere,

313
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,630
all with backgrounds like mine,

314
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,830
all hoping

315
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,310
things don't get worse.

316
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,120
It's time to find a way

317
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,470
to uphold the government

318
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,790
while moving toward
a constitutional system.

319
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,850
If it weren't for people of my status,

320
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,870
no one would listen.

321
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,180
We delivered the message,

322
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,440
and we spoke the words.

323
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,630
If we all go down together,

324
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,440
at least we won't regret it.

325
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,820
What a bunch of old naive people.

326
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,050
It's somewhat effective.

327
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,980
At least now,

328
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,610
the nine-year preparatory period
for constitutional reform

329
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,710
has been shortened by three years.

330
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,510
Anyone can make empty promises.

331
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,070
That's why I called you here.

332
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,550
Are you familiar

333
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,550
with Liang Xiang?

334
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,390
He's close to the Prince Regent.

335
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,390
Can you help us find out

336
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,230
and ask the Prince Regent

337
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,510
what he thinks about
this constitutionalism?

338
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,480
[Investigation Bureau Office
of Ministry of Civil Affairs]

339
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,590
General.

340
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,700
What is it now?

341
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,110
We found

342
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,170
the woman and child

343
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,630
from that photo.

344
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,630
A neighbor said

345
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,730
the woman

346
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,660
once helped the Wang case suspect

347
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,260
set up a photography studio.

348
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,630
Is that so?

349
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,070
We were ready

350
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,470
to arrest her yesterday,

351
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,790
but found out

352
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,560
she's closely tied

353
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,720
with you

354
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,220
and General Yang Kaizhi.

355
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,870
So...

356
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
You're saying...

357
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,470
you've saved dignity for me?

358
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,120
General Liang,

359
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,520
the Prince Regent and Prince Su

360
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,550
have always favored

361
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,500
the Wang case.

362
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm just a small inspector,

363
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,430
I wouldn't dare stir things up,

364
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,960
especially when it involves
you and Kaizhi.

365
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,870
But,

366
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,550
we're being lenient now,

367
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,550
but who knows what'll happen later.

368
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,790
So I hope

369
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,210
you can start making plans early.

370
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,950
Since you're so understanding,

371
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,590
then I'll handle

372
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,960
this matter myself.

373
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,150
Is that okay?

374
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,600
That's exactly what I meant, Sir.

375
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,910
I appreciate it,

376
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,250
but official matters call for
official procedure.

377
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,880
Thank you.

378
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,650
Giddy up!

379
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,350
Mommy.

380
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,080
What's going on?

381
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,550
It's nothing serious, really.

382
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,430
We just want to invite you and your kid

383
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,290
to come with us.

384
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,280
It's simply

385
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,610
to take your statement.

386
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,200
Just a quick statement.

387
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,050
Miss, please.

388
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,490
Well.

389
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,970
Just keep the kid outside.

390
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,310
We'll take care of him for you,

391
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,040
otherwise, it might scare him.

392
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,270
Mommy.

393
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,430
What are they doing?

394
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,130
Don't be afraid, Bugu.

395
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,460
They can't do anything.

396
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,390
Why is it you?

397
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,350
The Prince Regent's security

398
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,150
has always been
our responsibility as Imperial Guards.

399
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,220
Liang Xiang.

400
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,470
Do you think we should

401
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,900
be talking here?

402
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,400
There's no choice.

403
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,410
Something went wrong,

404
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,060
so we can only talk here.

405
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,710
It's just a photo, isn't it?

406
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,550
Why go to such lengths?

407
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,860
That's right,

408
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,390
just because of a photo.

409
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,270
We questioned Huang Fusheng earlier,

410
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,520
and he confirmed he doesn't know you.

411
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,710
Huang Fusheng?

412
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,220
Which Huang Fusheng?

413
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,070
Enough, Shuhong.

414
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,710
Let's not talk about the photo.

415
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,780
Next, let's talk about

416
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,240
your future plans.

417
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,420
Do my plans concern you?

418
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,530
Originally, they didn't,

419
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,140
but now they do.

420
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,020
Every suspect witness in the Wang case

421
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,870
was interviewd by

422
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,070
the Investigation Bureau
of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

423
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,830
Expect you,

424
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,790
I did it myself.

425
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,510
Since I signed off on you,

426
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,520
I have to be responsible for you.

427
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,710
How are you responsible?

428
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,000
Listen to me, Shuhong.

429
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,440
Something went wrong.

430
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,480
You can't stay in Beijing anymore.

431
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,480
Staying in the rented house in Banqiao

432
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,610
is not good for you,

433
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,330
for me,

434
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,070
or for Kaizhi.

435
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,150
So I suggest you

436
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,200
go back to Shanghai,

437
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,630
alone.

438
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,070
Alone?

439
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,390
What about my son?

440
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,420
That's exactly what I wanted

441
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,500
to talk to you about today.

442
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,030
I'm not interested in this.

443
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,700
First, let me finish.

444
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:05,590
Okay?

445
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,590
Okay.

446
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,730
I'm listening.

447
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,630
I guess

448
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,940
you and Kaizhi stayed up

449
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,870
the other night,

450
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,180
wondering

451
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,910
why I would pick now

452
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,590
to invite you to my home for a meal.

453
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,110
That's right.

454
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,560
The current political situation
in the country is unpredictable,

455
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,550
more unstable than ever.

456
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,720
If this had happened a year ago,

457
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,210
I'm afraid even ten Wang Zhaomings

458
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,740
would've lost their heads.

459
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,910
Indeed,

460
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,420
no one

461
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,150
can say for sure

462
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,070
where this country is headed.

463
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,420
Don't tell me this crap.

464
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,260
Let's just talk about the child.

465
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,510
Fine.

466
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,860
As you wish.

467
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
Let's just talk about the child.

468
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,830
I know you love your son,

469
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,790
and I love him too.

470
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,420
So does the Old Madam.

471
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,910
So, emotionally,

472
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,890
there's nothing you need to worry about.

473
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,360
Shuhong,

474
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,230
children are the future.

475
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,000
Have you thought about the future?

476
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,980
Will our futures be the same?

477
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,480
You're a powerful figure
of the Qing dynasty,

478
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,030
while my son and I

479
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,200
are just commoners.

480
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,390
Our futures are not the same.

481
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,760
Whether powerful figure or commoner,

482
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,600
it doesn't matter.

483
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,660
He's our son,

484
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,310
and we both need to

485
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,020
carefully nurture him,

486
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,420
give him a safer environment,

487
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,260
a proper education,

488
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,910
and a chance to grow up well.

489
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
You're bringing this up now,

490
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,960
isn't it a bit too selfish?

491
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,310
I know you've suffered a lot

492
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,310
for this child,

493
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,910
and endured many hardships.

494
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,790
I'm really grateful

495
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,390
for everything you've done.

496
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,790
I also repent

497
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,260
for my past negligence.

498
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,110
That's why

499
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
I want to do even more now

500
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,740
to make things right.

501
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,350
What do you mean?

502
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,500
I've made myself clear.

503
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,020
My son

504
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,790
deserves a better life.

505
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,300
And that specifically means

506
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,710
staying out of politics.

507
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,310
Politics

508
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,500
for

509
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,110
a little kid,

510
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,150
don't you think it's too absurd?

511
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
You don't need to worry about my son.

512
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,260
How can I not worry?

513
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,390
I've already bought the ticket.

514
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,550
You may leave now.

515
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,180
I didn't want to do this,

516
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,050
but I have no other choice.

517
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,120
I have to go abroad with the delegation
the day after tomorrow.

518
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,610
If someone else takes over your case,

519
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,220
it'll only get worse.

520
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,390
By then,

521
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,800
what can you do about the child?

522
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,130
You can't just leave like this.

523
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,370
Give me back my son!

524
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:08,850
I think...

525
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,240
I've said everything I need to say.

526
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,020
Go back to Shanghai!

527
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,550
I wish you

528
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,290
a safe journey.

529
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,940
Stop right there!

530
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
Liang Xiang!

531
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,350
Stop right there!

532
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Liang Xiang!

533
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,200
Give me back my son!

534
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,390
Liang Xiang!

535
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,470
Liang Xiang!

536
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,460
Stop right there.

537
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,980
Come here, little one.

538
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,700
This way.

539
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,270
No, I want to wait for my mom.

540
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:57,830
Sure.

541
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,460
It's more convenient to wait here.

542
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,390
Come, come here.

543
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,310
What's your name?

544
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,910
Wu Bugu.

545
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,430
How could they treat you like this?

546
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,360
The court ordered

547
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,960
the petition representatives
to be expelled.

548
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,910
The constitutional petition has failed.

549
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:35,710
They're forcing you

550
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,350
onto the path of revolution.

551
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,840
Misleading the country and its people.

552
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:02,630
[The Sixth Division of Beiyang Army]

553
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,970
Colonel Zhang.

554
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,980
Your good days are coming to an end.

555
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,320
Our Sixth Division

556
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,230
is going to change.

557
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,270
How?

558
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,940
How else could it change?

559
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,270
It'll become the world
of those who studied in Japan.

560
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,670
Those of us from Baoding Academy

561
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,330
won't stand a chance anymore.

562
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,210
Battalion Commander Lin,

563
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,230
I heard the new commander-in-chief

564
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,910
is very young.

565
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,750
He's the same age as you.

566
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,910
What nonsense are you talking about?

567
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,790
The current Emperor is even younger.

568
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:34,920
How can you compare?

569
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,790
That's true.

570
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,090
Not only did he study abroad
at a very young age,

571
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,310
but he also had military achievements.

572
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,980
Li,

573
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,580
word from Beijing is

574
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,750
this new commander

575
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,250
might have connections
with the revolutionary party.

576
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,270
Really?

577
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,940
I don't know if it's true.

578
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,460
It's probably just someone

579
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,940
who doesn't like him,

580
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,540
trying to smear him.

581
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,710
That's hard to say.

582
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,270
This Commander Yang

583
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,750
has cut off his queue.

584
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,710
I don't think that rumor is baseless.

585
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,060
In the Qing army,

586
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,710
soldiers cut queue

587
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,830
to train,

588
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,060
but when have we ever
seen an officer do it?

589
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,230
Yes, exactly!

590
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,080
What are you all arguing about?

591
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,750
Duke Liang from the Imperial Guards

592
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,610
has also cut off his queue, right?

593
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,670
Empress Cixi saw it

594
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,190
and didn't say anything about it.

595
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,230
I've also heard

596
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,270
Commander Yang and Duke Liang

597
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,530
were classmates when studying in Japan.

598
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,790
So they have a connection?

599
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,350
Yes.

600
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,460
Everyone,

601
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,670
we need to be more cautious in the future.

602
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,790
He and Duke Liang

603
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,910
are very close.

604
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,060
Everyone, stand up!

605
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:56,150
The new commander-in-chief
of the Sixth Division has arrived.

606
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,540
Sit down!

607
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,910
Officers of the Sixth Division

608
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,640
have a peculiar way of smiling.

609
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,700
They hide daggers behind their smiles.

610
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,270
When I set off from Beijing,

611
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,310
a friend of mine introduced

612
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,640
the Sixth Division to me

613
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,330
in just four words:

614
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,010
"Good horses, sharp swords."

615
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,710
Yesterday and today,

616
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,460
General Zhou and I,

617
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,780
[The 12th brigade of the Sixth Division,
Brigade Commander Zhou]

618
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,310
along with General Wu,

619
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,350
we visited some units
of the Sixth Division.

620
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:58,080
[The 11th brigade of the Sixth Division,
Brigade Commander Wu]

621
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,520
They truly lived up to the name.

622
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,500
The cavalry battalion
of the Sixth Division

623
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,700
has fine horse breeds

624
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,520
and outstanding sword skills.

625
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,190
I had a pleasant conversation

626
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,730
with the officers and soldiers
of the cavalry battalion.

627
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,840
The new commander-in-chief

628
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,480
used to be

629
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,020
the Director of Cavalry
at the Ministry of War.

630
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,830
So the first thing he did after arriving

631
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,690
was visit the cavalry battalion.

632
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,470
Director of Cavalry?

633
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,440
That's not a high position.

634
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,680
He's Duke Liang's classmate.
He must come from a powerful background.

635
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,020
Indeed.

636
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,750
I asked

637
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,810
a sergeant in the cavalry battalion,

638
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,830
I said,

639
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,710
"Have you ever heard of

640
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,870
a poem from Britain,

641
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,560
specifically about cavalry?"

642
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,500
He said, "What poem?

643
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,910
Please, Sir, let me know about it."

644
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,140
So,

645
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,540
I recited this

646
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,940
English doggerel to him.

647
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:47,070
The poem goes:

648
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,500
"For want of a nail the shoe was lost;

649
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,790
for want of a shoe the horse was lost;

650
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,910
and for want of a horse the rider was lost;

651
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,910
for want of a rider the battle was lost;

652
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,980
for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.

653
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,350
And all for

654
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,760
the want of a horseshoe nail."

655
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,310
What kind of poem is this?

656
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,940
Is it really necessary?

657
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,600
Can this even be called a poem?

658
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,460
I know

659
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,140
everyone here

660
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,980
might think it sounds a bit over the top.

661
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,270
But there's

662
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,870
one thing we can take from it.

663
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,460
That is...

664
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,190
every small detail

665
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,230
of a soldier's life

666
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,100
could be related to

667
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,460
the fate of the country.

668
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,750
Now the country is in danger,

669
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,540
we soldiers

670
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,870
must work twice as hard,

671
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,730
so we don't

672
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,530
let down our people's trust.

673
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,270
We must always remember

674
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,700
a strong army

675
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,920
is the backbone of a nation.

676
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:01,710
-Bravo!
-Bravo!
