[Episode 31]

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,890
[Military Advisory Council]

4
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,310
You two are brothers.

5
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,900
If you won't help him shoulder the burden,

6
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,100
who else can the Prince Regent count on?

7
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,470
Tell me,

8
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,400
what's the most pressing issue

9
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,280
for the army right now?

10
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,680
No funds.

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,750
Without money, what can we do?

12
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:58,960
Wrong.

13
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,230
There's something even more
urgent than money.

14
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,200
Just one word.

15
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,470
Loyalty.

16
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,920
Loyalty?

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,639
For our Imperial Guards,

18
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,190
the most critical requirement

19
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,120
is unwavering loyalty to the Qing dynasty.

20
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,120
That's true.

21
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,290
Do you think

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,290
the six Beiyang Divisions
can live up to that?

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,220
It's hard to say.

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,560
But right now,

25
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,220
Yuan is lying low in his hometown, Zhangde,

26
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
playing the role of a fisherman.

27
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,950
Just one man, one boat,
drifting on a snow-covered river.

28
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,810
It's been all over the papers.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Like Jiang Ziya casting his line
without bait,

30
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,150
history is full of those
who hide their talents,

31
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,210
waiting for the right moment to rise.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,130
Duke Liang.

33
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,390
Duke,

34
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,840
we've discovered a photography studio

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,860
just outside the East Straight Gate.

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,150
There are two suspicious individuals there.

37
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,960
Over the past few days,

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,710
they've been monitoring

39
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,310
the Prince Regent's convoy.

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,150
Don't make a move on them yet.

41
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,950
Have someone keep a close watch.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,600
See if they have any contacts

43
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,079
beyond the studio.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,430
We need to know what they're really after.

45
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,400
Zhaoming,

46
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,630
is your copper wire long enough?

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,520
It's long enough,

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,240
but where should I connect it?

49
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,360
Hold on.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,450
I'm coming over.

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,420
Catch the thieves!

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,580
Catch the thieves!

53
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,000
Catch the thieves!

54
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,000
Catch the thieves!

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,240
Where are they?

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,720
At the entrance of the alley,

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,000
under the small stone bridge!

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,360
Hurry up!

59
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,000
Grab your weapons!

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,860
Come with me to catch the thieves!

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,310
Catch the thieves!

62
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,870
Coming!

63
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,430
Where are they?

64
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,190
At the entrance of the alley,

65
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,240
under the small stone bridge.

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,190
Let's go!

67
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,800
Hurry up!

68
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,630
Quick!

69
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,800
Catch the thieves!

70
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,480
Duke Liang.

71
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,630
This way, please.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,310
Originally,

73
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,190
we only informed
the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

74
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,240
But then I realized that wouldn't be enough.

75
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,190
This small stone bridge

76
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,720
is part of the Prince Regent's

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,159
daily route to court.

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,650
Since his safety was involved,

79
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,630
we had no choice but to alert

80
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,230
the Imperial Guards as well.

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,690
Be careful, Duke Liang.

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,170
What's this telephone for?

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,270
Here's my guess.

84
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,000
If that big thing over there

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,040
is a bomb,

86
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
then this phone

87
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,480
might be the detonator.

88
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,020
If someone rings this side,

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,659
then over there—

90
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,100
boom!

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,680
The consequences would be disastrous.

92
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,310
Don't move.

93
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,420
Everyone, stay still.

94
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,620
I'll go find someone I know

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,940
and bring in an expert.

96
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Do you understand?

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,390
Yes,

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
I understand.

99
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,430
Yellow gunpowder.

100
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,680
Made in Japan.

101
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,380
It's extremely powerful.

102
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,830
Especially this

103
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,560
electric ignition device.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,690
It's very advanced,

105
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,360
but clearly not mass-produced.

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,830
It looks handmade.

107
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,570
Handmade?

108
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
Who has the skills for something like this?

109
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Obviously,

110
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,960
someone's planning to blow up the bridge.

111
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,920
Then what's this

112
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,070
metal canister for?

113
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,680
It's to increase the explosive power.

114
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,490
But it's not welded.

115
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,390
It looks more like

116
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,110
it was hammered out by hand.

117
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Immediately,

118
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,930
go investigate all the
blacksmith shops in Beijing for me.

119
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,020
And bring those two
from the photography studio

120
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,100
to me right away.

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,720
Make way!

122
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,730
Everyone, make way!

123
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,790
Step aside!

124
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,750
Everyone, clear out!

[Shouzhen Photography Studio]

126
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,460
Back up!

127
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,510
Stop looking!

128
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,320
Back up!

129

Hurry up!

131
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,510
Back up!

132
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,630
Stop looking!

133
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,530
Wang Zhaoming.

134
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,790
You don't even know

135
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,990
what their target is?

136
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,870
Do you have

137
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,440
an evacuation plan?

138
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,100
What if something goes wrong?

139
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,340
With skills like that,

140
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,140
he still thinks he can take down
the Prince Regent?

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,670
I think Wang Zhaoming

142
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,000
is like a moth to a flame,

143
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
recklessly making

144
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,960
his political declaration.

145
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,410
Take them away!

146
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,170
Huang Fusheng knows this address.

147
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,770
You can't stay at my place anymore.

148
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:51,790
Now,

149
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,150
go to Sir Fan's house

150
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,330
and bring the child back.

151
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,060
Stay at Renjun's wife's place.

152
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,400
What about you?

153
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,250
What... What do I have to be afraid of?

154
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,870
I've got nothing to do with them,

155
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,790
not even a bit.

156
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,280
I just happen to know them.

157
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,480
I know a lot of people.

158
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,650
Come on.

159
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,360
Go now.

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,760
[In 1910, Wang Zhaoming and his associates established
the Shouzhen Photo Studio in Beijing as a base for their assassination plot.]

161
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,810
[On April 16, they attempted to assassinate Prince Regent Zaifeng,
but the plan failed and they were arrested.]

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,600
You only caught three people?

163
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,130
Yes.

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,840
We only caught three people.

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
The furnishings and utensils here

166
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,510
are clearly for more than three people.

167
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,720
But when we rushed in,

168
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,290
we only found three people.

169
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,310
There are women's clothes here.

170
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,390
But...

171
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,080
In the group,

172
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,140
there must be female members as well.

173
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,490
I agree with your observation, Duke.

174
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,020
Their business is good.

175
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,790
So many people have come here
to take photos.

176
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,600
True enough.

177
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,080
It really fooled all of us.

178
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,120
Who would have thought

179
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,460
that this newly opened photography studio

180
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,460
was actually set up for this reason?

181
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,390
What's the matter, Duke?

182
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,600
Is something wrong?

183
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,870
Duke Liang.

184
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,870
Duke Liang.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
His Highness wishes to see you.

186
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
He's in the study.

187
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,120
At this hour?

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,460
His Highness can't sleep.

189
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,630
He heard you were

190
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
out inspecting.

191
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,470
Please.

192
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,650
Last year in Harbin,

193
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,760
they sent Xiong Chengji
to assassinate the Seventh Lord.

194
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,630
Not long ago,

195
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,130
George Fong from overseas

196
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,980
plotted to kill the Sixth Lord
during his visit.

197
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,870
Now,

198
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,240
Wang Zhaoming and his two accomplices

199
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,300
have set their sights directly on me.

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,200
The three of us brothers,

201
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,090
each and every one,

202
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,810
feel as if we're standing
on the edge of a volcano.

203
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,360
Tufang.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,060
Wang Zhaoming's lengthy confession

205
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,000
accuses me of being
autocratic and dictatorial,

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,980
appointing relatives and nobles
to the detriment of the country,

207
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,160
lacking empathy for the people's hardships,

208
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,050
and ignoring public opinion.

209
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,260
That's why they want me dead.

210
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,990
From my perspective,

211
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,230
he completely misunderstands me,

212
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,030
just as I completely misunderstand him.

213
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,510
These days,

214
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,690
who can really hold
absolute control over everything?

215
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,630
If you ask me,

216
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,790
no one in my position could do that.

217
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,520
All I can do is do my best
to stabilize the situation,

218
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,360
preserve our ancestral legacy,

219
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,870
and wait until

220
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,510
Xuantong comes of age.

221
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,920
Then I can hand over the power

222
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,390
intact to the Emperor.

223
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,670
For this,

224
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,050
I'm only just managing
to keep things together.

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,730
I know my abilities fall short.

226
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,240
Prince Su suggests

227
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
that for Wang Zhaoming
and his two accomplices,

228
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,360
we should adopt a policy of
conciliation and leniency

229
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,000
to avoid further aggravating
conflicts with the rebels.

230
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,860
Your Highness,

231
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,030
what

232
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,960
do you think?

233
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,670
Let's take a step back.

234
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
All we can do is take a step back.

235
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,510
Step back,

236
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,870
and everything will be fine.

237
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,910
No death sentence?

238
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,950
Well, the bomb didn't explode after all.

239
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,510
Let's not further

240
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,150
deepen the resentment.

241
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,080
Especially...

242
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,630
This matter is personal for me.

243
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,110
Killing him would be unwise.

244
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,200
It would only turn

245
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Wang and the other two into martyrs.

246
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,170
I won't do something so foolish.

247
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,290
All of this will be recorded in history,

248
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
preserved for future generations.

249
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,400
Do you understand?

250
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,460
Tufang.

251
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,950
Yes.

252
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,100
I understand.

253
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,740
Tufang.

254
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,950
You are one of the most
promising young members

255
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,150
of the imperial clan.

256
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,820
I have high hopes for you.

257
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,270
But I also know

258
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,100
you studied in Japan,

259
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,950
where you not only
learned about military matters

260
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,349
but also met many influential people.

261
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,190
Given the current situation

262
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,560
and court politics,

263
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,339
you must have
some opinions of your own, right?

264
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,370
[Memorial]

265
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,460
This

266
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,830
is the appointment decree for Yang Kaizhi

267
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,830
as commander of the Sixth Division.

268
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,630
I've already decided to approve it.

269
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,510
Do you have any objections?

270
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,430
What's wrong?

271
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,790
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

272
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,350
I remember the other day

273
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,950
you spoke highly of him.

274
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,060
Yes,

275
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,700
Kaizhi and I

276
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,300
are friends.

277
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,780
Friends?

278
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,350
Friends are those who

279
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,150
see through each other

280
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,540
yet still choose

281
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,390
to stay close.

282
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,350
You've seen through him?

283
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,220
Very clearly.

284
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,020
It's a good thing to be able to
see through someone.

285
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,630
What's truly unsettling

286
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,720
are the ones you can't see through at all.

287
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,030
Take Prince Qing, for example.

288
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,980
Just when you think
you've got him figured out,

289
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,380
he'll do something completely unexpected

290
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,740
and catch you off guard.

291
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm going to approve it.

292
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,950
If I regret it later...

293
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,300
Your Highness, please wait.

294
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,810
If the goal is simply to
keep Yuan and the others from Beiyang in check,

295
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,220
I'm afraid there's no one

296
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,480
more suited for the job than Yang Kaizhi.

297
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,300
But when it comes to unwavering loyalty

298
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,430
to the Qing dynasty,

299
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,950
I...

300
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,740
[Approved]

301
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,560
Go congratulate your classmate.

302
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,980
He's the first division commander

303
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,970
in Qing history

304
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,590
to graduate from
a Japanese military academy.

305
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,500
In any case,

306
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,870
he's closer to you

307
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,400
and further from Yuan Shikai.

308
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,950
Oh,

309
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,870
when you offer your congratulations,

310
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,000
bring this with you.

311
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,190
Inside are 42

312
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,630
secret memorials,

313
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,980
all accusing Yang Kaizhi of

314
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,180
being part of the revolutionary party.

315
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,700
Tell Yang Kaizhi

316
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,630
that I have full faith

317
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,110
he will uphold the same loyalty

318
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,540
he showed during the China-Japan incident

319
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,780
in Yanji.

320
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,160
He now leads a key division
near the capital,

321
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,020
and I trust he will defend the court.

322
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,190
Unharness the horse and let it rest well.

323
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,950
I'll use the carriage again after noon.

324
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,480
Alright.

325
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,510
You're too tired. Go get some rest.

326
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,910
I pay my respects to you, Mother.

327
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,710
Another sleepless night, huh?

328
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Seriously.

329
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,730
You have yet to receive a noble title,

330
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,670
yet you've already been
exposed to constant risk.

331
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,630
What?

332
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,110
They haven't made you a marquis yet.

333
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,220
Your title is just

334
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,740
a mere Acting Commander
of the Imperial Guards.

335
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
When something's happened,

336
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,350
where are all those marquises and ministers

337
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,610
from the army and navy?

338
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,260
Jianqiu, bring another set of utensils.

339
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,390
Join us for the meal.

340
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,640
I don't mind doing a bit more work.

341
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,020
What really gets to me

342
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,150
is seeing the Prince Regent
with that look of

343
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,610
helplessness and sorrow.

344
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,870
The assassination attempt

345
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,390
shook him deeply.

346
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,870
In my opinion,

347
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,110
it's not that the rebels are too fierce.

348
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,840
It's that the Prince Regent
is too soft-hearted.

349
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,700
Mother, you're right.

350
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,630
The Prince Regent has just decided

351
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,500
not to execute

352
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,360
Wang and the other two rebels.

353
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,440
Is he trying to rule with benevolence now?

354
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,350
Won't that make it even harder

355
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,700
for you Imperial Guards

356
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,220
to protect him?

357
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,060
You'll have to deal with

358
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,190
even more reckless people, won't you?

359
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,520
I think he's scared out of his wits.

360
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,190
He can't tell when to

361
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,430
show mercy and when not to.

362
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,780
Does he really think

363
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,870
sparing them will stop the revolution?

364
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,200
It's best not to speak of

365
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,680
such things.

366
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,630
Oh, by the way,

367
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,980
there's an important matter

368
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,060
I'd like to trouble you with.

369
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,190
Please make an appearance
and show your support.

370
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,020
Kaizhi's appointment decree has been issued.

371
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,670
I want to take this opportunity to invite

372
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,190
a few old classmates and friends
over for a small gathering at home.

373
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,910
There are some things that must be said,

374
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,240
and I intend to say them.

375
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,810
Bugu, we're back.

376
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,490
Come in.

377
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,430
Renjun's wife is really clever.

378
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,390
She can see through everything.

379
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,500
What did she see through?

380
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,590
If I just send you over like this,

381
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,100
who knows what she'll think of us.

382
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,500
Let her think what she wants.

383
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,370
You're the one at a disadvantage.

384
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,410
I'm the burden.

385
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,590
Are those three really safe now?

386
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,840
Yes, they're safe.

387
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
The court

388
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,540
has adopted a policy of conciliation.

389
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,460
They're no longer escalating
conflicts with the revolutionaries.

390
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,220
You really were being too suspicious.

391
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,880
Go have fun.

392
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
How come you look

393
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,220
so well?

394
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,870
Don't tell me it's because someone's back

395
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,980
to boiling water, cooking,

396
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,440
doing laundry, and tidying up for you again.

397
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,540
Not exactly.

398
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,810
Then why are you grinning?

399
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,300
Shuhong, congratulate me.

400
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,910
The decree appointing me
as commander of the Sixth Division

401
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,390
has officially been issued.

402
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,220
Really?

403
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,980
So that means

404
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,950
you're leaving Beijing?

405
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,430
The day after tomorrow.

406
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,500
Today and tomorrow,

407
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,590
you need to pay your respects

408
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,830
to all the major docks in Beijing.

409
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,020
They helped out,
so we've got to keep our promises.

410
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:42,780
Is that so?

411
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,220
Oh, right.

412
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,190
Liang Xiang is hosting a dinner
at his place tonight.

413
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,790
He wants to congratulate me.

414
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,540
He specifically asked for you and the child

415
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,400
to go together.

416
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,790
Why invite me and the child?

417
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,060
I think this matter

418
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,110
needs to be settled once and for all.

419
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,640
While I'm still in Beijing,

420
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,870
let's find a way

421
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,670
to put everyone at ease.

422
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,950
I don't see the need for that.

423
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,700
Bugu!

424
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,300
What's wrong?

425
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,190
Come on, get up.

426
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,540
Where did you hurt?

427
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,390
Let me see.

428
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,260
What happened? Does it hurt?

429
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,910
This door hasn't been
properly sealed, has it?

430
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,110
I really didn't do it.

431
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,190
Did I say it was you?

432
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,930
Then why are you looking at me like that?

433
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,990
Bugu, don't rummage through things.

434
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,790
It's fine.

435
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,670
Let him be.

436
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,870
Very well.

437
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,590
Maichen, take a look.

438
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,540
What's up with Tufang tonight?

439
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,390
He's determined to make us
feel like we're in Tokyo.

440
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,950
Fenglan,

441
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,060
haven't you always been curious about

442
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,670
how people eat in Japan?

443
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,200
This meal is quite special.

444
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,970
If I had known earlier,

445
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,500
I would have borrowed

446
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
a kimono from Miyata Hidemi.

447
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,460
Who is Miyata Hidemi?

448
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,110
You don't even know her?

449
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,080
She's the top courtesan

450
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,890
at Japan House
in the Peking Legation Quarter.

451
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:11,610
Fenglan,

452
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,000
don't bring up those old friends of yours.

453
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,060
Tufang's wife, Duo Mei,

454
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,320
can't stand hearing about these things.

455
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,980
Fenglan's here?

456
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,840
Duo Mei.

457
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,110
Renjun,

458
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,150
look how you've dressed up your wife.

459
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,950
She looks just like Du Liniang
from Chinese opera.

460
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Duo Mei, you really have a sharp eye.

461
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,420
Since it’s a reunion of old friends,
let’s make it a little livelier.

462
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,700
After a few rounds of drinks,

463
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,900
why don't you perform

464
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,110
"Su San Left Hongtong County" for everyone

465
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,710
to get the atmosphere going?

466
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,640
I wonder if my voice

467
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,780
will cooperate today.

468
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,040
I'm sure it'll be fine.

469
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,950
Oh, right.

470
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,520
Where's Tufang?

471
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,780
He went to the legation by carriage himself.

472
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,390
After all, both of them are teachers.

473
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,590
They'll be here soon.

474
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,830
Maichen,

475
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,900
don't you two start fighting again later.

476
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,910
Fighting?

477
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,350
Between whom?

478
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,500
Duo Mei,

479
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,260
do you really believe what he says?

480
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,390
Has Renjun ever said

481
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,300
anything serious?

482
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,460
Renjun,

483
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,670
when the drillmaster arrives later,

484
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,220
you have to

485
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,880
stop being so reckless, alright?

486
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
How could I?

487
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Back in Tokyo,

488
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,390
I was as meek as a lamb.

489
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,190
Sir Yang,

490
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,950
how did you become a general so quickly?

491
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,590
In Li Renjun's words,

492
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,520
when someone gives you a long gown,

493
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,710
you've got to act like it, right?

494
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,780
As you say, sir.

495
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,830
Giddy up!

496
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,500
Bugu.

497
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,740
In a moment,

498
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,550
when you see Old Madam Liang,

499
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,810
remember to call her Grandma.

500
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,190
Just like when we were in Tokyo.

501
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,660
Sir Yang has arrived.

502
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,060
Look at this, it's outrageous!

503
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,870
Shuhong is here.

504
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:29,670
Come quickly.

505
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,460
Kaizhi has become a division commander

506
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,700
in the blink of an eye.

507
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,040
He's a general now.

508
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,200
How are we supposed to live with that?

509
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,390
Everyone, be quiet.

510
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,190
Let me, Li Renjun, perform

511
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,630
the ceremony of
subordinate to superior with my brother.

512
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,260
Alright.

513
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,460
What do you want to do?

514
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,950
You tell me,

515
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,090
and that's how we'll do it.

516
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,740
As a subordinate greeting a superior,

517
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,670
what else can we do?

518
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,910
Shall we begin?

519
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,910
Begin.

520
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,200
Everyone, watch closely!

521
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,190
Just look at him.

522
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,740
Report!

523
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,150
Reporting to the commander-in-chief of
the Sixth Division of the Beiyang Army!

524
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,460
I am Li Renjun,
colonel of the 12th Regiment,

525
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,690
6th Brigade of the 3rd Division,

526
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,980
presenting my utmost respect

527
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,950
and reverence with a grand salute!

528
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,500
Get lost!

529
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,700
You get lost!

530
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,260
Oh my!

531
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,870
Time has turned back again.

532
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,600
We're now at the Bamboo Hotel
like it was ten years ago.

533
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,120
Mother.

534
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:33,630
Mother.

535
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,280
Mother.

536
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,740
Kaizhi,

537
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,840
with all these fancy decorations,

538
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,440
you look so impressive!

539
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,270
Congratulations on your promotion.

540
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,060
It really feels like time
has rewound, doesn't it?

541
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,570
Mother,

542
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:44,950
after all these years,

543
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,680
you're still

544
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,860
so robust and healthy.

545
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,910
This dear son of mine

546
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,510
really knows how to flatter.

547
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,300
Renjun.

548
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,020
Mother,

549
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,900
let's not stand on ceremony.

550
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,530
You are truly a bringer of fortune.

551
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,220
You must have made
several trips to Beijing this year, right?

552
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,060
Is this the lady

553
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,320
who can perform female roles in opera?

554
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,280
Come, pay your respects to Mother.

555
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,190
Greetings, Mother.

556
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,540
I pay my deepest respects to you, Mother.

557
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,540
Just look at this scene.

558
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,170
Her acting skills are truly impressive.

559
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,550
You look unfamiliar.

560
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,500
Mother, I am Maichen.

561
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,980
I am Gu Maichen from Shandong.

562
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,440
We met in Tokyo, remember?

563
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,630
At the military school,

564
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,480
I was the one who carried Tufang's shoes.

565
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,400
Carried shoes?

566
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,020
What shoes are you talking about?

567
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,390
It's me...

568
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,350
Mother, don't listen to his nonsense.

569
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,630
Among our fellow cadets,

570
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,740
he was the one who stood out,

571
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,800
to the point it almost turned deadly.

572
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,750
Alright.

573
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,240
These two, mother and son.

574
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,460
Shuhong,

575
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,590
is this child's clothing

576
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,190
a bit too light?

577
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,420
Grandma.

578
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,430
Please sit down. Don't just stand around.

579
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,880
Let's all take a seat and wait.

580
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
Duo Mei, invite everyone to sit.

581
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,400
Shuhong,

582
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,650
come sit beside me.

583
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
Almost everyone's here now.

584
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,110
We're just waiting for Hirata and Yoshiko.

585
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,440
You should sit down too.

586
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,510
Thank you.

587
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,530
Grandson, come sit here.

588
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,260
Right next to me.

589
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,190
Shuhong,

590
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,600
you've been through a lot.

591
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,720
It really hasn't been easy.

592
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,640
Open your mouth, my grandson.

593
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,130
Here.

594
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,310
Eat up. Grandma's doting on you.

595
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:33,950
Here.

596
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,190
Take it slow. Be careful not to choke.

597
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,540
The Japanese military attaché to China,
Mr. and Mrs. Hirata, have arrived.

598
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,270
Welcome, Drillmaster Hirata.

599
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,480
Come on.

600
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,360
Please take the seats of honor.

601
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,990
Welcome, Drillmaster Hirata.

602
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,260
And this is?

603
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,020
You should have met before.

604
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,020
Have we met before?

605
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,980
Outside the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department,

606
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,970
I personally witnessed you

607
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,380
deliver a sharp slap

608
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,400
to each of your three students.

609
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,340
Oh, I see.

610
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,410
Now I remember.

611
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,220
Alright, sit down, son.

612
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:33,940
Sit.

613
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,260
Sit down.

614
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,430
Except for Duo Mei and Fenglan,

615
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,670
everyone here is an old friend from Tokyo,

616
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,670
including our respected Old Madam.

617
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,480
So tonight, I've prepared

618
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,350
this Japanese-style family dinner

619
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,730
to reminisce about our days as classmates.

620
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,780
The temple gates are honored by the elders,

621
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,670
guests are welcomed with utmost sincerity,

622
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,430
disputes are settled without quarrels,

623
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,190
and everyone

624
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,610
fulfills their duties wholeheartedly.

625
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,960
Tufang,

626
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,500
stop being so formal.

627
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,090
Just tell us how we're going

628
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,659
to drink tonight.

629
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,750
How do you think we should drink?

630
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,270
I think,

631
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,520
for the first round,

632
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,230
we pair off and go head-to-head.

633
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,730
Let's start with those who have old grudges.

634
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,719
Begin with a reconciliation toast.

635
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,830
You'd better explain

636
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,360
what you mean by "grudges."

637
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,090
Maichen.

638
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,500
You should toast Drillmaster Hirata first.

639
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,150
Back then, it was you who fired that shot.

640
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,480
The sound still echoes.

641
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,170
If you don't offer the first toast
to Drillmaster Hirata,

642
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,570
none of the brothers here

643
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,790
will feel at ease.

644
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,540
That's a good suggestion.

645
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,020
Come on.

646
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,310
Drillmaster Hirata,

647
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,659
back at the Tokyo Military School,

648
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,790
I was often disrespectful

649
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,830
toward you.

650
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,179
I sincerely apologize.

651
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,240
Please forgive me.

652
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,130
Wait a moment.

653
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,560
Maichen,

654
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,350
where are you currently employed?

655
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,950
I...

656
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,140
Maichen has accepted my invitation

657
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,870
to serve as a member of the general staff

658
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,600
in the Beiyang Sixth Division.

659
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,770
Then I can rest assured.

660
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,140
It wasn't all for nothing, after all.

661
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,880
Good, that's great.

662
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Is there anyone else still holding a grudge?

663
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,580
Aren't you just looking for trouble now?

664
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,310
Everyone's finally reunited,

665
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,280
and you're just bringing up
painful memories for no reason.

666
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,190
Right. I shall listen to my wife.

667
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,620
Let me rephrase that.

668
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,580
Is there anyone here
with a past romance to confess?

669
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,710
That's more like it.

670
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:41,790
Shuhong.

671
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,430
Let's not talk about anything else.

672
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,870
Back then, at the dining table
on the ship to Tokyo,

673
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,430
you, me, Kaizhi, and Liang Xiang

674
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,350
were all sitting there, waiting for dinner.

675
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,750
Can you give me an answer?

676
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,320
Among us three greenhorns,

677
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,990
who did you fancy?

678
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,150
That's inappropriate, Qianli.

679
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,310
Old Madam is here,

680
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,050
you're bringing up such awkward topics.

681
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,100
In my opinion,

682
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,660
this first glass of wine

683
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,230
should be offered to Mother.

684
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,460
After all, no one could beat

685
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,620
your pastries back in Tokyo.

686
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,420
That's right.

687
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,460
Come, let's raise a toast to Mother.

688
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,110
Come on, let's all toast to Mother together.

689
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,910
This was supposed to be my treat,

690
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,310
how did I end up the one drinking?

691
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,830
Come on.

692
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,270
You should be the ones drinking.

693
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,950
Come on.

694
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,950
Come on.

695
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,450
May you live a long, healthy life.

696
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,820
You're all such wonderful children.

697
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,930
Come on. Here.

698
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,380
Maichen, come on, have another drink.

699
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,440
No more drinking. I'm getting tipsy.

700
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,230
Where's the bathroom?

701
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,360
I'll take you there.

702
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,950
Shuhong.

703
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,180
I'll come find you for a drink later.

704
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,180
You go sit down. I'll take the child.

705
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:50,460
This is improper.

706
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,520
We're family. No need for such formalities.

707
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,100
Let's go, darling.

708
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,560
Let me take you to pee-pee.

709
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,020
Let's go.

710
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,550
Go ahead.

711
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,390
You go ahead and take care of things too.

712
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,190
Alright then.

713
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,630
You're still so beautiful.

714
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,620
General Liang,

715
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,820
your wife just left a moment ago.

716
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,960
Duo Mei understands everything.

717
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,430
Understand what?

718
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,660
Disputes between us.

719
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,660
Didn't you just say in your opening remarks

720
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,520
that disputes should be settled
without quarrels?

721
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,390
So you're saying

722
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,480
you agree with my proposition?

723
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,700
What if I do?

724
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,480
And what if I don't?

725
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Shuhong,

726
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,500
there's no need for us to argue.

727
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,460
Besides, this isn't something
we can argue our way through.

728
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,230
But when it comes to matters concerning

729
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,350
the future of our country,

730
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,060
those involving right and wrong
on a grand scale,

731
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,260
how can women truly see things clearly?

732
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,750
If you can't see it clearly,

733
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,060
don't get involved.

734
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,980
Especially don't be swayed by

735
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,580
the incitement of radicals.

736
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,190
They are simply exploiting

737
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,050
women's ignorance and goodwill.

738
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,710
General,

739
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,720
what exactly are you trying to say?

740
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,060
Don't assume that

741
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,430
just because the court
is taking a lenient stance

742
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,400
toward the three involved in the Wang case,

743
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,830
the detectives in Beijing will simply drop

744
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,560
the rest of the investigation.

745
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,660
Especially the traces

746
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,750
you left at

747
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,680
the Shouzhen Photography Studio.

748
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,430
Bravo! That's wonderful.

756
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,230
Why is she singing this?

757
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,430
It's the inner lament of a female prisoner.

758
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,480
Good!

759
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,060
That was wonderful!

760
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,980
It sounds so beautiful!

761
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,910
Sing another verse, please.

762
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,430
Go on.

763
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,430
Yes, sing another verse!

764
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,910
Then I'll humbly oblige.

765
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:30,950
Mother loves to hear it. Go on.

766
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,960
You're going to become a division commander.

767
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,650
And it's the elite force
of the Beiyang Army.

768
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,200
Congratulations.

769
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,860
That's not a big deal.

770
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,830
Sir,

771
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,060
you represent the whole Japanese Army.

772
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,630
You are still at the top of your game.

773
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,540
To you, the Sixth Division
of the Beiyang Army

774
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,200
is nothing more than this.

775
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,860
From my perspective,

776
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,710
the Beiyang Army's current development

777
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,870
lacks strategic vision.

778
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,270
You must be clear about

779
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,850
what your ultimate purpose for it is.

780
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,360
German advisors have already laid down

781
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,580
the groundwork for modernization.

782
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,580
But if that's all there is,

783
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,610
it's far from enough.

784
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,340
Then in your opinion?

785
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,500
Your country's current approach

786
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,710
of prioritizing military
spending financially

787
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:37,060
will lead to a very bad outcome.

788
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,410
The military will separate itself
from the national economy,

789
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,630
expanding blindly.

790
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,950
This will further

791
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,500
destabilize your already fragile

792
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,180
political system.

793
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,870
The armed forces will end up

794
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,500
as the final arbitrator

795
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,140
in future political struggles.

796
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,350
That's a dangerous path.

797
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,390
You're absolutely right, sir.

798
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,130
I truly hope it won't come to that.

799
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:18,980
Tufang.

800
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,710
Come here.

801
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,830
Among the three of us,

802
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,500
you and Kaizhi have both become generals.

803
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,230
I'm the only one left behind.

804
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,750
It's really unfair.

805
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,430
Can you help me out?

806
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,660
If I can't become a division commander,

807
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:44,190
at least let me be
a brigade commander, right?

808
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,410
Renjun,

809
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:51,560
there's something
I should've told you long ago.

810
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,460
Could you stop bringing up

811
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,660
Mr. Yuan all the time?

812
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,060
Given the current situation,

813
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,600
you need to understand
who's on the winning side

814
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,730
and who's not.

815
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,710
If you don't see that,

816
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,430
how can I help you?

817
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,520
But...

818
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,500
Can we really sacrifice our friendship

819
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,140
just for an official post?

820
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,060
You're just

821
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,660
too stubborn.

822
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,880
In this regard,

823
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,180
you should really learn from your wife.

You're here.

831
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,990
My eldest grandson is back!

832
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,020
Look.

833
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,830
Be careful.

834
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,140
What's going on with this child?

835
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,980
You...

836
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:10,980
Stop.

837
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:11,830
Take a break, will you?

838
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,090
You'll get dizzy soon.

839
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,230
Miss Shuhong,

840
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,460
I noticed your bow just now

841
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,260
had a certain palace style to it.

842
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,310
Your dining etiquette
is also very authentic.

843
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,040
Where did you receive your training?

844
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,230
Do you know Utako Shimoda?

845
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,620
She was my teacher.

846
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,910
Utako Shimoda?

847
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,330
She was my teacher too.

848
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,270
Ichiro, come here for a moment.

849
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,510
Excuse me.

850
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,520
Do you know?

851
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,710
Miss Shuhong and I are schoolmates.

852
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,580
I remember now.

853
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,100
We indeed

854
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,750
met outside
the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

855
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,350
Your husband was indeed
very strict back then.

856
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,390
The two generals present here

857
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,460
have both been slapped by him,

858
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,590
right in front of me.

859
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,130
Is that so?

860
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,040
In Japanese military schools,

861
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,460
getting hit is also
part of the educational curriculum.

862
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,930
That student named Maichen over there

863
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:25,560
can only be a general staff

864
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,180
because he himself

865
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,150
couldn't endure this part of the curriculum.

866
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,050
Run slower, darling.

867
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,140
Don't be naughty.

868
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,640
I think you're just excited to see people.

869
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,210
Eat something,
or you'll be hungry again tonight.

870
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,920
Darling, come, let's go find Aunt Mei.

871
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,200
Let's have some pastries.

872
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,270
-Let's go.
-Aunt Mei has some pastries.

873
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:47,660
Okay.

874
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:48,620
Go ahead.

875
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,680
Time for pastries!

876
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,750
Girl,

877
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,190
come here.

878
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,980
Girl,

879
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,350
sit here.

880
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,160
Sit properly.

881
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,310
I have been

882
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:19,360
wanting to talk to you for a while.

883
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,860
Girl,

884
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,460
do you trust me?

885
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,630
Madam Liang,

886
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:34,540
the first time we met

887
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,830
when we were in Tokyo,

888
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,770
I felt that you

889
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,540
were so kind and affectionate.

890
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,500
That's it then.

891
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,880
If it were those Japanese people,

892
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,620
I wouldn't be

893
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,680
this close to them.

894
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,870
Although I'm Manchu

895
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,100
and you're Han,

896
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,730
we're still one family.

897
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,350
The bloodlines of our two families

898
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
are now

899
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:11,870
like this,

900
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:14,790
tied in an unbreakable knot.

901
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,980
Madam Liang, don't be anxious.

902
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,840
Take your time.

903
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,180
-I don't care what
-I'll listen.

904
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,620
your background is.

905
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,790
But this child

906
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,350
must absolutely not

907
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,390
be involved in any legal matters.

908
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,460
How could that be allowed?

909
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,660
Who are our ancestors?

910
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,750
I've already told my son

911
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,050
to make sure

912
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,100
that in Beijing,

913
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:41,430
no matter who it is,

914
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,460
no one will be allowed

915
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,140
to lay a finger on the child.

916
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,750
When it comes to loyalty,

917
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,830
can you find another family

918
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,950
like ours in Beijing?

919
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,680
We've been loyal to the court,

920
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:59,590
so the court should treat us fairly too.

921
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,180
Girl,

922
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:05,750
do you understand?

923
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,290
Even you,

924
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,580
his own mother,

925
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,290
aren't allowed to harm him.

926
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,620
But

927
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,540
he's still

928
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,090
just a child.

929
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,290
He can't keep wandering off.

930
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,690
He needs guidance, right?

931
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,540
In case something happens in the future,

932
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,140
it would involve the child again,
wouldn't it?

933
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,930
So, girl,

934
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,720
tonight,

935
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,710
go home and think carefully

936
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,790
about whether this child

937
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,660
could possibly

938
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,220
stay with our Liang family.

939
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,290
Let Duo Mei and I help raise him.

940
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,270
We'll find him a good school.

941
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:18,920
This way,

942
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,980
wouldn't everything be settled?

943
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:50,820
Come.

944
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,920
Sir Yang,

945
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,320
Liang asked me to give this to you.

946
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,430
Thanks, Luo Ge.

947
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,230
Alright then.

948
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,180
Liang Xiang and Old Madam

949
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,170
both mentioned the photography studio.

950
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,990
It's clearly blackmail.

951
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,990
They want me to leave the child
with the Liang family.

952
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,180
What did you

953
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,570
leave at the photography studio?

954
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,540
I've thought it over.

955
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,060
The only thing they could find

956
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:35,830
was a photo of me and my son.

957
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,870
A single photo

958
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,480
taken during the soft opening.

959
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,640
What can a single photo prove?

960
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,980
Son, come wash your face.

961
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,820
So what

962
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,440
are your plans?

963
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:52,540
Why should I

964
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,470
give the child to the Liang family?

965
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,870
My son is my own.

966
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,810
For five years,

967
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,020
Tianbai and I have painstakingly

968
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,830
raised him.

969
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,760
We watched him grow bit by bit in our arms.

970
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:06,660
In the end,

971
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,920
I'm not qualified to raise him anymore?

972
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,380
Just because of one photo,

973
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,710
they want to strip away

974
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:12,970
my right to be a mother?

975
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,880
Isn't this blackmail?

976
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,870
Go to bed now.

977
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,140
Go on.

978
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:35,300
What's this?

979
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:37,910
Just like you,

980
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:39,950
it's also blackmail.

981
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:42,240
Blackmailing you?

982
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,500
Looks like

983
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,620
tonight,

984
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:48,950
they've truly laid

985
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,270
a trap for both of us.

986
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,660
Mommy, my tummy hurts.

987
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,870
I need to poop.

988
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,360
You should hurry back to bed, okay?

989
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,360
I'm coming.
