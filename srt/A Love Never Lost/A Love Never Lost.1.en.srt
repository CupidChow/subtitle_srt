The teacher canceled our class today.

Beheading people is a sinister and unlucky matter.

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,120
Liang.

188
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
You are really something.

189
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,840
You brat.

190
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,910
Look at all of you.

191
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,600
Twenty fried fritters.

192
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,390
Let's go home.

193
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,790
Let's go.

194
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,360
What did I tell you?

195
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,410
Your father passed away early.

196
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,240
You are my only hope.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,510
Why can't you study hard

198
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,840
and make me proud?

199
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,600
I was wrong.

200
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,080
Really?

201
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,930
You're 17, going 18 soon.

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,930
You're an adult.

203
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,620
You should learn to work hard.

204
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,720
Are you going somewhere?

205
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,430
Have dinner by yourself. It's on the stove.

206
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,910
The magistrate's family has invited

207
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,900
the Salt Transport Commissioner of Huguang's wife for dinner.

208
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,050
[Descendant of Dorgon, Prince Rui, Mother of Liang]

209
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,510
Somehow, they found me

210
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,620
and asked me to accompany her.

211
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,280
I wonder what they are thinking.

212
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,880
What am I supposed to do with you?

213
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,850
Of all the things you could have done,

214
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
why did you have to be a rebel?

215
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
So beautiful.

216
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,580
Your Liangbatou hairstyle is beautiful.

217
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,510
What is this lousy official doing?

218
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,240
It's so noisy.

219
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
How do you Bannermen

220
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,240
kowtow with so many

221
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,080
accessories on your head?

222
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,810
[Manistrate's Mansion of Jingzhou]

223
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,790
The women in the old ancestral residence

224
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,790
only kneel when they have to kowtow.

225
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,030
We use our right hand

226
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,950
to touch the tip of our Liangbatou.

227
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,000
When we touch it,

228
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,720
we tilt our head slightly to the right.

229
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,350
One touch equals one kowtow.

230
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,600
For each kneel, we touch it 3 times.

231
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,930
If we kneel again, we touch it 3 more times.

232
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,370
Could you demonstrate it for us to see?

233
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,030
Just like this.

234
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,210
It's so neat.

235
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,960
It's so elegant.

236
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,150
It's so neat.

237
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,910
So beautiful.

238
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,340
We have made the right call to invite you.

239
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,150
The Salt Transport Commissioner's wife is also a Bannerman.

240
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,160
I don't understand your rules.

241
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,770
When she arrives later,

242
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,450
you have to help me out.

243
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,960
Make sure I don't make a mistake

244
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,359
and make a fool of myself.

245
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,640
Got it, Madam.

246
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,589
This is my daughter, Duo Mei.

247
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:17,369
[Duo Mei]

248
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,750
Duo Mei, greet your aunt.

249
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,480
Aunt.

250
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,109
We Bannermen

251
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,220
use "auntie" instead.

252
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,440
For example, the sixth auntie or

253
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,970
the seventh auntie.

254
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,640
We add their ranks in front of the address.

255
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,480
Would you look at that?

256
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I almost made another mistake.

257
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,210
Later,

258
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,000
when the wife of the Salt Transport Commissioner is here,

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
you can call her third auntie.

260
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,160
Does a junior need to perform formal greetings too?

261
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Of course.

262
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,320
Does she kneel on both knees

263
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,910
or just one knee for the greeting?

264
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,830
Men kneel on both knees.

265
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,110
When ladies meet each other,

266
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,030
they can just bend their knees instead.

267
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,290
Just like this, Madam.

268
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,790
Like this.

269
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,240
It's such a neat greeting.

270
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,110
I've never seen it before.

271
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,960
This gesture.

272
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,720
Mei, did you get a good look?

273
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,640
Yes.

274
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,060
Keep your head straight.

275
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,830
Keep it. You can use it on the way.

276
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,180
Where is my case?

277
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,110
The one I asked you to hide.

278
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,030
My Commander-in-chief entrusted this to me before he died.

279
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,030
I must get it done.

280
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,270
I have to go to Shanghai.

281
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,960
You still plan to run around?

282
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,750
Do you want to die?

283
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,590
Miss.

284
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,750
Is the distinguished guest here?

285
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,880
She'll be here soon.

286
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,160
Mother asks you to hold back on the chili when you cook.

287
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,510
The wife of the Salt Transport Commissioner can't eat spicy food.

288
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,270
Got it.

289
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,650
Here comes the wife of the Salt Transport Commissioner of Huguang.

290
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,350
Go.

291
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,720
Go right now.

292
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
Immediately.

293
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,030
This way, please.

294
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,540
Here comes the wife of the Salt Transport Commissioner of Huguang.

295
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,080
Here comes the wife of the Salt Transport Commissioner of Huguang.

296
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,950
My daughter, Duo Mei.

297
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,100
Greetings, Third Auntie.

298
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,750
Here.

299
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,110
What a beautiful girl.

300
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,450
How old are you?

301
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,240
Auntie, I'm 17.

302
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,110
So beautiful.

303
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,030
Greetings, Master.

304
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,680
Are you Lady Bi?

305
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,750
Yes, Master.

306
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,880
Lady Bi.

307
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,680
Where have you been making money?

308
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,240
Master,

309
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,450
20 years ago,

310
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,050
I married Liangmu of the Zhengnan family.

311
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,200
Liangmu works for the court.

312
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,260
He transferred

313
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,870
to Jingzhou from Nanjing 2 days ago.

314
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,750
I see.

315
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,730
You must be wealthy now.

316
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,960
I dare not call myself wealthy

317
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,360
in front of you, Master.

318
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,550
Get up.

319
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,200
Today, the host is giving us food.

320
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,110
You don't need to be too polite.

321
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,940
Yes.

322
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,070
Master.

323
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,640
Come on. Have a seat.

324
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,930
Go.

325
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,300
This way, please.

326
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,150
This is the seat of honor.

327
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,880
So...

328
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,290
I'm here today.

329
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,790
It's not convenient for her to take this seat.

330
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,320
I'll sit here on her behalf.

331
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,140
Have a seat, everyone.

332
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,830
You wanted me to show you the Bannerman etiquette.

333
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,760
Well, this is it.

334
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,000
Your Ladyship.

335
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,010
Have a seat.

336
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,740
Have a seat.

337
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,240
You don't have to go against

338
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,510
the host's kindness.

339
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,480
Sit down and eat with us.

340
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,230
Thank you, Master.

341
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
Your Ladyship, please.

342
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,380
I really didn't know.

343
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,160
You really didn't know?

344
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,270
I only knew she was the widow

345
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,640
of a soldier of the Banner Battalion.

346
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,350
As for the rest...

347
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,610
You must know Dorgon, Prince Rui, right?

348
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,920
The ancestor of the Plain White Banner,

349
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,040
the Regent Prince, Father of the Emperor.

350
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,210
Dorgon? Prince Rui?

351
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,000
Yes.

352
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Her maiden family is a descendant of Dorgon.

353
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,720
You asked her to accompany me?

354
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,120
You...

355
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
That's deliberately making things difficult for me.

356
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,500
Your Ladyship.

357
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
Your Ladyship, I really didn't know.

358
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,220
Your Ladyship.

359
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Mother.

360
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,660
What should we do?

361
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,660
She's so drunk.

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,070
What do we do now?

363
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,550
Mother.

364
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,640
Mother.

365
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,680
My son.

366
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,900
How dignified.

367
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,560
Be careful.

368
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,240
Slow down.

369
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,580
Very dignified.

370
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,710
There is a guest room in the mansion. How about…

371
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,720
Liang Xiang.

372
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm here.

373
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,510
It seems that

374
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,640
I can't teach you anymore.

375
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,910
Go to the administrative ministry.

376
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,620
They want to see you.

377
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,510
Master,

378
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,320
please forgive me this time.

379
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I love studying, Master.

380
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,000
Master.

381
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,000
Master.

382
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,530
Please forgive him.

383
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,490
Liang Xiang won’t do it again.

384
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,770
Go.

385
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,180
Liang Xiang.

386
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,560
It's not that I don't want to teach you,

387
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,270
but...

388
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,130
What's wrong, Liang?

389
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,720
Why do you look so listless?

390
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
How should I tell you?

391
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,670
We didn't expect

392
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,710
your ancestral family in the capital

393
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,510
to suddenly think of you either.

394
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,970
The document arrived yesterday.

395
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,880
They want you to reach Shanghai in three days.

396
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,800
Shanghai?

397
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,550
Why?

398
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,440
Why?

399
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,440
I also want to know why.

400
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,750
Why are they only reminded of

401
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,000
the ancestors of the Qing Dynasty

402
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,270
at a time like this?

403
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,920
The world is

404
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,800
in terrible turbulence.

405
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,880
On one hand, the internal strife of the party.

406
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,540
On the other hand, the threat of foreign powers.

407
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,000
In the battle of the Boxer Rebellion last year,

408
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,240
the Eight-Nation Alliance

409
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,030
seized Beijing city with less than 20,000 people.

410
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,000
They're still in there right now.

411
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,600
They still have our imperial capital hostage.

412
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,880
There have been several rounds of negotiations.

413
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,640
Tell me.

414
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,810
If a negotiation can't be reached,

415
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,400
what can you do

416
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
if they make themselves at home

417
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,310
and take advantage of us?

418
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,720
Nothing.

419
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,720
The Empress Dowager and the Emperor have gone to survey Xi'an.

420
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
In Xi'an,

421
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,750
they finally thought of reorganizing the army

422
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,280
and rebuilding the troops.

423
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:35,830
Look.

424
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,260
The official document

425
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,750
stated some facts.

426
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,950
Compared to their glorious ancestors,

427
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,110
princes of current times have become increasingly incompetent.

428
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,400
Some may be well-educated but fail to grasp the big picture.

429
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,510
They feed on tax funds but know nothing about civil affairs.

430
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,110
They indulge in arts and entertainment, treating knives and acrobatics

431
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,320
as mere amusement.

432
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,810
Do you understand, child?

433
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,960
It means,

434
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,310
members of the royal families in the capital

435
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,720
are rotten to the core.

436
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,000
They couldn't find a suitable candidate anymore.

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,460
That's why they found you.

438
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,400
Me?

439
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
They want to

440
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,700
send you to Japan to study military affairs

441
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,290
and expand your knowledge.

Yes.

Yes.
