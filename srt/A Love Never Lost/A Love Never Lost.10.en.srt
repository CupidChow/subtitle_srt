Chairman called from Beijing.

20
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,290
What did he say?

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,870
Chairman has talked to a few European

22
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,960
and American banks including

23
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,020
HSBC and Citibank.

24
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,500
He asked them to help us get through this.

25
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,540
Chairman also said

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,590
we should make sure every client

27
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,630
can cash it.

28
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,710
If we don't have enough cash,

29
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,380
we can apply for commercial loans

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,310
from European and American banks.

31
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,320

48
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,830

Your artwork

53
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,790

Do you know that?

56
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Not bad, Mr. Kanyama.

57
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
Really?

58
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,920
What do you mean?

59
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,470
We had a deal.

60
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,080
How could you print and transport it

61
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,720
without telling us?

62
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,659
Mr. Wu,

63
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,560
you misunderstood.

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
Counterfeit money

65
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,540
is printed based on real money.

66
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,080
As the capital supplier,

67
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,310
we have to consider

68
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,620
the risk of investment.

69
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,870
I just used a little

70
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,190
for a test first.

71
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,240
It's understandable.

72
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,600
What a pity.

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,190
What a pity.

74
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,120
You should have sold the counterfeits

75
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
all at once.

76
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,800
Then you could have earned more.

77
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480

to give us his next painting.

Fighting against it

130
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,310

can only come from a genius.

135
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,270
But your boss

136
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,560
plagiarized my creativity.

He printed, transported,

138
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
and tested it

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
without telling us.

00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,440

142
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,070
I didn't expect this.

143

I didn't expect you

144
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
to be so close

145
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,850
to these financial oligarchs.

146
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,950

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,670
That's why I always said

150
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,310
you are too naive.

We need to take back all the banknotes

155

and destroy them.

156
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,810

157
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,330
won't start until one year later.

no one in our country is capable of doing that.

six months ago, a Japanese bank

169

mentioned a JV collaboration with us.

170

Mr. Sheng refused it without hesitation.

Surround this house.

197
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,950
Don't let a criminal go.

198
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,530
All of them have been taken care of. There are many guns.

199
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,870
Yes.

200
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,119
Shuhong, where's the newspaper?

201
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,810
It's on the table.

202
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,590
[Tokyo Daily News]

203
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,030
What's wrong? What happened?

204
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,270
We have to move.

205
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,240
Now.

206
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,550
Move?

207
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,030
Yes.

208
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,790
Where should we move?

209
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,720
How would I know?

210
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,790
Hurry up.

211
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,550
Pack our things.

212
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,490
Just take important things with us.

213
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,490
Hurry up.

214
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,120
Don't just stand there.

215
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,950
It'll be too late if we don't leave now.

216
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,960
Mr. Wu.

217
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,900
Girl, where are you going?

218
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,860
We...

219
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,920
Sir.

220
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
Sir.

221
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,120
Where is he?

222
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,550
This is strange.

223
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,980
Usually he would be here at this hour.

224
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,560
These are all his books.

225
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,060
Don't do this.

226
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,370
Your shoes.

227
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,840
What's going on?

228
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,490
What happened to him?

229
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,920
Maybe he'll come back.

230
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,790
He won't come back?

231
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,080
Liang Xiang,

232
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,680
I heard your mother went back to your home country.

233
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,590
There was no other way.

234
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,920
I don't have time to accompany her.

235
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,830
She couldn't stand

236
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,440
staying at home alone.

237
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,070
She wanted to go back long ago.

238
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,750
But the winter in Japan is too cold.

239
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,030
I was worried she might catch a cold on the way.

240
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,790
Upon spring,

241
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,480
she was in a hurry

242
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,590
to go back again.

243
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,440
So,

244
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,960
I asked a fellow-villager

245
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,360
to take her back to Hubei.

246
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
What a pity.

247
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,790
I wanted

248
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,450
to invite her to my place to have a meal this week.

249
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,950
You've been kind enough.

250
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,550
Come with me.

251
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,270
I'm going to introduce someone

252
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,270
to you.

253
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,440
They are powerful people.

254
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,790
They'll be helpful in the future.

255
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,680
Okay.

256
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,850
Lieutenant Hirata,

257
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,270
do you think

258
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,790
my father cares

259
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,920
about that Chinese young man

260
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,400
more than

261
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,510
his guardian?

262
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,310
Duke Ayakura

263
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,510
knows what he's doing.

264
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,720
In my opinion,

265
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,160
he wants to cultivate

266
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,790
a future military leader.

267
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:04,480
A Chinese military leader who is close to Japan.

268
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,750
Come in.

269
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,480
This is

270
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
Mr. Shibata, Cabinet Secretary.

271
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,480
This is Liang Xiang, a cadet.

272
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,640
Nice to meet you.

273
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,020
This is the president of Mitsubishi Joint Venture.

274
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,880
I'm Liang Xiang.

275
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,680
Nice to meet you.

276
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,270
This is

277
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,680
Mr. Kataoka,

278
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

279
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,510
Nice to meet you.

280
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,000
Come on. Cheers.

281
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,750
Cheers.

282
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
Is he picking a son-in-law?

283
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,590
If that's the case,

284
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,590
Western countries,

285
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,380
especially Russia, would definitely care.

286
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,640
I don't think Duke Ayakura

287
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,480
would be so abrupt.

288
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,160
What do you mean?

289
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,790
If Liang Xiang marries you,

290
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,400
it means China and the Japanese royal family

291
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,350
will form ties of consanguinity.

292
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,920
Do you think the West can tolerate it?

293
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,350
I see.

294
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,350
No wonder your students fear you so much.

295
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,510
You just

296
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,170
instill political intimidation into them like this.

297
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,600
Miss,

298
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,060
you underestimated Chinese culture.

299
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,270
The classical virtues of balance and restraint

300
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:38,350
have long been cherished in the spiritual essence of Chinese culture.

301
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,470
Are you Mr. Cai?

302
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,240
Yes.

303
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,650
I'm Cai Guangqi.

304
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,790
I'm Liang Xiang.

305
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,830
Do we know each other?

306
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,750
I bought

307
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,480
your wisteria grape painting.

308
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,690
Duke Ayakura likes it very much.

309
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,490
So he specially invited you.

310
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,750
I see.

311
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,610
So this is why I was invited.

312
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,090
Come on.

313
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,160
Right.

314
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,320
Can I ask you about someone?

315
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,270
Go ahead.

316
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,990
The Chinese girl

317
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,570
who always contacted you

318
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,570
for drawings.

319
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,110
You mean...

320
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,550
Shuhong?

321
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,710
It's her.

322
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,580
[Osaka, Japan]

323
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,220
Is it for sale?

324
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,990
How much?

325
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,750
15 yen.

326
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,150
15 yen.

327
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:08,760
Here.

328
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,080
It feels a bit tight.

329
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,540
How about 10 yen?

330
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:28,050
Then you need to give me your shoes.

331
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,360
But mine is worth 50 yen.

332
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,020
Mine is worth 100 yen.

333
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,440
100 yen?

334
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Leave.

335
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,220
Wait.

336
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,650
Forget it.

337
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
You win.

338
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,610
Thanks.

339
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
You're welcome.

340
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,400
You're Chinese, right?

341
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,940
Among the Chinese people I've ever seen,

342
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,440
you're the best at doing business.

343
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,510
I'm flattered.

344
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,230
The shoes are still on your feet,

345
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,970
but you have an additional 10 yen in your pocket.

346
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
I give things in exchange for what I need.

347
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,680
Give us the money!

348
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,640
What?

349
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,780
Smart Chinese guy,

350
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,030
in my territory,

351
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,440
no matter how much you earn

352
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,440
or how smart you are,

353
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,210
you have to give us protection money.

354
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,380
Do you understand?

355
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,330
Okay.

356
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,770
Jerk!

357
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,120
Is this all you have?

358
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,030
You poor guy.

359
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,790
Poor guy.

360
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,010
Aren't you smart?

361
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,200
You have nothing to eat?

362
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,270
Give my money back to me!

363
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,920
Or you have nowhere to live?

364
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,030
How did a well-educated Chinese guy

365
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,350
end up like this?

366
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,690
Let's go.

367
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,700
Give my money back to me!

368
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,440
Bastard!

369
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,520
How dare you fight back!

370
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,110
What are you doing?

371
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,300
What are you doing?

372
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,210
Get lost!

373
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,160
What are you doing?

374
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,960
Get lost!

375
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,500
Get lost!

376
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,510
Tianbai, what happened?

377
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,860
Jerk!

378
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,200
What are these?

379
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,270
I found a job.

380
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm a tailor in Yoshino Fashion Shop.

381
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,510
A tailor?

382
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,000
You... You're gonna be a tailor?

383
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,960
The probationary period is three months.

384
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,830
If I get hired,

385
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,360
I can earn 15 yen a month.

386
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,880
Do you know how to make clothes?

387
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,610
I'm familiar with needlework.

388
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,270
It's just that the shop uses a sewing machine.

389
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,750
I'm not familiar with it yet.

390
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,400
The boss asked me

391
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,850
to bring back an old machine

392
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,610
to practise.

393
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Give me a hand.

394
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
Help me fix this machine.

395
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,640
I think something is wrong with it.

396
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,310
Who is your boss?

397
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,640
Why would he take you in?

398
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,610
I'm talking to you.

399
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,810
He must be an old man.

400
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,560
Definitely.

401
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,880
Wu Tianbai,

402
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,560
what are you talking about?

403
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,310
If we don't make money,

404
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,240
how can we survive?

405
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:52,920
But we should

406
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
make clean money.

407
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,060
Look at you.

408
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,120
A girl like you...

409
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,480
You... You have a job as a tailor.

410
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,270
Do you know how to make clothes?

411
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,800
Have you ever made clothes?

412
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,350
Is it that hard?

413
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,830
Tear apart a piece of clothes first

414
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,880
and sew them then.

415
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,310
That's it, right?

416
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,510
You haven't answered me yet.

417
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,680
Is the boss a man?

418
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Yes, he's quite old.

419
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,550
You are not allowed to go. Understand?

420
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,950
You are not allowed to go.

421
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,790
Think about it.

422
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,210
Why would he take you in?

423
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,000
He thinks I'm suitable for this.

424
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,600
And he is satisfied with me.

425
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
He's willing to teach me.

426
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,030
And I need money.

427
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,070
Listen to yourself.

428
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,400
You just blurted it out, didn't you?

429
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,030
He is satisfied with you and willing to teach you.

430
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,750
To put it bluntly,

431
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,920
it's because you're young

432
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,880
and beautiful!

433
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,680
That's right.

434
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,820
There are many garments in the shop.

435
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,550
The boss asked me to try them on.

436
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,400
I looked pretty in them. They suited me well.

437
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
He asked you to be a model?

438
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,010
Well, what does he want?

439
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,640
You just took off and put on clothes.

440
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,640
What does he want?

441
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,200
You are not allowed to go.

442
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,290
Do you hear me? You are not allowed to go.

443
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:53,910
Wu Tianbai.

444
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,430
What?

445
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,680
Listen.

446
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,350
You're an adult.

447
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,630
Can you be reasonable?

448
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,920
Look at you.

449
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:02,260
You made bombs first. Then you made banknotes.

450
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,000
But you failed.

451
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,750
Now the police in Shanghai and Tokyo

452
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,790
are looking for us all over the world.

453
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,510
We are homeless and always on the run.

454
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,040
We don't have food or water.

455
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,880
I don't want

456
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,340
to have anything to do with your stuff again.

457
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,710
If you don't let me go,

458
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,030
we can only separate.

459
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,990
You live your life.

460
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,190
I'll live my own life.

461
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,270
It's good, right?

462
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,350
It's fixed?

463
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,450
The boss said

464
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,140
this machine is just a bit old.

465
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,110
You know how capable I am.

466
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,340
I know machines very well.

468
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,670
That's it.

469

[Yoshino, Boss of Yoshino Fashion Shop]

470
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,630
That's it.

471
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,510
Move it here.

472
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,600
Good.

473
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,860
You should start from sewing.

474
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,680
Cutting is a bit more difficult.

475
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,000
I'll teach you gradually.

476
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,270
Okay. I'll do my best.

477
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,020
Ms. Oshima,

478
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,340
you haven't been here for a long time.

479
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,020
Is the dress this girl is wearing

480
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,840
a new product of your shop?

481
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,840
Ms. Oshima, you are very sharp-eyed.

482
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,510
Yes.

483
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,719
This

484
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,320
is this year's new product in our shop.

485
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,639
Please.

486
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,030

487
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,480
come here.

488
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,110
Okay.

489
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,310
Let Ms. Oshima

490
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,600
appreciate it.

491
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,510
Ms. Oshima, nice to meet you.

492
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,810
Where did you get the money?

493
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,760
You said you're still in the probationary period, right?

494
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I sold four sets of clothes

495
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,020
for Mr. Yoshino today.

496
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,220
The old man was so happy

497
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,120
that he officially hired me.

498
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,450
He even advanced me half a month's salary.

499
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,920
I don't believe there is such a good thing.

500
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,940
Eat.

501
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,000
We haven't eaten properly for two days.

502
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,430
You are still inquisitive?

503
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,400
I promised your brother-in-law I will protect you.

504
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,190
I'm responsible for you.

505
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,230
That's right.

506
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,840
You are the one

507
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,440
sent by God to take care of me.

508
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,360
Eat,

00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,550
my savior.

510
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,280
Only by eating enough food

511
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,780
can you gain the strength to protect me.

512
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,450
Right?

513
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,000
You were hovering

outside Yoshino Fashion Shop.

00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,960
Do you think I didn't see you?

516
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,000
I need to see

517
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,980
if this business is reliable.

518
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,870
Also,

519
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,800
I need to know if the boss

520
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,130
is up to something else.

521
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,230
Promise me.

522
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Don't go there again.

523
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,450
Okay?

524
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,670
It...

525
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:39,890
makes me feel sorry.

526
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,280
Sorry?

527
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,060
I make you feel sorry?

528
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,110
You are knowledgeable.

529
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,590
You're ambitious and capable.

530
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,140
You can speak four foreign languages.

531
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,430
According to you,

532
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,840
compared to you, other Chinese people

533
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,980
are ignorant.

534
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,360
They need you to wake them up

535
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,490
and enlighten them.

536
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,120
Right?

537
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,030
That's true.

538
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,320
When we face a national crisis,

intellectuals

540
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,880
are the conscience of the nation.

541
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,070
So,

542
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,150
what you care about

543
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,360
is the people.

544
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,890
Don't be so jealous.

545
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,980
Don't care about

546
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,460
old men or young men.

547
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,560
What are these again?

548
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,440
Mr. Yoshino has started

549
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,670
to teach me how to cut.

550
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,360
He made this sample himself.

551
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,030
I brought it back to learn.

552
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,500
Tonight,

553
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,430
I need to make one identical to this.

554
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
The old man is keeping a close eye.

555
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,750
Each piece of clothes

556
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,850
has a different style.

557
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,830
The way of cutting needs to be different too.

558
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,980
It's not easy.

559
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,760
Don't listen to him.

560
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,280
Monkey see, monkey do. Right?

561
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,940
What's so difficult about it?

562
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,390
Come on. Let me take a look.

563
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,670
The collar and cuff

564
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,000
are a little different.

565
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,960
This is a geometric pattern.

566
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,030
Your ruler

567
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,160
might not be useful.

568
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,070
You

569
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:24,660
need to use chalk

570
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
to draw lines on it.

571
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,110
For this kind of special pattern,

572
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,840
you need a specific slide rule.

573
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,590
How about this?

574
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,250
I'll make one for you tonight.

575
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,500
That's right.

576
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,290
We have a doctor here.

577
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,860
Unfortunately, you're a chemistry doctor.

578
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,760
It's a piece of cake.

579
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,470
I'll teach you when I'm full.

580
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,530
You didn't sleep all night?

581
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,050
Don't touch it.

582
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,840
I've marked everything,

583
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,280
including the shoulders and waist.

584
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
If you mix them up, they won't match.

585
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,440
Good for you.

586
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,500
You've become a master

587
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,690
of cutting.

588
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,110
It's not hard.

589
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,190
To be honest,

590
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,110
I'm better at geometric arithmetic

591
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,890
than chemistry.

592
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,250
Boldness comes from mastery.

593
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,210
My goodness.

594
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,560
Have you been a tailor before?

595
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,700
Do you know why

596
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,000
I can master something

597
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,090
that I know nothing about so quickly?

598
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,190
Good question. Why?

599
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,960
I have love in my heart.

600
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,440
I'm not learning any skills.

601
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,840
I'm competing for the woman I love

602
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,030
with another man.

603
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,440
You're talking nonsense again.

604
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,700
I'm telling the truth.

605
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,590
A woman like you

606
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,930
should have a better future.

607
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:37,970
Otherwise,

608
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,610
it would be a pity.

609
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,380
Look carefully.

610
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,920
It's not hard.

611
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,790
I've drawn the lines for you.

612
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,360
Just follow the lines.

613
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,550
You're awesome.

614
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,610
You can sew clothes.

615
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
But men and women are incompatible.

616
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,030
I'm speechless.

617
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,660
You have so many theories.

618
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:45,510
Boss,

619
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,300
is this okay?

620
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,360
Incredible.

621
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,420
It's only been a few days.

622
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,590
You're a genius.

623
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,930
You gave me a chance.

624
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,150
I spent the whole night making it.

625
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,910
At this rate,

626
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,760
within less than half a month,

627
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,840
you can complete tasks independently.

628
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,280
Everyone, listen.

629
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,950
See?

630
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,710
Your wages

631
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,780
are much higher than Shuhong's.

632
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:21,140
But look at what she made.

633
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,510
She's still a beginner.

634
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,760
Look at her craftsmanship.

635
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,440
Everyone,

636
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
work harder.

637
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,700
You kept asking me for a pay raise.

638
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,000
Stop doing that.

639
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Get back to work.
