00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,820
Exactly.

194
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,200
Kaizhi,

195
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,790
you're not acting like yourself.

196
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,790
You're that ambitious Yang Kaizhi!

197
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,180
Don't touch me.

198
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,440
Hey, Kaizhi,

199
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,750
I'm not

200
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,100
into lecturing anyone.

201
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,500
I'm neither good at it.

202
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,750
But let me ask you

203
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,280
one question, Yang Kaizhi.

204
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Why did you come to Tokyo?

205
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,110
To sympathize with other states?

206
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,360
Definitely not, right?

207
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,600
None of us aims for this.

208
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,120
Right?

209
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:17,840
Yes.

210
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
I know better than anyone

211
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,810
what kind of person you are, Yang Kaizhi.

212
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,670
We met for the first time

213
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,800
in Jingzhou, right?

214
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,630
How incredible you were

215
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,670
at that time!

216
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,460
How many great dreams

217
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,440
and ambitions were there

218
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,500
in your mind?

219
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,500
Ready to die for it anytime!

220
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,520
In my opinion,

221
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,970
you were like a hero in a chaotic time.

222
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,920
Am I right?

223
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,510
Regardless of your identity

224
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,440
and your belief,

225
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,490
I can still vividly recall

226
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,910
your stunning resolve

227
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,840
and patriotism.

228
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,480
Look at you.

229
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,370
Where's that resolve now?

230
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,130
Waning heroism?

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,780
No way!

232
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,870
You, Yang Kaizhi,

233
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,400
are not such a wimp, are you?

234
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,040
Indeed.

235
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,230
Are you praising me to put me on the spot?

236
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,910
No, I didn't

237
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,720
mean that.

238
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,240
I agree with your cousin.

239
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,950
Today's China

240
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,960
has completely lost

241
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,790
the power to exercise sovereignty.

242
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,190
Both Japan and Russia are

243
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,910
obviously fighting in full swing

244
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,440
in our Liaodong Peninsula.

245
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
What can the court do?

246
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,670
The court did nothing

247
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,660
and couldn't do anything.

248
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,550
A whole lot of things

249
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,550
are waiting for us
to go back to China to kick off.

250
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,080
Right?

251
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,910
Yes, that's right.

252
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,380
I'll give you that.

253
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,080
Tufang,

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
you didn't sound

255
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,630
like a military student just now.

256
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,960
You sounded like a future military leader

257
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,750
of the court!

258
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
Kaizhi!

259
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,550
We need to be all ears.

260
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,390
When this man

261
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,730
shows a stroke of genius,

262
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,380
it's a gain to listen to him.

263
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,550
This is the biggest support

264
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,790
for Tufang!

265
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,910
It'll be too late to hear him out

266
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,310
after he becomes a high-ranking official!

267
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,650
Don't talk nonsense. Renjun.
You're going too far.

268
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,950
Tufang, do you really

269
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,920
have this ambition?

270
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,670
Or is it for

271
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,670
the foundation of the Aisin Gioros?

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,870
Let me put it this way, Kaizhi.

273
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,870
I'm not sure where they'll assign me

274
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,200
after I go back to China,

275
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,030
but I know

276
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,660
what I should do.

277
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,300
Since you said so, Tufang,

278
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,760
we have no objections.

279
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,600
That's right! Just follow his lead now!

280
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,330
Nah, stop it.

281
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,920
You have to think it through

282
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,790
before making a decision.

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,710
Yes.

284
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,990
You have to think it through.

285
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,650
I have thought it over.

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,320
We should

287
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,270
stay grounded

288
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,530
to finish your studies

289
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,390
and get those military diplomas.

290
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
Then let's head home

291
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,910
to build the army and the national defense.

292
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,790
Based on that,

293
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,600
be it eliminating internal chaos

294
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,860
or fighting the enemy,

295
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,600
only we can make it.

296
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,550
None of those

297
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,880
talkative scholars can

298
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,630
replace us to achieve it.

299
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,600
That's right.

300
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Exactly.

301
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,970
Then it's a deal.

302
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,870
Let's grit our teeth.

303
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,440
When we return to China,

304
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,080
if I make any achievements,

305
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,470
your support is indispensable.

306
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,700
Let's fight together.

307
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,800
Fight together.

308
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,360
Lüshun Port

309
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,200
is one of the best military ports in Asia,

310
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,870
known as the Gibraltar in the East.

311
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,120
The port is surrounded by mountains on three sides.

312
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,910
On the mountain

313
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,750
are the fortresses and cannons

314
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,000
built by the Chinese long ago.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,210
After the Russians occupied the land,

316
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
they reinforced and modified

317
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,170
the fortifications.

318
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,830
It's now strongly fortified.

319
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,000
If the 3rd Corps of the Japanese Army

320
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,480
wants to take down Lüshun,

321
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,360
the key to victory is using cannons.

322
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,440
And it must be huge cannons.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It is said that the army has gathered

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,240
18 pieces
of 280mm coastal artillery in Osaka,

325
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,980
ready to be moved to Liaodong.

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,360
280mm?

327
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,480
They've really mobilized
the largest-caliber cannons

328
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,630
in the world?

329
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,120
Yes.

330
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,240
It's said that to move them,

331
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,870
special railway tracks have to be laid first.

332
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,440
Sir, I have something to report.

333
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,030
Come in.

334
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,130
I'm sorry

335
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,410
for the interruption.

336
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,670
I heard from Yoshiko that

337
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,870
Duke Ayakura

338
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,030
informed you of the situation

339
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,910
on the front line a few days ago.

340
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,110
I'm not here to discuss the war with you.

341
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,530
This is beyond the capability

342
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,880
of an overseas student.

343
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Sounds like you're...

344
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,210
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

345
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,250
It's a personal request.

346
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,670
What is it?

347
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,080
My classmate, Yang Kaizhi,

348
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,710
is very useful to me.

349
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,930
Liang Xiang,

350
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,120
I suggest you

351
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,600
leave him alone.

352
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,450
Neither of us can do anything about it.

353
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,960
Then who can?

354
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,610
Last time,

355
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,620
it was not the Tokyo police
interfering with it.

356
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,650
Who was it then?

357
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,720
It concerns the safety of Japan.

358
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,650
Who do you think

359
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
it could be?

360
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,550
I see.

361
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,069
This Kaizhi

362
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,960
seems to be

363
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,310
on close terms with people

364
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
exiled in Tokyo.

365
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,810
I have no idea about it.

366
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,250
I advise you

367
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,920
to stop defending him.

368
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,340
If you don't help me,

369
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,110
I'll go turn to Duke Ayakura.

370
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,550
I'll tell him that

371
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
if this person

372
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,400
is got rid of

373
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,660
by your secret police,

374
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,210
it will be a disgrace to Japan.

375
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,340
Fine.

376
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,310
You already

377
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
sound like

378
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
a military leader.

379
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay.

380
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,610
I'll ask my acquaintances to help you.

381
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,510
But I have to remind you.

382
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,510
Be careful when you

383
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,740
use this person.

384
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,070
Qianli.

385
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,270
Have you received

386
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,640
the monthly information funds

387
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,710
from Shanghai Circuit?

388
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,360
Yes.

389
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,270
Satisfied?

390
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,790
But

391
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,550
we are not satisfied

392
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,720
with your information quality.

393
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,720
What do you mean?

394
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,350
Did you misreport or miss anything?

395
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,660
For example, Yang Kaizhi.

396
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,920
In your information,

397
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,510
he seems very low-profile.

398
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,840
Lord Meng,

399
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,830
I, Li Renjun,

400
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,590
I'm an honest and candid man.

401
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,720
I can't make up stories, right?

402
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,840
That's not what I meant.

403
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,030
Then what do you mean?

404
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,440
Honestly,

405
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,750
I don't need this money so badly.

406
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,240
This monthly pay

407
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
is like a pain in the neck.

408
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,070
I want to quit.

409
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,110
Qianli,

410
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,720
don't worry too much about it.

411
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,350
Because this is

412
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,350
only between you and me.

413
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,500
Of course I'm worried.

414
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,350
According to

415
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,110
your Shanghai Circuit's intel standard,

416
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,840
almost all the Chinese in Japan

417
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,200
will be on the list.

418
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,610
How about this?

419
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,350
We won't bother you

420
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,280
for normal intelligence anymore.

421
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,720
From now on,

422
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,600
you're only in charge of special information.

423
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,180
What new tricks are you playing?

424
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,350
In Tokyo,

425
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,510
we think we have sensed danger.

426
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,410
We heard something about a secret

427
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,030
underground weapon transportation channel.

428
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,880
We want to know

429
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,680
which group of rebels

430
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,380
is controlling it.

431
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,510
And we're more curious

432
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,330
about how they deliver

433
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,500
these weapons and ammo

434
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,350
from Tokyo to Shanghai.

435
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,070
What happened? Let's go take a look.

436
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,200
Lord Meng,

437
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,940
now you've seen it with your own eyes.

438
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,630
This is Tokyo.

439
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,010
If all these people outside

440
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,230
are on your list,

441
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm afraid you can't handle them all.

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,280
So, you'd better keep

443
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,590
the next month's salary for yourself.

444
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,110
It's not something for me.

445
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,110
I can't accept it.

446
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,960
Qianli.

447
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,000
Qianli!

448
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,520
Why are you here?

449
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,570
The store is running well.

450
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,200
You're really something.

451
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,260
Last time I saw you,

452
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,510
you were selling flowers in Osaka.

453
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,640
You should thank me.

454
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,970
So what brings you here?

455
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:57,890
Someone asked me to help

456
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,090
check a batch of guns.

457
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm here to inform you

458
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,380
of the delivery location.

459
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,350
What is this?

460
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,470
This is proof of receipt.

461
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,030
Take this and get on board

462
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,110
to find the second mate,

463
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,240
that Irishman.

464
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,230
What's an Irishman like?

465
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,000
Blonde-haired,

466
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,200
blue-eyed,

467
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,240
with a beard,

468
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,960
a full beard.

469
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,510
Then can he understand what I'm saying?

470
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,370
No, I'm afraid.

471
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,540
He speaks English.

472
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,590
But you have this.

473
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,390
Show him this,

474
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,850
and he'll understand.

475
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,880
I see.

476
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,910
It's an American vessel,

477
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,330
the Princess Margaret,

478
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,400
docked at Pier 3, Port of Tokyo.

479
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,990
Remember, the goods are packed in batches.

480
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,310
Five guns per box. Three boxes in total.

481
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,350
From Yokohama.

482
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Only 15?

483
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,610
Shouldn't it be 300?

484
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,240
You think it's like transporting cabbage?

485
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,000
Split them up

486
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,500
and deliver like this.

487
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,890
That's the safest.

488
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,920
Then I can only split up

489
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,340
the payment as well.

490
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
No way.

491
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,000
We've made a deal

492
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,350
to pay it all at once.

493
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,400
Can you guarantee

494
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,510
I can receive all the goods after paying?

495
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,840
Don't worry about that.

496
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,330
There's a bank guarantee.

497
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,750
Bank?

498
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,100
You don't know?

499
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,430
Your payment

500
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,400
is transferred

501
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
from the Tokyo Citibank.

502
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,750
That's it.

503
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,050
You pick up the goods on board at 7 p.m.

504
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,550
Upon receipt of your goods,

505
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,960
I'll come to help you check them.

506
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,440
Bye.

507
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,830
Bank?

508
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,440
Banks are also in charge of this business?

509
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,620
[Pier 3, Port of Tokyo]

510
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,910
Zunian, you stay here with the car.

511
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,840
Linjiang,

512
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,040
come with me
to pick up the goods by boat.

513
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,410
Okay.

514
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,140
Row the boat.

515
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,710
Who's there? What are you here for?

516
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,910
Row the boat over here!

517
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:38,900
Come here!

518
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,000
Darn it.

519
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,660
Shoot!

520
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,570
Carry them upstairs!

521
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:15,830
Deliver three boxes

522
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,880
to this address overnight.

523
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,240
Okay.

524
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,160
Okay, let's go.

525
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,830
This shot hit hard.

526
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
My legs are still

527
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,720
totally numb now.

528
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,380
I-I can't move them even a bit.

529
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,270
What now?

530
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,120
We can't go to the hospital.

531
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,850
Go get

532
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,000
Zhu Shuwen over here.

533
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
He's a medical student.

534
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,930
Who can we reach out to at this hour?

535
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,540
Hang in there until daybreak.

536
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,160
After this incident,

537
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,730
we won't be able to
get the other guns for sure.

538
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,110
The seller will no longer send goods.

539
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,910
No more goods?

540
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,350
This is the contract term.

541
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,750
I can do nothing about it.

542
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,040
But we've paid the money.

543
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,830
The money is deposited in the bank

544
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,920
under your name,

545
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,700
but you can't withdraw it.

546
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,280
It's a big loss this time.

547
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:18,750
Yeah,

548
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,510
I guess we can't afford it

549
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,960
even if we sell this house.

550
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
We can't change the fact.

551
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,970
Don't worry,

552
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,890
I'll work out a way.

553
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,790
Y-You work out a way?

554
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,400
How?

555
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,210
It's over 5,000 dollars!

556
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,770
You work out a way...

557
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,400
Stop thinking about it!

558
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,330
Just focus on recovery.

559
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,000
Leave the rest to me.

560
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,640
Kaizhi.

561
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,210
You asked for leave again.

562
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,570
What's wrong?

563
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,480
Didn't you

564
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,740
just come back as well?

565
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,280
It's a real mess outside!

566
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,590
I've just been to Pier 3 to send

567
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,480
a fellow villager off.

568
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,800
Something happened
to the Princess Margaret,

569
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,400
you know?

570
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
The Princess Margaret? Really?

571
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,750
What happened?

572
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,040
Don't you think it was too crazy?

573

00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,880
is a large chunk of money.

765
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,510
You look great.

766
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,480
I guess that my schoolmates
are doing well too.

767
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,030
Principal, everything is done.

768
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,550
She is my student.

769
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,590
Nice to meet you.

770
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,920
Then I'll take my leave, Miss Yunhong.

771
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,140
You can come visit the school
whenever you're free.

772
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,400
See you.
