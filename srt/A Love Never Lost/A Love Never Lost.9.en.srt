Someone told me to come to the kendo hall.

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,190
It was me.

A little.

31
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,060
Is this a physical education

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,140
or a military affairs course?

33
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,110
It's ethical training

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,320
Sounds interesting.

36
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,680
I think so too.

37
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,630
Traditional Chinese soldiers

38
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,390
have neither an exaggerated masculine personality

39
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,580
nor the common practice of duels.

40
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,800
They only persuade.

41
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
They use Confucianism

42
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,860
to persuade soldiers with morality,

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,950
so

44
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,750
the most ideal pursuit of Chinese soldiers

45
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,409
is a Confucian general.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,200
That's true.

47
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,560
Listen to me. Throw it away.

Not only did he behead Tang Caichang and the others,

125

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,070
can't risk death,

197
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,230
then it can't seek survival.

198
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,130
If you wish to survive,

199
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,660
you must first dare to die.

200
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,440
The nation must dare to die!

201
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,030
You must become

202
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,790
a conscious civilian force

203
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,200
under the current conditions

204
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,240
of the world.

205
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Without this kind

206
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,500
of civilian force,

207
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,150
a thriving people's revolution

208
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,080
would be impossible.

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,960
Yes!

210
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,510
Well said, right?

211
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,870
Great.

212
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:34,830
Where'd he go?

213
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,120
Who was that?

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,570
That's Liang Xiang.

215
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,920
He's the member of the imperial family,

216
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,380
the descendant of Dorgon?

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,730
Liang Xiang.

218
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,320
Liang Xiang!

219
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,360
You're no fun.

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,970
Liang Xiang.

221
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,250
This is outrageous!

222
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,260
They are discussing academics.

223
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,570
This is outrageous!

224
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,870
I only saw a bunch of troublemakers.

225
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't see the Korean lady

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
you mentioned.

227
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,340
I didn't lie.

228
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,030
The Korean lady

229
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,360
doesn't live at school.

230
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,000
She usually comes a little late.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
Forget that Korean lady.

232
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,510
Keep her for yourself.

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Where is that young man from the imperial clan?

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,840
Sir,

235
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,630
I'm afraid

236
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,970
he doesn't like revolutionary propaganda.

237
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,870
That means

238
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,750
that he was swayed.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Forget it.

240
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,770
Having a student like me

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,900
is enough.

242
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,750
No.

243
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,400
You should

244
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,810
continue to work on him.

245
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,420
He just dislikes it. Don't be scared.

246
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,600
In the late years of Wang Mang,

247
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,960
the villagers all hid away

248
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,870
when they saw the rebels.

249
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,360
Why?

250
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,910
Because they didn't trust the rebels.

251
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,720
Then what happened? Liu Xiu also rebelled.

252
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,600
Liu Xiu was a noble.

253
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,320
When he stood there

254
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,580
in his noble clothing,

255
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,810
the villagers became at ease.

256
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,750
They sighed and said,

257
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,240
"Look, even at that rich Liu Xiu

258
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
has spoken up.

259
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,120
It seems reliable."

260
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,410
You need to understand

261
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,080
that being able to promote

262
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,810
that an imperial youth has joined the revolution

263
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,840
will be very valuable.

264
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Brother!

265
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,670
Brother.

266
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,960
Where have you been?

267
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,630
I made a little mistake.

268
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,690
[Lee Joohee, Daughter of Wealthy Korean Businessman]

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,150
I forgot to wind the clock yesterday.

270
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,720
Who told you to wear a dress?

271
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,480
You asked me

272
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,240
to dress up.

273
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,910
Even so,

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,360
I didn't ask you to wear rouge.

275
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,840
Don't you think I'm pretty?

276
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,290
I do.

277
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,130
I do.

278
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,080
Not at all.

279
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,610
You don't look like a rich lady at all.

280
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,800
What are you talking about?

281
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,970
Let’s go.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,120
Mr. Cheng Zhaofang

283
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,960
wants to discuss something with me.

284
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,750
Come with me.

285
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,370
Let's go.

286
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,790
When Kaizhi comes,

287
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,320
we must tell him about this.

288
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,700
Kaizhi is here.

289
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,320
Kaizhi,

290
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,980
have a seat.

291
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,870
Kaizhi,

292
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,600
I saw Liang Xiang

293
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,630
get taken away

294
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,000
by the duke's carriage earlier.

295
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,510
Why is the Japanese duke

296
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,870
acting so intimate

297
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,750
with the Qing dynasty's imperial clan?

298
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,440
Could it be

299
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,750
that they really want to help the Qing dynasty?

300
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,430
I think they have an ulterior motive.

301
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,320
Our teacher was right.

302
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,870
Kaizhi,

303
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,870
you have to persuade him

304
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,800
to take the side of the revolution.

305
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,480
Just now,

306
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,720
I heard from the comrades of the Inspirational Committee

307
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
that they believe

308
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,000
the Japanese want to groom

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,260
the Qing imperial clan for their own use.

310
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,410
If people like Liang Xiang

311
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,150
really become

312
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,670
important officials of the Qing dynasty,

313
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,280
then China

314
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,150
would have to submit

315
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,160
to Japan, right?

316
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,150
That can't happen.

317
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,150
That can't do.

318
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,200
If that's the case,

319
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,670
then we must expose

320
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,630
the hypocritical masks of the Japanese.

321
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,030
Yes.

322
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,390
It's not just Liang Xiang.

323
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,200
We need more Chinese students

324
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,080
studying in Japan

325
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
to know the wild ambitions

326
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,960
of the Japanese.

327
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,550
Yes, we need to let everyone know.

328
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,870
Yes.

329
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:39,750
So,

330
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,600
we must have a voice.

331
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,150
I suggest

332
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,490
the student council

333
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,560
to create a revolutionary journal

334
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,110
to clarify our principles,

335
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,390
manifest our revolution,

336
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,720
and unify our ideology.

337
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,000
Kaizhi's suggestion is good.

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,550
I can mobilize

339
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,840
the classmates in my dormitory.

340
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
They have been eager to join.

341
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
My dormitory can do it too.

342
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,840
-Mine too.
-Mine too.

343
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,300
The Army Academy is full of government-sponsored students,

344
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,480
so it's difficult for me.

345
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,000
You must personally participate

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,510
in soliciting submissions, typesetting, and printing.

347
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,000
If we don't have enough funds,

348
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,750
I can pay for the first edition

349
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
and we can figure out the rest later.

350
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,750
Kaizhi, don't worry.

351
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,790
Leave it to us.

352
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,790
Leave it to us.

353
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,790
Don't worry, Kaizhi.

354
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,240
Everything is hard to begin.

355
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,030
Our mission

356
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,440
is to have a good start

357
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,480
for our journal.

358
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,109
Great!

359
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,839
Let's do it.

360
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,310
Please say something.

361
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,090
Is it okay or not?

362
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,430
How can a mere courtyard scene

363
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,440
look so magnificent?

364
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,400
I fear no one can do this,

365
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,680
except Cai Guangqi.

366
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,010
You like it?

367
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,860
The buyer has good taste.

368
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,040
Mr. Cai said the same thing.

369
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,640
Mr. Cai...

370
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,510
Mr. Cai should thank him.

371
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,920
In the past, he could only paint this kind of small artwork.

372
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,830
Mr. Kanyama,

373
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,760
you praised the painter

374
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,270
and praised the customer.

375
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,520
Why don't you praise me

376
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,790
for connecting the two, like a needle guiding thread?

377
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,750
Do you want to get a raise again?

378
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,480
I should get one when necessary.

379
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,590
The needle went through,

380
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,920
but there's still some thread that can't.

381
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,270
Let me think about it.

382
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,140
Welcome.

383
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,030
This way.

384
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,960
Look.

385
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,030
It was painted

386
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,120
entirely according to your request.

387
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,470
What an amazing painting!

388
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,570
You're the one buying the painting?

389
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,420
You're the one selling the painting?

390
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,200
You know each other?

391
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Not really.

392
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,670
This is the painting, right?

393
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:57,960
Deal.

394
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,480
I'll take it.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,060
I'll buy it.

396
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,400
It is

397
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,920
1,700 yen, right?

398
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,870
Yes, 1,700.

399
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,680
Thank you.

400
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,920
Thank you.

401
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,670
Shuhong,

402
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,790
help the customer pack the painting.

403
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,240
Yes.

404
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,620
Hey, Japanese nobleman,

405
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,640
you should take a good look.

406
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,420
It's so precious.

407
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,470
You can't buy it casually

408
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,060
like it's a chamber pot.

409
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,900
How else should I look at it?

410
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,430
It looks

411
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,050
exactly like how I imagined.

412
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,510
Forget it.

413
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,350
You Bannermen

414
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,400
are used to being wasteful.

415
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,200
You spend money like it's paper.

416
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,510
Who is she to you?

417
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,210
How can she speak like this?

418
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,310
That's how pretty girls talk.

419
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,980
If she talks like this,

420
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,110
I won't buy it.

421
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,510
Good.

422
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,290
It'll be ruined if you buy it.

423
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:56,830
Fine.

424
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,570
I won't buy this painting.

425
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,300
What's going on?

426
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,790
The money knows its owner.

427
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,720
It hopped into my pocket

428
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,050
and refuses to come out.

429
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,400
Shuhong, hurry and pack the painting.

430
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,110
Oh, right.

431
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,720
Your carriage didn't come today?

432
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,350
Lad,

433
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,550
call a carriage.

434
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,140
He can't walk with such a large painting.

435
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,750
Yes.

436
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,100
Excuse me.

437
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,640
You're so arrogant.

438
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,100
You want me to lose my job?

439
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,730
No,

440
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,670
are you really working here?

441
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,070
So what?

442
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,570
That's better than you, a Japanese royalty.

443
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,240
Honestly,

444
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:46,960
if you didn't come

445
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,310
in a carriage like that,

446
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,090
you could've saved at least half the money for the painting.

447
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,960
You fool.

448
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,790
Do the Japanese

449
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,090
even dare to scam the royal family?

450
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,880
Not really.

451
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,310
Mr. Kanyama specifically said

452
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,300
that this painting was ordered by the Japanese royal family.

453
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,120
Mr. Cai

454
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,960
put in all the effort

455
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,790
he had.

456
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,310
He spent half a month on just the composition.

457
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,570
He worked really hard.

458
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,570
The Heavenly Emperor.

459
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
The Japanese still believe in the heavens.

460
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,440
If they didn't,

461
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,060
the world would be in chaos.

462
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,440
You mean

463
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,070
China doesn't believe in the heavens anymore,

464
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,510
so that's why the world is in chaos?

465
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,510
Do you believe in it?

466
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,200
Me?

467
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,790
What do you think?

468
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,390
Judging from

469
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,790
your attitude towards me,

470
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,390
I bet you don't believe in it.

471
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,840
Since you've paid for the painting,

472
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,840
you and I are done.

473
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,030
Liang Xiang,

474
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,450
let me help you pack the painting.

475
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,970
I can't believe you still remember my name.

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,120
Now I'll never forget it.

477
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,880
You're my big client.

478
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,150
If you want to buy paintings in the future, come to me directly.

479
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,740
I'll give you a discount

480
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,600
since your mom is so nice.

481
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,960
You got paid?

482
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,230
Yes.

483
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,760
The big painting was sold.

484
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,630
Do you know who bought it?

485
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,680
You'd never guess.

486
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,090
That Bannerman across the street.

487
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,350
The military student across the street?

488
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,570
Where did he get so much money?

489
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
Didn't you say it was the Japanese royal family?

490
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,010
He just rode someone else's carriage.

491
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,550
It's also amazing to be able to ride the carriage.

492
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,680
How so?

493
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,410
He's just a fool

494
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,830
looking for a place to spend his money.

495
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,840
You were at home but didn't boil the water?

496
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,300
You just wait for me to come back to serve you?

497
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,270
Shuhong,

498
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,320
invite him over some time.

499
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,880
Who?

500
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
The military student across the street.

501
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,840
What,

502
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,740
you want to rob him because he's rich?

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,510
I've discussed it with Tianxiang.

504
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,880
We want to make all Japanese military students

505
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,440
stand on the revolution's side.

506
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,030
Why can't you accept anything nice?

507
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,510
You just want to

508
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,110
put everything in your pocket.

509
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,510
Our political strategy

510
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,440
is to have a central revolution

511
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,030
and seize key locations.

512
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,410
Both of these

513
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,110
two methods

514
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,110
need new military affairs talents.

515
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,240
Find a chance to invite him over.

516
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,790
I'll work on him.

517
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,700
Father will be happy

518
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,450
when he returns later.

519
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,530
Lieutenant Hirata

520
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,420
is an excellent officer.

521
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,680
Why are you suddenly mentioning him?

522
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,680
He told me about you.

523
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,730
He's crazy.

524
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,270
Why is he doing this?

525
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,720
What? You...

526
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,090
He's pursuing me,

527
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,160
but I haven't decided yet.

528
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,180
He can't spread the news

529
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,380
all over the world.

530
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,550
He didn't mean that, really.

531
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
Why are you afraid of him?

532
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm not afraid of him.

533
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,790
He is my drillmaster.

534
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,000
I have to respect him.

535
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,400
Don't tell him

536
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,480
I mentioned it to you.

537
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,790
You are

538
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,520
such a gentleman.

539
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,000
No.

540
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,790
That's a very high praise.

541
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,170
The word "gentleman"

542
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,410
in Chinese basically means...

543
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,200
A gentleman is magnanimous;

544
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,920
a despicable man is petty.

545
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,490
A gentleman pursues righteousness;

546
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,680
a despicable man pursues interests.

547
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,350
A gentleman does not take others' honor as their own,

548
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,310
right?

549
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,030
Are you learning Chinese?

550
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,960
My father loves Chinese culture.

551
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,820
As his daughter,

552
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm also influenced.

553
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,720
Miss Yoshiko,

554
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,120
I have something

555
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,960
at the academy, so I need to go back.

556
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,490
Why are you leaving so soon?

557
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,170
Mom, Liang Xiang—

558
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,880
Please help me tell her

559
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,970
that I really have something urgent.

560
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,550
Bastard!

561
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,090
He left?

562
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,380
Mom,

563
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,770
did you know?

564
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,750
Ichiro from the Hirata family

565
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,590
actually told Liang Xiang

566
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,830
that I'm his fiancée.

567
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,410
Yoshiko,

568
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,440
don't you dislike

569
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,680
his braid?

570
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:33,070
Yes,

571
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,550
I don't like it.

572
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,830
I hate it.

573
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,510
Why must a man make himself

574
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,510
look like a woman?

575
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,110
Mom,

576
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,790
he's really

577
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,640
a little too feminine.

578
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,540
Don't you think

579
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,370
this painting is also very feminine?

580
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,270
Drillmaster Hirata.

581
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,960
What is it?

582
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,630
I have a question.

583
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,320
Say it.

584
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,640
We are all cadets.

585
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:24,880
Why do Japanese students

586
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,270
get to learn the Maxim gun,

587
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,160
while the Chinese students

588
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,270
are only taught the single-shot rifle?

589
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,310
In addition, for positional defense,

590
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,660
why are Japanese students

591
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,910
not only taught trench building,

592
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,150
but also the use of mines,

593
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,920
while the Chinese students

594
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,270
are only taught trench building?

595
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,350
Any other questions?

596
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:36,790
Of course.

597
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,680
For example, Chinese students

598
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,590
are only taught cavalry

599
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,350
but not the defense

600
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,210
of infantry against the cavalry.

601
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,510
Cadet Liang Xiang.

602
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:43,990
Yes!

603
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,070
I think my future father-in-law

604
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,310
already told you

605
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,350
that the Japanese army

606
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
doesn't give explanations.

607
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,070
But your future father-in-law's daughter said

608
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,070
she hasn't decided to marry you yet.

609
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,640
Cadet Liang Xiang.

610
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,400
Yes!

611
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,480
Meet me at the kendo hall

612
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,550
in an hour.

613
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,750
Yes.

614
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
You've got guts.

615
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,000
What's going on?

616
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,510
Kendo club? Father-in-law?

617
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,840
He's probably going to teach you a lesson.

618
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,200
Oh my.

619
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,260
What did I just say?

620
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,200
Father-in-law.

621
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,630
You mentioned his father-in-law?

622
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,090
Who's his father-in-law?

623
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
I messed up.

624
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,350
Cadet Liang Xiang,

625
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,920
you know

626
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,510
if you want to wear a long kimono

627
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
tidily,

628
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,000
you must follow

629
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,950
the etiquette of wearing kimonos.

630
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,060
Are you listening?

631
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,310
But I think it's just a piece of cloth

632
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,310
with a hole in the middle for my head.

633
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,340
I don't want today's lesson

634
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,010
to turn into a private duel.

635
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,400
Whatever.

636
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,160
You are the teacher.

637
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,510
It's not easy to be a teacher.

638
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,310
First, I have to defeat the students

639
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,440
so

640
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,920
they'll feel a bit of humility.

641
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,590
If you can't do it, put down your pride.

642
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,520
There's no point in acting strong.

643
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,160
Take this.

644
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,390
Not bad. You've grown stronger.

645
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,440
If you allow me to break the rules,

646
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,150
I can do better.

647
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,510
I promise you,

648
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,920
you can use

649
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,790
any method to win.

650
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,030
In that case,

651
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,160
please forgive me for being disrespectful.

652
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,790
Take this!

653
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,850
See?

654
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,480
Your life

655
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,920
is in my grasp

656
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,020
and under my control now.

657
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,190
That's right.

658
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,510
You're very straightforward.

659
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:57,030
Do we need to hide anything from each other?

660
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,140
Just be straightforward.

661
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,680
Liang Xiang,

662
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,970
let me give you advice.

663
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,740
Don't complain.

664
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,160
Complaints are only for the weak,

665
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
while the rules of this world

666
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,160
are decided by the strong.

667
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,550
No strong person

668
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,970
would teach others

669
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,400
all their ways of success.

670
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,170
The Japanese army

671
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,450
is not that immature.

672
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,620
Do you understand?

673
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,670
Well said.

674
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,160
Very well said.

675
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,070
Do you understand what I said?

676
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,640
Even if I don't know

677
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,170
what you're talking about,

678
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,200
I know you said it well.

679
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
You're the teacher, after all.

680
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,130
Pick up your sword

681
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,440
and hold it tightly.

682
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,550
In the future, learn to speak with it.

683
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,030
Japanese samurai swords

684
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,700
are not for decoration.

685
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,310
It'll be unsheathed sooner or later.

686
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,680
Do you think Tufang will get hurt

687
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,720
by them dueling like this?

688
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,170
No.

689
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,220
Of course not.

690
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,409
Tufang is back.

691
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,670
How was it?

692
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,630
Is everything okay?

693
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,150
Yeah.

694
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Did the school reply?

695
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,290
Yes.

696
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,110
They shouldn't discriminate in their teaching.

697
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,670
How about

698
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,550
we talk to Principal Takagi?

699
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,440
Yes.

700
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,850
Why isn't he saying anything?

701
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,110
Tufang,

702
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,000
say something.

703
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,570
Did they not agree?

704
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,400
Come here. Move.

705
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,739
What's wrong?

706
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Say something.

707
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,880
Get up and drink some water.

708
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,340
Come on.

709
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,000
How are things?

710
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,910
I don't know how things should be,

711
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,930
but I know it can't be like that.

712
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,950
What?

713
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,490
Like how?

714
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,620
Making petitions and boycotting class

715
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,960
might work

716
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,000
at the Tokyo Imperial University,

717
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,200
but in the army academy,

718
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,200
it'll never work.

719
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,010
If we don't do this,

720
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,020
are there any other ways?

721
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,190
If he doesn't want to teach,

722
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,990
it's useless even if he teaches.

723
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,430
There is only one way.

724
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,550
You have to learn

725
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,570
what he is willing to teach

726
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,730
and learn it better than his Japanese students.

727
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,080
Just you wait.

728
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,150
A samurai's sword

729
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,670
will be unsheathed sooner or later.

730
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,570
What are you waiting for?

731
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,900
Go back and study.

732
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:02,920
Yes,

733
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,050
go back to your room.

734
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,150
Go back to your own rooms.

735
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,630
Let's go.

736
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,240
How is it?

737
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,390
It's so delicious.

738
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,320
Eat more if you like it.

739
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,070
Anyway, my son

740
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,030
won't come back today.

741
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,480
These dishes won't taste like this

742
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,810
as leftovers tomorrow.

743
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
Eat up.

744
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,010
Try this.

745
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,410
Here, try it.

746
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,160
Hold it with your hands.

747
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,190
I haven't had

748
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,590
such delicious Chinese food in a long time.

749
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Your son

750
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,960
is so lucky to have you

751
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,070
as his mother.

752
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,820
It's hard to raise a child.

753
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,760
You face so many problems

754
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,480
raising them to adulthood.

755
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,440
Dear,

756
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,400
I forgot to ask.

757
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,330
Where are you from?

758
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,230
I'm from Anqing.

759
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,550
Anqing?

760
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,690
Isn't that downstream from us?

761
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,510
What do your parents do?

762
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,440
My family runs a brush and ink shop.

763
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,300
We make brushes

764
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,480
with wolf hair and sheep hair.

765
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,630
We sell some ink,

766
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,360
inkstones,

767
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,320
and paper.

768
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,070
In other words,

769
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,510
things related to calligraphy and painting.

770
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,710
A family of scholars.

771
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,320
How come you came here?

772
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,070
Madam Liang,

773
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,880
some things are better left unsaid.

774
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,110
It's hard to explain.

775
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,760
If it's hard, you don't have to explain.

776
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,000
That Mr. Wu

777
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,600
seems to have a special relationship with you.

778
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,280
I won't trouble you.

779
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,810
If it's hard, you don't have to explain.

780
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,340
Let's talk about things that can be explained clearly.

781
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,490
But you're right.

782
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,960
My son grew up

783
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,360
in the Banner Battalion.

784
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,760
Who would've thought

785
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,670
that he'd come to Japan?

786
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,320
No one expected that.

787
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,370
Your son is different.

788
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,760
He was sent by the court to get trained.

789
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,300
He will be a general in the future.

790
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,820
What general?

791
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,180
It'll be a feat if he can support himself.

792
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:09,940
Madam Liang,

793
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,020
your food is so delicious.

794
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,140
It's so authentic.

795
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,480
You have the same taste

796
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,670
as my son.

797
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,510
He likes it too.

798
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,630
He craves it.

799
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,740
I finally get it now.

800
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,510
Every soldier

801
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,920
craves food.

802
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,450
As soon as he becomes a soldier,

803
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,030
he gets hungry whenever he's free.

804
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,160
He wants something delicious whenever he has time.

805
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,640
Really?

806
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,280
Yes.

807
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,510
The other day, my son told me

808
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,110
what he wanted to eat while training.

809
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,710
Do you know what it was?

810
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,150
What was it?

811
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,390
He wanted the apricots he ate as a child.

812
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,400
He thought of that kind of thing.

813
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,960
Apricots?

814
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,250
It sounded beautiful when they hawked it.

815
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,370
Fresh water and apricots.

816
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,480
Apricots that aren't sour and are sweet as honey.

817
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,310
Isn't it nice?

818
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,670
Shuhong.

819
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,760
Mr. Wu is calling you.

820
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Madam Liang, I...

821
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,690
Go ahead.

822
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,400
Honey,

823
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,340
take this over

824
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,710
to Mr. Wu.

825
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,040
Let him have a taste too.

826
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,440
This one.

827
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,520
Then just take the dumplings.

828
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:22,550
Okay.

829
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,650
Thank you, Madam Liang.

830
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:48,870
[Shanghai Qinghe Qinlou Villa]

831
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,070
Mr. Song!

832
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,070
Mr. Song!

833
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,360
Mr. Song.

834
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,760
Da Ren,

835
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,440
what's the emergency.

836
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,420
Take a look at this.

837
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,780
Isn't this just a 10-yuan banknote?

838
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,610
Mr. Song,

839
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,670
look again.

840
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,910
It has been confirmed

841
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,810
to be a counterfeit banknote.

842
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,030
Counterfeit?

843
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,710
This morning,

844
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,440
a clerk from Wansheng Bank

845
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,960
took 11 of these counterfeit notes

846
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,620
to cash them in at our counter.

847
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,880
Fortunately, it was

848
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,230
a senior employee who handled it.

849
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,400
He immediately thought something was wrong.

850
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,560
After verification,

851
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
it was indeed forged.

852
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,760
Really?

853
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,960
It looks so authentic.

854
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,380
This is not the worst part.

855
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,630
This happened in the morning

856
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,460
and by the afternoon, all banks in Shanghai

857
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,540
found out.

858
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,960
People are in chaos.

859
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,710
They brought in

860
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,630
all the banknotes

861
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,070
from the Imperial Bank of China

862
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,270
and demanded to cash them immediately.

863
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,810
The workers

864
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,150
can't catch their breaths.

865
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,680
They're still working now.

866
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,440
How could this happen?

867
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,920
Does Shorty Sheng know?

868
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,350
Chairman Sheng is away in Beijing.

869
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,890
He doesn't know about it yet,

870
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,690
which is why I'm here asking you.

871
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,510
Immediately send a telegram

872
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,910
and tell Sheng Xuanhuai.

873
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,800
This is a serious matter.

874
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,230
If we can't control it,

875
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,280
the consequences will be unimaginable.

876
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,680
I'll send a telegram now.

877
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,440
Baoquan.

878
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,230
Baoquan!

879
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,480
There's horrible news.

880
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,710
What is it?

881
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,800
I just came back from Yu Mansion.

882
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,710
You know what?

883
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,880
The Imperial Bank of China's banknotes

884
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,480
got forged.

885
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,630
Isn't it just 11 10-yuan notes?

886
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,760
No.

887
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,600
First, they found counterfeit 10-yuan notes.

888
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,850
Then at night,

889
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,160
they found counterfeit five-yuan notes too.

890
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,410
There are counterfeit five-yuan notes too?

891
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,190
That's why it's a big deal.

892
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,320
Ding, the Yu family's cook?

893
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,630
It's the one that made Huaiyang cuisine last time.

894
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:18,230
I know him.

895
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,810
Hurry and tell me.

896
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,550
Today,

897
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,890
Ding went to cash

898
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,780
a five-yuan note at the HSBC Bank.

899
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,110
Not only

900
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,600
did the bank employee not give him cash,

901
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,660
but he also tore the note up on the spot

902
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,400
and stamped on the word "counterfeit."

903
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,280
Ding insisted

904
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,410
that I show you this.

905
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,230
You are

906
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,150
the chairman of the Imperial Bank of China.

907
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,880
He asked you

908
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,320
to help him out.

909
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,920
This is big trouble.
