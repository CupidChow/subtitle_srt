1
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,650
I need to go to Ales Ross Pharmacy.

2
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,000
Why do you need to go to the pharmacy?

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,759
The concentration of the sulfuric acid is not high enough.

4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,840
In Shanghai,

5
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,039
only Ales Ross Pharmacy

6
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,300
has good strong acids.

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,150
Other pharmacies

8
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,160
only have ordinary sulfuric acid.

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,460
What are you doing?

10
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm buying dangerous chemicals.

11
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,080
If I don't dress myself up as a Japanese,

12
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,710
they might not sell it to me.

13
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,190
I know.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,630
This is racial discrimination, right?

15
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,130
You are well-learned.

16
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,420
In the Settlement,

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
Japanese are colonists.

18
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,910
Chinese

19
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,160
are slaves that are colonized.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
We are inferior.

21
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,240
How dare they!

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
You've understood.

23
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,710
You've understood now!

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,150
I underestimated you.

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Here, put this on.

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,290
Then they won't be suspicious.

27
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,590
Come with me.

28
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,470
We'll be a Japanese couple.

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,760
The chance of success will be greater.

30
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,870
Will...

31
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,079
Will this work?

32
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,690
We can only find out

33
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,150
if you dare try it.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,630
What is that?

35
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
What is this?

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,590
What is this?

37
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,870
What... How much is it?

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
No.

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,000
Understand?

40
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,640
Renjun, you're so rich.

41
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,600
Where did you get such a big yen?

42
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,240
Why does this money

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
look so familiar?

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't talk nonsense. You're familiar with it?

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Call out to it and see if it responds.

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,800
You got it from Meng right?

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,360
No, it's mine.

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,430
Renjun.

49
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,740
A gentleman loves money and takes the right way.

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,430
Stop keeping an eye on me.

51
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,360
You have no idea.

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,710
Yang Kaizhi is

53
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,310
the richest man in our house.

54
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,710
Two days ago,

55
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,590
he brought back a stack of yen.

56
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,440
It has to be at least 2,000 yuan.

57
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,630
Really?

58
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,240
Liang Xiang, don't be so jealous.

59
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,840
There's a road for everyone.

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,180
No matter how rich others are,

61
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,430
no one can compare to you.

62
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,000
You and His Highness are on the same boat.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,160
That's amazing.

64
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,310
Stop kidding.

65
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you think that's a good thing?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,530
His Highness is so worried.

67
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,160
I found that in Japanese,

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,600
there isn't this

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,630
important word.

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,750
What word?

71
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,750
Execute.

72
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,510
Execute?

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,630
In Chinese,

74
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,030
that sounds so powerful.

75
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,360
You can just shout ruthlessly,

76
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,610
"execute him!"

77
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,000
You can

78
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,750
sing it too,

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,190
"execute."

80
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,230
You can also call it out lightly,

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,020
"execute."

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,300
Or you can also say it in a mocking manner,

83
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,870
"execute me!"

84
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
Look at you.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,000
There are so many words in Chinese.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
Your favorite is just

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,920
"execute"?

88
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,630
I just want to know

89
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,480
if it's as varied

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,240
to say "execute" in Japanese.

91
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,360
In my opinion,

92
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,480
the most important word in Japanese

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
is, "I want it."

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
"I want it."

95
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,560
"I want it."

96
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,070
You pick one.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,190
It's obvious.

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
Look, we've memorized

99
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,720
so many Japanese words.

100
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,190
Eat, sleep,

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,310
clothes, water and toilet

102
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,630
They don't form a sentence.

103
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,360
But as long as we add "I want it,"

104
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,980
all of them are useful.

105
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,070
You're right.

106
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,070
I want water.

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,830
I want the toilet.

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,720
I want to eat.

109
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,630
It works.

110
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,830
I want a ride.

111
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,310
I want to

112
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
take a shower.

113
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,360
I want to...

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,870
go to a brothel!

115
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,310
What do you say going to a brothel in Japanese?

116
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,190
It's not in the booklet.

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,190
It's not here.

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,070
There are "man" and "woman" in it.

119
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,190
You just need to say

120
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,920
I want a woman.

121
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,120
If you say so,

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,390
they will understand

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
that you want a woman.

124
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,180
I... What was it again?

125
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,480
Good evening, Sir.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,310
Good evening, Sir.

127
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,310
Good evening, Madam.

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,870
How can I help you?

129
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,920
Do you know that?

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
My wife always complains to me

131
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,720
about that toilet has got a hole

132
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,480
and had to clean for so long.

133
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,310
Right, my darling?

134
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,800
Two toilets and one sink

135
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,310
also need cleaning.

136
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,320
What can I do for you?

137
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
Yes.

138
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I need...

139
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,720
2,000 ml of strong acid.

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,830
Really? So much?

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,310
You cannot use it all.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,430
No.

143
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,430
I said I need

144
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,000
2,000 ml.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,160
My wife is fond of cleanliness.

146
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,190
As you wish.

147
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
For the sake

148
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,190
this beautiful lady.

149
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,830
Normally we cannot sell too much strong acid.

150
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,600
Thanks.

151
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,390
Too much.

152
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,430
May I ask you something?

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,870
Madam, what is it?

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Do you have cockroaches at home?

156
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
How does your family deal with cockroaches?

157
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,000
Cockroach?

158
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,190
That's right.

159
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,040
Cockroaches are scary.

160
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
They come out at night

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
and are everywhere.

162
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
So scary...

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,120
I'm old.

165
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,070
I thought a lot of ways.

166
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,310
I can't deal with them.

167
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,120
Sorry.

168
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,040
Bye.

169
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,909
Is this beauty

170
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
mute?

171
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Mr. Wu,

172
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,150
why do you speak so many foreign languages?

173
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,390
And you're so brave.

174
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,320
You look so much like one.

175
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,550
Like what?

176
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
Like a rich Japanese.

177
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,870
You look like one too.

178
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,200
You look like a rich Japanese's

179
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,130
beautiful wife.

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,120
Unfortunately, I can't speak Japanese.

181
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I can teach you.

182
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
Really? Teach me now.

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,320
Listen carefully.

184
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,730
Mind my mouth and pronunciation.

185
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,910
You're great.

186
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,480
What does that mean?

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,730
In Chinese, it means

188
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,870
you're great, you're amazing.

189
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,240
You're great.

190
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,480
You're...

191
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,000
Great.

192
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
Great.

193
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,670
Yes.

194
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
Practice more.

195
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
You're great.

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,200
You're great.

197
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,630
You're great.

198
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,360
Well said.

199
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Remember,

200
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,480
you can only say this to me in the future.

201
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,140
Don't say this to anyone else.

202
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,840
You're great.

203
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,570
This is real high concentration sulfuric acid.

204
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,640
Shuhong, do you know

205
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
I, Wu Tianbai, will amaze everyone.

206
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,510
You're great.

207
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,670
You're great.

208
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,720
You're great.

209
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,080
Shuhong.

210
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,070
I'll shake up the whole China. Do you believe that?

211
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,910
I...

212
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,870
will shake up the whole China.

213
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,750
I want to take a ride.

214
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
How much?

215
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,790
How much?

216
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
How much?

217
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,440
Bye.

218
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,360
Liang Xiang.

219
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,270
Come here.

220
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,200
Liang Xiang.

221
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,960
The Vice President of Shanghai Business Association,

222
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,200
Song Baoquan,

223
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,080
has asked me to ask you for a favor.

224
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,030
Song Baoquan?

225
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,720
Yes.

226
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,550
I don't know him.

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
He's asking you for a favor.

228
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,550
If you do it,

229
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,960
you'll know each other.

230
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm just a mere military student.

231
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,630
What can I do for him?

232
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,720
I heard

233
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,730
you and His Highness are very close recently.

234
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,080
I...

235
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,000
Shanghai Business Association

236
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,840
is holding a dinner party.

237
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,750
They want to invite His Highness to the banquet.

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,080
Don't worry.

239
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,150
He just has to show up.

240
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,750
This...

241
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,860
This has nothing to do with me.

242
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,150
Help me pass the message.

243
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,280
Just ask His Highness to show up.

244
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,360
That's all.

245
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,670
Do you think...

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,870
You can do it?

247
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,510
Where have you been?

248
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,320
I went out for a walk. Can't I?

249
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,270
You're really planning on becoming a student here?

250
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,150
Your classroom is not filled anyway.

251
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,150
Do you think I really need your help?

252
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
Brother-in-law.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,630
Are you going to charge me tuition fee?

254
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,200
Don't say that.

255
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,080
Even if you spent money,

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,540
will you get to listen to such good lectures?

257
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,080
Can there be teachers of such good quality out there?

258
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,270
You're right.

259
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
Your teachers are all so good.

260
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Shuhong.

261
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,720
What now?

262
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,150
Three newly registered female students

263
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,510
are staying in the school with you.

264
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,110
They are already in the room.

265
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,960
Take care of them for me.

266
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,150
If you need anything for your daily life,

267
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,120
look for General Manager Xu.

268
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Got it.

269
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,440
You're back, Senior.

270
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,440
You're new here?

271
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,510
Yes.

272
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,720
We are

273
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,390
the new female volunteers.

274
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,320
Female volunteers?

275
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,510
What's that?

276
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,610
What are you doing?

277
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,630
This is the rule.

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,480
What rule?

279
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,390
On the first meeting of female volunteers,

280
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,480
we must match our secret code.

281
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,550
There's a secret code too?

282
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,720
You must be testing us.

283
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,600
Jingwen, let's show her.

284
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,120
Where do you come from?

285
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,000
From the east.

286
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,910
What did you bring?

287
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:08,910
Something from China.

288
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,790
What did you come for?

289
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,750
For the world.

290
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,790
Who are your friends?

291
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,050
Sun Wen, Huang Xing, and Tao Chengzhang.

292
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,080
Okay. Wait a minute.

293
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,890
Your Highness.

294
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,770
Why can't the imperial descendant

295
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,960
just focus

296
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,390
on his studies?

297
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,600
I understand.

298
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,750
I'll just send him back.

299
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,720
Wait.

300
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,750
Let him in.

301
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,110
I have something to tell him.

302
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,550
Yes.

303
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,860
Your Highness.

304
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,350
Don't mention that damned dinner to me.

305
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
I understand.

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Look at these sentences.

307
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,840
With 5,000 soldiers,

308
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,660
I fight 100,000 soldiers.

309
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,550
Use tired soldiers

310
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,840
as new horses.

311
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,120
I really like this line.

312
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,720
"Use tired soldiers

313
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
as new horses."

314
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,550
The words

315
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,600
express

316
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,060
our current state of mind.

317
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,960
For this trip to Germany,

318
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,200
I'm also

319
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
a new horse.

320
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,200
Since I was born,

321
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,530
I've never left Prince Chun's residence.

322
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,920
My brother

323
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,510
became the emperor.

324
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,000
Therefore,

325
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,920
since I was a child, I have to be careful about

326
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,880
my every word

327
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,480
and every move

328
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,720
I'm just like the goldfish in this jar.

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,130
I'm living within transparent walls,

330
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,700
for people to appreciate.

331
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,410
You probably don't understand it.

332
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,920
Even though you're a new horse too.

333
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,990
I understand what Your Highness means.

334
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,240
Don't call me Your Highness.

335
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,650
I can't stand people calling me that.

336
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,400
Look at this.

337
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,200
I wonder

338
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
what I did wrong.

339
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,030
Why is everyone

340
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,070
complimenting me

341
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,590
and praising me?

342
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
I am me.

343
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,550
My brother is my brother.

344
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,790
And that

345
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,110
darn business tycoon.

346
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,840
He actually spent so much money

347
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,960
for such an extravagant

348
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,890
welcome dinner.

349
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,130
Let him go ahead.

350
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,920
Don't tell him

351
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm not going.

352
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,890
Do you understand?

353
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,920
Let him spend

354
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,750
his own money.

355
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,830
Spend it all!

356
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,830
Understand?

357
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,070
Yes.

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,590
Really?

359
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,750
Great.

360
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,920
This royal family is actually

361
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,960
giving this honor to me.

362
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,680
That's great.

363
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,350
You'll be responsible for this.

364
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,750
Don't worry about money.

365
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,070
Got it.

366
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,830
I'll cover all expenses.

367
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,480
You just need to do this thing well

368
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
with dignity.

369
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,070
Invite everyone prominent

370
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,240
from both Chinese and western factions!

371
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,920
All right.

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a good thing.

373
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,970
Oh right.

374
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Don't invite them in my name.

375
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,830
Invite them in the name of Shanghai Circuit.

376
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,720
The safety will be

377
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,450
wholly executed by the Shanghai Police Station.

378
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,440
Brilliant.

379
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,830
That's brilliant.

380
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,790
We can't be the main characters.

381
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,180
The main character has to be the royalty.

382
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,280
Did you succeed?

383
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,590
This bomb

384
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,680
is more reliable than the batch

385
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,200
we created in Japan.

386
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,440
I added a safety device.

387
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
It's this safety pin.

388
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,110
Is it powerful enough?

389
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,920
With only one-fifth of the stuffing,

390
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,000
my lab can

391
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
be bombed through.

392
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,960
It's more than enough

393
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
to kill Prince Chun

394
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,380
who is visiting Shanghai.

395
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,490
What are you planning to do?

396
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,720
Shanghai Circuit

397
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,350
is welcoming Prince Chun

398
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,440
at Yipinxiang tonight.

399
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,240
I can disguise myself and sneak in.

400
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,790
But

401
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,960
I need another helper.

402
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,400
Otherwise, this won't

403
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,960
pass the security check.

404
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,770
Tell me, who do you need?

405
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,070
Your sister-in-law, Qiuhong.

406
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,920
Are you crazy?

407
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,690
Why are you getting her involved?

408
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,520
Just because she's your relative.

409
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,790
Your so-called rational revolution

410
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,110
can only sacrifice others' lives

411
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,440
and not your relatives?

412
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,070
No.

413
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,790
That's not what I meant.

414
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,960
Then what do you mean?

415
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
I know her.

416
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,790
She's just a girl

417
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,070
from a small town.

418
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
She knows nothing

419
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,110
and understands nothing.

420
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,590
Just because she knows

421
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,200
and understands nothing.

422
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,070
Innocence is her natural advantage.

423
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,080
She's not a member of the group.

424
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,060
In our revolution,

425
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,590
we don't include the lives of ordinary people.

426
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,720
Is she ordinary?

427
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,590
No, she's not.

428
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,880
In fact, i my opinion,

429
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,880
she's very talented.

430
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,480
I know her better than you do.

431
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,750
Not necessarily.

432
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,830
How about

433
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,590
you ask her

434
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,960
for her own opinion.

435
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,310
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

436
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,440
Hurry up. Quick.

437
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,920
Hello, Principal.

438
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,980
Hello, Principal.

439
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,880
Shuhong.

440
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,960
Come here.

441
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,000
What's wrong?

442
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,790
I don't know.

443
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,920
What's going on

444
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,450
between Wu Tianbai and you?

445
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,480
Answer me.

446
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,350
How dare you smile?

447
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,590
I thought of Mr. Cheng’s class.

448
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,310
He said

449
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,200
what's horrible about Chinese people is

450
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,720
all marriages are decided by one's father and brother,

451
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,070
Are there any couples

452
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,400
who married willingly?

453
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,120
What are you talking about?

454
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,330
Answer my question.

455
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,050
Stop talking nonsense.

456
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,200
Go ahead.

457
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,200
What did he do to you?

458
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,790
Who did what to me?

459
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,310
Are you two together?

460
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,590
You must be together.

461
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,320
I should have told you earlier.

462
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,050
What do you want to tell me?

463
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,460
He's someone who does whatever he wants.

464
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,200
You know?

465
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,310
And you're so young.

466
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,790
Brother-in-law.

467
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,050
How can you say that about your comrades?

468
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,550
A group is like a family, comrades are like siblings.

469
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,680
Need is the truth.

470
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,080
Action is theory; right?

471
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,310
Oh no.

472
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,070
Did Wu Tianbai

473
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,200
teach you that?

474
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
Isn't this a school?

475
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,240
Can what the teacher says be wrong?

476
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,960
Okay.

477
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,270
I'll get someone

478
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,720
to buy you a boat ticket now.

479
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,070
Go back to Anqing today.

480
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,530
No, I don't want to go back.

481
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,590
You must go back.

482
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,920
How did it go?

483
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,920
I knew she wouldn't listen to you.

484
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,510
Hurry up. Catch up.

485
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,750
Hello.

486
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,480
Hello.

487
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,110
Young Master.

488
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,880
Here, put it here.

489
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,410
Don't be so clumsy.

490
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,350
Wait for me outside.

491
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,140
What are you doing now?

492
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,110
These are just some food and things you can use.

493
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,480
They don't cost much.

494
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,680
This is a little something from me.

495
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,050
I can’t bring it with me.

496
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,370
The leader just said

497
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,110
tonight,

498
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,790
six military students will share one room.

499
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,920
Where do I put it?

500
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,720
If you can't bring it with you, distribute it among your classmates.

501
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,120
Young Master, you have a special identity.

502
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,640
I dare not do nothing,

503
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,480
I have to be courteous to you.

504
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,000
Nowadays,

505
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,880
many people

506
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,640
hate the court.

507
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,810
In the past they would respect you.

508
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,690
But I'm still respecting you now.

509
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
Empress Cixi

510
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
lost the Forbidden City.

511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,890
Now this country is not like a country nor like a home.

512
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,550
When you get to Japan,

513
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
they might beat you up. Who knows?

514
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,880
Listen to me.

515
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,920
Let's put down our pride

516
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,000
and get close to your classmates.

517
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,400
You're going so far away.

518
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,110
If not your classmates, who else can you rely on?

519
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,640
No matter how capable I am,

520
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,000
it won't be useful.

521
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,590
Good reminder.

522
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,240
Captain Zhu, you're here again.

523
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
Don't say that.

524
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
Do I dare not come?

525
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,270
Young Master is boarding the boat tonight.

526
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,110
No matter how busy I am, I have to come send him off.

527
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,240
Yes.

528
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Don't come again.

529
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,760
Do you hear me?

530
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,930
Don't come back again tonight.

531
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,070
See?

532
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,480
My Young Master is sensible.

533
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,670
Okay, I'll listen to you.

534
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,000
I won't see you off.

535
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,300
But you have to take care of him for me.

536
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,270
Captain Zhu, don't worry.

537
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,880
Young Master.

538
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,200
When you leave Shanghai,

539
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,720
I won't be able to take care of you.

540
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,590
You...

541
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,730
have to take care of yourself.

542
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,110
Take care.

543
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,640
Laixi, get up!

544
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you hear me?

545
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,000
Laixi. Do you hear me?

546
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,880
Get up, Laixi.

547
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm leaving.

548
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,350
I'm leaving.

549
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,270
Captain Zhu.

550
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,070
He's so loyal.

551
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,000
By the way, Liang Xiang,

552
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
have you sent the invitation

553
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
from the Circuit?

554
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,070
Yes.

555
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,270
It was delivered last night.

556
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,200
Great! Great!

557
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,730
That way, I can tell them I've done my part.

558
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,830
Liang Xiang.

559
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,960
You are really different

560
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,510
from other imperials.

561
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,360
How could you just leave?

562
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,680
You're just starting to

563
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
learn things from these classes.

564
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,520
It'll be in vain if you leave.

565
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,830
Why are you in a rush

566
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,960
to return to Anqing?

567
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Are you in a hurry to get married?

568
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,750
I heard from your brother-in-law

569
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,110
that your parents are marrying you off

570
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,240
to Song's first wife's family in Anqing.

571
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,110
Is that true?

572
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,240
Are you really willing to marry him?

573
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,590
Screw that Song's first wife's family.

574
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,960
If he wants to, then let him marry into them.

575
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,590
No.

576
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,720
What happened between you and Hanhua?

577
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,480
It's nothing, Ahyi.

578
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,880
I like this school

579
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,640
and there are good teachers.

580
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
But it's not suitable

581
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,440
for a student like me.

582
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,740
I'll be on my way, Ahyi.

583
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,960
Be good.

584
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,720
Shuhong.

585
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,970
I've called a ride for you.

586
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,350
It's downstairs.

587
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm doing this for your own good!

588
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
Are you ready?

589
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,510
We've rented a private carriage.

590
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,510
The drayman is one of us.

591
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,240
He'll come at night.

592
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,880
Tianbai.

593
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,480
Have you found the person you're looking for?

594
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,960
If this gets out,

595
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,090
we'll be in trouble.

596
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,750
We can't get close

597
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,880
nor stay far.

598
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,200
Who knows? They might sell you out.

599
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,480
Are you...

600
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,590
going alone?

601
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,000
See who it is.

602
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,720
Okay.

603
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,070
Does Mr. Cheng live here?

604
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,350
You are?

605
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,030
I have Mr. Cheng’s business card.

606
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,030
I want to pick up some books from him.

607
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,080
Mr. Cheng went back to Anhui a few days ago.

608
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,110
It's fine then. Thank you.

609
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,480
Shuhong!

610
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,110
Shuhong!

611
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,480
Wait for me!

612
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
Go! To the dock!

613
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,530
Don't stop! Go to the dock!

614
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,750
What are you doing?

615
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,110
I'm sorry.

616
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,840
I have something to do with her.

617
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,590
Give it back. No!

618
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,110
Come with me!

619
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,240
I won't!

620
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,240
I won't!

621
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,070
No!

622
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,110
Who is this?

623
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,240
I don't know.

624
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,830
If you leave today,

625
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,340
we'll never see each other again.

626
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,440
Your brother-in-law

627
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,370
misunderstood our relationship.

628
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,790
Shuhong,

629
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,550
no one can

630
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,720
explain love.

631
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,790
I'm like a mercury.

632
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,310
And you are born

633
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,010
a highly-concentrated acid.

634
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,200
Once these two substances

635
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,270
meet and mix,

636
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,000
an explosion is inevitable.

637
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,350
But this is also the most beautiful,

638
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,000
most gorgeous,

639
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,800
chemical reaction in the world.

640
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,960
It doesn't waver

641
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,400
for others.

642
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,610
As expected of a doctor in chemistry.

643
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,200
That is true.

644
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,310
You also taught

645
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,640
those girls' chemistry like this, right?

646
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,720
Not everyone

647
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,400
is as smart as you are.

648
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,080
They are not as stupid as me.

649
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,310
I'm not that casual

650
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,240
about relationships as you think.

651
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,550
Did I say you are?

652
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,400
Then why did you run away

653
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,310
seeing me just now?

654
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,030
It's like I did something

655
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,070
shameful.

656
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,150
I just thought

657
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,080
I would never see you again.

658
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,790
I'll just go back to Anqing.

659
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,510
Can't I do that?

660
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,510
Of course you can.

661
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,550
You have the right to do so.

662
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,550
That's it then.

663
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:35,200
Yes.

664
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,750
You can go back to Anqing

665
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,400
and follow your father's order

666
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
to marry that rich man,

667
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,640
inherit their family business

668
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,070
and continue the family lineage

669
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,200
for the Song family.

670
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,960
This is

671
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
the ideal marriage

672
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,240
that Mr. Zhaofang has planned out for you, right?

673
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,590
Do you know why I compare you

674
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,520
highly concentrated strong acid?

675
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,750
Because you're too bright.

676
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,480
When I first saw you,

677
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,710
I felt a strong sense of

678
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,320
innocence from you.

679
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,760
You're fooling me again.

680
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,110
I'm serious.

681
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,710
The idea you gave

682
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,480
your brother-in-law

683
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,880
surprised me.

684
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,400
That girl from a small town

685
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,370
can be so bright.

686
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,710
That's such a simple way

687
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,230
to solve the problem.

688
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,440
What? I don't understand what you're saying.

689
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,400
You suggested for the women from the members' families to come set up the class.

690
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,330
This is nothing.

691
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,230
Just with that little gesture, it's a lot.

692
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,880
Elite soldiers fill the sea, but Nu Wa patches the sky.

693
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
The solutions

694
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,580
are simple.

695
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,400
It's just transporting rocks.

696
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,800
The value is in

697
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
your inner spirit.

698
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,260
Are you telling the truth?

699
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,110
I'm good at perceiving people.

700
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,400
Shuhong.

701
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Stay.

702
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,280
Let's work together.

703
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,510
I need you.

704
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,710
I came to collect books–

705
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,030
You don't need any book.

706
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,360
You're a book yourself.

707
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,920
You

708
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,000
are the author of your own book.

709
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,710
You decide

710
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,190
what kind of person you become

711
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,710
in the future.

712
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,000
There's a big event tonight.

713
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,230
Come with me.

714
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,800
Get dressed now.

715
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,760
I'll be the husband and you'll be the wife.

716
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,190
What did you say?

717
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,400
Wu Tianbai asked you to book two tickets

718
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,070
to Japan tonight?

719
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,430
Yes.

720
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,030
Two second-class tickets

721
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,690
to Japan Cruise's Osaka Maru.

722
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,630
He told me

723
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,800
he can't stay in Shanghai

724
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
no matter it succeeds or not.

725
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,480
I think he's really afraid of

726
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
the safety of the school.

727
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,230
No one can

728
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,710
convince Tianbai.

729
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,800
What can you do?

730
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,230
Please.

731
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,260
Your Highness.

732
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,480
This is the captain of

733
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,020
the German ship Baian,

734
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,150
Mr. Braun.

735
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,840
It's Baian's honor

736
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,330
to serve Your Highness.

737
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,820
It's Baian's honor

738
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,840
to serve Your Highness.

739
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,440
Thank you, Captain.

740
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,350
The boat is set to sail tomorrow?

741
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,760
Is the boat set to sail tomorrow?

742
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,670
It's tomorrow, Your Highness. The first stop is Hong Kong.

743
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
It's tomorrow, Your Highness.

744
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,900
The first stop is Hong Kong

745
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,760
His Highness isn't coming to the banquet anymore?

746
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,360
I don't know what went wrong.

747
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,960
His attendant said

748
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,630
there was no such arrangement at all.

749
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,920
The invitation has been sent out,

750
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,440
and the opening drums are beating,

751
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,710
yet you're telling me

752
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,820
the star of the show is not coming?

753
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,710
The royalties are surly.

754
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,280
What can you do?

755
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,000
What's wrong, Baoquan?

756
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,190
Keep it low.

757
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,550
Even if His Highness is not coming,

758
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,000
the show has to go on.

759
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,320
Let’s just eat among ourselves.

760
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,580
Just enjoy ourselves.

761
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,760
We can only do that.

762
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,480
We can only do that.

763
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,800
Okay, I'll go liven up the atmosphere

764
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,460
and stabilize the situation.

765
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,030
What happened, Baoquan?

766
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,010
Why does Da Ren look unwell?

767
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,150
Women shouldn't be so nosy.

768
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,510
It's just a meal.

769
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,400
The Circuit has ordered,

770
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,550
for all guests,

771
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,630
as long as they are suspicious,

772
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,630
search them; no mistake is allowed!

773
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,150
Good.

774
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,490
You look just as I thought.

775
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:37,960
Shuhong.

776
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,110
Miss, you can go in now.

777
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,710
No matter what happens,

778
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,170
don't leave the carriage.

779
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,510
Find a place where you can come and go easily

780
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,760
and settle down.

781
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,630
Yes.

782
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,000
Make yourself at home.
