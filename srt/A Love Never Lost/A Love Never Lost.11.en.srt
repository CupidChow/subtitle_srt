[Episode 11]

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,590
Okay.

4
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,150
Relax, girl.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
You're gorgeous.

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,590
Your outfit looks amazing too.

7
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,780
Just be natural.

8
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,680
Yes.

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,860
Be confident.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Straighten your back.

11
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,430
Okay.

12
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,370
Smile again.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
Shuhong,

14
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,590
you're about to be

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,639
on the cover of a fashion magazine,

16
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,630
wearing

17
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,840
this year's new design from our shop.

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
I spent a fortune on it.

19
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,930
Your smile

20
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,240
is worth 200 yen,

21
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,550
got it?

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,870
Look at that girl.

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
Alright.

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,240
Don't move.

[Tokyo, Japan]

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,590
Comrades,

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,800
the revolutionary tide back in China

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,600
is surging with great momentum.

30
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,170
Here in Japan,

31
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,870
student-led

32
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,130
revolutionary groups

33
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,130
are springing up like

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,250
bamboo shoots after the rain.

35
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,610
But for a revolution,

36
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,140
ideals alone are not enough.

37
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,930
As the saying goes,

38
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,120
before the troops move, the provisions must go first.

39
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,800
We need money.

40
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,060
Right now, quite a few businesspeople

41
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,190
have helped us raise

42
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,720
revolutionary funds.

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,050
I've brought all of it here.

44
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,650
But let me be clear upfront:

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,079
Every single cent

46
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,750
must be spent

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,630
where it counts most.

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,530
As revolutionaries,

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
we first need to get rid of bad habits

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
like being wasteful, impractical,

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
and image-conscious.

52
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,640
Yifan made a good point.

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,620
Speaking of money,

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,730
I heard there was a financial crisis

55
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,190
back in China not long ago.

56
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
It's related to Tianbai.

57
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,350
I heard he's hiding somewhere in Osaka.

58
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,000
Can someone help me track him down?

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,700
Cousin, what brings you to Tokyo?

60
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,330
I'm here on business.

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,960
I couldn't find the person I was looking for,

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
so I have no choice

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,769
but to ask for your help.

64
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,700
What is it?

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,510
I heard in Shanghai that

66
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,220
you made quite a name for yourself in Tokyo.

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Just rumors.

68
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I need you to go to Osaka for me.

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,940
We have a comrade taking refuge there.

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,190
Help me figure out a way

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,190
to find him.

72
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,190
Mom is here.

73
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,210
Mom, you're back.

74
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,540
Let's go home.

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,630
Boss, I have to go.

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,240
I still have two outfits left to finish.

77
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:51,750
Wait.

78
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,310
There's something I need to tell you.

79
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,750
Please, have a seat.

80
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,530
Alright.

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,630
After you.

82
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,520
No thanks,

83
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,900
I don't drink.

84
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
You can have it.

85
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,630
No way.

86
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,240
You've got to drink.

87
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,710
Ever since you showed up,

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,040
our business has been booming.

89
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,260
Come on.

90
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,050
Raise your cup.

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,310
Okay.

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,210
That's the spirit. Let's toast

93
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,720
to success. Cheers!

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,560
Alright.

95
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,270
I never asked you.

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,480
Do you know anyone else in Osaka?

97
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,480
Well...

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Yes.

99
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm staying with someone from my hometown.

100
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,870
Someone from your hometown?

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,310
A man or a woman?

102
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,480
A middle-aged man from my hometown.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,160
The one who always comes by

104
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,390
our shop?

105
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes.

106
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,000
Actually, I knew it long ago.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,750
Are you two

108
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,720
involved?

109
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,300
No, nothing like that.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,290
We're just from the same hometown.

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,720
What a lucky guy.

112
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,170
You're the one who looks after him.

113
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,550
When he's anxious,

114
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,940
you bring him treats.

115
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,630
When he's scared,

116
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,190
you hold his hand.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,480
There are plenty of women in Japan

118
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,120
who are just as silly as you.

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,190
They have a lot of maternal instincts,

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,340
so much that they don't really know who to give it to.

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,610
And because of that,

122
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
a certain kind of man has become

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,460
more common in Japanese society.

124
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,000
We call them

125
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,510
"kept men."

126
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,930
Actually,

127
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
he's pretty knowledgeable.

128
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,160
Knowledgeable?

129
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:19,750
Yes.

130
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,630
A man who lives off a woman

131
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,830
is knowledgeable?

132
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,400
What kind of knowledge is that?

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,040
Do you think I have that kind of knowledge?

134
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,630
Boss, you've got to be kidding.

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,070
Do you think my kind of knowledge

136
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,250
is better than

137
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,600
that man of yours?

138
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,030
Boss, you're quite learned.

139
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,310
Whether I'm learned or not, I wouldn't dare say,

140
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,630
but here, I'm the one making the money.

141
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,560
If a man can't provide for

142
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,659
a woman,

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,680
then what kind of man is he?

144
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,830
You know,

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,190
my wife passed away

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,750
years ago.

147
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,310
Over the years,

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,750
many matchmakers have come by,

149
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
but none seemed right.

150
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,540
I need to find a woman

151
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
who can help me run the business.

152
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,190
You have no idea.

153
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,010
But from the very first day you started working here,

154
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,679
I took a liking to you at first sight.

155
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,510
After more than three months together,

156
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,920
I really think my first impression was spot on.

157
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,730
Don't you think

158
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,080
we're

159
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,880
a perfect match?

160
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,710
I know I'm old and ugly

161
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,840
myself,

162
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,920
but I have a heart that cherishes and protects.

163
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
You're truly beautiful.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,510
Trust me.

165
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,080
Let me take care of you.

166
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,000
Only Yoshinoya's fashion

167
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,380
truly complements you.

168
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,550
You look

169
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,000
your best

170
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,540
in our designs.

171
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,740
You could be on magazine covers,

172
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,620
attend fashion parties,

173
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,750
and make a fortune in no time.

174
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,820
Think we'd make

175
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,930
a perfect couple?

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We want every woman in Tokyo

177
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:03,630
to wear our clothes.

178
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,640
My goal is to make it the top fashion brand in Osaka.

179
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,520
Well,

180
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,870
don't turn me down so fast.

181
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,550
Go home and think it over.

182
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,870
Answer me tomorrow.

183
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,920
This dress took me

184
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,450
a lot of effort today.

185
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,130
I had to cut the pattern using newspaper several times

186
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,320
before finally getting it right.

187
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
Do you know where the challenges were?

188
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
One was the collar,

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,870
and the other was the sleeves.

190
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,270
Every little detail had to be just perfect.

191
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,200
You're right.

192
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Like in politics,

193
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,720
the one with the greatest ability is called the leader.

194
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
Being a leader is tough.

195
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,410
What's wrong?

196
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,750
Is something bothering you?

197
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,750
What happened?

198
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,750
Nothing.

199
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,920
Why do you look so upset?

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
Mr. Wu,

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
let me put it this way.

202
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm probably

203
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,960
losing my job tomorrow.

204
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,080
Why?

205
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,290
No particular reason. I just want to quit.

206
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,120
No,

207
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,510
you have to tell me the truth.

208
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,320
I...

209
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,910
I finally managed to make a little progress.

210
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,030
Today I bent over cutting

211
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,560
and tailoring all day long.

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
And now you come back saying you're quitting?

213
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,510
What about all the effort I put in today?

214
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,200
What about...

215
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,960
Mr. Yoshino asked me to marry him.

216
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,490
Would you be okay with that?

217
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,600
If you say yes, then I'll marry him.

218
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,320
No.

219
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,110
I knew it.

220
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,170
Are all men this sleazy,

221
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,390
no matter where they're from?

222
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,870
Quit it.

223
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,450
I've got your back.

224
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,360
Tomorrow,

225
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,160
fire that bastard.

226
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,330
[Yoshinoya Clothing]

227
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,880
Sorry to bother you.

228
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,310
I'm looking for a Chinese woman named Xie Shuhong.

229
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,270
Is she here?

230
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,510
What's your relationship with her?

231
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,200
Relative.

232
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,870
Relative?

233
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,060
Relative?

234
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,200
That's good.

235
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,270
That's good.

236
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,600
Have you seen it?

237
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,120
Your relative

238
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,030
was on the cover of "Housewives Weekly."

239
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,670
I paid 200 yen to get her on it.

240
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,280
Since you're her relative,

241
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,200
you should pay me the 200 yen.

242
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,440
200 yen?

243
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,440
That's right.

244
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
200 yen.

245
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,320
Why?

246
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,630
A week ago,

247
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,670
she just ran off without saying a word.

248
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,500
She hasn't shown up for work since.

249
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:37,320
So now, you'll have to pay the money she owes.

250
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,670
You're her relative, aren't you?

251
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,630
That's not fair.

252
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,510
Why should I

253
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,230
pay the 200 yen?

254
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,840
I already paid,

255
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,450
but she disappeared.

256
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,120
What more reason do you need?

257
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,790
You don't want to

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,840
get the police involved, do you?

259
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,080
She and that man

260
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,870
have very questionable identities.

261
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,200
Look,

262
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,960
are you going to pay over there,

263
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,200
or right here?

264
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,010
Flowers for sale.

265
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,270
Flowers for sale!

266
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,040
Would you like some flowers?

267
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,150
Flowers for sale!

268
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,240
Would you like some flowers?

269
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,050
No, thanks.

270
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,440
Would you like to buy some flowers?

271
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,100
No, thanks.

272
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Flowers for sale!

273
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,510
Interested in some flowers?

274
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,030
I think we've met somewhere before.

275
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,120
Do you remember?

276
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,470
Sorry, you got the wrong person.

277
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,760
Don't you remember

278
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
on the cruise,

279
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I brought bread to your boyfriend?

280
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,510
You're one of those military students studying in Japan?

281
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,550
Probably more than just that.

282
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,650
Stop messing around. Go away.

283
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:22,420
I'm busy.

284
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,630
Flowers for sale.

285
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,280
Is this you?

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,440
You went to Yoshino's store?

287
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,240
That's right.

288
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,550
I spent 200 yen

289
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,630
to buy it.

290
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,440
Serves you right. Who told you to mind other people's business?

291
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,000
How can you say that?

292
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,570
We are relatives.

293
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,630
Who's your relative?

294
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,670
Yang Yifan is your brother-in-law, right?

295
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,450
How do you know that?

296
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,630
He is my cousin.

297
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,980
I'm his cousin too.

298
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,700
My name's Yang Kaizhi.

299
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,120
On the cruise coming to Tokyo,

300
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,620
I really didn't expect

301
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,750
you to be Wu Tianbai.

302
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,910
The famous Wu Tianbai.

303
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Why did Hanhua come to Tokyo?

304
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Sun Wen from Revive China Society

305
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,810
invited him here

306
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,569
to discuss whether we can

307
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,609
merge with them.

308
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,510
Really?

309
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,900
Forming an alliance with Sun Wen?

310
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,069
We're still negotiating.

311
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,270
It's still uncertain

312
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,119
whether it will go through.

313
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,030
What else did he say about me?

314
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,359
The Tokyo Police Station hasn't lifted

315
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,829
the manhunt on you yet.

316
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,310
He hopes you can lay low in Osaka for a while.

317
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,560
How?

318
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,310
Doesn't he understand the saying,

319
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,240
"Poverty brings even the strongest to their knees?"

320
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,690
Look! Here comes the funding.

321
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,040
Stop wasting your time selling flowers.

322
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,070
I really don't think you should be out and about like that.

323
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,510
It's not safe

324
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,720
for a young girl like you

325
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,840
to be out on the streets all the time.

326
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
All that fuss over a bit of money.

327
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,110
Without it,

328
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,510
you'd have starved to death already,

329
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,790
and now you're acting all high and mighty?

330
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,890
Watch your mouth.

331
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,880
With my brain,

332
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,100
I can get money from anywhere.

333
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, just brag.

334
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,400
Why didn't you brag when we had nothing to eat?

335
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,440
Now suddenly you're full of talk.

336
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,170
But look, the money's here now.

337
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,480
Hanhua knows how valuable I am.

338
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,510
You think the Party can function without me?

339
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,370
Tell me, Kaizhi. Am I right or not?

340
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,890
What else did your cousin say?

341
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,270
Your brother-in-law

342
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,600
wants you to come back to Tokyo with me.

343
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:33,870
Wait.

344
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,700
What does Hanhua mean?

345
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,180
Is he trying to break us up?

346
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,110
After you left Shanghai,

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,550
people from the Shanghai Circuit went to Anqing.

348
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,210
Your sister was so frightened

349
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,040
that she had a miscarriage.

350
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,080
My sister didn't give birth to the baby?

351
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,920
Yes.

352
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,010
What about my parents?

353
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,170
Were they also implicated?

354
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,940
I heard from Yifan that

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,260
the shop is still open.

356
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,330
But business is not as good as before.

357
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,880
Your father was well-liked.

358
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,270
The investigation from the Shanghai Circuit was brushed off by the locals,

359
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,800
so they didn't dig too deep.

360
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,920
When Yifan came to Tokyo,

361
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,790
your father asked him to bring you some money.

362
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,610
He wanted you to stay in Tokyo to study,

363
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,960
not to return to China.

364
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,450
Yifan has already made arrangements

365
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,140
with

366
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,550
Aoyama Jissen Women's University in Tokyo.

367
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,510
Principal Utako Shimoda

368
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,860
has agreed to admit you.

369
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,440
So,

370
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,850
you should come back to Tokyo with me.

371
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,320
Mr. Wu,

372
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,710
what do you think?

373
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,860
What else can I say?

374
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,920
She has suffered a lot

375
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,400
following me all this way.

376
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
There's no reason

377
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,400
and it's not worth it for her to keep suffering because of me.

378
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,600
Studying is a good plan.

379
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,650
You should focus on your studies.

380
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,750
Maybe the next time we meet,

381
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,270
we'll have fewer arguments.

382
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,070
Don't go. Just let him be.

383
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,070
He's always like this; it's nothing new.

384
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
You jerk!

385
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,860
If others can do it, why can't you?

386
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,030
Are you

387
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,030
crying?

388
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,550
How dare you cry?

389
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,200
Cadet Gu Maichen,

390
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,670
speak up!

391
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,680
I'm so ashamed.

392
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,000
Louder!

393
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,090
I can't hear you!

394
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,910
I'm so ashamed!

395
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,730
Get up!

396
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,850
Fine.

397
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,960
Pull yourself together,

398
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,550
now!

399
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,550
Fully armed!

400
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,920
Run ten more laps for me!

401
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,240
Hold on tight!

402
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,200
Go quickly!

403
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,150
What are you waiting for?

404
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Faster!

405
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,070
Run faster!

406
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,680
Why so slow? Hurry up!

407
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,960
You fool.

408
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,350
Get up!

409
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,670
Get up now!

410
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,530
Get up!

411
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,780
Check, please.

412
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,510
Sir,

413
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,670
someone has already paid your bill.

414
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,920
Come on.

415
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,220
Sit down. Come here.

416
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,460
Sit.

417
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,790
Still thinking about that?

418
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,260
Let it go; it's all in the past.

419
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,970
Oh, yeah.

420
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,080
Maichen, this is for you.

421
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:15,930
Keep it.

422
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,210
No, Tufang, I can't take that.

423
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,120
Keep it.

424
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,550
Tufang, you...

425
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,540
Just take it if you're told to.

426
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,850
Take it.

427
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,530
No.

428
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,160
Enough. Stop fighting.

429
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,680
Tufang, you...

430
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Renjun, go talk some sense into him.

431
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,730
Let's go.

432
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,470
Bro, let's have a good chat.

433
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,470
Let's go.

434
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,050
Hurry up.

435
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,550
Let's go.

436
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,270
Let's go.

437
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,160
Hurry up.

438
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,310
Renjun, I...

439
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,030
What have you been saying

440
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,160
to him all this time?

441
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,270
What could I say?

442
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,270
I helped him find a rickshaw

443
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,000
and sent him straight to the Ginza red-light district.

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,630
What?

445
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,640
Gu Maichen

446
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,470
comes from a farming family in Tai'an, Shandong.

447
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,960
He's always been insecure,

448
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,920
then he met that

449
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
Japanese instructor.

450
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,200
It almost made him want to kill.

451
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,440
You have to help him regain his confidence.

452
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,240
But that doesn't mean you should send him to the red-light district.

453
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,750
Just listen to me.

454
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
It won't go wrong.

455
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,070
Drillmaster Hirata.

456
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,750
Cadet Li Renjun,

457
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
you may go now.

458
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,680
Yes.

459
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,310
Cadet Liang Xiang,

460
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,570
you've learned

461
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,310
how to win people over now.

462
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,180
I'm winning people over?

463
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,230
Sir,

464
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,530
I don't understand what you're talking about.

465
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,160
Your actions today

466
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,610
clearly show that

467
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,930
you're openly inciting our country's trainees

468
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,160
to resist the mental re-education

469
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,350
imposed on you by the Empire of Japan.

470
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,640
That's your interpretation,

471
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,230
Drillmaster Hirata.

472
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,200
Shut up!

473
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,190
Did I give you permission to speak?

474
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:17,880
You think you're clever,

475
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,680
buying people's loyalty,

476
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,510
forming factions,

477
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,510
and gathering

478
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,000
loyal allies to run things back home.

479
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,930
But first, you must remember,

480
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,290
understand and embody

481
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,990
the true spirit of the Empire of Japan.

482
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,920
Otherwise, you'll never truly

483
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,790
graduate from here.

484
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,310
If that's the case,

485
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,160
then your studies here

486
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:02,640
will be meaningless.

487
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,270
It's not only a tragedy for your personal education,

488
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,950
but also a failure on my part as your teacher.

489
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,750
Hirata!

490
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,240
Maichen, what are you doing?

491
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,690
I'm going to shoot this arrogant bastard!

492
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,830
Still hiding?

493
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,490
I'll kill you!

494
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,070
Maichen!

495
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,400
Maichen, you've gone crazy!

496
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,270
I'll kill you!

497
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,160
Maichen, stop it!

498
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,510
Stop! Maichen!

499
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,640
Maichen!

500
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,190
I...

501
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,550
Hirata!

502
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll kill you!

503
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,920
Hirata!

504
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,310
I'll finish you off, Hirata!

505
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,960
Send him to the military tribunal.

506
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,250
Sir,

507
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,030
Cadet Liang Xiang has arrived as ordered.

508
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,310
Come in.

509
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,080
Is your hand injury healed?

510
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,310
Thank you for your concern, sir.

511
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,880
It's already healed.

512
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,920
I regret to inform you that

513
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,940
the school has decided

514
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,920
to expel Cadet Gu Maichen.

515
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,400
Despite my best efforts,

516
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,780
I was powerless to stop it.

517
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,430
There were 52 cadets from your country.

518
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,090
Now, there are only 51.

519
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,670
By the time you graduate,

520
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,210
I'm not sure if that number will stay the same.

521
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,190
From what I know,

522
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,480
many of you have your own connections.

523
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,840
That Yang Kaizhi

524
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
is one of them.

525
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,240
Kaizhi?

526
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,080
Why bring him up?

527
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,790
Aren't you recruiting military talent?

528
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,550
He's one of your targets too, isn't he?

529
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,440
Maybe you're right.

531
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,070
What's the saying

532
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,000
from your country?

533
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,100
A fence needs three stakes;

534
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,160
a hero needs

535
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,510
three helpers.

536
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,780
You may go now,

537
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,210
Cadet Liang Xiang.

538
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,870
Yes, sir.

539
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,310
By the way,

540
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,670
Miss Yoshiko

541
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,030
asked me to let you know:

542
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,370
Her teacher,

543
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,920
Miss Utako Shimoda, the principal of

544
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,830
Tokyo Jissen Women's University,

545
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,520
is hosting a tea gathering this Sunday.

546
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,290
Miss Yoshiko

547
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,550
would like to invite you to join her.

548
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,210
Thank you for her kindness.

549
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,190
But I won't be able to make it.

550
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,250
I already have other plans that day.

551
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,450
I need to look up some military history materials.

552
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,590
Is that so?

553
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,010
I'll pass the message to her.

554
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:48,840
[Tokyo Jissen Women's University]

555
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,230
Watch your step.

556
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,270
This is the school motto established

557
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,720
by Principal Utako Shimoda when the school was founded.

558
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,030
By the way,

559
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,920
there will be a tea gathering hosted by the principal this afternoon.

560
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,910
The principal

561
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:14,820
has long been engaged in educating courtly noblewomen,

562
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
so most of the students here

563
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,290
come from aristocratic families in Tokyo.

564
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,350
Today is Sunday.

565
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,860
Everyone's gone home for now.

566
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,360
Be back at school before 8 p.m. tonight.

567
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,030
Why don't you take some time to settle in first?

568
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,160
You're Shuhong, right?

569
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,440
Take this time to get used to the place.

570
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,330
Tomorrow, Principal Utako Shimoda

571
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,030
will be teaching you personally.

572
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,550
Let's begin.

573
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,200
Hold the ladle

574
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,610
[Utako Shimoda, Principal of Jissen Women's University]

575
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,220
the way I'm holding it.

576
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:24,420
[Tokyo Jissen Women's University]

577
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:44,989
Here.

578
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,360
What are you doing here?

579
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,080
I almost couldn't recognize you.

580
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,150
They did manage to turn you into

581
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,320
a proper lady.

582
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,730
Your outfit

583
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,480
must've cost at least

584
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,070
50 yen.

585
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,620
I've only got five minutes.

586
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,070
Don't be so heartless.

587
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:00,730
Seriously.

588
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,790
What's the matter?

589
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,940
Can't afford the rent,

590
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,040
or can't buy a loaf of bread?

591
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,370
You really know me best.

592
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,160
Just tell me how much you want.

593
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,850
Here's the thing:

594
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,520
I came to Tokyo this time

595
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,320
because I needed to meet some people.

596
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:17,900
But to meet them,

597
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,280
I have to be in the right places.

598
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,110
The problem is,

599
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,940
those places in Tokyo are way too expensive.

600
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,270
Alright, stop nagging.

601
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,600
Is that enough?

602
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,660
Listen,

603
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,750
spend wisely.

604
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,530
I don't have any left either.

605
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,340
Got it.

606
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,840
Don't tell your brother-in-law that I was here.

607
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,780
He doesn't know I'm in Tokyo.

608
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,930
I'm not going to snitch on you.

609
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,520
That's it.

610
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,850
Just don't come running to me only when you're short on cash.

611
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,550
Excuse me,

612
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,230
is this booked by Mr. Yang?

613
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,440
A military officer

614
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,880
in uniform booked it yesterday.

615
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,770
That's right.

616
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,760
Yang Kaizhi,

617
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,880
what a tightwad.

618
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,440
It's rare to see him loosen his grip.

619
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,690
We should make sure he spends plenty.

620
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,360
Sit down.

621
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,460
Actually, I have another appointment tonight.

622
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,070
Please don't tell me

623
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,650
it's with a member of the Japanese royal family again.

624
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,380
Take a guess.

625
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,720
Who is that?

626
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,760
Your former boss.

627
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,400
My former boss?

628
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,360
Mr. Yuan?

629
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,320
Exactly.

630
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,360
He is the envoy of

631
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,490
Yuan Shikai, the Minister of Beiyang.

632
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,590
Got it. It's him.

633
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,360
Why did he only invite you and not me?

634
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,110
That's why I don't want to go.

635
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,310
And I can't go either.

636
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,510
Do you know why

637
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,840
he's been avoiding you?

638
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,920
Tell me.

639
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,030
He told me

640
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,090
Yuan Shikai had set aside a commander position for me

641
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,960
in the Beiyang New Army's Third Garrison

642
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,360
and wanted me to join him right after graduation.

643
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
Oh my god,

644
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,060
a commander!

645
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,030
Starting off as a commander?

646
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,300
Yeah.

647
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,670
That's his style.

648
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,510
That's him.

649
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,510
Tufang,

650
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,210
you can go for it.

651
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,460
Why not?

652
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,630
If you join the Beiyang New Army,

653
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,740
I, Li Renjun, might get to ride your coattails in the future,

654
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,490
right?

655
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,440
They gave you a command post right off the bat.

656
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,400
Yuan Shikai

657
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
is just using me to make a statement,

658
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,000
putting on a show for the court.

659
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,150
As a royal relative myself,

660
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,010
there's no way I'd be some puppet official for Yuan.

661
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,280
Impressive, Tufang!

662
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Your spirit really shines through.

663
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,750
You're going to be someone great someday.

664
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:53,350
Of course.

665
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,280
Let me introduce you all

666
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
to my best friend,

667
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,550
Miss Lee Joohee,

668
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,970
daughter of a wealthy Korean businessman.

669
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,640
Kaizhi.

670
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,420
This... is too exaggerated.

671
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,630
No need to make things up.

672
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,920
A wealthy Korean businessman? Seriously?

673
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,070
Come on, we're bros.

674
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,510
No need for that!

675
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,480
As long as you like her, Kaizhi,

676
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,510
even if she came from

677
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,030
a brothel,

678
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,760
we'd still have to accept her. Right, Tufang?

679
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Renjun, what are you talking about?

680
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,940
Nice to meet you.

681
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,290
I appreciate your guidance and support.

682
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,730
These are the classmates

683
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,930
I mentioned before.

684
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
You're Liang Xiang.

685
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,320
I was late

686
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,590
that day at the Tokyo Imperial University.

687
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,590
We should have met a year ago.

688
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,800
What a pity.

689
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,870
Kaizhi.

690
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,870
Really, Liang Xiang.

691
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,280
She was originally introduced to you,

692
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,540
but you ran away early.

693
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,140
What did you two do behind my back?

694
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,190
Nothing.

695
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,840
Our dear classmate here

696
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,530
is quite the charmer, huh?

697
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,280
I don't know what's going on between you two.

698
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,960
Kaizhi,

699
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
since your friend is visiting,

700
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,800
tonight's got to be special.

701
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,150
Let's do it properly.

702
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,190
Bring out the food!

703
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,520
The host is not here yet.

704
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,360
We'll serve the dishes when he arrives.

705
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:19,840
Fine.

706
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,550
Kaizhi, you're always getting others to pay up.

707
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,320
When's it our turn

708
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,760
to spend your money, huh?

709
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,920
Now that you've got ties with a Korean tycoon,

710
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,120
you'd better not embarrass the dignity of the Great Qing!

711
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm late.

712
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:36,880
Sorry.

713
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,840
Let me introduce you all.

714
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,840
This is my cousin, Yang Yifan.

715
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,630
His courtesy name is Hanhua.

716
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,330
They're in a private room.

717
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,880
Keep an eye on them.

718
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,130
Yes, sir.
