[Episode 19]

3
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,710
Well done.

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,920
Well done.

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,360
You're right.

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,150
We can't let Second Brother

7
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,610
keep acting out like this.

8
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,610
I don't have the strength to hit him anymore.

9
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,190
That useless brat.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
Such an useless brat!

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,870
Father,

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
these cadets

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,850
are really impressive.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,730
We should win them over.

15
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,320
We mustn't let others get to them first.

16
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,290
I've already told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,710
We can't keep playing nice

18
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,150
in the Yanji border negotiations.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,079
We need to toughen up.

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,310
We can't let ourselves

21
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,570
be outdone by a cadet who just graduated.

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
His name is...

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,660
What's his name again?

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,520
It's...

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,380
It's right on the tip of my tongue.

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,829
Yang Kaizhi.

27
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,079
That's right.

28
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,310
Yang...

29
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,550
I know him very well.

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,070
He and Tufang belong to the same cohort.

31
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,060
You slapped someone

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,340
and sprained your own arm?

33
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,280
You're really something.

34
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
I lost my temper for a moment.

35
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,430
You're still too hot-headed, son.

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
I think

37
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,430
it's time Duo Mei married into the family.

38
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,690
Let's do it this month.

39
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,800
Mother, it's...

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

41
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,240
What's wrong with

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,240
having a woman by your side

43
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,170
supporting you?

44
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,490
It might help you calm down a bit.

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,430
In that place,

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
how can you make it without fire in your belly?

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,240
They're all pigs.

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,050
Not one of them is capable.

49
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,000
That's why you need to balance toughness with softness.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,590
You need to win people over.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,960
Otherwise,

52
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,630
do you think one arm alone

53
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,870
can hold up the world?

54
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:48,960
Well,

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,870
I ended up getting myself a wife

56
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,070
while healing my arm.

57
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,800
Fine.

58
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,079
I'll do as you wish.

59
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,720
That's more like it.

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,870
Mother.

61
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
Do you remember Yang Kaizhi?

62
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Of course.

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,870
He's the one who messed around

64
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,710
with that Korean woman.

65
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,310
Mother, you're being biased.

66
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,750
He's now in Yanji

67
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,770
making a

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,590
big impact

69
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,440
as a border affairs assistant.

70
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,980
That's quite impressive.

[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]

72
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,310
This time,

73
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,510
the dispute between China and Japan

74
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,000
over the Yanji border

75
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,330
has finally ended with our complete victory.

76
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,040
It's truly something to celebrate.

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,310
Indeed.

78
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,630
It's truly something to celebrate.

79
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,360
It was hard-earned.

80
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,430
I think

81
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,750
this victory

82
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,670
was all thanks to appointing the right person.

83
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,330
A cadet who just graduated,

84
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,750
just a mere border affairs assistant,

85
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,480
shined brilliantly

86
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,520
as soon as he stepped on the scene.

87
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,090
He is a young man worthy of respect.

88
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,310
Prince Chun,

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,720
it seems

90
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,040
modern military education

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
really is crucial.

92
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,480
I agree.

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,870
I agree.

94
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,920
I heard

95
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,750
the curriculum at your academy

96
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,040
is pretty great.

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,430
I've been so busy

98
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,970
that I haven't found the time,

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,240
so...

100
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,070
Since you can't find the time,

101
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,870
just let

102
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,360
someone who can

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
take charge.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,070
I think Liang Xiang

105
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,800
is suitable for this position.

106
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Yes.

107
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,480
And he doesn't need to be the Deputy Director of the Military Academy Department.

108
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Let him take charge of the academy.

109
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,870
What do you think?

110
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,659
I have no objections.

111
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,540
It's up to you.

112
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,920
You...

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,780
Then let's ask for the Empress Dowager's approval.

114
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,840
Slow down. Give them a hand.

115
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,570
Support the bottom.

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,260
Don't break it. Be careful.

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,160
You.

118
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,630
These fish are very precious.

119
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,040
Hurry up. Be careful.

120
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't scare my fish.

121
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,400
Be careful.

122
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
Er,

123
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,390
what's going on here?

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,190
Head of the Academy?

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,560
Where did you get the news?

126
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,270
Really.

127
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,970
The Empress Dowager has approved the appointment decree.

128
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,870
Then thank your father

129
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,190
on my behalf.

130
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,720
But these goldfish?

131
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,190
It means "the joy of fish and water."

132
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,000
Aren't you getting married?

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,440
It's my early gift.

134
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,360
I'm so curious.

135
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,310
I've been hiding

136
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,000
the news of this wedding.

137
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,750
How did you know?

138
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,360
Come on,

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,430
who are you now?

140
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,240
You slapped me

141
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,750
so hard that the whole capital

142
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,480
heard it.

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,920
Set the sedan down!

144
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,200
Duo Mei.

145
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,750
I feel

146
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,280
it's easier to talk to you

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,460
with this veil between us.

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,230
Yes.

149
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,440
The very next day we met,

150
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,030
I left for Japan.

151
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,000
Right?

152
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,120
Before that,

154
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,200
we hadn't even spoken a word to each other.

155
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Yes.

156
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,000
That was...

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,960
the 27th year of Guangxu.

158
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,390
It's been five years.

159
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,470
That's right.

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,510
And I spent

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,200
four of them in Japan.

162
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,240
I don't want to know

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,570
why my mother likes you.

164
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,100
An old person is an old person.

165
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,170
She must have her reasons.

166
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,360
These five years have been very long for me.

167
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,310
But I like you.

168
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,720
The first time I saw you come to our home,

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,850
I already liked you.

170
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,970
How come I don't remember that at all?

171
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,960
Not every boy in the Banner Battalion

172
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,510
is likeable.

173
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,680
I never asked you to like me.

174
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,050
But you are different.

175
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,180
How am I different?

176
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,530
You looked different.

177
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,730
Looked different?

178
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,120
Since then,

179
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,990
your mother has often visited our home.

180
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,510
My mother likes nobles.

181
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,910
What noble?

182
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,550
Back then, we only had two rooms

183
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,680
and two wooden beds.

184
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,790
But I like it.

185
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,840
Our mansion in Jingzhou is very big,

186
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,040
with plenty of rooms.

187
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,320
I didn't marry your mother,

188
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,070
nor did I marry my mother.

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,790
I don't like nobles

190
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,920
like my mother does.

191
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,790
I like you.

192
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,240
I like the way

193
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,500
you carry your drunk mother home

194
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,390

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,640
willing to donate funds for a fundraiser

385
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,270
through Kanyama.

386
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,900
The Restoration Society is really poor.

387
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,270
Not long ago,

388
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,740
they even planned to rob a bank.

389
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,100
But they gave up later.

390
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,270
Giving up was the right choice.

391
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,270
Otherwise,

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,060
they'd be no different from bandits.

393
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,400
I know Kanyama.

394
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,300
He only holds art exhibitions

395
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,270
to sell Chinese paintings and calligraphy

396
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,920
to wealthy merchants and nobles.

397
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Not necessarily.

398
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,750
The Russo-Japanese War just ended.

399
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,880
Those Japanese capitalists

400
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,030
who made a fortune

401
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,270
have to find other ways

402
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,070
to spend their money and enjoy themselves, right?

403
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,270
You think you can take

404
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,830
that dirty money back to fuel the revolution?

405
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,110
The source of the money doesn't matter.

406
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,590
Even roses

407
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,030
need to be watered with manure.

408
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,400
How come you and my brother-in-law

409
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,530
said the same thing?

410
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,750
What's going on, Shuhong?

411
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,420
Mr. Kanyama.

412
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,350
Mr. Kanyama,

413
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,050
you're not planning

414
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,660
to auction these Chinese rebels, are you?

415
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,750
It's not impossible.

416
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,250
I heard that in Sun Wen's

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
armed operations along the Guangdong

418
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,030
and Guangxi borders,

419
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,750
there were Japanese personnel

420
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,350
and funding involved.

421
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,270
I see.

422
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

423
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,480
I must clarify

424
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,270
that today's occasion

425
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,370
is an art event.

426
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,640
China, with its ancient history,

427
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,000
not only has a long tradition

428
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,160
of painting and calligraphy

429
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,750
but also a vibrant reality

430
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,510
of people's daily lives.

431
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,920
Miss Shuhong,

432
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
am I right?

433
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,020
You're helping us understand the profound meaning

434
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,310
behind the landscapes and birds and flowers.

435
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,030
Mr. Kanyama,

436
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:56,680
why are you ashamed to talk about money?

437
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,640
I'm sorry

438
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,040
for taking your time.

439
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,840
Let me introduce

440
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,520
the origin of these pictures.

441
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,670
These photos show

442
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,670
revolutionaries

443
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,130
from the Zhejiang-Anhui region of China.

444
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,840
Everyone, take a look.

445
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,680
These are revolutionaries who are willing

446
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,350
to dedicate everything to this country.

447
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,160
I sincerely ask

448
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,270
all of you

449
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,090
to look closely into their eyes.

450
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,810
Please take a look.

451
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,750
See what is contained

452
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,750
in their gaze.

453
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,100
Their efforts through generations

454
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,970
are for

455
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,880
a longing for freedom.

456
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,240
They still hold

457
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,510
the courage to fight.

458
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,680
Even if they have to die,

459
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,350
they will look down on their enemies with contempt!

460
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,350
Can you tell me

461
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,140
who exactly

462
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,750
are the enemies of these heroes?

463
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:51,950
That's right.

464
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,350
They are heroes.

465
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,940
All these heroes

466
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,160
were made by their enemies.

467
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,110
For example,

468
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,750
Tsarist Russia's Baltic Fleet

469
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,510
created your naval hero,

470
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,350
Togo Heihachiro.

471
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,790
And the creators

472
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,120
of these Chinese heroes

473
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,720
happen to be

474
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,640
the current rulers of China—

475
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,750
the corrupt Qing government.

476
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:31,310
That old woman, Cixi, is pushing forward

477
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,920
the so-called new policies.

478
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,990
It's too late!

479
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,030
Countless fearless

480
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,030
heroes

481
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,240
have already taken up

482
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,790
arms!

483
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,140
They have taken up arms!

484
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

485
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,000
the Chinese revolutionaries

486
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,880
urgently need support from international friends.

487
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,400
Please help them

488
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,660
achieve their dreams!

489
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,270
Please generously donate!

490
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,680
Donate!

491
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,830
What's going on?

492
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,070
The Finance Minister from the cabinet is here too.

493
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,980
If your legation

494
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,480
hears about this,

495
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,640
it will be a serious diplomatic incident.

496
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,920
This is ridiculous!

497
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,360
I am...

498
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,750
Ayakura.

499
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,400
Nice to meet you.

500
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,030
What is the educational background

501
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,090
of that Chinese man

502
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,620
in the wheelchair just now?

503
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,270
He's a doctor.

504
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,110
A PhD in chemistry.

505
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,510
No wonder.

506
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,850
Does that mean anything?

507
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,080
Rebels in Chinese history

508
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:32,000
often died without knowing why.

509
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,240
Today's rebels, however,

510
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,930
are politically motivated

511
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,240
and highly educated individuals.

512
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,000
They even write books and manifestos.

513
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,160
What's wrong with that?

514
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,480
That depends on who you think it's bad for.

515
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
This will be very troublesome

516
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,250
for your authorities.

517
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,920
These rebels

518
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,270
have a wide and powerful influence.

519
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,400
Come on, Bugu.

520
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,640
Look at the tail up there.

521
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,640
You draw the tail.

522
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,560
A big shark, a big shark!

523
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,640
A big shark.

524
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,800
Kanyama said I was reckless.

525
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,930
You don't think so too, do you?

526
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,110
Whether you were reckless or not,

527
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,440
you've already done it.

528
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
You're right.

529
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,730
We don't care about the result,

530
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,480
right?

531
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,790
Ever since I brought you here

532
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,650
from Shanghai,

533
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,880
we haven't cared—

534
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,400
not because we truly don't care,

535
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,600
but because we can't.

536
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,550
Once we start caring,

537
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,400
all that courage we once had

538
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,120
will become worthless.

539
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,880
You're talking about yourself.

540
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,160
I've never been like that.

541
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,750
I never care

542
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,080
what others think of me.

543
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,270
A little fish.

544
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,750
Yes, draw a little fish.

545
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,100
Little fish, little fish.

546
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,300
Go ahead, you draw it.

547
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,000
Come on.

548
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,500
Draw this stroke here.

549
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,400
Yes.

550
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,300
Oh right,

551
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,870
why don't we buy a camera too?

552
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,350
We can even

553
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,270
turn that stationery store downstairs

554
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,590
into a photography studio.

555
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,520
Turn it into a photography studio?

556
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,030
Hanhua's photos

557
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,240
are powerful

558
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,270
no matter what.

559
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,510
They're

560
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,030
more convincing

561
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,350
than empty words.

562
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,240
Do you know

563
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,270
the true spirit

564
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,400
of photography?

565
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,990
It's to record life and resist forgetting.

566
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,750
Didn't you see

567
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,640
the shock

568
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
on those dignitaries' faces

569
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,860
when they looked at these photos?

570
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,240
To record life?

571
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,400
It's settled.

572
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,810
Let's buy a camera.

573
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,590
The darkroom equipment is all ready-made.

574
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,940
Let's turn the shop downstairs into a photography studio.

575
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,510
A camera costs about a thousand or so—

576
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,310
it's not much.

577
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,160
The most important thing

578
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,420
is that even if we go back to our country,

579
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,030
we can take it

580
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,920
with us

581
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,680
and put it to good use.

582
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,960
Right, Bugu?

583
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,840
The Japanese army

584
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,000
can fight

585
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,370
like a single organism

586
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,000
because of

587
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,880
their absolute obedience

588
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
to orders.

589
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,000
Even if it's

590
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
a wrong order

591
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,110
with no explanation,

592
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,100
they'd still follow the command precisely.

593
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,660
If someone is your commander,

594
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,110
when they say stand up, you must stand up;

595
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,350
when they say lie down,

596
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,350
you must lie down.

597
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,520
Being beaten

598
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,000
is part of the training.

599
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,270
What kind of beating?

600
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,640
Slapping, of course.

601
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,370
Is that so?

602
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,270
Not exactly.

603
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,750
See? I knew it.

604
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,480
It's too brutal.

605
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,000
But for someone like you,

606
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,460
they're a bit more polite.

607
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,800
They'd first order you

608
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
to take off your hat

609
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,170
and stand at attention,

610
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,000
and then…

611
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,640
Then what?

612
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Then they'd

613
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,880
slap you from both sides

614
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,160
until you lie down.

615
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,360
In the Japanese army,

616
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,640
brutality is the rule.

617
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,270
It makes people fierce

618
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,880
and turns them into soldiers.

619
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,740
Getting beaten

620
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
is part of becoming an adult.

621
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,790
Heard that, Second Lord?

622
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,650
Among us, you're the one

623
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,640
the drillmaster favors the most.

624
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,510
You were the first

625
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,640
to become an adult.

626
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,230
What? Are you jealous?

627
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,750
Lord Tao is right.

628
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,400
Second Lord, you're an adult now.

629
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,030
You're an adult now!

630
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,910
Stop making a fuss here!

631
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,090
Those bastards are all sly as foxes.

632
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,890
None of them is easy to deal with.

633
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,160
Why bother arguing with them?

634
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,020
That's right.

635
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,480
It's meaningless.

636
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,830
Here, Tufang,

637
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,530
have some watermelon.

638
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,560
Here.

639
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,960
Actually, if you ask me...

640
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,140
What?

641
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,950
Can I say it?

642
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,110
I think those lords out there

643
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,270
are like dung beetles

644
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,590
that fell into the lunch box—

645
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,190
they came to the wrong place.

646
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,590
No matter how much you educate them,

647
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,790
they will still be dung beetles.

648
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,840
Do you think I'm stupid?

649
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,110
Expecting those rich brats to turn out well?

650
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:50,640
Wrong.

651
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,940
I didn't come here

652
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,050
to run a school.

653
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,480
I came to run a bank.

654
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,910
Run a bank?

655
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,640
Aren't all their fathers

656
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
my shareholders?

657
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,300
I'm keeping them here like money in the bank.

658
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,850
Drillmaster Liang!

659
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,930
You're eating watermelon.

660
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,640
Second Lord Zaixun,

661
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,730
have you attended the imperial court meeting?

662
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,240
It's better to be a drillmaster.

663
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,790
n this heat,

664
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,880
three trainees

665
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,630
can only share one watermelon.

666
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,530
If you're here to eat watermelon,

667
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,590
you can have it all.

668
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,960
There are whole ones over there.

669
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,760
Take them all.

670
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,280
Sir, the wind's changing.

671
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,130
The court meeting was over.

672
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,720
Yuan failed.

673
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,590
Yuan Shikai schemed meticulously.

674
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,740
He anticipated the Empress Dowager's intentions

675
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,510
and planned for the constitutional monarchy

676
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,510
to be established

677
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,920
exactly 12 years later.

678
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,270
If it was too soon,

679
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,270
the Empress Dowager would think

680
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,270
he wanted her to return power early.

681
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,470
If it was too late,

682
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,150
it would seem insincere.

683
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,390
Stop beating around the bush.

684
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,719
Just tell me the result.

685
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,440
Did Yuan Shikai's new government system

686
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,630
pass or not?

687
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
The Empress Dowager is a wise person.

688
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,000
She didn't even

689
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,760
glance at Yuan's plan.

690
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,360
She took it from Prince Qing

691
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,960
and immediately

692
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,590
handed it over to Yuan's political enemy,

693
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,670
Qu Hongji,

694
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,960
ordering him to revise it.

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,920
Prince Qing

696
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,010
was sweating buckets at the time.

697
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,590
This was amazing.

698
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,030
As she handed it over, the whole world was turned upside down.

699
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,880
Indeed.

700
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,230
By the way,

701
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,989
Fifth Lord asked me to pass a message to you.

702
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,199
What did Prince Chun say?

703
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,110
Fifth Lord said

704
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,440
that the establishment of the Ministry of War

705
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,150
is already set in stone.

706
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,960
Most of the six garrisons of Beiyang New Army

707
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,510
will be taken

708
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,230
from Yuan's control

709
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,760
and placed directly under the Ministry of War.

710
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,230
As for the Minister of War,

711
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,180
it will definitely be Tieliang.

712
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,880
But this person commands the entire national army

713
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,360
and is not the best choice

714
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,160
to hold central military power.

715
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,930
Fifth Lord

716
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,520
means for you to prepare

717
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,100
to assist Tieliang to take over the military power.

718
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,120
In other words...

719
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,330
A great responsibility is about to be entrusted to him.

720
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,300
Maichen.

721
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,840
Qianli?

722
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,320
How long has it been since we last met?

723
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,470
Too long.

724
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,000
Since I was expelled

725
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,190
from the school in Tokyo,

726
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,800
we haven't met at all.

727
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,620
Have a seat.

728
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,220
You really are something.

729
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,960
Others shoot at the target paper.

730
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,280
But you shot

731
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,730
right at Hirata's head.

732
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,160
What?

733
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,920
You've been hiding in Beijing.

734
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,550
Have you earned any money?

735
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,760
What money?

736
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,590
I don't even care about making money.

737
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,710
I make a living

738
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,670
as a PE teacher

739
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,920
at a public school.

740
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,340
Not bad.

741
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,030
You might not be as distinguished as before, but you still have dignity.

742
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,960
You still

743
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,440
love to teach, don't you.

744
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,060
Not at all. It's just for dignity.

745
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,510
Now that the Imperial Exam has been abolished,

746
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,710
running new-style schools

747
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,510
is like opening public toilets—

748
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,510
a novelty for at most three days.

749
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,880
Maichen, I'm here for one thing.

750
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,810
You know Beijing well.

751
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,450
Find me a quiet residence

752
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,390
to rent for a year.

753
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,510
It doesn't have to be big,

754
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,440
but convenient for buying things.

755
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,590
The rent

756
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,910
should be under 100 yuan.

757
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,440
Are you rich now?

758
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,130
Our Li Qianli has become Gold Li.

759
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,200
With 100 yuan,

760
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,090
you can rent a top-notch quadrangle.

761
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,050
Fine, a quadrangle it is.

762
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,990
Okay. Are you living alone?

763
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:06,390
You're still so conservative.

764
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,060
Who rents a place in Beijing

765
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,210
without involving a woman these days?

766
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,710
I went a bit too far at a brothel.

767
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,880
She got attached to me and I can't shake her off.

768
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
You.

769
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,110
Back in Tokyo,

770
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,360
you were always trying to

771
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,280
push me into the red-light district.

772
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,190
Now look at you,

773
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,070
you messed up.

774
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,440
But seriously,

775
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,760
do you really plan

776
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,730
to live with that kind of woman?

777
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
A man

778
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,870
should be strong, tough,

779
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,960
and responsible.

780
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,910
That's it.

781
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,960
I have to

782
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,440
go to Tieshizi Alley

783
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,110
to deliver some money to Mr. Yuan.

784
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,410
Find me a place.

785
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,710
I trust your judgment.

786
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,620
Mr. Yuan? Which Mr. Yuan?

787
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,410
Yuan Shikai.

788
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,450
How many Mr. Yuans could there be?

789
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:55,950
Handle it now.

790
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,550
If you're done, just keep it there.

791
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,610
I'll come back to you.

792
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,340
Okay, just wait for my message.

793
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:25,460
[Xiao Fenglan]

794
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,050
Maichen?

795
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,730
It's me, Xiao Fenglian.

796
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
Aren't all Renjun's classmates

797
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
like you?

798
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,150
Upright posture,

799
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,960
with a neck

800
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,360
that looks like there's a mop stuck to the back of your head.

801
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,760
This must be the house, right?

802
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,630
It's great—excellent Feng Shui.

803
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,970
It's really nice.

804
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,720
This place is great.

805
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,400
It's convenient to get anywhere from here.

806
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,130
The most important thing

807
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,860
about a house is the location.

808
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:50,070
Yes, Qianli told me.

809
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,810
Who's older between you and Renjun?

810
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,770
I am, I'm a year older.

811
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,590
Really?

812
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,230
Why do you look younger?

813
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,990
Qianli has been through a lot.

814
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,500
He's experienced.

815
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,440
Experienced.

816
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,640
He's just shameless.

817
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,440
I think this house is pretty good.

818
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,530
It's a standalone yard—

819
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,490
quiet, private, and low-key.

820
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,710
Yes.

821
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,710
Qianli specifically

822
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,880
asked for that.

823
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,870
He said it mustn't be too flashy.

824
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,350
He wouldn't dare be flashy.

825
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:16,920
Everything he does

826
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,120
is shady and corrupt.

827
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,630
But to be fair,

828
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,910
not all of it is really his own doing.

829
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,910
It's all orders from his superiors.

830
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,710
He sends off piles of gold,

831
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,590
jewels, silver, and cash

832
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,630
to other people's homes

833
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,960
without even blinking.

834
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,590
How could a mere battalion commander

835
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,710
have the guts

836
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,850
to spend that much money on his own?

837
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,420
I think this house is great.

838
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,880
Low profile, nothing flashy.

839
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,070
It's in harmony with everything.

840
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,230
It's just that the rent

841
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,680
is 40 yuan higher

842
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,030
than what Qianli told me earlier.

843
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,150
I tried everything to talk the landlord down,

844
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,750
but he just refused to budge.

845
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,030
Fine, it's okay.

846
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,030
You don't need to talk to him.

847
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,500
If I say it's worth it, it's worth it.

848
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,430
I'll pay you the difference later.

849
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,030
What are you waiting for?

850
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,670
Hurry up

851
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,710
and unpack the things.

852
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:06,310
Officer Li will be back soon.

853
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:08,980
Don't do it.

854
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,000
Maichen,

855
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,150
leave the heavy lifting

856
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,440
to the soldiers.

857
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,690
You must let the orderlies

858
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,800
have things to do.

859
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,710
We need to make them think

860
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,920
they are useful.

861
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,690
You can't carry it like that.

862
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,670
Be careful.

863
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,880
Hurry up.

864
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,690
Slow down!

865
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,760
Did you find out?

866
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,360
Where is Guangmingdian Alley?

867
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,410
Stop circling around.

868
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,360
They said it's just ahead.

869
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,620
Stop, stop.

870
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,620
Can Beijing people ever give straight directions?

871
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,750
How many "just aheads" have we passed?

872
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,160
Now it looks like it.

873
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,670
Follow that cart up ahead.

874
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,100
Hya!

875
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,300
Hya!

876
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,230
Judging by the direction,

877
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,630
they're going to Guangmingdian Alley too.

878
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,100
[Liang Residence, Guangming Alley]

879
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,720
Of course. Have a seat.

880
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,400
Please.

881
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,760
Commanders, please forgive us.

882
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,220
There are too many people.

883
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,130
Rong Ge.

884
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,140
What is it, Young Madam?

885
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,570
Why are there so many people here?

886
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,490
Exactly.

887
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,920
People keep coming to talk with him.

888
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,710
It's been nonstop.

889
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,240
And they all brought gifts.

890
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,240
Tufang told us

891
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,500
to block the entrance.

892
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,480
He said not a single gift

893
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,540
is allowed inside.

894
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,440
Be smart.

895
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,880
Turn them all away—gifts and people.

896
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,190
Otherwise,

897
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,510
we'll be stuck here till midnight.

898
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,570
Tufang said

899
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,850
he must talk to each of them personally.
