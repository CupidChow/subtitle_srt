[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,950
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,590
Commander Zhang,

4
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,710
now that you're
the Southern Army's commander,

5
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,509
you sure know how to impress us.

6
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,330
One question from you,

7
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,640
and even our chief judge

8
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,400
is stumped.

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,550
Sir,

10
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,640
the track gauge in Wuhan

11
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,140
is 4.85 feet.

12
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,770
Same

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,030
as in Beijing.

14
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,780
I just got off the train,

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,120
and I sent someone to measure the tracks.

16
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,750
The gauge in Zhangde

17
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,800
is also 4.85 feet.

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
This proves one thing:

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,360
corruption's the same everywhere!

20
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,630
Commander Zhang,

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,090
our railway gauge standard

22
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,340
comes from Europe.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,970
It was set by Europeans.

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,280
Is that so?

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,360
Then

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,470
why did they set it

27
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,680
at 4.85?

28
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,560
Why not 4.86

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
or 3.86?

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,360
Why exactly 4.85?

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,680
Exactly.

32
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,860
Good question.

33
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,470
The European railway gauge

34
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,630
came from
the wheelbase of European carriages.

35
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,690
The wheelbase of European carriages

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,910
is exactly 4.85 feet.

37
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,750
And why is the wheelbase

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,470
that wide?

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,930
You really know how to argue.

40
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,150
Because that's the width

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
of two horses side by side—

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,940
their rumps set the standard:

43
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,390
4.85 feet.

44
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,090
So that's how it is.

45
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,120
Kaizhi,

46
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,840
you really are a man of knowledge!

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,470
Cheers.

48
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,680
Chief Judge,

49
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,030
your man is really something.

50
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,650
Now I'm relieved.

51
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,680
If he were any weaker,

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,910
he really couldn't

53
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,770
handle certain people out there.

54
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,480
Look at that.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,470
The drill hasn't even started yet,

56
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,840
and someone's already
buttering up the brass!

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,960
If you're to suck up,
don't just do it to one person.

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,270
Make sure both men in power

59
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,680
feel flattered.

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,190
Am I right?

61
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,120
That's right.

62
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,040
Duan,

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,680
why are you leaving?

64
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,110
I was just kidding. Come on.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,710
The Western food

66
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,420
is awful.

67
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,790
Who came up with it?

68
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,560
Come on, brothers,

69
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,290
drink as you please.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:38,830
Cheers.

71
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,040
Cheers.

72
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,070
Cheers.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,409
Let's drink.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
Don't take it the wrong way, Chief Judge.

75
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,240
Before the drill,

76
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,680
I wouldn't dare offend you.

77
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,370
It's totally fine.

78
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,000
General Zhang, you have a sharp eye.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,030
I should be learning from you.

80
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,390
Commander Zhang,

81
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,280
you must've come from the artillery corps.

82
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,500
How did you know?

83
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,800
Artillerymen

84
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,680
are always obsessed with measurements,

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,360
and

86
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,710
they always use feet.

87
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,120
Kaizhi,

88
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,240
I have high hopes for you.

89
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,000
Our border hero,

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,160
come.

91
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,409
See?

92
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,500
The two armies haven't even faced off yet,

93
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,790
and the tension
is already thick in the air.

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,070
That's why it's even more important

95
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,360
for us judges

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,130
to stay fair and impartial.

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,630
If Manchu generals
want to lead Han soldiers,

98
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,040
they should study

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,770
Han culture more.

100
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,950
Han culture values flexibility,

101
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,950
not rigid rules.

102
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,240
My friend.

103
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,510
The Commander-in-Chief

104
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,840
has changed his stance.

105
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,290
I told you long ago.

106
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
Don't take it too seriously.

107
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,070
It's all about mutual favors—

108
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,470
you help me, or I help you.

109
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,760
Come on,

110
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,680
don't look so upset.

111
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,830
Come with me over there

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,920
and greet those

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
brigade commanders.

114
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,190
Let's go.

115
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,470
[Imperial Bank of China]

116
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,360
Miss,

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,440
are these the correct amounts?

118
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,909
Yes.

119
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,560
Shuhong.

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,050
Alright, wait a moment.

121
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,830
It's really you.

122
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,240
Yeah, it's me.

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,020
I could tell from afar.

124
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,040
What?

125
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,710
You're back in Shanghai?

126
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Yihua.

127
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,520
The carriage is about to leave.
I've got business.

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,470
Coming, coming!

129
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,180
You go ahead. We'll catch up later.

130
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,110
Sure. Come visit when you're free.

131
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,760
You're still so beautiful.

132
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,280
Who was that?

133
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,960
Your third son's wife.

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,890
Still as pretty as ever.

135
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Brother-in-law.

136
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,570
Had another fight?

137
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,390
You bet.

138
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,750
A big one.

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,570
Since you came back this time,

140
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,430
you two have always been arguing.

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,930
What's really going on?

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,450
Your brother-in-law…

143
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,010
Forgive me for being blunt.

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,050
He's just not cut out to be a leader.

145
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,510
To be honest with you,

146
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,270
I've already teamed up

147
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,190
with comrades in Shanghai

148
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,120
to take him down.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,190
In my opinion,

150
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,860
he's only good for writing his theories.

151
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,120
The most important thing right now

152
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,600
is the Zhejiang-Anhui uprising.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
Success or failure doesn't matter.

154
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,860
We just have to make it happen.

155
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,190
We need

156
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,270
those donors to see exactly

157
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,920
where

158
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,240
their money went,

159
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,800
how we spent it,
and whether it was worth it.

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,510
Whether we succeed doesn't matter.

161
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,510
But look at him—

162
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,870
keeping saying we're not ready.

163
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,000
He's just being unreasonable!

164
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,680
Did the money for Qiu Jin and Xu Xilin

165
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,540
get delivered?

166
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,520
It's all been handed over.

167
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,320
Well,

168
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,280
keep Zhangde's money separate.

169
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,679
We might need it anytime.

170
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,549
Didn't Wang Han take some money?

171
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,960
That was for operational expenses.

172
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm talking about the pension

173
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,050
for Wang Han's family.

174
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,430
A pension for Wang Han's family?

175
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,510
Why so surprised?

176
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,060
He's alive today,

177
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,260
but who knows about tomorrow?

178
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,020
You're really cold-blooded.

179
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
If one gives
one's life for the revolution,

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
it's worth it.

181
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,020
But their families

182
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
still have to live on.

183
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,560
Attention!

184
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,360
Salute!

185
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:47,530
Giddy-up!

186
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,840
Giddy-up!

187
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,120
Stop!

188
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,120
What are you doing?

189
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,060
Enjoying yourself, Kaizhi?

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,300
This rain is perfect.

191
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,490
You're my superior.

192
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,670
I have to join you
in this romantic moment.

193
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,260
But if I catch a cold when we arrive,

194
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,520
I'll have to blame you.

195
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,700
You, come here!

196
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,840
What's going on?

197
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,860
The assassin ran that way!

198
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Stop! Stop!

199
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,880
Stop! Don't run!

200
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,970
The assassin is in the hotel.

201
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,200
Surround the entire building.

202
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Open the door!

203
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,030
Open the door!

204
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,670
Coming. Coming.

205
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:01,240
Open up! Open up!

206
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,150
Fool!

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Dying for you people
really isn't worth it!

208
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,090
Out of the way!

209
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,790
Search the place!

210
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,240
Yes.

211
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,290
You, go that way.

212
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,720
Yes.

213
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,480
Sir.

214
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,760
[Northern Army Camp]

215
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,790
What is it, Chief Judge?

216
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,120
The confrontation time has passed.

217
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,980
Why hasn't anything started yet?

218
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Can't be helped.

219
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,960
The Southern Army hasn't arrived.

220
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,790
Everyone, stand up!

221
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,790
Salute!

222
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,550
Renjun,

223
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,110
I heard that
some battalions in the Northern Army

224
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,360
have canceled the military salute

225
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,760
and changed it to bowing.

226
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,710
Is that true?

227
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,980
The Ninth Battalion
just got a new Manchu commander.

228
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,420
He said the Commander-in-Chief, Feng Shan,

229
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,850
approved the change.

230
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,270
Really?

231
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,600
The Commander-in-Chief approved it?

232
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,790
What can we do?

233
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,650
I can't control others,

234
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,030
but my men won't change.

235
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,850
Whoever dares to change,
I'll kick their ass.

236
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,090
An army is an army!

237
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,090
Looks like Mr. Yuan

238
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,910
really picked the right man back then.

239
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,720
Of course.

240
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
A man's gotta know gratitude—

241
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
always stay proper,

242
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,670
righteous, grounded,

243
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,440
and clean.

244
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,220
Qianli,

245
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,660
why do Northern soldiers

246
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,210
hang their shoes around their necks?

247
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,750
Chief Judge,

248
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,510
you shouldn't ask me that.

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,240
You should ask the new quartermaster.

250
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,570
The new quartermaster?

251
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,440
He was just transferred here
two weeks ago.

252
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,150
He's the Commander-in-Chief's
brother-in-law.

253
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,350
You'd better ask him.

254
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,340
The joint drill is about to start,

255
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,910
and they're all barefoot?

256
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,910
Tell them to put their shoes on. Now!

257
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,080
Put them on!

258
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,960
Quickly!

259
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,150
Quickly!

260
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,790
Tell me.

261
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,490
What's going on here?

262
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,440
For this autumn military drill,

263
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,700
because of the parade,

264
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,670
all officers and soldiers
are required to wear leather shoes.

265
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,000
The shoes were all custom-ordered

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,790
by the new quartermaster in Tianjin.

267
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,480
Who knows

268
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,910
how much money he pocketed from this?

269
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,000
The shoes all came out

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,910
too small.

271
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,030
In a whole company, only 11 or 12 men

272
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,150
can actually wear them.

273
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,150
As for the rest...

274
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,130
Is the entire Northern Army

275
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,210
in this situation?

276
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,670
Yes.

277
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,550
All the shoes

278
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,440
were ordered by that quartermaster.

279
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,550
The Commander-in-Chief's brother-in-law,

280
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,480
what's his name?

281
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Qide, with Qi meaning inspiration
and De meaning

282
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,150
virtue.

283
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
Inspiration and virtue?

284
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,640
More like lack of virtue!

285
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,870
If they don't fit,
we can just go barefoot.

286
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,760
Without shoes, we can still defeat them,

287
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,330
can't we?

288
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,550
Yes!

289
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,150
However,

290
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,240
if we go barefoot in the parade,

291
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,240
our steps won't sound crisp and loud.

292
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,440
So just bear with it.

293
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,120
No matter how small
the shoes are, put them on.

294
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,240
We'll throw them away after the parade.

295
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
For the Northern Army,

296
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,360
for our honor,

297
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,170
can you grit your teeth and tough it out?

298
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,410
Yes!

299
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:33,730
[The Qing government holds an autumn military drill
between the Northern and Southern Armies in Zhangde.]

300
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
It's been three full hours.

301
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,480
Sir,

302
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,130
the Southern Army still hasn't arrived.

303
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,980
That's right.

304
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,380
The actors aren't tired,

305
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,460
but the audience's backs are aching.

306
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,050
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

307
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,170
I'm really sorry.

308
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,030
We hit a snag in the last kilometer.

309
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,390
Zhang,

310
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,050
we're all on the Emperor's payroll.

311
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,430
I'm showing you respect,

312
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,840
and you've got to show me some too.

313
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,320
We all need to show

314
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,550
His Majesty and Her Highness

315
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,120
some respect, right?

316
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,150
Of course.

317
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,950
Commander Zhang,

318
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,600
now you know

319
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,330
how long a kilometer is, right?

320
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,550
Is it 4.85 feet?

321
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,730
Sir,

322
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,480
both armies'
artillery units are in position.

323
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,609
The artillery duel

324
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,069
is ready to begin.

325
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,510
Shall we start?

326
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,829
Start.

327
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,750
Start!

328
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Commander Zhang,

329
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,440
from here on,

330
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,200
I really don't dare beat you anymore.

331
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,400
To be honest with you,

332
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,480
Mr. Yuan is having bad luck.

333
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,610
I don't want to cause him more trouble.

334
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,660
The show's about to start!

335
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,170
Southern Army, get ready!

336
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,590
Fire!

337
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,800
Great! Great!

338
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,050
Northern Army, get ready!

339
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,310
Fire!

340
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,410
Awful.

341
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,590
That was awful.

342
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,710
Second round.

343
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,340
Southern Army, get ready!

344
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,200
Fire!

345
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,590
Good, good, good!

346
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,310
Good, good, good!

347
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,790
Excellent!

348
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,830
Good, good, good!

349
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,050
Northern Army, get ready.

350
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,110
Fire!

351
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,030
Third round. Southern Army, get ready!

352
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,510
Fire!

353
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,830
In the third round, the Southern Army

354
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,070
hit all the targets!

355
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,680
Great! Great!

356
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,190
Zhang is indeed
from an artillery background.

357
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,140
He took the wrong road,

358
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,580
but his artillery skills are good.

359
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,820
The Northern Army is upset.

360
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,100
Losing two rounds like that
seems a bit suspicious.

361
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,790
Upset about what?

362
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,110
When two flowers blossom,
each has its own charm.

363
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:14,840
If you ask me,

364
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,250
they both
have their strengths and weaknesses.

365
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,840
Northern Army, third round,

366
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
get ready!

367
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,440
Fire!

368
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,640
They're not firing cannons

369
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,570
but practicing calligraphy.

370
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,310
The impact points are perfectly aligned,

371
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,970
forming the character "one,"

372
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,980
implying number one in the world.

373
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,010
We're indeed not good enough.

374
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,960
The Southern and Northern Armies

375
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,030
have completed
three rounds of artillery competition.

376
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,030
The Southern Army

377
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,680
has won all three rounds.

378
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,110
Great! Great!

379
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,200
Sirs,

380
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,830
the parade of both armies

381
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,200
will begin in one hour.

382
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,790
Please wait a moment.

383
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,880
The Northern Army is upset.

384
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,740
They missed every shot in three rounds.

385
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,680
As the Chief Judge,

386
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,630
how should I handle this?

387
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,400
Sir.

388
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,320
Just pretend you didn't see it.

389
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,560
No.

390
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,310
I can't tolerate the Northern Army's

391
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,790
nonchalant attitude towards
the court's autumn military drill.

392
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,480
As a leader,

393
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,480
I should approach this with authority

394
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,880
and knock the Beiyang Army
down a peg or two.

395
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:14,950
Tufang.

396
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,880
Yesterday in Zhangde,

397
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,830
an assassin dropped a bomb.

398
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,120
Two guards were killed.

399
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,590
Is that so?

400
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,120
The assassin's target

401
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,950
was none other

402
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,700
than you.

403
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,490
It's been confirmed.

404
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,880
The assassin was carrying a photo

405
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,310
clipped from the Shanghai Times

406
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,710
on the 10th of this month.

407
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,340
In his luggage,

408
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,200
we also found

409
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,730
a luggage claim ticket
from a Shanghai hotel.

410
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,830
The Police Department

411
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,510
has already notified the Shanghai Circuit

412
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,310
to assist in the investigation.

413
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
From Shanghai?

414
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,680
Who wants to kill me?

415
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,900
No matter who it is,

416
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,240
for our part,

417
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,910
we'd best keep a low profile
and stay cautious.

418
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,030
Sir.

419
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,350
This is the hotel registry.

420
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,480
Please take a look.

[Nanyang Hotel]

422
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,150

423
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,750
Tianbai.

424
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,400
Tianbai.

425
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Wang Han is in trouble.

426
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,070
The police in the Settlement

427
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,550
have traced it to the Nanyang Hotel.

428
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,080
The hotel staff all know me.

429
00:24:59,130 --> 00:24:59,560
I'm afraid…

430
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,910
The autumn military drill
in Zhangde wrapped up peacefully.

431
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,260
[The autumn military drill
in Zhangde wrapped up smoothly.]

432
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,200
The papers are full of praise,

433
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,440
but no breaking news.

434
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,830
That means Wang Han failed.

435
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,480
His target is still alive.

436
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,290
Who was Wang Han's target?

437
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,420
It doesn't matter anymore.

438
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,030
Oh, right. Go to the bank immediately

439
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,630
and cash out all our savings.

440
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,860
I'm afraid we can't
stay in Shanghai any longer.

441
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,200
Leave the child with Xueqing.

442
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,590
You and I will head straight for Hangzhou.

443
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,590

444
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,440
Qiu Jin in Shaoxing

445
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,640
really needs my help.

446
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,960
We'll go there directly

447
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
and lay low for a while

448
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,720
so they can't trace us here

449
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,050
from the Nanyang Hotel.

450
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,480
What a pity, Miss.

451
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,590
If you cash out everything now,

452
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,310
you'll lose quite a bit of interest.

453
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,960
I know,

454
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,640
but you can't have it both ways, can you?

455
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,830
I want to convert them all into stocks.

456
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,760
I've heard stocks
are more profitable than savings.

457
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,260
That depends on which stock you pick.

458
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,860
Hello, Mr. Song.

459
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,400
Considering seniority

460
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,200
and the past relationship

461
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,660
between our two families,

462
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,440
calling me Mr. Song

463
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,370
feels a bit too formal, doesn't it?

464
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,840
It does.

465
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,920
Uncle.

466
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,220
You're buying stocks?

467
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,350
Yes.

468
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,620
I can recommend two for you.

469
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,130
No, I don't want to trouble you.

470
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,440
How's that trouble?

471
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,720
I know the financial world

472
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
like the back of my hand.

473
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,070
This is what I do.

474
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,230
With the amount you have,

475
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,740
if you trust me…

476
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,750
I ran into Song Chen when I was in Tokyo.

477
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,950
He sent me the photos.

478
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,790
He also told me

479
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,120
that you took the photos.

480
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,700
When I was in Tokyo,

481
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,110
I ran a photography studio.

482
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,030
See?

483
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,830
The branches of our Song family

484
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,070
are a bit too low

485
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,520
to accommodate a phoenix like you.

486
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,790
Buy stocks 056 and 017

487
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,720
for this lady immediately.

488
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,450
Okay, Mr. Song. I'll buy them right away.

489
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,440
You're not
in urgent need of cash, are you?

490
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,530
I do need some cash as well.

491
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,130
Give 200 silver dollars to this lady.

492
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,680
Come up to my office later to complete

493
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,440
the paperwork.

494
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,300
Okay, Mr. Song.

495
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,980
Well…

496
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,440
Song Chen
complained to me about being broke.

497
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,310
He said you took photos for him,

498
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,770
but he hadn't paid you yet.

499
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm paying on his behalf.

500
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,970
I have other matters
to attend to. I must go now.

502
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,030

how did Wang Han fail

504
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,620
to kill Liang Xiang in Zhangde?

505
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,370
Bad luck, I guess.

506
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640

507
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,440
Still as beautiful as ever.

Hongming,

509
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,580
I want to ask you about someone.

510
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Six years ago in Hangzhou,

511
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,310
I met a remarkable man

512
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,240
named Sun Jingchao.

513
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,720
Sun Jingchao?

514
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,750
Sun Jingchao,
leader of the White Cloth Party,

515
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
knows some medicine.

516
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,350
At the peak of the White Cloth Party,

517
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,880
it had up to 20,000 members,

518
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,660
spread across
the seven counties of Fuyang.

519
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,610
Unfortunately,

520
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,970
he was captured by the court

521
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,140
two years ago

522
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,250
and is still imprisoned in Hangzhou.

524
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,960
for a meeting at Datong Academy.

525
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,950
Sun Jingchao was the only one missing.

526
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,910
I see.

527
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,850
I need to see him.

528
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,830
Help me get into the prison.

529
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,370
No way, Tianbai. That's too dangerous.

530
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Shuhong, let me explain.

531
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,490
I don't want to hear it.

532
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,550
How could you?

533
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,830
No matter what,

534
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,310
Liang Xiang is my child's father.

535
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,590
Whether you're enemies or not,

536
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,310
you shouldn't have

537
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:23,830
asked a mother

538
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,090
to kill her child's father.

539
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,700
To hell with that father!

540
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,490
I'm telling you,

541
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,490
I, Wu Tianbai, and that bastard

542
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,960
are mortal enemies!

543
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,070
I will kill him.

544
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,200
What?

545
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,020
Feeling sorry for him?

546
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm talking about my son.

547
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,550
I'm speaking for my son.

548
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,240
What are you on about?

549
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,830
You are feeling sorry for him!

550
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,630
Just admit it.

551
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
If you didn't care,
why are you arguing with me?

552
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,860
How many times have I told you?

553
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,180
That wasn't my choice.

554
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,720
It went completely against my will.

555
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,000
Not your choice?

556
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,270
Listen, Shuhong.

557
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,110
That day, you two weren't alone

558
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,950
when you did those filthy things.

559
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,680
There were three people there.

560
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,850
I was there too!

561
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,240
You're finally telling the truth.

562
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,280
You never trusted me.

563
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,390
You've treated me

564
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,720
like nothing but a tool.

565
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,830
Tell me,

566
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:18,720
how long have you

567
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,830
wanted him dead?

568
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,350
Since the very first day!

569
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,590
For what he did to the country
and to me myself,

570
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,440
any real man would never forget!

571
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,590
Don't expect me to!

572
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,170
I was a fool.

573
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Such a fool.

574
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,480
All these years,

575
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,350
whatever you told me to do,

576
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,310
I did it.

577
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,000
I never questioned right or wrong.

578
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,200
I completely lost myself.

579
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,220
What did I get in return?

580
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,200
Just those words from you.

581
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,310
Wu Tianbai,

582
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,680
you're too heartless.

583
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,870
If you ask me,

584
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,140
you care about no one

585
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,380
but yourself!

586
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,740
Look at me.

587
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,070
My body is covered in scars.

588
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,200
I can't even walk.

589
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,400
I have to lie down just to pee!

590
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,740
Do I still have myself?

591
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,920
If I'd lived for myself,

592
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,030
would I have

593
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,550
ended up like this?

594
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,340
I'm telling you, Shuhong.

595
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,590
A hero battered and broken

596
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,270
is still a hero!

597
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,550
Given Sun Jingchao's

598
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,350
enormous influence
in the seven counties of Fuyang,

599
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,070
the prison gives him special treatment.

600
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,600
They even

601
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,590
allow him

602
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,120
to run a clinic behind bars.

603
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,550
Even some officials

604
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,880
go to him for treatment.

605
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,550
The White Cloth Party

606
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,440
is the largest

607
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,320
of all the parties in Zhejiang.

608
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,720
Seven counties, over 20,000 members.

609
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
If we can

610
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,790
bring these people to our side,

611
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,720
it would be of great help

612
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,480
to Qiu Jin and Xu Xilin's

613
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,830
Zhejiang-Anhui uprising.

614
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,550
Exactly.

615
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,570
It would be such a waste otherwise.

616
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,960
I must see him. I must.

617
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,390
I'll see him in person

618
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,720
to discuss this matter.

619
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,790
You go make contact

620
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,110
with the prison officials.

621
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,110
Even if it costs a lot, it's worth it.

622
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,270
Alright, but the money…

623
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,170
My woman is still mad at me.

624
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,770
Wait until she comes back.

625
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,200
Again?

626
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,940
How long have you two been together now?

627
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,080
Still acting like you just met.

628
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,659
Another 3-3 invasion?

629
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,320
Why do you always like
playing on the third line?

630
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,120
You love flashy moves.

631
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
I just focus on securing territory.

632
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,139
By the way,

633
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,920
I heard from Referee Jiang Fangzhen

634
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,980
that you submitted a memorial

635
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,900
about the autumn military drill.

636
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,960
Is that true?

637
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,980
Baili sure can't keep his mouth shut.

638
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,290
What exactly are you trying to do?

639
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,090
You've barely got your footing,

640
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,150
and you're already poking the bear?

641
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,550
If the army continues like this,

642
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,840
what future does it have?

643
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,920
Back in the Banner Battalion,

644
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,320
I was always a troublemaker.

645
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,449
Old habits die hard.

646
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,190
Kaizhi,

647
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,830
let me introduce you.

648
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,510
This is my wife.

649
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,050
What do you think?

650
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,160
Even better than your Miss Li, right?

651
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,840
A beauty. A beauty.

652
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,630
A real beauty.

653
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,630
In what way is she beautiful?

654
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,960
A true beauty is one

655
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,190
with the appearance of a flower,
the voice of a bird,

656
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,650
the spirit of the moon,
the grace of a willow,

657
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,110
bones like jade, skin like ice and snow,

658
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,820
the poise of autumn waters,

659
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
and a heart of poetry.

660
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,880
Hear that?

661
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,880
This is the man
I've been telling you about…

662
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,010
Yang Kaizhi, right?

663
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,150
Who else but him

664
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:32,070
could praise a woman like that,

665
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,690
chirping away like a thrush?

666
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,850
This way, he's here.

667
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,350
You are…

668
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,020
[Tuoteke Duanfang, Viceroy of Liangjiang]

669
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,860
I'm Tuoteke Duanfang,

670
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,460
courtesy name Wuqiao.

671
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Nice to meet you, madam.

672
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,000
No need for formalities.

673
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,230
Mr. Duanfang,

674
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,280
Viceroy of Liangjiang.

675
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,840
By seniority,

676
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,230
you should just call me Duanfang.

677
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,040
It feels more familiar that way.

678
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,030
Go tell Xiang that
Viceroy Duanfang is here.

679
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes.

680
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,320
My house isn't far from here.

681
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,290
I thought I'd stop by.

682
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,330
I heard your son just returned

683
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,510
from the autumn military drill.

684
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,320
Forgive me for not welcoming you properly.

685
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,680
Viceroy Duanfang.

686
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,370
Tufang, it's a pleasure to meet you.

687
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,970
Viceroy Duanfang,
I'll leave you two to chat.

688
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,630
Okay.

689
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,590
You sure have some high-ranking guests.

690
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,150
He's a big shot?

691
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,930
Looks like a mediocre,
withered old man to me.

692
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,590
This man is far from mediocre.

693
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,710
Among the Bannermen,
those who earned their positions

694
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,710
through the Imperial Exam are rare.

695
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,350
He's one of the few.

696
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,870
Tufang,

697
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,710
it's a bit plain here.

698
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
Later, I'll have someone send over a pot

699
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,260
of bird plum blossoms.

700
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,810
My mother arranged everything here.

701
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,150
She likes it simple.

702
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,520
I just came from Jiangning
the day before yesterday.

703
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,480
Xiangcheng sang your praises,

704
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,190
saying you're a rare new military talent

705
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,510
among us Bannermen.

706
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,070
Yuan Xiangcheng, Mr. Yuan?

707
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,760
What, you two haven't met yet?

708
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,440
That's not right.

709
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,650
You work on military affairs,

710
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,070
yet you haven't gotten
acquainted with Yuan Xiangcheng.

711
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,730
That's just making things
harder for yourself.

712
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
I'll arrange it in a few days.

713
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,240
People need to interact.

714
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,960
How can you
become close without interaction?

715
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,320
If you're not close,

716
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,070
how can you work together?

717
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm just a junior.

718
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:43,920
Getting close with

719
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,230
a high-ranking official

720
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,160
feels improper.

721
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,510
It might look like
I'm trying to climb the ladder.

722
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,480
Yuan Xiangcheng

723
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,320
isn't as bad as some people say.

724
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,730
In and out of the court nowadays,

725
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,570
officials

726
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,760
with vision, capability, and ambition

727
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,150
like him

728
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,230
are not too many, but too few.

729
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,670
Just look at

730
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,400
how he's governed Tianjin.

731
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,360
It's improving day by day.

732
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,400
We Bannermen

733
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,070
need to let go of our old prejudices.

734
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,920
I didn't bring much for this first visit,

735
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,930
just a calligraphy piece I wrote.

736
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:34,920
It's a couplet from Emperor Yongzheng.

737
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,800
"To judge people wisely,
one must learn broadly and listen widely."

738
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,920
He's truly a refined gentleman.

739
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,240
Duanfang's calligraphy

740
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,880
is really quite good.

741
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,920
But what's his intention?

742
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,900
Is he acting
as a go-between for Yuan Shikai?

743
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,230
He and Yuan Shikai

744
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,440
have become in-laws.

745
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,360
What else could he mean?

746
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,990
So that's actually true?

747
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,900
One is the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

748
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,380
the other of Zhili.

749
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,840
So Jiangning and Tianjin

750
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:19,400
are family now.

751
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,630
A man of his rank

752
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,200
visiting me personally…

753
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,570
I really don't know what to make of it.

754
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,000
So, my son,

755
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,080
in this world,

756
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,710
there's no absolute right or wrong.

757
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,480
Five years ago,

758
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,630
the rules set by our ancestors

759
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,440
forbade intermarriage between Manchu and Han.

760
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,570
Back then, that was considered wrong.

761
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,270
But five years later,

762
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,930
intermarriage
between Manchu and Han became right.

763
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,470
No right or wrong?

764
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,000
If that's really the case,

765
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm stuck in a tight spot.

766
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,550
Yuan Shikai
has been transferred to Beijing

767
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,320
and appointed as a grand councilor.

768
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,230
Zaifeng has also joined

769
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,290
the Grand Council.

770
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,410
These two are at odds again.

771
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,020
Today, Duanfang came,

772
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,360
and yesterday, Zaixun came.

773
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
They both came to recruit me.

774
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,200
I really don't know whose side to take.

775
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,870
Do your own thing.

776
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,820
Don't worry about others' opinions,

777
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,490
not even Kaizhi's.

778
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,480
In my opinion,

779
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,320
he's not the type

780
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,580
to be content playing a supporting role.

781
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,480
You really

782
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,010
don't need me to go with you?

783
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,620
I was a bit impulsive that day.

784
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,990
Don't take it to heart.

785
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,710
This sounds like a farewell speech.

786
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,980
You stay here.

787
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,180
Don't go anywhere.

788
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,440
If anything happens to me,

789
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,330
go straight back to Shanghai.

790
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,040
The child always needs
someone to take care of him.

791
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,290
I got it.

792
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,660
Be careful.

793
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:48,860
If I walk back,

794
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,640
don't be too shocked.

795
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,890
[Hangzhou Prison]

796
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,760
Mr. Sun.

797
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,290
The guy from Shanghai is here.

798
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,400
Are you feeling up to it today?

799
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,150
If so, I'll let him in.

800
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,110
If not, I'll send him away.

801
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,610
[Sun Jingchao, head of the White Cloth Party]

802
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,360
Let him in, Kuan.

803
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,750
Okay.

804
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,550
Come in.

805
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,760
You guys

806
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,150
are lucky

807
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,150
to catch Mr. Sun

808
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,960
in good spirits today.

809
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:40,920
Normally,

810
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,000
Mr. Sun wouldn't treat you
for any amount of money.

811
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,860
Thank you, sir.

812
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,730
Are you alright?

813
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,160
Mr. Sun, I'll leave you to it.

814
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,410
When you're done,

815
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,890
just call me, okay?
