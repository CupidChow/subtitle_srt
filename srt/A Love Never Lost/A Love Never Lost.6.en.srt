[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,940
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,079
Where did you go?

4
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,310
I pawned the jewelry.

5
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,329
Such a fine pair of earrings

6
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,430
only got me this much money.

7
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,590
They're heartless.

8
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,110
I have to go out later.

9
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,050
It'll be

10
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,950
a few days.

11
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,940
Take care of yourself.

12
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,080
Where are you going?

13
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,290
Do you really think you're...

14
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,080
Let me put it this way.

15
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,310
My job

16
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
is a revolutionist.

17
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,010
A professional revolutionist, you know?

18
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,840
But our room and board fees

19
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
are due.

20
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,650
Wait for me to get back.

21
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,710
Delay it a bit more.

22
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,030
Miss.

23
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,120
Coming.

24
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,960
Madam,

25
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
please come in.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,910
Why hasn't Mr. Wu come back yet?

27
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,350
It's been days.

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,030
Yes,

29
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,340
it's been days.

30
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,470
He has business matters.

31
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,990
It's easy to lend money these days,

32
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,120
but it's hard to get money back.

33
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,610
Business?

34
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,360
He's doing business?

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,160
Yes.

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,600
He's been working on it and invested a lot of money.

37
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
Otherwise, my budget wouldn't be so tight.

38
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,200
Cut it out.

39
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,800
He can do business?

40
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,630
He's probably run off again.

41
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,890
Run off?

42
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,659
Just because of your room and board?

43
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,470
It's not the first time.

44
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,520
I don't understand what you're talking about.

45
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,920
Miss,

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,070
I know him better than you do.

47
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,920
Are you learning Japanese?

48
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,330
You're really good at writing.

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,270
I have some good books here.

50
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,150
I'll find them for you later.

51
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,600
Cut it out.

52
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
He can do business?

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,830
He's probably run off again.

54
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,560
I know him better than you do.

55
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,600
It's raining heavily.

56
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,720
Get up, get up.

57
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,120
How can you sleep so early?

58
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,190
Get up.

59
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,480
Get up.

60
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,160
We should have had a drink long ago.

61
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,870
As women,

62
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,160
why should we mistreat ourselves?

63
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,380
Come on, drink.

64
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,630
You two sleep separately?

65
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,040
I don't believe

66
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,630
a cat can sleep with a salted fish next to it.

67
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,000
To be honest,

68
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,920
I never charged him

69
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,510
when he stayed here before.

70
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,120
Why is that?

71
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,750
Why do you think?

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,420
It's because he's charming.

73
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,510
He

74
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,340
stayed here the first time he came to Tokyo.

75
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,190
At that time,

76
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,520
I really liked him.

77
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,960
I see.

78
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,160
But he doesn't like me.

79
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,090
See, he ran away again.

80
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,370
You said he does business.

81
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,390
What business can he do?

82
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,830
Drink.

83
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,670
You're going out?

84
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
It can't be cheaper.

85
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,470
This is the lowest price in Tokyo.

86
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,669
What do these Chinese people

87
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,350
take us as?

88
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
A pigsty?

89
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,360
How can you even suggest

90
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,360
five yen per month?

91
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,000
[Bamboo]

92
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,240
You're back?

93
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
No news.

94
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,250
No news at all.

95
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,900
Don't feel ashamed.

96
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,910
We're both women.

97
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,270
I won't kick you out.

98
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,160
If you feel bad,

99
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
you can help me clean the guest room

100
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,670
and help me with the kitchen.

101
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
Private Liang Xiang.

102
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,080
Yes, sir.

103
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,240
How many pigs did the black sow lay?

104
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,240
Eleven in total, sir.

105
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Eat your food.

106
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,240
Yes, sir.

107
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,320
You lit a joss stick in the pigsty,

108
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,030
I saw.

109
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,840
Who were you praying to?

110
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,850
It's the god that rules over the livestock.

111
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,960
One of your Chinese gods?

112
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,670
I don't know which country it belongs to.

113
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,270
The Banner Battalion's horses

114
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,020
were fed by all soldiers.

115
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,320
We had to pay if they died,

116
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,440
so everyone burned incense and prayed to the god.

117
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,630
I see.

118
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,630
You were

119
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,630
blessing our black sow.

120
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,630
It really worked.

121
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,790
It had 11 piglets.

122
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,880
We'll have pork next year.

123
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,320
Private Liang Xiang.

124
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,630
Yes, sir.

125
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,550
From tomorrow onwards,

126
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,550
you don't have to feed pigs anymore.

127
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,910
Join t

128
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,350
the training of infantry squadron officially,

129
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,230
understand?

130
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,120
Yes, sir.

131
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,790
Hurry!

132
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,120
Keep up.

133
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:23,910
Hurry!

134
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Hurry up.

135
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,750
Hurry up.

136
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,550
How did you

137
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,440
manage to survive?

138
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,570
Your gear must weigh 30 kilograms, right?

139
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,380
Hurry up.

140
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,630
Isn't yours the same?

141
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Are you carrying your squad's tarp?

142
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,240
Yes.

143
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,370
I have the lowest position.

144
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,340
Who else would carry it?

145
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,000
Everyone,

146
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,450
field operations begin now.

147
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,560
-Yes!
-Yes!

148
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,730
Looks like

149
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,840
feeding pigs

150
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,040
is much easier.

151
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,790
Come here.

152
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,000
Look at the Japanese soldiers.

153
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,130
All of you completed

154
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
the 24-kilometer march.

155
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,599
Private Liang Xiang!

156
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,500
Are you impressed now?

157
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,830
Yes, sir.

158
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,110
I really admire them.

159
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,680
You can't just admire them.

160
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,700
You have to find the reason.

161
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Yang is also Chinese.

162
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,030
Why can he do it...

163
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,270
But you can't?

164
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,750
You are embarrassing my squad,

165
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,590
making it seem as if

166
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,750
I'm not as good as Sergeant Kawashima.

167
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,240
Go.

168
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,240
Have Yang Kaizhi teach you

169
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,110
to see what the problem is.

170
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,880
Yes.

171
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,070
Yang Kaizhi.

172
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,640
Tell me,

173
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,080
what trick are you pulling this time?

174
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,510
With your body,

175
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,910
you're no better than me.

176
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,090
I don't believe it.

177
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,720
Did you

178
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,920
bribe your sergeant?

179
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,960
No one can dig

180
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,670
the rocky land

181
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,750
your sergeant assigned to you.

182
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,480
He's clearly messing with you.

183
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,510
My sergeant

184
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,240
treats me well.

185
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,160
Look at this soil.

186
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,240
I put the spade in

187
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,610
and the soil comes out.

188
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,880
Put the spade in

189
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,110
and the soil comes out.

190
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,110
Put the spade in.

191
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,590
What are you looking at? Go dig your rocks.

192
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,790
Yang Kaizhi,

193
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,280
damn you.

194
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,940
Add some firewood.

195
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,310

and you're already desperate?

208
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,120
Actually,

It's from China.

Who sent it?

213
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,730

Your mother?

216
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,550
Yes,

217
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,510
It's my mother.

218

Buy with my credit.

227
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,870
Fifteen yen for one.

228

Miss, you're Chinese?

230
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,090
You are also Chinese?

Do I not look like it?

232
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,930
With your braid cut, you look Japanese.

233

The tip is thick

237

but not very flexible.

238
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,590
Will you use it for writing or drawing?

239
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,160
Drawing.

240
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,130
You can try preparing the brush

241
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,530
by filling it up with ink.

242
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,830
The next time you use it,

243
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,370
it'll be easier to handle

245

No. My family also sells brushes.

247

Really?

248
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,930
How did you, a Chinese girl,

00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,860
end up in Tokyo by selling brushes?

250
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,860
My family's brushes aren't this expensive.

251
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,240
Then what are you doing in Tokyo?

252

It's so expensive.

257
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,330
It's priced according to the size.

258
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,750
If the painting is bigger,

259
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,810
it may be even more expensive.

260
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560

261
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,910

is to help the store contact the artists.

278

279
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,510
have their eyes on an artist's work,

280
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,590

You don't have to worry about this.

I don't want to follow others' wishes.

340

I don't want others to take care of me.

You're not allowed to do this work.

342
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,200
I won't allow it.

343
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,380
Why should I listen to you?

344
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
It's not suitable.

345
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,480
Why not?

346
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,670
I'm bad at speaking Japanese

347
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,980
and need to bring a list

348

Do you think they hired you because you're capable?

352
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,150
I didn't say I'm capable.

353
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
I met a great painter.

354
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,030
He helped me get the job.

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,310
Why would he help you?

356
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,210
Think about it.

357
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,750
Why would

358
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,280
something so great happen?

359
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,750
He was willing to help me.

360
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,660
I told you, you're not allowed to do this.

361
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,120
I know people like them.

362
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,200
You deliver a painting, send some money,

363
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,680
and they give you 35 yen a month?

364
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,640
Use your brain.

365
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
Think whatever you want.

Actually,

373
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,210
we should have talked long ago.

374
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
Do you hear me talking to you?

375
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,030
Shuhong, do you know

376

It's a great era.

380
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,990
A so-called great era

381
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,000
is a time where you either live or die.

382
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:09,940
Do you know

383
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,160
that China

384
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,560
is facing its biggest change

385
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,790
in the last 3,000 years?

386
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,900
The court is corrupted.

387
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,540
The country has lost its sovereignty.

388
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,750
What should we do?

389
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,840
Just watch our country and people perish?

390
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,720
So...

391
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,400
So, people like us are needed

392
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,720
to fearlessly and tirelessly

393
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,680
change the fate of this country.

394
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,550
The fate of China

395
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,510
is in all of our hands.

396
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,820
Our personal dreams

397
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:49,000
and fates are intertwined

398
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,430
with the country's fate.

399
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,780
It's inseparable.

400
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,110
What I want to do

401
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,680
is to open up

402
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,280
a new possibility for China.

403
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,160
This is my ideal.

404
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,680
It doesn't matter

405
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,930
if people support me or not.

406
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,470
I'll keep going forward.

407
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,910
I know it to be impossible but will do it anyway.

408
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,920
What's the true meaning of an ideal?

409
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,550
It's not the result

410
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,810
that you get at the end,

411
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,200
but the process.

412
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,680
The real meaning

413
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,880
is the process.

414
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,470
Didn't you also say

415
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,710
that your purpose of life

416
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,200
is to make

417
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,830
your neighbors in Anqing

418
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,200
praise your parents?

419
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,370
What's wrong with that?

420
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,790
I think

421
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,070
that one day,

422
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,800
they will praise your parents.

423
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
You're speaking nonsense again.

424
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,120
How is that nonsense?

425
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,590
I'm serious.

426
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,420
The world will change.

427
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,330
Don't be skeptical.

428
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,750
People will change too.

429
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,550
Sooner or later,

430
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,960
they will praise your parents

431
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,890
for giving birth

432
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,110
to such a good daughter for the country.

433
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm already in this state

434
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
and you're still complimenting me like this.

435
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,270
Do you really think I'm stupid?

436
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,030
No.

437
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,440
I think

438
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,620
you have infinite potential.

439
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,270
Really.

440
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,640
I thought you would

441
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:24,650
fare badly

442
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,930
while I was away.

443
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,130
But you have infinite potential.

444
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,110
You found yourself a job.

445
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,640
You

446
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,030
are a woman with infinite potential.

447
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,240
Actually, everyone

448
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,550
has potential

449
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,950
that they're unaware of.

450
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,680
Sometimes, this potential

451
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,000
can be boundless.

452
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,330
Stop being deceptive.

453
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,640
Even if you

454
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,830
trick a bird to come down,

455
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,490
I'm still going to work at the art shop tomorrow.

456
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,480
I want to rely on my own ability,

457
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,210
instead of someone's charity.

458
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,920
I'm not insisting on stopping you.

459
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,400
I...

460
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,930
I'm afraid you'll get tricked.

461
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,400
Look at you.

462
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,070
You're a Chinese girl

463
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,960
in a big city like Tokyo.

464
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,190
There are too many

465
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,360
temptations.

466
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,190
I've even been tricked by you.

467
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,000
What else can I fall for?

468
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,150
No matter how big Tokyo is,

469
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,800
it's hard to find

470
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,679
to find another Wu Tianbai.

471
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,480
That’s why

472
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,960
I am unique.

473
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,150
If you really want to find someone like me,

474
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,590
you won't be able to find him.

475
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,670
All you can do is brag.

476
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
What can you do

477
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,920
other than brag about yourself?

478
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,760
If you don't believe me,

479
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,070
you can ask Zhaofang.

480
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,670
He will arrive the next day.

481
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,360
Isn’t Cheng Zhaofang your idol?

482
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,150
Ask him

483
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,190
and see what he'll say

484
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,389
about me, Wu Tianbai.

485
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,960
Mr. Cheng is in Tokyo?

486
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,360
So...

487
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,239
What is he doing in Tokyo?

488
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,330
Right now,

489
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:50,960
Tokyo is

490
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,710
the base of the revolutionists.

491
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,480
Those who are capable

492
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,280
all come here.

493
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,000
So...

494
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,030
Shut up.

495
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,590
You just paint a pretty fantasy every day

496
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,070
without investing anything.

497
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,400
Can I eat or drink it?

498
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,030
No, I still have to earn a living by myself.

499
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,590
Sleep!

500
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,430
I am very satisfied

501
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,200
with the squad's technical shooting performance

502
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,230
today.

503
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,070
I just

504
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,920
discussed with Sergeant Kawashima.

505
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,320
We want to see how capable

506
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
you Chinese military students are

507
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,960
without the local Japanese soldiers.

508
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,140
How about this?

509
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,000
Choose three

510
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,210
from the Chinese military students.

511
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,840
The Inukai Regiment

512
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,500
will also choose three people

513
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,160
for the competition.

514
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,030
What do you think?

515
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,790
Private Liang Xiang!

516
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,360
Fall out.

517
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,510
Yes.!

518
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,670
You'll be the leader.

519
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,670
You pick two Chinese students

520
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,980
to represent the military students.

521
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,760
Understand?

522
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,230
Yes,

523
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,590
sergeant.

524
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,400
As for the Japanese soldiers,

525
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,730
we don't need to choose.

526
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,360
I will choose randomly.

527
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,670
You.

528
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,400
Yes.

529
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,360
You.

530
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,740
Yes.

531
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,440
You.

532
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,850
Yes.

533
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,480
Fall out.

534
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,350
Private Liang Xiang.

535
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:17,920
Yes.

536
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,430
It won't be us, right?

537
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,710
Li Renjun!

538
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,360
Yes!

539
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,810
Fall out.

540
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,110
Here.

541
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,760
And...

542
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,650
Yang Kaizhi.

543
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,230
Me?

544
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:42,640
Yes, you.

545
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:43,990
Yes!

546
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,690
Can you do it?

547
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,070
He's making me do this unprepared.

548
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,070
All of those people

549
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,190
are better than me.

550
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,410
Why did he have to choose me?

551
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,090
You're brave.

552
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,480
You're not even afraid of death.

553
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,940
Why are you afraid of this?

554
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:14,800
It's okay.

555
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,620
Not to brag,

556
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,260
but target practice

557
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,990
is no big deal for the Wuwei Corps Right Division.

558
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,510
We know the ropes.

559
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,710
We have to teach the Japanese

560
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,590
a lesson today.

561
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,090
Aim more to the right.

562
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,640
There's a crosswind.

563
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
It seems that

564
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,760
we must

565
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,280
reacquaint ourselves

566
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,090
with the Chinese military students.

567
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,660
This is so embarrassing.

568
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,190
Takeda Yuichi missed the target.

569
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,340
What a fool.

570
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,930
Well done, guys.

571
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:33,760
We defeated the whole

572
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Inukai Regiment.

573
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,150
I was wondering

574
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,680
how I could rank at the top

575
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,150
with my level.

576
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,590
You're just lucky.

577
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,590
My luck is usually so-so,

578
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,840
but my good luck

579
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,040
is all spent on moments of life or death.

580
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,330
We have a break tonight.

581
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,280
How about we have some fun outside?

582
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,300
You're going to decide on the place

583
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,230
and make me and Liang Xiang pay again, aren't you?

584
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,150
No,

585
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,490
someone else will pay tonight.

586
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,550
Liang Xiang,

587
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:02,960
you have to come.

588
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
They want to meet you.

589
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,480
Who are they?

590
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,880
They are court officials

591
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,560
who just came from China

592
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,920
and attended the National Industrial Exhibition in Osaka.

593
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,400
You kid

594
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,970
even got involved with the court officials.

595
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Can't I get to know

596
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,840
an official?
