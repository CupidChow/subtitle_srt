[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,970
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,120
It doesn't

4
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,759
sound relevant to me.

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Does it have anything to do

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,370
with everyone present?

7
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,759
Who cares about my pay?

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,479
Who cares about my job?

9
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,039
You literates are only

10
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,120
patronizing us with fancy words.

11
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,770
I always hold the belief

12
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,430
a strong army

13
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,169
is a nation's backbone.

14
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,570
What makes a qualified

15
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,070
army man is integrity.

16
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,970
Integrity overcomes hypocrisy.

17
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,370
Integrity debunks falsehoods.

18
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,500
For an army man who swears to protect the country,

19
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
only caring about his job

20
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,340
and pay, while turning a deaf ear to

21
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,470
to the impoverished

22
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,650
masses' voice is wrong.

23
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm just being honest.

24
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,430
Everybody,

25
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,930
think about what "revolution" means.

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,690
To simply put,

27
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,010
"revolution" is a way

28
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,340
to change fate.

29
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,030
Not just our fate,

30
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,370
an individual's fate,

31
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,970
but also the fate of

32
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,810
all the poor

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,420
and suffering people

34
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,540
who are barely fed and clothed.

35
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,530
Injustice can be

36
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,540
eliminated by revolutions.

37
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,010
Old restraints can be

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,030
shattered by revolutions.

39
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,340
Officers,

40
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,670
the old times have passed.
A new era is yet to come.

41
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,830
It's time we started a revolution

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,570
to restore...

43
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,150
Nonsense!

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,630
I'm going to kill you!

45
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,370
Guards, take him away!

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,250
You're a traitor, a rebel!

47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,060
Unfaithful saboteur!

48
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
You unscrupulous

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,970
betrayer!

50
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,720
I despise you,

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,730
obnoxious traitor!

52
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,200
Kaizhi,

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,470
that was a close one.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,400
We almost all got killed.

55
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,870
Be seated.

56
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,090
Everyone,

57
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,630
that little accident happened

58
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,410
because I didn't make things clear.

59
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,740
Now, I'll get to the point.

60
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,130
The main force of Beiyang Army

61
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,500
is concentrated in Wuchang.

62
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,060
Beijing is vulnerable now.

63
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,410
If you all follow my lead

64
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,870
at this particular moment

65
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,650
to start an uprising

66
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,810
and attack Beijing,

67
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,220
I'm sure it won't take any bloodshed

68
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,370
for us to appease the capital troops

69
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,220
and overturn the monarchy.

70
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,209
We'll send messages to the southeast

71
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,810
to prevent confrontations.

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,570
Then, a brand new era

73
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,810
will be forged.

74
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,950
Why bother telegraphing the court about

75
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,780
establishing constitutional monarchy?

76
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,690
-Bravo!
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

77
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,250
What's wrong?

78
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,690
For the forthcoming revolution,

79
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,500
I need you to go

80
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,700
to Wuchang instantly

81
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,130
to ask the revolutionary army

82
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,810
there to carry out our joint plan.

83
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,210
I expect the troops in Wuhan
to attack and contain

84
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,330
Beiyang Army's main force
in the north of Hubei

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,690
to prevent the latter from
assigning backup to Beijing.

86
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,130
Yes!

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,980
Report!

88
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,909
Pacification Commissioner Yang.

89
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,890
Make sure

90
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,130
you deliver this letter

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,360
to Yan Xishan, leader of Shanxi revolutionary army,

92
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,020
so that we and the new army there

93
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,690
can form an alliance as soon as possible

94
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,450
and attack Beijing together.

95
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:48,890
Got it.

96
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,130
Gentlemen,

97
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,250
this is a make-or-break moment.

98
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,180
Our future hinges on this move.

99
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,300
This three-pronged plan

100
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,700
to conquer Beijing seems

101
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,890
meticulous to me.

102
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
I'm ready

103
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,450
to risk my life for the battle.

104
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,210
Kaizhi,

105
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,350
[Lan Tianwei]
[Commander of the Second Mixed Brigade]

106
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,690
the one remaining area

107
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:10,980
of concern is your friend now.

108
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,740
Li Renjun is

109
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,370
a staunch supporter of Yuan.

110
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,970
Are you sure you can
have him under control?

111
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,690
Report!

112
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,570
The Ministry of War in Beijing

113
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,130
has a message for
Pacification Commissioner Yang.

114
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,690
Say it.

115
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,810
"Upon receiving this telegram,

116
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,810
return to Zhentou immediately

117
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,690
to lead the Sixth Division

118
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,770
to suppress Yan Xishan's rebel forces in Shanxi.

119
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,970
No delay is allowed."

120
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,180
Sounds like a trick.

121
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,010
They're afraid of me uniting

122
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,409
with the Sixth Division.

123
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,510
Why would they suddenly...

124
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,750
Kaizhi,

125
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,710
isn't it just perfect?

126
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,680
This telegram can be our excuse

127
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,690
to take away Li Renjun's power

128
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,090
of commanding a brigade.

129
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,130
It seems too good to be true.

130
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,590
You were wishing for help,

131
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,540
and now help is here.

132
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,810
Report!

133
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,740
Commander Zhang,

134
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,690
for unknown reasons,

135
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,300
half an hour ago,

136
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,180
all the trains at

137
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,980
Luanzhou Station

138
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,740
just left.

139
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,690
Not one stayed.

140
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,450
Have you asked the railway authorities?

141
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,180
They replied

142
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,980
that it was the capital's order.

143
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,870
Someone must've tipped them off.

144
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,980
Impossible.

145
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,570
Could it be that quick?

146
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,620
Without trains,

147
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,500
our units can't

148
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,160
reach Beijing in a short time.

149
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,690
Take action now, guys.

150
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,570
You two sort out the problem

151
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,370
about trains

152
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,690
and stabilize the troops,

153
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,890
while I go back to Zhentou.

154
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,890
As for the details,

155
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,130
we'll communicate via telegram.

156
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,690
Okay.

157
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,890
Ma Buzhou!

158
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,890
Here I am!

159
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,690
Get me a horse. I'm heading to Zhentou.

160
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,570
Yes!

161
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,030
Those in Beijing must be
onto something now.

162
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,850
But there is no turning back.

163
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,540
If necessary, we'll have to

164
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,310
complete the mission with our blood.

165
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,690
Goodbye, you two.

166
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,770
What lies ahead

167
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,570
is danger.

168
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,740
Our backs are against the wall.

169
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,590
What's going on?

170
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,180
Wait for a while, please.

171
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,970
Don't you see?

172
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,850
It's a carriage of the Imperial Guards.

173
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,450
How dare you stand in the way?

174
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,810
Sorry.

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,970
Just a sec.

176
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,490
Who is it?

177
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,060
The mounted soldiers

178
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,610
are in Beiyang Army uniforms.

179
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,540
They must be escorting

180
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,970
the Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet,
who just arrived today.

181
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,430
The Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet?

182
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,890
You mean Yuan Shikai?

183
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,420
Who else than he

184
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,280
would make such a grand entrance?

185
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,300
You're right.

186
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,170
In the blink of an eye,

187
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,750
he got a brand new title.

188
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,420
My Lady,

189
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,060
what can I do?

190
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,060
My life has turned

191
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,420
into a living hell!

192
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,000
Laixi?

193
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,650
What brings you here?

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,120
My dear Young Master!

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
The world has changed.

196
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,060
Before I realized it,

197
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,010
the Shanghai Patrol and Defense Battalion I led

198
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,270
had turned against the Qing government.

199
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,400
Even now, I still don't know

200
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,450
how that happened.

201
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,290
Get up.

202
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,420
Did you come from Shanghai?

203
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,960
Y-Yes.

204
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,820
The reformists took over
Shanghai five days ago.

205
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,570
That night,

206
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,060
when I went back indoors

207
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,690
after taking a pee,

208
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,690
the two deputy battalion commanders

209
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,210
came in and told me

210
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,070
that if I joined the anti-Qing battle,

211
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,060
I'd still be the battalion commander.

212
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,420
If I refused,

213
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,180
they wouldn't kill me,

214
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,330
but I had to go back to my hometown.

215
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,450
What could I say?

216
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,380
They had long been in collusion

217
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,910
with the revolutionaries.

218
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,330
What a shame.

219
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,830
What a huge shame!

220
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,570
Shanghai just

221
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,570
caved in, without none

222
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,420
of the military and police units

223
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,280
firing

224
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,260
a single shot, except for

225
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,460
the Jiangnan General

226
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,570
Manufacturing Bureau.

227
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,810
In just one night,

228
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
white flags appeared everywhere

229
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,810
faster than one could imagine.

230
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,420
What made you

231
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,090
come to Beijing?

232
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,610
I couldn't bring myself
to continue working

233
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,670
as the battalion commander, could I?

234
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,420
I was put under siege by

235
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,970
the deputy commanders

236
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,830
before I made an attempt to fight.

237
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,300
They weren't harsh on me, though.

238
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,570
They helped me pack up my stuff

239
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,450
and sent me to Shiliupu Pier,

240
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,970
so that I could leave.

241
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,490
But...

242
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,720
But where was I supposed to go?

243
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,490
I became a personal guard

244
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,300
for your grandfather at 14.

245
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I realized

246
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,740
that Beijing was my only choice,

247
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
where Her Ladyship lives.

248
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,060
Young Master,

249
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,780
I could only turn to you.

250
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,820
Don't you see?

251
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,210
Young Master,

252
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,270
please let me stay!

253
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,060
I can be a gardener

254
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,180
or a gatekeeper

255
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,690
as you please!

256
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,570
My Lady...

257
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,610
Laixi!

258
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,420
I beg you!

259
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,300
Laixi!

260
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,210
Get up.

261
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,940
You silly man.

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,940
Why didn't you just

263
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,180
join in the anti-Qing movement?

264
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,240
Weren't you a fool?

265
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,570
Young Master,

266
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,060
how could I do that?

267
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
It was your grandfather

268
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,490
who saved my life,

269
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,300
when many others died.

270
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,370
Going against

271
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,610
the Qing government is equal

272
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,340
to going against him, isn't it?

273
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,490
I don't mind losing my job as an official.

274
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,970
All I want is

275
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,180
a clear conscience.

276
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:35,330
Duo Mei,

277
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,030
take Laixi to a guest room.

278
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,210
Let him settle in.

279
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,390
Commander Laixi,

280
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,300
this way.

281
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,070
Thanks, Young Master.

282
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,150
Thanks, My Lady.

283
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,110
I can do it myself.

284
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,180
Has the situation

285
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,060
really become this bad?

286
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,060
Shanghai yielded

287
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,210
in just one night?

288
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,550
I just visited the Japanese legation.

289
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,450
Attaché Hirata told me

290
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,450
that London seemed to

291
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,630
have telegraphed the British envoy,

292
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,210
asking him to openly show

293
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,060
support for Yuan Shikai
being the chief political leader

294
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,690
and facilitating a truce between

295
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,020
the north and the south.

296
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,450
The foreigners are touching
the court's core interests.

297
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,180
Don't they have respect for Prince Regent?

298
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,420
I'm afraid

299
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,900
he'll have to step down.

300
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,420
Step down?

301
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,810
The British are acting

302
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,210
like thugs, aren't they?

303
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,060
Hirata said,

304
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,180
London would sacrifice

305
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,690
the entire

306
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,970
royalty of Qing

307
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,770
as a way to show support for Yuan.

308
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,490
Could it be that

309
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,820
Hirata was lying to you?

310
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,580
You have no idea, Mother.

311
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,620
The chaos has posed threats to Beijing.

312
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,230
A tip-off just came from Luanzhou,

313
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,690
saying that Yang Kaizhi,
Zhang Shaozeng and Lan Tianwei

314
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,150
plan to lead two divisions

315
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,410
and one brigade to raid Beijing.

316
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,810
Is it true?

317
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,810
In that case,

318
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,570
why are you still chatting with me?

319
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,690
The new Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet has arrived.

320
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,950
Yuan Shikai is bound to

321
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,820
deal with whatever is about to happen.

322
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,730
All soldiers,

323
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,850
line up by regiments

324
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,180
to get winter uniforms.

325
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
All soldiers,

326
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,870
line up by regiments

327
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,320
to get winter uniforms.

328
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,970
Maichen, I'm telling you.

329
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,170
You must execute the command

330
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,420
of attacking Niangzi Pass!

331
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,090
Just like you, I'd hate to

332
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,570
fight against the revolutionary militias in Shanxi.

333
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,940
But it's our job to follow orders!

334
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,570
The 24th Regiment must commit

335
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,610
the military deployments set along

336
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,470
the Zhengding-Taiyuan Railway!

337
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,520
Brigade Commander Zhou,

338
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
why are you here?

339
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,300
At Yuan Shikai's secret order,

340
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,940
I've come to the Sixth Division's rescue.

341
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Mr. Yuan?

342
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,220
Giddy-up!

343
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,810
Giddy-up!

344
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,200
Giddy-up!

345
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,180
Glad to see you, Governor.

346
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,450
"Governor"?

347
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,660
A telegram came from the court,

348
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,060
appointing you to be
the Governor of Shanxi.

349
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,990
You're required to go to Shanxi now

350
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,340
to suppress the revolutionaries there.

351
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,300
Where are Maichen and Colonel Feng?

352
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,540
Maichen is with the 24th Regiment,

353
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,420
depositing troops along

354
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,280
the Zhengding-Taiyuan Railway.

355
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,450
Gather all the officers above

356
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,730
the battalion commanders
of the Sixth Division

357
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,730
for a meeting now.

358
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,980
I have an announcement to make.

359
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,690
Sure.

360
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,900
Go!

361
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,970
Have all the officers assemble!

362
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,619
Yes!

363
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,270
Before the meeting,

364
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,390
I need to talk to you in private.

365
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,930
An overdue talk it is,

366
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,790
I'd say.

367
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,230
Officer,

368
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,420
hold on.

369
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,030
Brigade Commander Zhou?

370
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,420
Yes, it's me.

371
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:11,730
Salute!

372
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,900
All of you, get out.

373
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,380
I need a private

374
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,950
conversation with Brigade Commander Li.

375
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,960
Yes.

376
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,180
Report!

377
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,860
Commissioner Yang,

378
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,720
a letter for you

379
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,460
came from Shanghai yesterday.

380
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,230
[To Yang Kaizhi]
[From Xie Shuhong]

381
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,490
Report!

382
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,140
Commissioner,

383
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,140
here's a telegram

384
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,860
from Luanzhou for you.

385
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,450
Say it.

386
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,770
"My troops are ready and expecting

387
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,740
to join forces with the Shanxi army."

388
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,450
It is signed by

389
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,380
Zhang Shaozeng, commander of the 20th Division,

390
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,510
and Lan Tianwei, commander of the Second Mixed Brigade.

391
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,010
Here is my reply to them.

392
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,140
"I will lead 18,000 soldiers

393
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,340
from Shanxi and Hebei to meet with you."

394
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,140
Signed by

395
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
the commander of the Sixth Division,

396
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,660
Yang Kaizhi.

397
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,380
Hold it.

398
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,180
Wait till we have a discussion.

399
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,860
Yes!

400
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,210
Kaizhi...

401
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,240
My dear friend,

402
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:18,860
don't push things too far.

403
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,210
It's won't do good to us.

404
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,680
This is exactly why

405
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,660
we're having a private talk

406
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,970
now.

407
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,860
Go ahead.

408
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm listening.

409
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,490
Qianli,

410
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,490
do you know what state

411
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,010
our country

412
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,380
is in right now?

413
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
I know a bit of it.

414
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,420
The Qing dynasty

415
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,490
has become a disappointment

416
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,890
and a crumbling colossus

417
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,370
that is about to be ended.

418
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,380
You should

419
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,490
follow the trend, instead of

420
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,900
fighting against it.

421
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,140
I know what I'm doing.

422
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,530
You had better not

423
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,790
make rash decisions.

424
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,900
You think I'm acting rashly?

425
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,860
Yes.

426
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,250
Your enemy has

427
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,970
predicted all your moves.

428
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,420
Kaizhi,

429
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,730
take my advice.

430
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,250
Happenings

431
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,550
beyond your control are called "fate."

432
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,660
Those within

433
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,250
your control

434
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,010
are called "fortune."

435
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,010
Both your fate and fortune

436
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,380
are in the palm of someone else's hand.

437
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
What's the point of struggling?

438
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Aren't you like a moth

439
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,640
flying into the flame?

440
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,740
If you don't declare to start an uprising,

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
I'll cut you some slack,

442
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,700
for the sake of our friendship.

443
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,590
So my future is decided by you then?

444
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,420
No.

445
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,450
I'm just a nobody.

446
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,210
I mean someone else!

447
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,820
Which is it, Mr. Yuan,

448
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,900
or Liang Xiang?

449
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,900
Kaizhi...

450
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Kaizhi,

451
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,010
why can't you play dumb?

452
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,900
Just think about

453
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,900
what your actions can bring you.

454
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,250
Nothing, I'm afraid!

455
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,010
You consider your mission

456
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,210
to be noble and grand,

457
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,530
even earth-shattering.

458
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,990
But what's the use of that?

459
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,420
How can you complete

460
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:25,970
any mission

461
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,010
when you're dead?

462
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,640
Are you threatening me

463
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,490
with death?

464
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,970
No.

465
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,290
I'm simply asking you to withdraw

466
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,220
the order of starting an uprising.

467
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,400
Who told you to do this?

468
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,620
Was it Tufang?

469
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,210
Before Tufang left,

470
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,730
he did give me some advice.

471
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
He told me to watch out for you

472
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,490
and to stop you from acting on impulse.

473
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,620
Ignore my suggestions all you want.

474
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,450
But you should

475
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,890
listen to him, right?

476
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,250
Both you are

477
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,690
Wu Bugu's fathers,

478
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,490
aren't you?

479
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,730
Father?

480
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,490
Yeah.

481
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,730
It seems to me that Liang Xiang

482
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,710
really longs to be a father.

483
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,820
But is it easy to be a father?

484
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,580
As Zhang Jian said,

485
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,380
"The best creation in the universe

486
00:24:58,970 --> 00:24:59,860
is life."

487
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,770
What matters is

488
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,450
people's survival,

489
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,940
people's well-being

490
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,620
and our future generations.

491
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,340
If the reign of Liang Xiang

492
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,070
and those of his kind can't even

493
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,180
let most of the people achieve

494
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,050
the basic standards of living,

495
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,210
then how is he qualified

496
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,210
to be the father of the nation?

497
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,210
Why doesn't he try

498
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,870
playing a man's another role?

499
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,690
He can be a son,

500
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,860
to his mother

501
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,970
and to 400 million people!

502
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,730
If he were a loyal son

503
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,860
to those I said,

504
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,860
he would know

505
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,180
their suffering,

506
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,450
hear their inner voices,

507
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,380
and meet their demands,

508
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,290
instead of being an apologist

509
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,620
for a minority of people

510
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,620
to protect their interests

511
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:03,620
and privileges.

512
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,210
Well said.

513
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,290
Sounds like what you would say.

514
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,810
If you do think I have a point,

515
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,990
please tell him that

516
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,970
when you can.

517
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,010
Report!

518
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,050
All officers have been

519
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,510
gathered on the platform.

520
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,650
Will you still give a speech?

521
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,580
If I were you,

522
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,690
I would get on a train

523
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,690
and go back to Shanghai

524
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,860
to be with the woman

525
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
I love.

526
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,450
That way,

527
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
no one would have any regrets.

528
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,650
Garrison commander?

529
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,860
I'm here, sir.

530
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,450
I'm about to

531
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,690
address the troops.

532
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,690
I hope that when I speak,

533
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,470
you'll have the audience under control.

534
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,530
Yes.

535
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,950
I will do my utmost to ensure your safety.

536
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,860
Attention!

537
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,660
Officers of the Sixth Division,

538
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,840
on this breezy night with moonlight,

539
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,620
I,

540
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,380
Yang Kaizhi,

541
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,150
in the name of revolutions,

542
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,970
will announce

543
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,730
a major decision

544
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,210
relating to the fate

545
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,860
of each of us.

546
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,880
You failed to persuade him.

547
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,970
Could I have changed his mind?

548
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,290
Neither could you.

549
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,250
Mr. Yuan has decided to
transfer me to Beijing.

550
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,530
I'd like to leave now.

551
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:39,670
I know how you must feel, Qianli.

552
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,510
Go and pursue your career without worry.

553
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,770
I'll take over

554
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,530
the 12th Brigade.

555
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,690
You won't be held accountable for

556
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,910
whatever happens from now on.

557
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,450
I'll take full responsibility.

558
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,050
My wife is waiting for me at home.

559
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,010
Do you mind if I take my leave now?

560
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,100
I'll see you in Beijing,

561
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,210
Qianli.

562
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,620
After Yang's speech,

563
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,210
tell all the colonels

564
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,860
to meet me in the station inn.

565
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,690
Yes, sir!

566
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,530
As Sun Wen said,

567
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,730
if the Chinese nation

568
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,770
can't risk death,

569
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,370
then it can't seek survival.

570
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,050
If we are to survive,

571
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,010
we must first dare to die.

572
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,220
The nation must dare to die.

573
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,220
In revolutions,

574
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,420
blood is shed,

575
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,510
and lives are sacrificed.

576
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,050
Leaves would

577
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,450
wither and perish,

578
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,210
but they also

579
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,940
nourish the soil.

580
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,530
Perhaps,

581
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,990
as a falling leave, I can't contribute

582
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,110
to what may be an unsalvageable land.

583
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,620
But I'll gladly become the first one

584
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,080
to awaken the autumn wind.

585
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,210
When the wind rises

586
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
and the land is covered with

587
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,860
400 million fallen leaves,

588
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,860
we will finally embrace

589
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,530
a new fertile land,

590
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,000
a whole new

591
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:22,870
China.

592
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,050
I know

593
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,330
that many of you

594
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,150
completely disagree with

595
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,530
my decision to begin a revolution.

596
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,380
I can tell that from

597
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,690
some of your eyes

598
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,020
that express no passion

599
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,530
or the determination to sacrifice.

600
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,970
What I can see

601
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,010
is numbness

602
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,250
and coldness.

603
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,980
But it's fine.

604
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,450
I would never

605
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,790
force any of you to obey me.

606
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:24,290
Here,

607
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,380
what I can guarantee is

608
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,170
my determination to start revolutions

609
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,420
and my readiness to sacrifice my life.

610
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,690
With a smile, I walk this road.

611
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,310
Smiling still,

612
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,310
I walk through the heart of the desert

613
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,050
on my way to the destination.

614
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,690
Thank you, everyone.

615
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,820
Thank you all

616
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,310
for listening to

617
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,739
my last speech.

618
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,650
After dismissal,

619
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,900
all colonels please report to

620
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,170
Room 217 in the station inn.

621
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,170
Dismissed!

622
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,070
Kaizhi,

623
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,580
my dearest,

624
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,420
I can't wait to

625
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,300
throw myself into your arms

626
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,040
and tell you

627
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,880
this exciting news in person.

628
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:42,830
Commissioner.

629
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,340
Buzhou,

630
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,450
what's up?

631
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,450
Congratulations on being promoted

632
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,500
to be the Governor of Shanxi.

633
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:16,900
Get up.

634
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,670
Have you heard about this poem?

635
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,130
"With a smile, I walk this road.

636
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,680
With a smile,
I walk through the heart of the desert.

637
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,510
Where is the place I'll finally rest?

638
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,130
Where?

639
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
I will be buried by unfamiliar hands

640
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,550
in a barren land."

641
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,050
How tragic.

642
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,380
"With a smile, I walk this road.

643
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,090
I keep walking,

644
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,900
towards my destination."

645
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,420
"I know

646
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,090
on the path I've chosen,

647
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,450
anything could happen.

648
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,090
But I've made up my mind to go on,

649
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,340
like a silkworm

650
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,970
producing silk threads."

651
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,510
Kaizhi...

652
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,970
[Beijing]

653
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,610
How about

654
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,420
we drop you at the Ministry of War first?

655
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,680
Say something.

656
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,650
No.

657
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,870
Let's go to the Liang residence
in Guangmingdian Alley.

658
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,920
Years ago, we,
three inexperienced young man,

659
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,010
went to Tokyo together.

660
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,960
Now, one of us is dead.

661
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,980
I must tell Tufang

662
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,170
about this.

663
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,740
It's a burden I have to unload.

664
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,570
Or I won't be able to

665
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,420
find my inner peace again,

666
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,610
no matter what I do.

667
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:00,860
Drop the officer in

668
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,730
Guangmingdian Alley first.

669
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,520
Then head to our rented house.

670
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,880
Got it!

671
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,640
To Guangmingdian Alley first.

672
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,540
What's wrong, gentlemen?

673
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,940
What happened?

674
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,960
Tufang?

675
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,860
Kaizhi is dead.

676
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,860
Yang Kaizhi?

677
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,760
Please leave now.

678
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,580
We need a moment alone.

679
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,610
Your wife's face turned pale.

680
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,940
It makes sense.

681
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,900
A dear friend of ours, a living soul,

682
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,310
just perished.
