Attention!

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,840
The first time my son entered the Liang family,

5
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,670
it was you who brought him there, Kaizhi.

6
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,920
That's right.

7
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
You are now the child's stepfather.

8
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,280
Actually, even if you hadn't married Shuhong,

9
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,490
I would have still made you

10
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,820

However,

13
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,120
I always feel that Shuhong is

14
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,250
deliberately trying to get back at me.

15
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,170

You're wronging Shuhong with that accusation.

18
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,170
It was my idea.

19
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,090
Do you realize

20
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,930

our relationship

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,700

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,560
[A portion of the troops involved in the drill were deployed south to fight the Wuchang revolutionaries]

191
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,830
Everyone in the back, keep up!

192
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,780
Hurry up, hurry up!

193
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,410
Quick!

194
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,660
Keep up!

195
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,610
Hurry, hurry up!

196
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,250
Move faster!

197
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,050
Hurry up, hurry up!

198
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,370
Hurry!

199
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,540
Quick, push!

200
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,290
Move faster!

201
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,320
Hurry up!

202
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,430
Everyone, keep up!

203
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,010
Viceroy Liang has arrived!

204
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,550
Lord Zaitao has ordered me via telegraph

205
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,080
to return to Beijing today.

206
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,440
I didn't expect the autumn military drill

207
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,100
to end just as it was starting.

208
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,860
You all go ahead with your work.

209
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,790
I have something

210
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,070
to discuss with Commander Yang.

211
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,860
Hurry up, hurry up!

212
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Kaizhi.

213
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,560
Since we met in Shanghai,

214
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,970
we've stayed close for over 10 years.

215
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,010
And actually, all the trials and tribulations of the past 10 years

216
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,670
have been leading up to today.

217
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,740
Why do you say that?

218
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,170
I have to say it.

219
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,630
The severity of the situation in Wuhan

220
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,880
is much worse

221
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,060
than what I've conveyed to you.

222
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,800
Is that so?

223
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,680
I served at the heart of the court

224
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,810
for the past 3 years.

225
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,590
My head is full of numbers.

226
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,040
These numbers are telling me

227
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,060
that our country

228
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,600
is in the danger of collapse.

229
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,190
Is it that serious?

230
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,770
From what I understand,

231
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,680
Hubei’s treasury has amassed

232
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,569
a fortune of over 10 million yuan.

233
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:07,240
Now, that has completely

234
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
fallen into the hands of the rebels.

235
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,500
That amount of money

236
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:12,440
is more than enough to buy

237
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,099
the loyalty of the entire lower Yangtze region.

238
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,099
Not to mention,

239
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
Hanyang hosts the biggest

240
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,200
munition factory in the nation.

241
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
The arsenal in Wuchang

242
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,609
originally stored

243
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,609
over 10,000 Mauser 79 rifles

244
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,089
purchased from Germany,

245
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,450
15,000 Type 65 rifles

246
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,540
bought from Japan,

247
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:29,480
plus tens of thousands of rifles

248
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
produced by the Hanyang munition factory.

249
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,040
Together with mountain guns, field artillery,

250
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,300
and fortress cannons,

251
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,330
such a massive amount of weaponry

252
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,960
is enough for the rebels to

253
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,090
expand their forces by five brigades within 3 days.

254
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,960
Therefore,

255
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,770
if the court wants to suppress

256
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,230
the rebellion in Wuchang,

257
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,370
they must deploy the main forces of the Beiyang Army.

258
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,030
Otherwise,

259
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,040
there's no other way.

260
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,930
I understand.

261
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,110
What you are saying is,

262
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,330
the Sixth Division is returning to its station

263
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,930
so that we can be redeployed.

264
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,130
Rest assured,

265
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,380
after my Sixth Division returns to our station,

266
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,770
we'll be ready for your orders, Tufang.

267
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,110
That's hard to say now.

268
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:14,680
At this moment,

269
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,720
the cabinet ministers are deciding on who shall be

270
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,380
the Beiyang commander to lead the troops south.

271
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,010
Prince Qing has asked for

272
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,330
Yuan Shikai

273
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,180
to come out of retirement.

274
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,440
Yuan Shikai...

275
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,200
coming out of retirement?

276
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,930
I've already sent a telegram

277
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,330
expressing my willingness

278
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,570
to volunteer to lead the troops south.

279
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,570
But the possibility of being appointed

280
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,630
is extremely slim.

281
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,810
That's why I sent an urgent message

282
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,680
to Lord Zaitao,

283
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,960
urging him to tell the Prince Regent that

284
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,220
even if I am not chosen,

285
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,950
Yuan Shikai must not be allowed

286
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,410
to come out of retirement.

287
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,610
It really seems like a critical moment.

288
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,270
Therefore,

289
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,010
for the Sixth Division,

290
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,230
Lord Zaitao and I

291
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,210
can only rely on you, Kaizhi.

292
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,630
We can trust no one else.

293
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,680
Just watch.

294
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,830
Once Yuan Shikai comes out of retirement,

295
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,890
Brigade Commander Wu and Li Renjun

296
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,750
will naturally become his staunch supporters.

297
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,440
Tufang.

298
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,920
To be honest with you,

299
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
just now,

300
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,240
it already feels as if

301
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,150
I’m walking a tightrope among wolves.

302
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,330
To be frank,

303
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,090
Kaizhi,

304
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,570
in my eyes,

305
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,200
aren't you a wolf as well?

306
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,090
You must be joking.

307
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,330
I'm serious.

308
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,500
Then make yourself clear.

309
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,200
What kind of wolf am I?

310
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
You know it yourself.

311
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,780
No, I don't know.

312
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,950
Even if you are,

313
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,130
you're a wolf that has been

314
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,190
dancing closely with me for 10 years.

315
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,330
Don't laugh.

316
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,200
I advise you, Yang Kaizhi,

317
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,000
to continue to remain rational.

318
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,080
Do you understand?

319
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,310
[Sixth Division's Field Command]

320
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,040
The Wuchang Uprising

321
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,720
has caused a tremendous shock.

322
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,040
Many young officers

323
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,570
are as excited as if they've been

324
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,970
injected with morphine.

325
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,240
Excitement alone is not enough.

326
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,040
Are they willing to sacrifice for the revolution?

327
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm confident I can win over

328
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,700
Feng Hanhai's 24th Regiment.

329
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:58,720
Kaizhi.

330
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,760
If you can also persuade Renjun,

331
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,610
then the entire Twelfth Brigade will be complete.

332
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,330
I think the biggest trouble is the Eleventh Brigade.

333
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,200
That man, Wu,

334
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
is stubborn and unyielding.

335
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,330
Then let's work from the bottom up.

336
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,370
First, we'll mobilize a few junior officers

337
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,040
with revolutionary leanings.

338
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,330
Then we'll disarm Wu.

339
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,440
After that, we'll announce

340
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,170
the reorganization of the Eleventh Brigade's command structure.

341
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,100
Seems like that's the only way.

342
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,910
The key is to choose the right timing.

343
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,880
Let's do this.

344
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,240
You immediately send

345
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,970
a few trusted comrades to Wuhan

346
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,960
and establish contact with

347
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,120
the revolutionary forces.

348
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,580
Okay, I'll get right on it.

349
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,480
Report!

350
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,220
Brigade Commander Li has arrived.

351
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,620
Enter.

352
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,850
Kaizhi.

353
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,090
Something doesn't seem right to me.

354
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
What's not right?

355
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,680
I just came from the station.

356
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,610
The railway folks told me that

357
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,480
according to the transport plan,

358
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,630
the 20th Division and the 2nd Mixed Brigade

359
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,490
are both staying put in Luanzhou.

360
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,030
What are they trying to do?

361
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,850
Is that so?

362
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,330
Is that what's happening?

363
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:21,810
Report!

364
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,610
A telegram from General Liang Xiang

365
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,010
of the Beijing Military Advisory Council.

366
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,940
Read it.

367
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,330
The cabinet ministers have decided that

368
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,090
Minister of the Army Yinchang will lead as commander-in-chief

369
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,200
and lead the main forces of the Beiyang Army south

370
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,470
to quell the rebellion.

371
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,440
Your Eleventh Brigade is to be

372
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,930
immediately incorporated into the 2nd Army,

373
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,200
and follow them south under the command of

374
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,000
Sir Yinchang.

375
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:40,930
It's over.

376
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440

That's right.

453

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,130
What arrangements did your father make?

564
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,200
I was just joking.

565
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,680
Can women truly handle firearms?

566
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,570
Even if you could, I wouldn't let you do it.

567
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,100
Can you be serious for once?

568
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,090
Fine.

569
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,440
I'll go get your leader

570
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,040
to come and assign you a task.

571
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,780
Show him some respect.

572
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,130
This old man has a big appetite for power.

573
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,960
He has now become

574
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,850
the Finance Minister

575
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,450
of the Alliance in Shanghai.

576
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,880
What are you laughing at?

577
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,530
Your attire...

578
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,630
really makes you look like a finance minister.

579
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,290
Don't you listen to Song Chen.

580
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,180
Am I the type of person who wants to be an official?

581
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,040
If I really wanted to be an official,

582
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,860
I would have done it in the 21st year of Guangxu.

583
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,060
Why wait until today?

584
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,240
How is Kaizhi?

585
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,750
When we parted,

586
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,200
I didn't expect the situation

587
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,460
to develop so quickly.

588
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,200
So...

589
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,370
I'm afraid the original situation...

590
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,520
I just received news at noon.

591
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,440
Among the Beiyang Army participating in the autumn military drill,

592
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
the 20th Division

593
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,200
and the 2nd Mixed Brigade

594
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,410
have refused the court's orders

595
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,380
and jointly caused trouble in Luanzhou, Hebei.

596
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,330
Is that so?

597
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,610
What about Kaizhi's Sixth Division?

598
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,330
No news yet.

599
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,530
What do you need me to do?

600
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:20,930
My current workplace is at

601
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,130
the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce.

602
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,200
Come with me.

603
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,350
I need an assistant.

604
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,200
Shuhong.

605
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,370
Shanghai will respond to Wuchang

606
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,700
to achieve liberation.

607
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,530
There are many things waiting for us to do.

608
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,310
[Military Advisory Council]

609
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,440
As to Zhang Shaozeng

610
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,040
and Lan Tianwei's relatives in Beijing,

611
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,370
we must treat them well.

612
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,900
We must not harass them.

613
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,090
After all, the 20th Division

614
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,040
and the 2nd Mixed Brigade

615
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,040
haven't taken any extreme actions.

616
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,490
We need to give them time.

617
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,870
Don't push them too hard.

618
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,480
If pushed too far, they might really rebel.

619
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,540
Whose idea is this?

620
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,090
Of course, it's Lord Zaitao's

621
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,150
personal opinion.

622
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,170
He's gone out.

623
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,020
I have full authority to represent him.

624
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,420
Yes, I am representing him fully.

625
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,210
Tufang,

626
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,080
are you being this lenient

627
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,639
because these two

628
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,969
were your fellow officer cadets in Japan?

629
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,600
They neither return to their garrisons at Fengtian

630
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,030
nor head south to quell the rebellion.

631
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,050
Instead, they sent telegrams to the court

632
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,250
demanding a constitutional monarchy.

633
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,639
This is a military remonstration!

634
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,900
It's a serious matter.

635
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,989
Lord Zaitao,

636
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,260
I think you are only seeing half the picture

637
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,659
and is missing the whole.

638
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,960
Have you figured out

639
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,250
what's the most serious aspect

640
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,650
of this whole situation?

641
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,080
I'm listening.

642
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:49,639
The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.

643
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,040
The most dangerous place

644
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,250
is neither in Wuchang nor in Luanzhou,

645
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,989
but in Huanshang Village.

646
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,340
Huanshang Village?

647
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,830
That guy, Yuan?

648
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,730
That's right.

649
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,640
It's him, Yuan Shikai.

650
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,100
Tufang.

651
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,810
In times of crisis like now,

652
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,320
we can't dwell on past grievances.

653
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,430
That's too...

654
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,620
Lord Zaitao.

655
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
At this point in the game,

656
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
haven't you realized it yet?

657
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,590
Indeed.

658
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,160
As soon as news of the Wuchang Uprising broke,

659
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,890
the entire court was in chaos like headless flies.

660
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,550
There was no clear consensus.

661
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,190
That's why on the day Yinchang departed,

662
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,710
Feng Guozhang, who was going to battle,

663
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,040
made a special trip to Huanshang Village.

664
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,740
What does that signify?

665
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:43,160
Of course, it was to seek guidance on strategy.

666
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,690
The big decisions still had to come from Yuan.

667
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,840
What happened next was strange.

668
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,420
It's been several days now,

669
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,440
and the vanguard

670
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
still hasn't entered Hubei.

671
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,420
Where is Yinchang now?

672
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,470
Still on the train in Xinyang.

673
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,890
Is our Minister of the Army

674
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,290
out for a stroll or actually fighting a war?

675
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,160
Oh right.

676
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm puzzled too.

677
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,740
What are these people waiting for?

678
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,040
Isn't it obvious what they're waiting for?

679
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
The entire main force of Beiyang who is heading south

680
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,690
has shown a level of inaction

681
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,890
completely inconsistent with their strength.

682
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,490
One can only understand that

683
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
they are waiting for a

684
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,960
new commander to appear.

685
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,250
Are you saying...

686
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,440
They're waiting for Yuan Shikai?

687
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,080
If not, why do you think

688
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,110
Prince Qing nominated for Yuan to come out of retirement?

689
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,310
Was it really just a desperate measure?

690
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:40,730
Hello?

691
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Your Highness, it's me.

692
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,930
Seventh Lord is here. Please wait a moment, Your Highness.

693
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,670
Zaifeng, it's me.

694
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,130
Go ahead, I'm listening.

695
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,070
What?

696
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,140
I understand.

697
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,060
What did His Highness say?

698
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,330
You actually called it.

699
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,940
The edict has just been issued,

700
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
requesting Yuan Shikai to come out of retirement

701
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,050
in order to serve

702
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,510
as the Viceroy of Huguang.

703
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,780
Isn't this letting the tiger back in?

704
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,290
This won't do.

705
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,930
I must go talk to His Highness personally.

706
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,330
We absolutely cannot give Yuan Shikai

707
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,790
full military authority.

708
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,850
Viceroy Liang.

709
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,220
Hurry up, hurry up!

710
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,640
Quickly!

711
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,100
Be careful not to fall.

712
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,120
Hurry, hurry!

713
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,400
Keep up at the back.

714
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,090
Your Highness, your meal is ready.

715
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,130
Is Tufang still here?

716
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,460
Ask him to come and dine with me.

717
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:16,370
Yes, Sir.

718
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,270
Your Highness.

719
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,990
Sit down, let's eat together.

720
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,100
I heard from Seventh Lord...

721
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,600
that you seem to have something

722
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,410
to tell me.

723
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,720
Perhaps it's better not to say it now.

724
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,440
Why?

725
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
I didn't expect things to change so quickly.

726
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,440
The situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse.

727
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,890
It seems...

728
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,840
the telegraph war has already begun.

729
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,810
Telegraph war?

730
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,920
Yes, telegraph war.

731
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,560
Since the widespread use of telegraphs

732
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,730
in the Qing dynasty,

733
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,410
this is the first time

734
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,820
it has become a powerful tool in the hands of rebels.

735
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,950
Using the telegraph

736
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,490
and starting from Wuchang,

737
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,790
they unleased the rebellion's cause

738
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,040
rampantly

739
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,040
across the country like a plague.

740
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,380
Next would be Hunan, Shaanxi,

741
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,930
Jiangxi, Shanxi, and Yunnan.

742
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,490
I estimate that

743
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,210
other provinces will

744
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,340
eventually join in.

745
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,830
Its speed of transmission

746
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,520
is the same as that of the telegraph.

747
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,520
There are too many fish bones.

748
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,700
Take it away.

749
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,570
Carry on.

750
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,560
The root of the issue lies in this one "ko" move.

751
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,370
"Ko"?

752
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,900
The lone "ko" move left on a shattered board.

753
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,840
You mean the three towns of Wuhan?

754
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:45,460
Yes,

755
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,970
the three towns of Wuhan

756
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,260
are exactly the biggest pain point

757
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:53,150
between me and the revolutionary party.

758
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,530
You're right.

759
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,250
What troubles me the most

760
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,500
is this "ko".

761
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,530
The revolutionary party has been searching for five or six years, hasn't it?

762
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,190
They've always wanted to find

763
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,180
a "ko" that could fight against us.

764
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,820
Xu Xilin in Anqing,

765
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,730
Qiu Jin in Shaoxing,

766
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,840
Huang Xing in Guangzhou.

767
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,820
They were looking out,

768
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,080
but all of them

769
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,400
failed to form a stalemate.

770
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,610
Without a stalemate,

771
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,240
a "ko" cannot be formed.

772
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,640
But this time in Wuhan,

773
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,270
they've found it.

774
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,330
If Wuhan becomes

775
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,810
China's Bastille,

776
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,250
then all the

777
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,820
latent crises of the Qing dynasty

778
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,480
may be triggered

779
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,640
by this "ko".
