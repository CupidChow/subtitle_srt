190
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,870
This is the leadership institution
in Shanghai.

191
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,030
The first floor is mainly responsible
for import and export trade.

192
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,480
Its responsibility also includes
purchasing firearms and ammunition.

193
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,720
The second floor is the dormitory.

194
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,470
Your ammunition workshop is also
on the second floor.

195
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,820
There's also a printing house.

196
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
It's in the attic.

197
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,730
Let me show you around.

198
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,240
Be careful.

199
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,510
Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin,

200
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,250
how far have they gotten?

201
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,980
I think you should get settled first.

202
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,880
This matter is too significant.

203
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,140
It can't be explained in just a few words.

204
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,310
That's exactly why you should explain.

205
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,320
I heard

206
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,680
you have some different opinions.

207
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
Is that true?

208
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,730
There's a leadership meeting tonight.

209
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,910
We'll discuss it at the meeting.

210
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,640
Hanhua, what's wrong with you?

211
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,090
You're so hesitant.

212
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,240
How can you handle

213
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,900
the responsibilities of leadership
like this?

214
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,150
Tianbai.

215
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,550
This is a matter of life and death.

216
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,870
One small mistake could cost many lives.

217
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,600
Are you afraid of people dying?

218
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,490
When I, Yang Hanhua, do things,

219
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,890
I do them pragmatically.

220
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
If I earn one dollar,

221
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,870
I do business worth one dollar.

222
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,910
If I earn two dollars,

223
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,570
I expand to a two-dollar deal.

224
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
But those people,

225
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:54,870
they only have one dollar,

226
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,360
yet they want to do ten dollars'
worth of business.

227
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,000
How could that possibly work?

228
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,020
The uprising in Zhejiang and
Anhui provinces

229
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,440
is such a large-scale operation,

230
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,670
yet with a bunch of unrealistic

231
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,070
plans and preparations.

232
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Everyone's minds are feverish.

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,790
Where's the ideological and
organizational groundwork?

234
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,480
There's no reliable preparation at all.

235
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,940
They only focus on action.

236
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,610
Tianbai.

237
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,120
If it weren't for my past year of

238
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,380
reading and thinking,

239
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,910
I'm afraid I would also be

240
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,040
on that white horse,

241
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,380
shouting to the world,

242
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,760
"Let's take action, friends!"

243
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,980
Alright, enough said.

244
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,370
Get some rest first.

245
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,440
We'll discuss in detail at
the meeting tonight.

246
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,840
I still need to meet someone
from Shaoxing.

247
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,190
Have a rest.

248
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,010
Do you want to lie down on the bed?

249
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,440
I'm afraid your brother-in-law
is not happy

250
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,030
about me, Wu Tianbai,

251
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,569
coming back at this time.

252
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,440
No way. You're being paranoid.

253
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Am I?

254
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,440
Just look at his attitude just now.

255
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,040
That's so unlike him.

256
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,069
Right, this matter has

257
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,880
always been controversial
within the party.

258
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,440
He, Yang Yifan,

259
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,350
is just worried that I, Wu Tianbai,

260
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,070
will stand in opposition to him.

261
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,960
Tianbai.

262
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,240
We've just arrived.

263
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,200
Let Yifan handle the big matters.

264
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,720
You're just...

265
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,480
Although I was in Tokyo physically,

266
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,340
my heart has always been in China.

267
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,200
This won't do. I must do something
about this matter.

268
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
I can't let him keep wavering like this,

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,830
being so indecisive

270
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,960
and hesitant.

271
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,570
Tao in Tokyo feels the same way.

272
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,480
Salute!

273
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,260
The background of this
autumn military drill is special.

274
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,750
Yuan has voluntarily stepped down from

275
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,390
the leadership of the four
garrisons of Beiyang.

276
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,450
[Feng Shan, Commander-in-Chief of Beiyang Army]

277
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,670
I, Fengshan, will take over the command.

278
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,310
A Manchu general leading Han troops,

279
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,550
it's quite tricky.

280
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,510
You're right, Sir.

281
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,750
It's the first time for the Beiyang Army

282
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,710
to be out of Yuan Shikai's control.

283
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,410
Out of his control?

284
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,490
That's a bit premature to say.

285
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,880
You mean...

286
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,520
Yuan

287
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,740
is like the birth mother of
the Beiyang Army.

288
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,730
And what about us?

289
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,680
We are

290
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,270
at most a wet nurse.

291
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,960
Those deep-rooted ties

292
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,350
have been planted since the days

293
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,000
they trained in Xiaozhan.

294
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,680
Moreover, Yuan

295
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,830
is a master at winning people over.

296
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,960
Don't be fooled by those

297
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,830
who grew up drinking wolf's milk.

298
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,830
They may

299
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,030
all seem obedient and submissive now,

300
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,720
but deep down,

301
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,980
who knows what they're really thinking?

302
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,550
It's time to wean them, Sir.

303
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,480
Starting from this autumn military drill,

304
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,920
we should gradually eliminate
Yuan Shikai's

305
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,780
influence over the Beiyang Army.

306
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,240
That's why

307
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,590
I made an exception to promote you

308
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,370
to be the Chief Judge.

309
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,200
I, Liang Xiang, deeply understand
the significance.

310
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,960
Regarding this arrangement,

311
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,340
many will be discontented.

312
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,310
Whether it succeeds or not

313
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,720
depends entirely on you.

314
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,100
Make sure to make others feel that

315
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,310
no matter which cloud is missing,

316
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,440
it will still rain.

317
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,140
A Manchu general can lead Han troops
just as well.

318
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,600
Yang Kaizhi?

319
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,980
[Yuan Shikai's official residence
in Beijing]

320
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,100
The newly appointed Army Inspector?

321
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,710
That's correct.

322
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Inspector Yang.

323
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,030
I'm afraid Mr. Yuan...

324
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,960
To be honest,

325
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,070
I've never handed over

326
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,720
a business card of this rank before.

327
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,920
I believe Mr. Yuan isn't that snobbish.

328
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,650
I'll give it a try then.

329
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,440
Mr. Yuan respectfully requests an audience
with the border-defense hero,

330
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,770
Inspector Yang Kaizhi.

331
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,510
Kaizhi

332
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,030
is really out of line.

333
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,070
I went to great lengths to
bring him to Beijing,

334
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,930
and what did he do?

335
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,470
He still hasn't come to see me.

336
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,310
For three days straight, he's been
paying respects everywhere,

337
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,440
and all to big shots.

338
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,300
It seems this man has great ambitions.

339
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,200
He was already like this when
we were in Tokyo.

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,750
You two complement each other.

341
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,680
Our family has lacked social skills

342
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,880
since ancient times.

343
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,440
No, Mother.

344
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,790
I simply disdain such practices.

345
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,720
The meat in a bun isn't on its folds.

346
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,790

[Prince Qing's Mansion]

348
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,310
seems a bit low.

349
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,530
Don't even mention it.

350
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,270
Qu Hongji

351
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,320
and Cen Chunxuan are constantly
challenging me.

352
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,310
On the surface, they're targeting me,

353
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,110
but in reality,

354
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,640
they're targeting my father
and Xiangcheng.

355
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,640
Of course his spirit is low.

356
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,320
My Lord.

357
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,280
Who doesn't have difficulties?

358
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,350
At times like these, we must stand tall.

359
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,280
Don't collapse.

360
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,030
The sun rises in the east
while it rains in the west.

361
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,360
There's no obstacle we can't get through.

362
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,000
Alright.

Only when you're down on your luck

365

can you see who your true friends are.

366

Come on, let's have a drink.

367

Sit on my lap.

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,720
What are you talking about, Kaizhi?

372
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,380
Ignore him.

373
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,750
This guy.

374
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,440
He's always been like this,

375
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,900
relying on his pretty face

376
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,240
and those narrow eyes of his

377
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,200
like a fishing net.

378
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,130
He uses the same trick on everyone.

379
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,010
I see you two

380
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,190
are much closer than with Liang Xiang.

381
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,920
Girl, you have a keen eye.

382
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,310
You're truly worldly.

383
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,490
This bit of aggression in a man

384
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,350
can't escape your notice,

385
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,110
can it?

386
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,310
Qianli, do you know

387
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,080
people like your wife

388
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,240
despise nothing more than

389
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,480
hypocrisy?

390
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,590
Compared to Liang Xiang,

391
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,110
the greatest virtue of me, Yang Kaizhi,

392
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,590
is being genuine.

393
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,720
What's the point of pretending?

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,510
Aren't we all just dumb boys?

395
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,960
You paid a visit to Tokyo,

396
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,350
and after you came back,

397
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,150
you suddenly became a nobleman?

398
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,640
Living in a big mansion,

399
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
with carriages coming and going
at the office.

400
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,590
It's like drawing nothing but a nose on
a whole piece of paper:

401
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,070
what a big face.

402
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,110
I, Yang Kaizhi,

403
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,750
refuse to buy into this act.

404
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,830
Just because he issued an order

405
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,960
to transfer me back,

406
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,970
I'm supposed to shamelessly be
at his beck and call?

407
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,760
I'm telling you.

408
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,570
We were all classmates,

409
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,720
right?

410
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,070
How can we not know

411
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,480
how he got here?

412
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,310
I hate it when he speaks to me in
that official tone.

413
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,040
It's not like we haven't seen
nobility before.

414
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,310
Come on. Let's eat.

415
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,100
Alright, alright, easy there.

416
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,300
It won't be fun anymore if you get drunk.

417
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,350
And you.

418
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,480
Don't think I don't know

419
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,830
what you've been busy with.

420
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,000
As for the autumn military drill,
don't take it too seriously.

421
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,860
Why care about winning or losing?

422
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
It's all an act.

423
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,140
Everything, from top to bottom, is fake.

424
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,880
Calling himself the Chief Judge.

425
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
The autumn military drill
hasn't even started yet,

426
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,160
and who's winning or losing

427
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,620
has already been decided.

428
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,170
Is that so?

429
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,650
What did you think?

430
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,110
Sir, you're awake.

431
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,600
Would you like to have a meal?

432
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,060
This...

433
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,590
What's all this about?

434
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,110
Mrs. Li arranged this.

435
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,420
The rent has been paid.

436
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,590
Thank you.

437
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,510
You're welcome.

438
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,020
[Autumn Military Drill Command Center]

439
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,830
Throughout history, those who
have achieved great things

440
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,880
must have the power to make bold moves

441
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,080
and reap the rewards of their hard work.

442
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,350
They must possess the ability
to wield tremendous power,

443
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,590
and have the ambition of
a swan soaring 1,000 miles.

444
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
You finally came.

445
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,460
I apologize to you, Sir.

446
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,050
I'm not like you.

447
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,350
I need to establish myself, don't I?

448
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,440
Look at you.

449
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,590
Such an unexpected

450
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,110
stroke of luck came our way.

451
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,960
If we were still in Tokyo,

452
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,020
we'd be overjoyed.

453
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,280
What a good opportunity it is to
command such a large army,

454
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
but you...

455
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,910
You've done a great job with
this sand table.

456
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,880
Are you complimenting me

457
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,200
or mocking me?

458
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,510
It's all an act. The props and set

459
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,110
need to be more realistic, of course.

460
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,750
Hey,

461
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,760
what do you mean?

462
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,480
The leaders of the northern
and southern armies,

463
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
have you met them?

464
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,320
I saw them at the meeting.

465
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,830
You saw them?

466
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,290
So you just had a brief exchange
of pleasantries.

467
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,110
That won't do.

468
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,480
Those two

469
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
are like watermelons in a barrel of oil.

470
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,200
They're very slippery and cunning.

471
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,750
You need to get a hold on them.

472
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,720
Otherwise, this act of yours

473
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,350
won't play out.

474
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,830
You came so late,

475
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
and you said something like that

476
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
right off the bat?

477
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't take your position as
the Chief Judge

478
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,500
too seriously.

479
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,880
You've only been here for a few days.

480
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,840
The way you talk about it...

481
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,720
Listen.

482
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,310
Just leave all the policy planning

483
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,640
and sand table exercises

484
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,390
to your officers.

485
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,800
Your main task is

486
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,320
to engage with the commanders
and interact with the troops.

487
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,110
Otherwise, you won't even
get your foot in the door.

488
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,720
Military drills without practicing
strategies and plans,

489
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,310
I've never heard of such a thing.

490
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,350
In my experience,

491
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,200
don't try to apply what you

492
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,830
learned in school here.

493
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,230
It doesn't work that way.

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,530
Just take my advice.

495
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,800
I don't see it.

496
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,590
This is what I meticulously recreated

497
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,480
step by step based on

498
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
the Japanese army's

499
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Battle of Mukden.

500
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,280
What our army lacks the most right now

501
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,410
is the latest military intelligence.

502
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,350
If we don't practice this in
the autumn military drill,

503
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,150
in my opinion,

504
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,680
it'll be completely meaningless.

505
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,170
You have a point.

506
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,720
You're right.

507
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,640
I see you haven't

508
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,070
grasped the situation at all.

509
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,590
Go talk to my adjutant first

510
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,350
and get fully briefed

511
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,410
on all the records.

512
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,370
Then we'll talk.

513
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,960
How does that sound?

514
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,350
Forgive me.

515
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,240
Sometimes I forget myself

516
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,720
and still think

517
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,480
you're the same cadet

518
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,210
who used to share a dorm with me.

519
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,610
I keep wanting to treat you as an equal.

520
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,000
Now you're being too formal.

521
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,310
Yes, Chief Judge!

522
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,480
This humble officer will never say

523
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,540
such things again.

524
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,700
I'll go study the records right away.

525
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,890
Wait a moment. Don't rush off.

526
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,480
There's something

527
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,890
I'd like to hear your opinion on

528
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,220
and see how to handle it.

529
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,750
Please, go ahead!

530
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,770
The autumn military drill,

531
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,440
because of the allocation of field tents,

532
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,720
has caused a huge dispute.

533
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,510
The tents couldn't be distributed,

534
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,000
and this matter has been reported to me.

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,130
Such a small matter?

536
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,750
It's precisely because it's a small matter

537
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,590
that it reveals the long-standing
grievances from all sides.

538
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,110
Go handle it for me.

539
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I won't show up.

540
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
This way, we can gain the upper hand.

541
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,880
Yes!

542
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,000
I'll go handle the small matters,

543
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,930
while you ponder the big issues
inside the room, Sir!

544
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,720
This bastard.

545
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
Mocking me.

546
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,000
If you ask me,

547
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,880
if you southerners give up half,

548
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,410
that should be about right.

549
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,250
Why should you Beiyang Army

550
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,780
get all the best things?

551
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,370
You get all the good stuff,

552
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,480
not even willing to spare a few tents.

553
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,720
Exactly.

554
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,880
You can't say it like that.

555
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,480
We're all the same.

556
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Our brigade has

557
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,240
3,600 people,

558
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,200
while you only have 2,400.

559
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,720
3,600 compared to 2,400,

560
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,540
that's a difference of 1,200.

561
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,590
What's wrong with us

562
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,590
asking for more tents?

563
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,480
Allocation on demand, right?

564
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,240
Exactly.

565
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,720
If it's really allocation on demand,

566
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,590
those few tents

567
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,350
aren't even enough for half
our asses to sit on.

568
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:09,720
That's right.

569
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,110
Your ass must be really big.

570
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,240
We Southern Army

571
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,000
weren't raised by "concubines" either.

572
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,510
That's right.

573
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,310
Whether born of the "legitimate wife"

574
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,710
or born of a "concubine,"

575
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,830
don't you know your place?

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,200
Watch your language!

577
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
How dare you speak like that!

578
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,350
That's going too far!

579
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,070
Gentlemen!

580
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,240
The Chief Judge sent me here

581
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,860
to only handle the allocation,

582
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,260
not to listen to demands.

583
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,350
So don't waste your time appealing to me

584
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,510
about how much you need them

585
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,930
or how difficult your situation is.

586
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,910
It's useless.

587
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,350
The available field tents

588
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,940
are just this many.

589
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,350
In total,

590
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,240
there are 324 tents.

591
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,240
After deducting

592
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,590
the 54 tents needed by
the General Headquarters,

593
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,240
there are 270 left.

594
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,090
The participating units consist of
two divisions

595
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,760
and two mixed brigades,

596
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,580
totaling nine brigades with
over 33,000 men.

597
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,700
We'll allocate the tents by brigade,

598
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,460
which comes to exactly 30 tents
per brigade.

599
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,590
30 tents?

600
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,260
30?

601
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,960
Half of our men will be left out
in the sun.

602
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,200
That's not enough.

603
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,480
isn't this just pushing

604
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,350
the problem onto us?

605
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,830
Exactly.

606
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,720
30 tents,

607
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
that's far too few.

608
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,720
Gentlemen.

609
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,960
Gentlemen!

610
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,010
This won't do. It's too few.

611
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,070
The headquarters

612
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,440
has just been established.

613
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,240
We're poor.

614
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,110
These are all we have.

615
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,110
Each of you can only get this many.

616
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
If you can house a battalion,

617
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,050
then house a battalion.

618
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,510
If you can't house a battalion,

619
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,880
then house two companies.

620
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,590
If you can't even house two companies,

621
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,750
then distribute them to the companies
as company headquarters.

622
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,480
In any case,

623
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,560
there's not a single tent more.

624
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,980
If you don't want them,

625
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,970
then forget it.

626
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,350
What's that supposed to mean?

627
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,350
What kind of talk is this?

628
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,350
If you really do this, we'll go home.

629
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,070
Fine, fine.

630
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,800
Let's just go home then.

631
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,400
Let me remind you all.

632
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,480
This time,

634

635

636
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,430
are keeping a close watch on our drill.

637
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,510
Not to mention

638
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,590
whether there are enough tents
to go around.

639
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,450
Even if there were no tents at all,

640
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,080
I don't believe any of you misters

641
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,590
would let this show

642
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,780
fall apart.

643
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:36,540
Alright.

644
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,640
30 tents it is.

645
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,930
It's better than nothing.

646
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,650
I'll sign.

647
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,280

648
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,590
This... This...

649
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,550
They signed so quickly.

650
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,690
Duke, hurry up and sign.

651
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,330
If you don't sign now,

652
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,870
we won't even have 30 tents left.

653
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,880
Just sign it.

654
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,960
Alright, alright.

655
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:54,830
Let's go.

656
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,780
Who is this person?

657
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,640
He's Yang Kaizhi.

658
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,500
You don't even know him?

659
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,510
He used to be a classmate of
the Chief Judge.

660
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,030
The one who settled things
with the Japanese in Yanji.

661
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,630
No wonder he's so efficient.

662
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,510
As they say,

your skills must be.

I'm heading to the bank.

667

How much should we withdraw?

669

Withdraw it all.

Yes.

Convert it all to cash.

673
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,420
We'll need it for a bunch of stuff.

Converting so much cash at once,

675
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,949
wouldn't that be too conspicuous?

676
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,550
Then withdraw it in batches.

677
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,480
Withdrawing small amounts in batches

678
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,840
might take some time.

679

At least 10 days.

680
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,290

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,170
like raindrops pouring down,

744
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,000
among the officers above the rank of
battalion commander,

745
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,400
about a dozen were promoted
out of nowhere.

746
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,240
All of them were Manchus,

747
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,410
and you were the only Han Chinese.

748
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,320
Is that so?

749
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,320
Kaizhi,

750
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
you earned it with your military
achievements at the border.

751
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,190
We're all convinced.

752
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,800
Right?

753
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,840
But the rest of them,

754
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
they all got promoted through this.

755
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,360
Is that true?

756
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,230
Kaizhi, you stick to the Chief Judge

757
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,190
every day, inseparable,

758
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,790
how do you not even know this?

759
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,000
Nowadays,

760
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,630
which rank doesn't have a price tag?

761
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,480
It's all openly priced.

762
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,210
What kind of nonsense is this?

763
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,470
Just like that,

764
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,320
Manchu generals are leading Han soldiers?

765
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,510
How come everyone leaves

766
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,570
as soon as I show up?

767
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,590
Right.

768
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,660
Why did they all leave?

769
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,420
It can't be helped.

770
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,210
You're the Chief Judge.

771
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,280
If it weren't because you're
the Chief Judge,

772
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
I would have left too.

773
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
Commander-in-Chief just

774
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,110
told me about some situation.

775
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,360
I'm quite surprised.

776
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,770
What situation?

777
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,230
Do you know that

778
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,180
the court originally planned

779
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,280
to remove those few Yuan's
die-hard supporters

780
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,550
from the Beiyang Army?

781
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,470
But surprisingly, they couldn't do it.

782
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,950
How is this news?

783
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,480
This means

784
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Empress Cixi is still

785
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,630
going easy on Yuan.

786
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,740
You think

787
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,000
lackeys like Li Renjun

788
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,280
came to Beijing

789
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,410
for nothing?

790
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,730
Both sides are competing for this.

791
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,530
The two sides you mentioned,

792
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,730
what do you mean?

793
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,380
You think he doesn't like this?

794
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,120
As long as the price is right,

795
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,280
whether it's Manchu generals
or Han soldiers,

796
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,360
they all have to sit in line
and take their share.

797
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,470
That can't be.

798
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,800
He personally conveyed

799
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,200
the general policy to me.

800
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,190
As the Commander-in-Chief,

801
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,760
how could he go back on his word?

802
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
What general policy?

803
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,230
Anyway, it's aimed at Yuan Shikai.

804
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,290
Isn't this absurd?

805
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,760
The blueprint of design

806
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,230
is based on the Japanese Army's

807
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,230
Battle of Mukden,

808
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,360
but the target

809
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,840
is the former Commander-in-Chief

810
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,510
of the Beiyang Army.

811
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,450
Now that you put it that way,

812
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
I'm all confused.

813
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,050
It really is like that.

814
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:04,450
That's why I've been reminding you,

815
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,230
don't try to apply what you learned

816
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,090
in school here.

817
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,780
What autumn military drill?

818
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,810
It was all just an act to begin with.

819
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,030
Look at you.

820
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,220
Why should you waste your energy?

821
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:24,690
[Zhangde, Henan]

822
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,840
Sir, you...

823
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,550
I didn't expect to find such a
fancy hotel here.

824
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,280
That's right.

825
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,970
You could say this place is like

826
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,290
half a hometown to

827
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,360
the Viceroy of Zhili.

828
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,840
Our hotel was personally funded by him
last year

829
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,940
and built according to the blueprints

830
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,150
by a Belgian designer
who came from Tianjin.

831
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,550
Not bad. I'll take a room.

832
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,510
I'm sorry, Sir.

833
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,360
Our establishment

834
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,940
has already been rented out to
the Headquarters.

835
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,010
The lease is for half a month.

836
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,320
[Revolutionary Wang Han]

837
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,460
The Headquarters?

838
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,000
Which Headquarters?

839
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,710
How many Headquarters could there be?

840
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,240
The Beijing Headquarters.

841
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,710
The autumn military drill is
about to begin.

842
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,630
This place is reserved for
high-ranking officials.

843
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,760
I just need one room.

844
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,030
I don't mind paying extra.

845
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,070
I'm here for business.

846
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,440
I need to maintain a certain
level of decency.

847
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,230
You can try the

848
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,280
small inn across the street.

849
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,480
I'm afraid we're really not available.

850
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,190
Leaders from the General Headquarters!

851
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,370
Second floor, please. Second floor.

852
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:12,970
Hey, you!

853
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,050
Hurry up and take the officers upstairs.

854
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:17,110
Officers, please proceed upstairs.

855
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,850
Attention!

856
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,490
Salute!

857
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,630
[Commander of the Southern Army]

858
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,970
[Commander of the Northern Army]

859
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
General Liang Xiang.

860
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,030
I have a question that

861
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,960
I've never been able to figure out.

862
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,030
You know train tracks?

863
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,360
Why is the gap between

864
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,280
the rails precisely

865
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,760
4.85 feet, not more, not less?

866
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,480
We've just taken a ride on the train.

867
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,500
As for why,

868
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,540
I actually don't know.

869
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,320
Commander Zhang.

870
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,390
Now that you're the Commander of
the Southern Army,

871
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:50,180
your words are truly striking.

872
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,070
With just one question,

873
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,480
you've stumped our

874
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,070
Chief Judge.
