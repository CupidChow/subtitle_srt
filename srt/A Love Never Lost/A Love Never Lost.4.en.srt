00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,880
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,229
Dr. Wu Tianbai

4
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,300
and Mrs. Wu are here.

5
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,400
Please.

6
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,910
Welcome, Dr. Wu.

7
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:16,820
Mrs. Wu.

8
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,270
Mrs. Wu.

9
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,050
The French consul, Mr. Morion,

10
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,079
and Miss Lucy are here.

11
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,380
What's wrong?

12
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,750
You're all shaking.

13
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm fine.

14
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,800
Yihua.

15
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
Miss Lucy is greeting you.

16
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,290
Don't be afraid. Stay close to me.

17
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,820
Don't talk to anyone.

18
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,040
Make yourselves at home.

19
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,820
Don't mind us.

20
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,850
Don't mind us.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,260
Who's the one you're so concerned about?

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,579
Who else could it be?

23
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,800
Your third son's

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,770
wife in Anqing.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,800
My son's wife?

26
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,520
Which one is she?

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
The doctor's wife just now.

28
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,579
The doctor's wife?

29
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,500
My son's wife?

30
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,970
Where is she?

31
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,460
Forget it, My Lord.

32
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,130
Don't wash your dirty laundry in public.

33
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,630
Look around

34
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,590
for Prince Chun,

35
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,670
the man of the hour.

36
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,710
Is he here?

37
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
I don't know him.

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
He's a young man around 17 years old.

39
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,950
Is he at the head table?

40
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,800
There are only foreigners there.

41
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,820
The prince is so young?

42
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Oh no.

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,300
I saw an acquaintance.

44
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,680
That fat guy?

45
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,420
Is he looking at me?

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,640
He's the Governor of Jiangsu.

47
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,990
I used to work under him.

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,930
Is he coming this way?

49
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,190
Listen.

50
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,810
Go back to the carriage now.

51
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,140
No matter what happens,

52
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,710
stay in the carriage.

53
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,310
How about you?

54
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,440
Don't worry about me. You leave first.

55
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,920
Tianbai, come here.

56
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,350
How have you been, Governor?

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
The pretty girl with you,

58
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
who is she?

59
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:14,920
My wife.

60
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,280
Get her here.

61
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,600
I'd like to meet her.

62
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,350
She left a piece of jewelry in the carriage.

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,360
By the way,

64
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,900
where is His Highness?

65
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,600
His Highness

66
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,920
wouldn't come somewhere like this.

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
So many people in Shanghai

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,750
want to curry favor with His Highness.

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,409
Is Song Baoquan worth His Highness' attention?

70
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,030
I see.

71
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
Tianbai.

72
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,920
You've wised up, right?

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,680
Good.

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,480
Later, you and your wife

75
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,630
should sit next to me.

76
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,190
I'll

77
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,090
give you some pointers.

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,000
Tianbai.

79
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,430
What's in your hand?

80
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,720
This

81
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,190
was meant for His Highness.

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,310
But since His Highness didn't come,

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,140
I might as well

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,630
give it to you,

85
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,480
you bloody traitor.

86
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,190
Tianbai!

87
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,970
Rebel!

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,530
Help!

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,840
Help! Rebel!

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,930
Help!

91
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,720
Tianbai.

92
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,930
Go!

93
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Move! Move!

94
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,500
Move! Move!

95
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,750
My Lord.

96
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,220
T-There's smoke.

97
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,040
Help!

98
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,170
My Lord!

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,310
Go after him!

100
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,210
Go! Go!

101
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,110
Don't let the rebel escape!

102
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,770
This is…

103
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,120
Why are you looking at me?

104
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,920
Your wife in Anqing chose her.

105
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,090
She…

106
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,720
She's quite something.

107
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,580
Where are we going?

108
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,330
Where are we going?

109
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,040
Say something!

110
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,920
I told you.

111
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,310
We're destined

112
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,190
to be together.

113
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,730
Like it or not, you have to stay with me.

114
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,240
No. I'll leave you.

115
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm done with you!

116
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,690
Are you scared?

117
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,430
This will implicate your whole family, won't it?

118
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,720
But it's too late now.

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,530
We'll go to Japan

120
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,690
and start all over.

121
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,630
You and I

122
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,510
are bound together.

123
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,430
We've made

124
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,090
headlines.

125
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,920
Therefore,

126
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,630
leaving with me

127
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,750
is the only way forward.

128
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,210
You have no other options.

129
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,600
[Shiliupu Pier, Shanghai]

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,270
One at a time.

131
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,360
Keep up.

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,740
Get out.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,300
Let's go.

134
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,020
Tianbai.

135
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,200
I knew you hadn't left.

136
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,200
Hanhua.

137
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,820
Stop.

138
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,530
Don't say anything.

139
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll clean up the mess you left.

140
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,390
But you have to promise me

141
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,130
to be nice to her.

142
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,580
I promise you.

143
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,310
Take good care of yourself in Japan.

144
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,200
If you get in trouble,

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,470
write to me at this address.

146
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,280
The ship is leaving.

147
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,520
Get aboard.

148
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,420
Hurry up.

149
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,510
Get aboard now.

150
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,750
Don't sit on that bunk.

151
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,550
Do you hear me?

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,460
Who are you talking to?

153
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,560
I'm talking to you.

154
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Liang Xiang.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,170
This bunk is mine.

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,460
Yours is the upper one.

157
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,120
Who are you to tell me

158
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,180
which bunk is mine?

159
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,720
Bannermen like you

160
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,440
love to look down

161
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,640
your noses at others.

162
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,200
You're the rule makers.

163
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,750
Am I wrong?

164
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,870
Kaizhi.

165
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,600
I've had enough of this.

166
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,430
Do you have to be so snarky?

167
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,600
We're both military students.

168
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,080
Don't be so mean.

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,730
Just because you know my secret

170
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,530
doesn't mean you can patronize me.

171
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,070
Listen.

172
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,280
I died once.

173
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,330
I fear nothing.

174
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,510
Both of you are here.

175
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,960
Which bunk is mine?

176
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,550
You'll sleep above Kaizhi.

177
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,040
He's rich and needs a bodyguard.

178
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,750
No problem.

179
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,000
Kaizhi.

180
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,510
I'll be your bodyguard.

181
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,510
Wuwei Corps Right Division

182
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,390
serves

183
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,650
wherever the money is.

184
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,080
This is the meal ticket.

185
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,610
The Japanese ship is great.

186
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,300
They offer

187
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,330
three meals a day.

188
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,770
You haven't answered my question.

189
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,630
What question?

190
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,120
Why did you do that?

191
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,310
Stop asking why.

192
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,440
You almost became a murderer, didn't you?

193
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,270
If that bomb

194
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,390
had really exploded,

195
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,590
how many people would've been injured?

196
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,120
How could you do that?

197
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,840
You're a teacher

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,170
at an all-girls school.

199
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,320
Yes.

200
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,890
I'm a teacher,

201
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,830
a scholar,

202
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,610
and a modern-day Jing Ke.

203
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,500
I was exercising my right.

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,290
This country is doomed.

205
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,810
The people are numb.

206
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,750
Someone has to stand up

207
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,010
to change everything,

208
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,290
to fire the people up,

209
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,310
even if it's a futile attempt.

210
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,070
This is fate.

211
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,240
We sink or swim together.

212
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,210
Sit here. Sit here.

213
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,030
Good morning.

214
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,510
Good morning.

215
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,600
I want…

216
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,330
I want…

217
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,480
I want…

218
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,360
Toilet.

219
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
This way, sir.

220
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,050
I'm going to the toilet.

221
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
I…

222
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,960
I want…

223
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,200
Water.

224
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,120
Water.

225
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay.

226
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,080
I want…

227
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,760
This one.

228
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,190
Okay.

229
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,510
Wait.

230
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,079
All…

231
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,960
All of them.

232
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,150
I want the same.

233
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,290
Okay. I got it.

234
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,000
A Chinese girl.

235
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,390
My friend is seasick

236
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,110
and feeling very uncomfortable.

237
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,510
Can I bring some food and drinks

238
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,510
back to my room?

239
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,050
Of course.

240
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,000
Is your friend feeling dizzy

241
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,750
and nauseous?

242
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,480
Yes.

243
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,900
He vomited all night.

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's better now

245
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,290
but still very weak.

246
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Is that guy Chinese

247
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,750
or Japanese?

248
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,880
This guy is from Japan.

249
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,410
Born and raised.

250
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,960
Miss,

251
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,400
I'll ask the kitchen

252
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,000
to prepare miso soup for you.

253
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,200
Please wait a moment.

254
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,750
Excuse me.

255
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,240
I'd like to order

256
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,110
the same breakfast

257
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,720
for my friend who's gone to the toilet.

258
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,880
Okay, sir.

259
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,590
Whoa, you're already eating.

260
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,530
It's funny that you really went to the toilet.

261
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,270
I had to keep up the act.

262
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,350
By the way,

263
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,960
the bathroom is very clean.

264
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,130
It smells good,

265
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,020
and the floor looks like a mirror.

266
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,160
If you spit on it,

267
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,110
guess what?

268
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,160
What?

269
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,530
You can slide from one end to the other.

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,960
It's true.

271
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,000
I swear.

272
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,240
Thank you.

273
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,450
They're making it now. It'll be ready soon.

274
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,480
He can actually speak Chinese?

275
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,040
So, you need to be careful with what you say.

276
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,350
One day,

277
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,880
I was walking on the street in Shanghai.

278
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,830
The old white woman walking in front of me

279
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,880
was very fat.

280
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,880
I said to Maichen,

281
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,180
"I wonder what she eats

282
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
to become so fat."

283
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,310
That old white woman

284
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,480
turned around and answered in Shanghai dialect,

285
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,240
"Food."

286
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,000
Also,

287
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,240
when Wuwei Corps Right Division

288
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
trained at Xiaozhan,

289
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,750
Mr. Yuan found several

290
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,240
German consultants for us.

291
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,370
They all had beards.

292
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,480
Like this.

293
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,570
Did they speak Chinese?

294
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,750
Only one sentence.

295
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,950
They knew it by heart.

296
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,710
Mr. Yuan said to the Germans,

297
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,210
"My soldiers are perfect,

298
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,900
except that

299
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,840
they don't aim when they shoot.

300
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,240
They shoot like this."

301
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Mr. Yuan added,

302
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,240
"You need to teach them to aim."

303
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,160
The Germans replied,

304
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,510
"Leave it to us."

305
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,110
It was the only sentence

306
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,240
those Germans knew.

307
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,480
No matter what Mr. Yuan

308
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,640
asked them to do,

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,730
they replied with conviction,

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,480
"Leave it to us."

311
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,070
"Leave it to us."

312
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,230
Your miso soup.

313
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,350
What's going on?

314
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,160
Eat. Stop staring.

315
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,270
Among the three of us,

316
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
Tufang has the best table manners.

317
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,750
Do I?

318
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,870
Do all the nobles

319
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,360
care about table manners?

320
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,640
My mother does.

321
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,110
We have a set of fine porcelain dinnerware.

322
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,110
She only takes it out when we have

323
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,400
distinguished guests.

324
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,240
She eats soup

325
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,130
with a spoon,

326
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,000
holds a teacup with both hands,

327
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and never makes noise when she eats.

328
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,080
You hear that?

329
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,790
A real nobleman

330
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,750
can trace his noble lineage

331
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,400
at least three generations back.

332
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,970
By the way,

333
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,270
is your mother's ancestor

334
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,640
really Emperor's Father and Prince-Regent

335
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,310
Dorgon?

336
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,110
The family book says so.

337
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,350
You're of noble lineage.

338
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,110
You, Yang Kaizhi,

339
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,830
are from a family of scholars.

340
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,000
Only I, Li Renjun,

341
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,550
am from a line of shepherds.

342
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,070
Who told you

343
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,730
I'm from a family of scholars?

344
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,010
You studied at Ziqiang Institute in Wuchang,

345
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,960
didn't you?

346
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
You told him about me?

347
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,250
You studied at Ziqiang Institute in Wuchang?

348
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,510
The officials

349
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,240
of Shanghai Circuit have dug into the background

350
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,110
of every military student heading to Japan this year.

351
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,020
They know everything

352
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,540
about everyone.

353
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,590
The miso soup

354
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:57,410
is authentic.

355
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,350
It's appetizing.

356
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,350
Very appetizing.

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
By the way, can you get me some bread?

358
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,160
The freshly baked kind

359
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,490
with a delicious smell.

360
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,430
Hello.

361
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,950
Hello.

362
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,350
Can I help you?

363
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,270
Are you taking the bread in your hand

364
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,270
back to your room?

365
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,240
Yes, it's freshly baked and still hot.

366
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,110
Yeah. It smells delicious.

367
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,480
Do you want it?

368
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,830
Take it if you do.

369
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,830
I can get some more from the dining room.

370
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,640
Can I?

371
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,010
Thank you very much.

372
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,350
Could you please

373
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,110
send it

374
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,240
to that cabin for me?

375
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,750
That one, 206.

376
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,610
You're welcome.

377
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,540
I'm glad to help.

378
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,400
206, right?

379
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,540
Does he like it?

380
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,270
Yes.

381
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,270
I think your husband

382
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,400
has a good appetite.

383
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,570
Excuse me.

384
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
Can I hang the laundry here?

385
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,350
Are you

386
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,600
asking me?

387
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,020
Is there a third person here?

388
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,690
Shall I ask about it for you?

389
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,180
I asked the chief steward.

390
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,240
First, there's a laundry room on board.

391
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,640
They offer laundry service for free.

392
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,880
These are all undergarments.

393
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
Why would I let strangers wash them?

394
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,890
You have a point.

395
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,170
What's the second?

396
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,330
If you want to wash clothes yourself,

397
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,960
the staff can dry them for you.

398
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,750
Dry them?

399
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,160
How?

400
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't know.

401
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,240
Maybe they have a machine for it.

402
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,880
The chief steward also said

403
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,110
you can't hang your laundry

404
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,310
anywhere on the ship.

405
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,020
It's the rule here.

406
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,800
I got it.

407
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,440
The Japanese have so many rules.

408
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,940
Are you and your friends all military students?

409
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,750
Yes.

410
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,750
We're all

411
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,160
government-sponsored military students who will study in Japan.

412
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
You did your own laundry at home?

413
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,480
Yes.

414
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,020
You're better at it than me. I barely know how to do it.

415
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,410
I can see that.

416
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,750
Wash it like this.

417
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
Then this.

418
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,930
Let me wash them for you.

419
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,510
This is improper.

420
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
They reek of alcohol.

421
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,640
He drank a lot before going aboard

422
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,170
and puked all over himself.

423
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Who is he to you?

424
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,830
No one.

425
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,260
Just an acquaintance.

426
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,400
Let me wash them for you.

427
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,640
You need

428
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,960
to soak the clothes in water for a while

429
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,530
before soaping them up.

430
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,590
I have soap.

431
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,970
Thank you.

432
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm afraid he's feeling unwell again.

433
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,640
I need to go check on him.

434
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay.

435
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,610
Thank you very much.

436
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,300
Who's it, Shuhong?

437
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,110
I mentioned him.

438
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,160
A military student.

439
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,110
Let him in.

440
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,880
I'd better leave.

441
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,220
Come in.

442
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,110
Have a seat.

443
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,090
Nice to meet you.

444
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,880
I know Takagi Sakuzo.

445
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,480
What?

446
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,750
The principal

447
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,950
of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy.

448
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,730
I-I don't know him.

449
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,400
This is the only good thing about the Japanese.

450
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,830
No matter how high-ranking a general is,

451
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,960
you can go to his house to visit him.

452
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,350
Two years ago, I had tea with him.

453
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,850
One can't do the same

454
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,160
with Chinese dignitaries.

455
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,880
Hand me the scissors.

456
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,340
I need to trim my toenails.

457
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,720
Do you know

458
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,350
why Japan is willing

459
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,400
to nurture

460
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
new talent for our army?

461
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,000
Please

462
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,160
enlighten me.

463
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,940
The Japanese think

464
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,880
they must work with China

465
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,520
to fight against

466
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,790
Russia

467
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,090
and Western powers.

468
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,960
Yes.

469
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,160
Of course.

470
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,830
You don't need to care about

471
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,230
what the Japanese think.

472
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,000
Learn as much from them as you can

473
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,800
while they're willing to teach.

474
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,350
I think so too.

475
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,240
Was Xiang Yu brilliant?

476
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
X-Xiang Yu?

477
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,640
Who is Xiang Yu?

478
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,770
Do you know Xiang Yu?

479
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,610
Xiang Yu, the Hegemon-King of Chu?

480
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,080
See?

481
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,080
She knows more than you.

482
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,210
I know the Hegemon-King of Chu.

483
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,640
Xiang Yu only lost

484
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,240
one battle in his whole life.

485
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,480
Do you know who he lost to?

486
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,010
He lost to Han Xin at Gaixia.

487
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,480
Han Xin was even more brilliant than Xiang Yu.

488
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,830
But how did Han Xin

489
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,750
become so brilliant?

490
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,600
Do you know it?

491
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,640
What about you? Do you know it?

492
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
Just say it.

493
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,750
Don't keep us in suspense.

494
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,410
Look at you.

495
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,350
Not humble at all.

496
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,550
Don't learn from her.

497
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,770
You're ridiculous.

498
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,180
Why would he learn from me?

499
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,040
How many people

500
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,400
would be a big fool like me who believed your lies?

501
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,610
When did I lie to you?

502
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,420
What did I lie about?

503
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,940
Why would I lie to you?

504
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The weak should humbly learn

505
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,090
from the strong.

506
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,240
Why was Han Xin so brilliant?

507
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,270
Because Han Xin

508
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,510
was once Xiang Yu's spear-bearing warrior,

509
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,770
which was a bodyguard.

510
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,200
Throughout the Battle of Julu,

511
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,440
when Xiang Yu ate, slept, fought,

512
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,770
and even when he pooped,

513
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,570
Han Xin was with him.

514
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,190
Han Xin

515
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
was trained by Xiang Yu.

516
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,430
Understand?

517
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,520
I understand.

518
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,920
Han Xin was brilliant

519
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,640
because he learned from

520
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,700
his enemy Xiang Yu.

521
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,130
Understand?

522
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Yes.

523
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,370
Truly understanding that is not easy.

524
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,960
You can't get it.

525
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,750
Young man,

526
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,310
if you want to achieve something,

527
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,170
you have to be as humble as Han Xin.

528
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,400
You need to use your enemy's combat experience

529
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,600
to improve yourself.

530
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,190
By the way,

531
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,960
you…

532
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,640
I forgot to ask your name.

533
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,510
My name is Liang Xiang.

534
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,050
You're a Bannerman?

535
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,350
I'm a Bannerman.

536
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,350
If you want…

537
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,000
I shall take my leave.

538
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,480
See you.

539
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,160
He…

540
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,800
He's actually a Bannerman.

541
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,400
Qianli.

542
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,160
Why do you think

543
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,480
my noble birth

544
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,210
is a concern for so many people?

545
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,310
Who are you talking about?

546
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,270
Is it a concern for you?

547
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,400
Me?

548
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,750
It is,

549
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,880
isn't it?

550
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,370
Don't say that.

551
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,670
You're different from them.

552
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
From whom?

553
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,640
The princes

554
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,750
and young nobles.

555
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,020
You want honesty?

556
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,110
Everyone in Wuwei Corps Right Division

557
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,750
hates people from the Eight Banners.

558
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,350
They're full of themselves.

559
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,750
Are they?

560
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,750
Our country is in hot water now.

561
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,350
Those people

562
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,790
played a big part in it.

563
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,750
Does that include

564
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,200
His Majesty?

565
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,070
His Majesty is a good and talented emperor.

566
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,350
But…

567
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,860
But what?

568
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,520
He doesn't get to call the shots.

569
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,680
Someone's reigning behind a curtain.

570
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,040
What are you two doing here?

571
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,490
Just for some fresh air.

572
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:54,930
By the way,

573
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,820
the officer in charge just told me

574
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,670
after we arrive in Japan,

575
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,270
we can't

576
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,480
go straight to the Army Academy.

577
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,160
Really?

578
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,030
Then where will we be going?

579
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,550
We need to go to prep school first

580
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,680
and then intern in the Japanese Army Regiment.

581
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,000
Only after we're qualified

582
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
can we go to the Army Academy.

583
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll be a private again?

584
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,920
How's that different from serving in Wuwei Corps Right Division?

585
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,680
I was already a squad leader.

586
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,240
Just go with the flow.

587
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,680
I've lived in military camps all my life.

588
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
I was born a reservist.

589
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,290
It's not that scary.

590
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,200
Yang Aiguo,

591
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,730
you've experienced death.

592
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,200
Whatever the future holds

593
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,550
can't daunt you,

594
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:30,310
right?

595
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,040
You know what?

596
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,920
Liang Xiang, in your veins,

597
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,940
there's courage running.

598
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,000
You're composed

599
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,310

600
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,800
I'm different from you guys.

601
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,160
In my mother's words,

602
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,440
it's a miracle

603
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,460
that I get to study abroad in Japan.

604
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
You two must have met before.

605
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,230
He left?

606
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,330
He left just like that?

607
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,510
Yes.

608
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,010
His Highness boarded a ship at Shiliupu Pier

609
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,110
this morning at 6:15.

610
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,679
He'll take the ship Guangji to Wusong first

611
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,510
and then transfer

612
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,440
to the German cruise Baian.

613
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,420
It's a huge ship that weighs 12,000 tons.

614
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,180
You did quite a bit of research this time.

615
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,360
Mr. Song.

616
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,630
We should thank God

617
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,800
His Highness didn't come.

618
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Otherwise…

619
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,810
What do the police say?

620
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,390
They've opened a case

621
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,180
but haven't caught the criminals.

622
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,940
I see.

623
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,250
I heard the criminals are a man and a woman.

624
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,190
The Governor of Jiangsu knows that man.

625
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,530
But no one knows…

626
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,190
who that woman is.

627
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,220
I'm not interested in that.

628
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,600
I'll leave it to you.

629
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,660
I'll take my leave.

630
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,450
Baoquan.

631
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,860
Is it about your third son's wife?

632
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,200
Don't speak of her again.

633
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,090
Never again.

634
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,300
That woman had nothing to do

635
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,430
with the Song family

636
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,510
and will have nothing to do

637
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,590
with us in the future.

638
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,480
Understand?

639
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,030
Why are you yelling at me?

640
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,530
Your wife in Anqing is the one to blame.

641
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,700
My goodness.

642
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,490
We're arriving in Japan soon.

643
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,380
Are you scared?

644
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,280
What I did will soon

645
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,420

646

647
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,520
Someone at the banquet knows me.

648
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,190
So…

649
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,610
Look at what you've done!

650
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,430
You have a doctorate in chemistry.

651
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,710
You're all about scientific rigor

652
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,240
and act like you know it all,

653
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,000
but in fact, you know nothing!

654
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,320
You were just messing around.

655
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,550
You acted on a whim.

656
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,710
No smart people

657
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,590
would do what you did.

658
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,120
You call this a revolution?

659
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,230
Obviously, we're

660
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,760
on different wavelengths.

661
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,040
Yeah.

662
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,320
How can a young girl from a small town

663
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,030
understand

664
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,630
the romantic dream of a revolutionary?

665
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,430
It's beyond you.

666
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,750
It is beyond me!

667
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,200
But however romantic your dream is,

668
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
you need to use your brain to make it come true.

669
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,830
Your bomb

670
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,190
didn't explode when it should have

671
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,590
and went off

672
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,920
when it shouldn't have.

673
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,020
Now you're in a tight spot

674
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,280
and escaping to Japan.

675
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,510
You don't understand.

00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,440
What is romance?

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,190
Romance

678
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,920

how are we going to make a living?

693
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,330
Do you have a house in Japan?

694
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,200
Do you have enough money?

695
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Will the police come after us again?

696
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,320
How do we get food and clothes? How do we live our lives?

697
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,580
Do you even have a plan?

698
