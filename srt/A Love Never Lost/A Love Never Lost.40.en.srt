[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,910
[Episode 40]

3
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,380
Grandpa,

4
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
what are you doing?

5
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Call me L-Laixi.

6
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
L-Laixi?

7
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
But your beard is all gray.

8
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,780
Even if it's gray, you can't call me that.

9
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
You call the lady "Granny."

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,240
How can you call me "Grandpa"?

11
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,400
Isn't that disrespectful?

12
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,440
Laixi!

13
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,990
See how happy that sounds?

14
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,110
You haven't...

15
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,310
You still haven't told me

16
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,560
what you're doing.

17
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,030
I'm pruning the flowers.

18
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
Why do you need to prune them?

19
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,590
So they can endure the winter.

20
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,000
What does that mean?

21
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Enduring the winter means

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,880
not being showy,

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,079
not showing off,

24
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,160
not standing out at this time,

25
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,460
and not causing trouble for themselves.

26
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,770
This way,

27
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,030
the snow won't freeze them,

28
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,400
the frost won't damage them,

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,680
and even ice shards won't hurt them.

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,000
They'll save up strength to
make it to spring.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,590
When spring comes,

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,640
the sun will be warm again

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,810
and the birds will chirp again.

34
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,240
Then they can bloom

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,510
and fill the branches.

36
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Isn't that Mr. Tieliang?

37
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,800
Who is Tieliang?

38
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,520
He's a great general commanding
millions of troops.

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,470
Are you a general too?

40
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,280
Me?

41
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,480
I spent my whole life in the military,

42
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,079
just trying to make a living.

43
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
Me, a great general?

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm nothing but a fart.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,560
A fart, a fart, a fart,

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,630
a fart, a fart.

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
You two, old and young,

48
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
what are you laughing about?

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,500
Laughing about farts.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Don't talk nonsense.

51
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,630
How can you be so vulgar?

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
A fart that flies high

53
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,070
reaches the willow treetops in Nanjing.

54
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,750
A fart that stays low

55
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,190
gets stuck between big sister's teeth.

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,630
You're getting carried away, aren't you?

57
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,100
I told you not to say it,
but you still did.

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,560
Do you want me to spank you?

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,510
This child

60
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,950
is just how you were as a kid,

61
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,330
always doing what you were told not to do.

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,159
Really?

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Was I that naughty too?

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,720
You bet.

65
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,390
That year,

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,040
it was freezing cold like this.

67
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,920
You ran inside, took a dump,

68
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,750
and covered it with my hat.

69
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,310
As soon as I entered the room,

70
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,159
I felt that it didn't smell right.

71
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,630
Just then, your great-grandfather

72
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,600
asked me to go deliver a message.

73
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
In my hurry,

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,180
I picked up that hat...

75
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,420
And put it on.

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,040
Little one,

77
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,850
what's so funny?

78
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,590
Is it funny?

79
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Young Master.

80
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,360
If I'm not mistaken,

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,160
the one you just saw off was Tieliang,

82
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,240
Mr. Tie, right?

83
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,300
Why are you so curious about everything?

84
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,240
It's been so many years since I last saw him.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,480
I was afraid I might have been mistaken.

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,190
It was him.

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,720
However,

88
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,210
you mustn't talk about this outside.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,970
I don't mind,

90
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,470
but Tieliang is sensitive about it.

91
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,320
He doesn't want outsiders to know

92
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,050
that he's organizing the Royalist Party with me.

93
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,480
I understand, I understand.

94
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,810
Will I talk carelessly?

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,080
Of course not.

96
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,290
What's the Royalist Party?

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,530
You, you, you...

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
It's very dangerous.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,760
Why are you like a parrot?

100
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,070
If you keep this up,

101
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,750
I'll have your mom

102
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,810
take you back home.

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,480
Tufang.

104
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,630
You can't talk about this carelessly.

105
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,960
It's a capital offense.

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,080
What's this?

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,150
It's an extra edition printed
by the newspaper office.

108
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,160
It's all over the streets.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,920
It's given away

110
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,470
[Republic of China was established
in Nanjing yesterday. Sun Yatsen is
the provisional president]

111
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,030
for free.

112
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,090
This...

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,310
What does this mean?

114
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,930
Oh my, oh my.

115
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,480
There are two suns in the sky now!

116
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,970
Grandpa.

117
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,050
Call me Laixi.

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,360
Laixi,

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,390
what does "two suns in the sky" mean?

120
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,270
What is that?

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,480
The sun.

122
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,450
How many are there?

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,920
One.

124
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:02,090
That's not right.

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,830
Starting from today,

126
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,020
there are two!

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,030
[November 13th, 3rd year of Xuantong
(January 1st, 1912)
Sun Yatsen becomes the provisional
president, announcing the country's name
as Republic of China]

128
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,360
[November 15 (January 3),
Republic of China's provisional government
was established in Nanjing]

129
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:30,080
[November 28 (January 16th),
Yuan Shikai officially went to force
Empress Dowager Longyu to abdicate]

130
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,870
[There was an assassination attempt at
Donghua Gate with more than 20 casualties,
but he survived and used this excuse
to never attend court again]

131
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,890
Viceroy Liang!

132
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,159
Viceroy Liang!

133
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,530
Viceroy Liang!

134
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,330
Viceroy Liang!

135
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,790
The opportunity has come.

136
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,920
What opportunity has come?

137
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
There was an assassination attempt

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
on Yuan Shikai at Donghua Gate
this morning.

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,990
He threatened the court

140
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,240
that he would no longer
attend court sessions.

141
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,430
Empress Dowager
has called for an urgent

142
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,260
imperial conference tomorrow

143
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,460
to discuss countermeasures.

144
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,660
She specifically requested your presence.

145
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,060
Who told you to inform me?

146
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,650
The head eunuch of Empress Dowager Longyu.

147
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,760
Is that so?

148
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Empress Dowager thought of me now?

149
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,000
That's why I said
the opportunity has come.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Could it be that Yuan is going to

151
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,860
throw in the towel?

152
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,010
If that's the case,

153
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,740
wouldn't it be a tremendous opportunity?

154
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,000
Viceroy Liang, you could use this
to achieve great things.

155
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,510
Calling Minister of
Imperial Guards Training,

156
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,320
Deputy Commander
of the Plain White Banner, Liang Xiang,

157
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,460
to have an audience
with the Empress Dowager.

158
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,950
Why is everyone so quiet?

159
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Since all of you here are members
of the imperial clan,

160
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,530
we're all family.

161
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
Don't be so formal.

162
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,200
Speak your minds.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,480
Let's see how we should

164
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,450
handle the current situation.

165
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,810
Uncle,

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,050
would you like to take the lead?

167
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,000
I humbly thank you for your kindness.

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
However,

169
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,480
I have been retired for many years.

170
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,990
I'm unaware of external affairs.

171
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,180
I'm not in a position to speak.

172
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Perhaps

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,420
we should first hear

174
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,600
the opinion of the
Prime Minister's representative.

175
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
That's fine.

176
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,680
Why don't you speak then?

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,360
Since the Empress Dowager has specified,

178
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,530
I shall convey

179
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,480
the Prime Minister's opinion.

180
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,190
The Prime Minister believes

181
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,300
that the North-South division

182
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,830
has led to a confrontation,

183
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,790
resulting in two governments
within one country.

184
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,640
The situation is quite severe.

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,390
The Prime Minister believes

186
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,870
that to resolve the current deadlock,

187
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,940
there is only one solution.

188
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,350
Which is

189
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,720
to dissolve both governments at once

190
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,940
and form a new provisional government.

191
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,150
What nonsense is this?

192
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,600
I can't believe Yuan came up with this.

193
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,910
He's ruining his own future,

194
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,270
handing over power willingly.

195
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,200
Isn't this just indirectly

196
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
acknowledging the rebels?

197
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,390
Yes, indeed.

198
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
Representative Zhao,

199
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,600
if the government is reorganized,

200
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,300
how will the imperial family

201
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,580
be treated?

202
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,500
With preferential treatment,

203
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,300
maintaining honorific titles.

204
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,460
Merely preferential treatment?

205
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,830
Isn't this equivalent to abdication?

206
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,590
That's your opinion.

207
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,040
Of course,

208
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,100
you're entitled to your opinion.

209
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,380
This is what a republican system is.

210
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,580
Aren't you clearly forcing
the emperor's hand

211
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,130
to abdicate?

212
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,040
As I've said,

213
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,430
that's your view.

214
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,150
Then what is

215
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,550
Yuan Shikai's view?

216
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,220
Haven't I just expressed it?

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,070
Dissolve both governments at once,

218
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,510
form a new provisional government,

219
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,320
and provide preferential treatment
to the imperial family.

220
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,580
Isn't this extortion?

221
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,920
Again, that's your view.

222
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,460
The Prime Minister instructed me

223
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,440
that if the imperial conference

224
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,110
cannot reach a decision,

225
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,240
the cabinet will have no choice
but to resign.

226
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,490
Empress Dowager,

227
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,720
I have fully conveyed

228
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,290
the Prime Minister's stance.

229
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,460
I request permission to leave.

230
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,530
This move by Yuan Shikai

231
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,580
is clearly a threat.

232
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,580
Threat?

233
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,450
You think it's a threat?

234
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,590
What kind of threat?

235
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,450
The one spoken aloud

236
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,710
and the one left unsaid.

237
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,750
Which one was spoken?

238
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:54,400
Which one wasn't?

239
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
The one spoken aloud

240
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,550
is about the throne,

241
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,890
pressuring you to give it up.

242
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,360
The unspoken one

243
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,010
is about life.

244
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,170
Life?

245
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,730
Yes, life.

246
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,110
What do you mean by that?

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Yuan is clearly asking

248
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,800
if you want the throne

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,830
or your life.

250
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,910
The assassination attempt the other day

251
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,360
really did Yuan

252
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,850
a big favor.

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,510
Yuan had warned us long ago,

254
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,360
saying that many revolutionists

255
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,020
had infiltrated the capital.

256
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,770
None of us believed him.

257
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,750
We said Yuan was betraying the court
for his own gain,

258
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
secretly communicating
with the revolutionists.

259
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,960
We said he was using
the revolutionists as a threat.

260
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,410
No.

261
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,030
I have already appeased him

262
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,890
about the incident the other day.

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Doesn't the revolutionists'
attempt on his life

264
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,720
prove that Yuan Shikai

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,620
is still loyal

266
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,720
to the court?

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,550
If you think so,

268
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,290
then Yuan will be even more unscrupulous,

269
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,700
taking a hands-off approach.

270
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,800
For example,

271
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,390
"Look, I almost lost my life.

272
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,850
You'd better

273
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,910
cherish your own lives.

274
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,010
I'm done with this."

275
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,560
Even if we lose him,

276
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,910
we can still manage.

277
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,410
This is absurd.

278
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,350
Empress Dowager,

279
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,630
I propose

280
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,670
to immediately approve

281
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,130
the resignations of Yuan Shikai's cabinet.

282
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,120
Since they've voluntarily resigned,

283
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,650
we might as well approve it.

284
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,790
How can the country be

285
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,670
blackmailed by such a scoundrel?

286
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,730
If they don't want to work, then great.

287
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
I humbly request the Empress Dowager

288
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,940
to reorganize the cabinet

289
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,140
and appoint a new general to go south,

290
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,020
free from the control of
Yuan's Beiyang clique.

291
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,440
In short,

292
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,980
the new cabinet should

293
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,820
use constitutionalism
to prevent revolution,

294
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,330
aim to save the overall situation,

295
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,590
and never easily agree to negotiations.

296
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:23,790
Indeed.

297
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,150
The Qing dynasty absolutely cannot allow

298
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,910
Yuan Shikai to have the final say.

299
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,910
We firmly disagree.

300
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,630
If it could be like this,

301
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,890
I would be overjoyed.

302
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,030
However,

303
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,400
a war cabinet

304
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,240
and leading the Qing army south

305
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,530
is easier said than done.

306
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,300
Within the imperial clan,

307
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,750
can we still find

308
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,200
such a military leader?

309
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,790
Zaitao.

310
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,030
Here.

311
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,750
If I send you now

312
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,349
to the front lines in Wuchang

313
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,960
to lead the Beiyang Army

314
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,420
and fight against the revolutionary party,

315
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,660
are you up to the task?

316
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,920
Your Highness,

317
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,980
I am not capable.

318
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,780
You were Chairman of the
Military Advisory Council

319
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,730
and the current Commander
of the Imperial Guards.

320
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,000
How can you not be capable?

321
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,510
I have only trained troops.

322
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,660
I've never fought in battle.

323
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,190
I beg for your forgiveness.

324
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,320
Please forgive me.

325
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,500
[Palace Telegram Room]

326
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,550
Where did this telegram come from?

327
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,150
General Duan Qirui
from the Beiyang front line

328
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,160
sent an urgent telegram
to the court cabinet.

329
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,200
Decode it immediately.

330
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,490
This message was
transmitted in plain text.

331
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,320
Plain text?

332
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,170
So many generals have signed it.

333
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,270
It's too unusual.

334
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,880
Quick, make copies.

335
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Right away.

336
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,550
I have an extremely urgent matter

337
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,480
to present to the Empress Dowager!

338
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,410
Come in.

339
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
What is it?

340
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,350
Your Highness,

341
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,390
Duan Qirui from the Beiyang front line

342
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,220
and 46 army generals

343
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,440
jointly sent a telegram petition.

344
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,780
A telegram petition?

345
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,910
What does it say?

346
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,300
The telegram petition states

347
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,720
that they are urging the emperor to

348
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
abdicate immediately.

349
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,240
-This...
-This...

350
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,780
And establish a republican system.

351
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,940
[Petition]

352
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,750
W-What should we do?

353
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,160
What should we do?

354
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,720
Indeed.

355
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,650
What should we do?

356
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,700
Isn't this rebellion?

357
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,510
Let's end the discussion here for today.

358
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,850
We'll reconvene tomorrow morning.

359
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,710
Your Majesty,

360
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,880
let's go back now.

361
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,660
This...

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,790
What should we do?

363
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,510
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

364
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,720
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

365
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,960
We'll discuss it again tomorrow.

366
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,730
Mr. Chen.

367
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,250
Let's go.

368
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,390
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

369
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,110
Tufang,

370
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,570
do you understand now?

371
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,900
This is how Yuan Shikai always strikes.

372
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,030
He has vanguards in the front,

373
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,630
reinforcements in the back,

374
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,760
and collaborators in between.

375
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,400
Be on your guard.

376
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,900
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,360
I couldn't help you.

[Imperial Guards Station]

379
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,170
Viceroy Liang!

380
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,830
Viceroy Liang!

381

Viceroy Liang!

382

Viceroy Liang.

383
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,860
Viceroy Liang.

384
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,470
What is this about?

385
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,070
The Qing dynasty's empire

386
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,260
was left by our ancestors.

387
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,920
It's not the Empress Dowager's dowry.

388
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,650
She has no right to give it away.

389
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,920
The emperor cannot abdicate.

390
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,650
He absolutely must not abdicate.

391
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,580
We, members of
the Royalist Party,

392
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,880
swear to defend the
emperor with our lives.

393
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,810
Defend the emperor with our lives!

394
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,370
I don't agree with tattooing.

395
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,400
Purely symbolic actions

396
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,930
will not yield any results.

397
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,100
Viceroy Liang,

398
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,680
then what do you say about those Beiyang

who sent a joint telegram
to force the Emperor's hand?

401
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,790
Should we just sit here
and wait for our doom?

402
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,310
No.

403
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,900
We are not chickens

404
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,550
to be slaughtered at will.

405
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,070
That's right.

406
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,570
Viceroy Liang,

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,160
the Royalist Party

408
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,240
is ready to take action.

409
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,630
We'll meet pistols with pistols,

410
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:10,630
bombs with bombs,

411
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,660
and threats with threats.

412
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:13,500
Yes.

413
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,160
Viceroy Liang,

414
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
give us the order.

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,750
Whoever forces the emperor to abdicate,

416
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,400
we'll fight them to the death.

417
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
We'll all go down together!

418

Let's fight them!

421
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,480
Calm down!

422
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,210
As members of the Royalist Party,

423
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,070
you are also

424
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,930
officers of the Imperial Guards.

Before the situation becomes clear,

426
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,000
any extreme actions taken

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,920
are irrational,

428
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,070
and even foolish.

429
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,150
They'll only give others excuses.

430
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
All your actions

431
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,020
must be approved by me.

432
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,440

-Yes.
-Yes.

434
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,430
What is it?

435
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,670
The verbal message to Yuan Shikai

436
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,050
has taken effect.

437
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,930
Yuan Shikai has started to
pressure the court.

438
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,460
What do you mean?

439
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,040
The revolutionary party is making trouble,

440
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,460
the constitutional party supports them,

441
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,860
and Beiyang is pressuring the court.

442
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,970
This is heaven's will.

443

The Qing dynasty

444
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,160

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,480
Also,

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,900
that classmate of yours,

449
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,560
the one involved with the Royalist Party,

450
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,240
must be the one
who changes the course of history.

451
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,900
Do you understand what I mean?

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,900
Liang Xiang?

453
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,790
That's the one.

454
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,050
If he's not eliminated,

455
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,820
the danger will be immense.

456
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,530
What do you mean?

457
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,560
You two are close.

458
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,680
He has no guard against you.

459
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,160
Your chances of success are very high.

460
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,300
You want me to kill him?

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,700
At the Tokyo Military School,

462
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,230
if it weren't for him,

463
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,730
I definitely wouldn't be sitting

464
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,250
where I am today.

465
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,110
He saved my life.

466
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,690
So, between you two...

467
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,480
Humans...

468
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,670
As someone who can be called

469
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,870
a human being,

470
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,960
even if I can't
repay kindness with kindness,

471
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,310
if I repay kindness with resentment,

472
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,880
or repay kindness with murder,

473
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,850
then I, Gu Maichen,

474
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,380

It's really great

554

you could come.

559
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,449
Was I in your dreams?

560
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,760
I'm sorry.

561
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,150
I wasn't?

562
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,080
You really weren't.

563
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,110
What about Kaizhi?

564
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,130
Was he there?

565
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,710
Not him either.

566
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,330
I wanted to dream of him,

567
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,400
but...

568
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,920
Your dreams

569
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,580
are truly just dreams.

570
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,340
None of your friends were in them.

571
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,670
They were all so vague and elusive.

572
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,400
I forgot upon waking.

573
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
That's just like you.

574
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,280
I, Li Renjun, live a simple life.

575
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,000
I think simply too.

576
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,030
So I don't dream.

577
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,440
I just sleep when I lie down,

578
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,070
and fall asleep as soon
as I close my eyes.

579
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,920
I think you

580
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,960
just dream too much.

581
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,610
You dream at night,

582
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,550
and during the day too.

583
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,670
It really is like that.

584
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,220
Are dreams of any use?

585
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,950
In dreams, you may travel
thousands of miles,

586
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,410
but when you wake up,
aren't you still in bed?

587
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,740
Tufang,

588
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,190
listen to my advice.

589
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,570
Stop dreaming.

590
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,490
It's useless.

591
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,620
I can hear it in your voice.

592
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,550
You think I've become like this

593
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,420
entirely by my own doing.

594
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,650
Qianli.

595
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,370
Those who criticize me

596
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,080
are heroes.

597
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,980
If I die,

598
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,230
the Qing dynasty falls.

599
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,790
Why hasn't anyone come?

600
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,330
Do they know we're
continuing the court discussion today?

601
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,440
Your Highness,

602
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,570
everyone has been notified.

603
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,930
So that means...

604
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,810
Liang Xiang's death was too tragic.

605
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,090
Yes,

606
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,990
it was too tragic.

607
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,510
Why did such a thing happen?

608
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,340
Yes,

609
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,540
why did such a thing happen?

610
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,850
In that case,

611
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,780
Prince Chun,

612
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,640
what should be our stance right now?

613
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,410
Your Highness, you are wise.

614
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,190
Whatever you think should be done,

615
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,250
that's what we should do.

616
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,210
We are just a widow and a child.

617
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,910
What stance could we possibly have?

618
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,770
Quickly, go tell Yuan Shikai

619
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,440
everything is negotiable.

620
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,550
Protecting the lives of my son and I

621
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,080
is crucial.

622
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,630
Yes,

623
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:59,170
protecting the empress dowager

624
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,800
and the emperor's lives

625
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,400
is the most crucial.

626
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:50,850
[The Royalists were crushed by
the wheel of history. The revolutionists
weren't able to free the people]

627
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,720
[The fruits of the Xinhai Revolution
fell into the hands of Yuan Shikai and
Chinese history entered a new era]

628
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:04,120
[The Communist Party of China was
established in 1921, bringing light to the
people who'd been searching in the dark.]

629
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:11,500
[The End]

630
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,440
Everyone,

631
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,630
line up according to the order

632
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,920
on the roster.

633
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,920
Do you hear me?

634
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,010
Adjust your positions now.

635
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,440
Don’t get it wrong.

636
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,830
Drillmaster,

637
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,400
can you read the roster in your hand?

638
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,670
I forgot who I’m lined up with.

639
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,400
Cadet, what’s your name?

640
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,070
Yang Kaizhi!

641
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,360
I'll start from the three before you.

642
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,890
Don't forget again.

643
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,030
Gu Maichen.

644
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,000
Here!

645
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,070
Li Renjun.

646
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:29,590
Here!

647
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,760
Liang Xiang.

648
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,090
Liang Xiang's here!

649
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,330
Use military language.

650
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,540
Liang Xiang, here!

651
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,230
Yang Kaizhi.

652
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,440
Here!

653
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,420
Do you remember your spot?

654
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,320
Yes.

655
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,370
Zhang Xianzhao.

656
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,230
Here!

657
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,110
Remember where you are now.

658
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,320
This is

659
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,670
your order.

660
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,510
According to this order,

661
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,800
you will live,

662
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,280
learn,

663
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:07,710
and fight.

664
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Understand?

665
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,110
Yes.

666
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,070
-Get ready to take the photo.
-Yes.

667
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:18,070
You're such a troublemaker.

668
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,960
Feel good now?

669
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,500
It's comfortable to stand on my left?

670
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,440
Who else's spotlight would I
take advantage of?

671
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,230
You're a noble.

672
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,890
Let's start taking the photo.

673
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,590
Remember,

674
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,760
from the moment the shutter is pressed,

675
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,070
you will become

676
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:42,030
a member of

677
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,840
the Tokyo Army Academy.

678
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,000
Don't let us down.

679
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,710
Ready.

680
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,550
We'll start on the count of three.

681
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,110
One, two, three.

682
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,300
[If life could remain
the way it was when we first met,]
[There would be no grief
over the past on the painted fan]
