[Episode 24]

3
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,509
A few days ago, Yang Kaizhi

4
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,350
sent me a letter from Beijing.

5
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,120
He said he wants to secure a position
commanding troops

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,780
and needs a large sum of money.

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,430
He didn't say it outright,

8
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,360
but I could read between the lines.

9
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,710
Is that so?

10
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,759
You're also close with Kaizhi?

11
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,620
Close? That's putting it mildly.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,840
I'm his benefactor.

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,810
I've always had his back

14
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,840
throughout his journey.

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Shuhong,

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,750
I think

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,250
I think we might as well work together.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
I have high hopes for you.

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,960
You have a natural talent for business.

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,870
In you, I've found something

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,150
I never saw

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,360
in my own son.

23
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,400
As for what exactly that is,

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,520
I can't quite put my finger on
what it is yet,

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,910
but you have a certain charisma.

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,840
Take the woman staying at my house—

27
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,680
she's incredibly picky.

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,270
But when she talked about you today,

29
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,530
it was nothing short of

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,960
remarkable.

31
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,470
Shuhong,

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,980
you're really good at emotional blackmail.

33
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,670
What are you two laughing about?

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,079
Mrs. Song,

35
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,430
you've come at just the right time.

36
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,630
There's something I'd like to tell you.

37
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,150
I've taken on a disciple.

38
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,000
A disciple?

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,079
A female one.

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,080
You want to take her on,

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,520
but she might not even acknowledge you.

42
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,710
Don't have any ill intentions.

43
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,080
That's why I'm asking you to
act as an intermediary.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,240
To avoid any misunderstandings with Shuhong

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,310
or with you.

46
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,690
Candied hawthorn!

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Fresh candied hawthorn!

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,430
Candied hawthorn!

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,600
Candied hawthorn!

50
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,410
Candied hawthorn!

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,150
Two sticks of candied hawthorn, please.

52
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, Sir.

53
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,600
Master Yang.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,710
Here you are, Sir.

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,030
Thank you, Sir.

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,710
Candied hawthorn!

57
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,520
Candied hawthorn!

58
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,990
[Wu Bugu]

59
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,579
The Zhejiang-Anhui Uprising

60
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,500
has shaken the court deeply.

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,380
They've already ordered all provinces

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,710
to disband the revolutionary party

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,370
and arrest the key offenders.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Fortunately,

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,690
I went through the list,

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,690
and your name

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
wasn't on it.

68
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,630
We should thank
Wu Tianbai and the others for that.

69
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,890
They dismissed me before taking action.

70
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,230
Otherwise, our entire family

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,050
would have ended up in the police station.

72
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,310
I'm good. You can have it.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,680
See that? He gets it.

74
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,430
He's trying to calm me down
on his dad's behalf.

75
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,970
Kaizhi, don't get your hands dirty.

76
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,680
Have a seat.

77
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,980
Oh, right.

78
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,310
What on earth is

79
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,190
going on between you two?

80
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,070
How did it escalate so far

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,840
that it led to a split?

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,600
That person's just an

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
anarchist.

84
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,600
To him, action is everything.

85
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,870
He wants to smash everything
and be done with it.

86
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,040
As for me,

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,730
I have bigger ideals.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,640
It's not just about China
becoming strong and wealthy.

89
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,170
That's only the first step.

90
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,720
What matters more

91
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,880
is transforming China

92
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,240
into a civilized society.

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,560
And a civilized China should help

94
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,900
the world become more civilized too.

95
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,440
That way, we can change this world,

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,390
where imperial powers

97
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,870
trample weaker nations at will,

98
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,110
and turn this savage world
into something better.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,730
You, Yang Yifan,

100
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,150
are really turning into a professor.

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,510
Are you seriously planning to
go into education now?

102
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,670
Isn't it obvious?

103
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,720
During the Zhejiang-Anhui Uprising,

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,870
only a small group of elites
sacrificed themselves,

105
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,130
while the majority stayed indifferent.

106
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,290
It feels like your revolution

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,800
has no connection to the common people.

108
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,920
If we want to change China,

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,430
we have to start by educating the people

110
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,000
and winning their hearts.

111
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,370
You, Yifan, are a Juren.

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,000
It's only natural for someone like you

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,260
to become a professor.

114
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,220
As for me,

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,750
I'm just a simple soldier.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,260
Becoming a professor is beyond my reach.

117
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,780
So what can I do?

118
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,540
Wu Bugu,

119
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,430
come here.

120
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll be your father.

121
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,930
How does that sound?

122
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,840
I already have a father.

123
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,880
Does your father teach you how to read?

124
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,430
Exactly.

125
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,550
Well, I can teach you how to read.

126
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,740
Have you ever heard of "The Youth of China"?

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,750
Listen,

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
"It's wonderful! Our youthful China

129
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,570
lives forever with the sky.

130
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,800
In strength, our China's youth

131
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,870
is boundless like our country."

132
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
Recite with me:

133
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,240
The sun has just risen,
casting a brilliant light upon the path ahead.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,190
The sun has just risen,
casting a brilliant light upon the path ahead.

135
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,310
A river bursts forth from the earth,
surging toward the vast sea.

136
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,920
A river bursts forth from the earth,
surging toward the vast sea.

137
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,480
A dormant dragon leaps from the depths,
its scales and claws flashing in motion.

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,240
A dormant dragon leaps from the depths,
its scales and claws flashing in motion.

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,870
See?

140
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,720
This kid's sharp.

141
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
Listen,

142
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,150
children are our future,

143
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,430
and the future's looking bright.

144
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,410
Right, Bugu?

145
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,530
Wait here.

146
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,270
Take us to Taifeng Restaurant in a bit.

147
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,750
Understood.

148
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,280
Alright.

149
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,630
Is this the place?

150
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,690
Yes, this is where Master Yang lives.

151
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,360
Coming.

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,100
You're back...

153
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
What's your relationship with Kaizhi?

154
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,800
Who are you?

155
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I am Liang Xiang.

156
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,510
Where is he?

157
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,210
Duke Liang,

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,590
I've heard of you.

159
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,630
Kaizhi is accompanying my husband

160
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,760
to the Imperial University of Peking.

161
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,780
Auntie, I'm hungry.

162
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,630
Why did you run out here?

163
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,480
It's cold outside. Go back in, quickly.

164
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,010
Hurry up.

165
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,929
This child's

166
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
quite something.

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,730
Just look at those big eyes.

168
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,080
Why are they going to

169
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
the Imperial University of Peking?

170
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,000
That's men's business.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,800
I wouldn't know a thing about it.

172
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,640
Why don't you go inside and wait?

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
How disappointing.

174
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,750
The beads, Auntie!

175
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,840
I want the beads!

176
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,790
You shouldn't point at people like that.

177
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,870
It's rude.

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,090
This one?

179
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,840
Well, Duke Liang...

180
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,120
If you like it, it's yours.

181
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,750
Oh, you really shouldn't.

182
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,480
Don't worry. It's just a child.

183
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,070
When Kaizhi returns,

184
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,960
have him come to my house immediately.

185
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,260
I have something urgent to discuss with him.

186
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,140
Alright.

187
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Say goodbye to the uncle.

188
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,290
Goodbye, Uncle.

189
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,140
Look, Auntie! A bead!

190
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,870
Just look at yourself,

191
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,130
what's gotten into you?

192
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,380
How could you take something
from a stranger?

193
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,710
Go inside, now.

194
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,420
[Li Renjun's Mansion]

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,270
Hi there.

196
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, Sis.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Liang's inside,

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,630
drinking with my good-for-nothing husband.

199
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,280
Looks like they won't be leaving
anytime soon.

200
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,770
Why don't you come in and have some snacks?

201
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,750
It's freezing out here.

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,750
No need to wait in the cold.

203
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,630
No worries, Sis.

204
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,000
Just keep an eye on them, that's all.

205
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,750
Well, in that case,

206
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
I'll go grab you two flatbreads.

207
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,550
I'll be right back. They're nice and hot.

208
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,310
Thanks, Sis.

209
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,320
During that autumn military drill
in Zhangde,

210
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,270
no one remembers

211
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,200
the top brass

212
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,450
of our Beiyang Army,

213
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,380
except for you, Liang Xiang.

214
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,910
Everyone, from the highest ranks down,
remembers you clearly.

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,400
You think I'm too strict and impartial?

216
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,440
Nonsense.

217
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,620
They're actually out to get you.

218
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,080
That's not quite right.

219
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,030
Then why was I the only one they remembered?

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,870
Think about it.

221
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,190
Why didn't that rebel, Wang Han,

222
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,730
target anyone else

223
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,390
but you, Liang Xiang?

224
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,000
With just one loud blast,

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,390
blood and flesh flew everywhere.

226
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,200
Your name, Liang Xiang,

227
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,510
spread like wildfire.

228
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,870
Now everyone knows it.

229
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,040
Renjun,

230
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,150
you really do have a way with words.

231
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,010
Stop drinking.

232
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,320
I was among the first to hear about

233
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,630
the uprising led by
Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin in the south.

234
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,000
I witnessed firsthand

235
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,390
how Duanfang, the Viceroy of Liangjiang,

236
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,750
was thrown into chaos.

237
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,750
I had met

238
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,080
Xu and Qiu before,

239
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
during my time in Tokyo.

240
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,870
Xu's uncle

241
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,340
once served as the Governor of Hunan.

242
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,440
Just last month, I saw him again

243
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,770
at Taifeng Restaurant.

244
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,000
I know Xu and Qiu too.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,670
It seems this revolution is happening
among people we actually know.

246
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,130
In the past, rebels usually

247
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,790
came from rural backgrounds.

248
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,680
But this time, it's different.

249
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,260
They're all part of the same circle.

250
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,390
They're all elites.

251
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,080
We all know each other.

252
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,250
Tokyo isn't that big.

253
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,120
We run into each other all the time.

254
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,910
I probably

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,320
even know the person

256
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,000
who wants to kill me.

257
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,890
Really?

258
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
Are you sure?

259
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,580
Who could hold such a grudge against you?

260
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,270
Do you think it's possible,

261
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,000
Kaizhi?

262
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Of course it is.

263
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,200
That's why, Liang Xiang,

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
your meteoric rise to power

265
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,000
might not be such a blessing after all.

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,670
Exactly.

267
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,050
Take Duanfang, for example—
he rose just as quickly.

268
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
But that night,

269
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,610
I saw how miserable he really was.

270
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,510
His eyes were bloodshot,

271
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,910
and his voice was hoarse.

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He neither ate nor slept,

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,080
working through dozens of telegrams
and documents all night long.

274
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,870
At dawn,

275
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,820
he didn't even have time to wash his face

276
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,440
before rushing straight to Jiangning.

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,870
What's so great about
being a high-ranking official?

278
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,440
He might be a provincial governor now,

279
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,320
but all he can do is defend himself.

280
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,390
He's got no strength left to fight back.

281
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,200
I guess

282
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,750
there are probably more people
who want him dead

283
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,320
than those who want me dead.

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,950
Look at me, running my mouth like this.

285
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,440
We haven't seen each other in days,

286
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,870
and instead of talking about good things,

287
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm just bringing up all this bad luck.

288
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,320
Tufang,

289
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,540
let's drop it.

290
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,550
I've caught wind of something

291
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,810
at the Ministry of War.

292
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,080
The memorial you submitted

293
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,200
has caught the Empress Dowager's attention.

294
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Is that true?

295
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
It seems so.

296
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,010
Come on, Renjun.

297
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,000
When you get back to Baoding, watch

298
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,750
how the 3rd Division

299
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,750
curses me.

300
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,510
Just listen to what you said.

301
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,910
Why would they curse you?

302
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,910
Because I'm famous again, of course.

303
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,050
My name's

304
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,630
spreading like wildfire now,
just like you said,

305
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,840
but nobody likes it.

306
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,210
Nah, come on, have a drink!

307
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,560
Stand up, everyone.

308
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,340
Greetings, students.

309
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,390
Greetings, teacher.

310
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Please be seated.

311
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,340
I've heard that

312
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,150
during this period,

313
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,720
the academy has invited

314
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,440
military attachés from Germany

315
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,300
and military advisors from Japan

316
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,240
to brief you on

317
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,840
the latest developments in world armies.

318
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,440
I'm very pleased

319
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,510
to hear this.

320
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,420
China's army modernization

321
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,600
must keep pace

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,670
with global military advancements

323
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,320
if we want to completely break free

324
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,870
from the cycle of defeat.

325
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:10,800
Alright.

326
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Now, what I'm about to say...

327
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,180
It seems that your lecture

328
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,140
and the memorial you submitted

329
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,280
share quite a few similarities.

330
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,550
I never expected Your Highness

331
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,210
to attend the class in person.

332
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,500
I suppose it's time
I made my position clear.

333
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,910
From where I stand,

334
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,500
whether I listen or not

335
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,640
is merely for show.

336
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,570
The Empress Dowager
has already made up her mind

337
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,610
to establish

338
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,690
an independent Imperial Guards unit

339
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,930
to take over all internal security duties

340
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,020
in Beijing.

341
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,920
So that's how it is.

342
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,400
You're the one who started this,
Liang Xiang.

343
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,120
It was your memorial

344
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
that convinced the Empress Dowager

345
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,910
to form the new-style,
army-like Imperial Guards,

346
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,480
made up entirely of

347
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
bannermen.

348
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,910
This will replace the old system,

349
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,770
where the 1st and 6th Divisions

350
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,480
of the Beiyang Army

351
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,780
took turns guarding Beijing.

352
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,810
It's a significant change.

353
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,150
The post of Commander of the Imperial Guards

354
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,350
has become highly sought after.

355
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,470
Many are vying for it,

356
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,750
myself included.

357
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,670
I can't afford to give anyone
the slightest excuse

358
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,530
to let such a vital position

359
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,860
fall into the wrong hands.

360
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,670
So...

361
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,540
So,

362
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,180
whether Your Highness
attends the lectures or not,

363
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,610
it sends a clear message.

364
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,790
Of course.

365
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,740
Your lecture, Tufang,

366
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,760
left quite an impression on me.

367
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I should've come to listen earlier.

368
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,680
If we're

369
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,890
going to

370
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,480
reform the Imperial Guards

371
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,740
to match a modern army,

372
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,550
there's a lot that needs to be done.

373
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,599
So,

374
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,440
before an official is appointed to

375
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,240
oversee the training,

376
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,660
someone needs to start laying

377
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,750
the groundwork.

378
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,240
I've proposed that you

379
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
take on this role.

380
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,850
Thank you for your trust, Your Highness.

381
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,780
No need to thank me.

382
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,200
Another grand councilor

383
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,660
has endorsed my proposal.

384
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,160
Do you know who it is?

385
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,030
I'm not quite sure.

386
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,490
Yuan.

387
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,560
Yuan Shikai.

388
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,030
Is that so?

389
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,000
He's always calculating.

390
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,030
If he can't outright

391
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,070
oppose a motion,

392
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,030
he'll just

393
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,110
go along with it

394
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,110
to avoid

395
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,970
completely alienating himself.

396
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,220
I appreciate Your Highness's reminder.

397
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,370
You'd better start preparing soon.

398
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,790
The court appointment

399
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,190
will be announced within the next few days.

400
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,670
The official title for the position will be

401
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,140
Acting Commander of the Imperial Guards.

402
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,310
"Acting Commander" sounds fitting.

403
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,720
I'll lay a solid foundation
for Your Highness.

404
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,520
Rest assured,

405
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,680
the force I eventually hand over to you

406
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,720
will be one

407
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
that can rival

408
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,350
the Imperial Guard of Japan—

409
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,620
a modern, elite army.

410
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,800
Hurry up!

411
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,560
Help me take the portrait down.

412
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,760
Be careful.

413
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,750
Don't drop it.

414
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Hurry up!

415
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,780
The head's facing downwards.

416
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,240
That's not how you hold it!

417
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,650
It's such a simple task,

418
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,550
and you're all messing it up.

419
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,790
Shuhong, Bugu,

420
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,210
my wife and child.

421
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,560
I'm alive and well.

422
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,330
Everything's fine.

423
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,420
Please don't worry about me.

424
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,880
Miss Shuhong.

425
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,890
Miss Shuhong.

426
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,440
Miss Shuhong.

427
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,170
The master is looking for you.

428
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,640
Chairman Song.

429
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,030
You went out?

430
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,070
Yes.

431
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
Staying here all day,

432
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,310
it's really...

433
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,590
As long as you don't leave the Settlement,

434
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,450
there shouldn't be any problems.

435
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,680
Even Cai Yuanpei, who has a warrant

436
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
out for him,

437
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,570
was only taken in by the police

438
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,590
for questioning and then released.

439
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,790
Is that so?

440
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,100
You look so lost,

441
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,380
Shuhong.

442
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,310
In Tokyo, I ran a photography studio

443
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,570
and a stationery shop.

444
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,360
I sold paintings, books, sausages, and hams.

445
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,830
In Osaka, I dabbled in fashion
and ran a flower business.

446
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,070
I was never idle.

447
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,600
But now... living like this

448
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,160
is really hard to take.

449
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,590
You can do all of that

450
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,030
in Shanghai too.

451
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,650
As long as you're willing,

452
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,910
you can start anytime.

453
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,110
I miss my child.

454
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,090
I never used to feel this way,

455
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,290
but now it's different.

456
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,890
There's this emptiness,

457
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,340
like I've lost my footing.

458
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
If that's all that's bothering you,

459
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,590
then you can rest easy.

460
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,930
Kaizhi wrote from Beijing.

461
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,200
Your sister and brother-in-law

462
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,010
are staying at his place

463
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,090
with your son.

464
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,030
I've made a fool of myself, Chairman.

465
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,860
Mothers

466
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,280
are all the same.

467
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,120
You feel the same things

468
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,180
and think the same thoughts.

469
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,030
Let's sit down and talk.

470
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,560
Sit down.

471
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,980
It's always better to talk while sitting.

472
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,040
You really should find something to do.

473
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,680
Shuhong,

474
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,610
there are suitable options out there.

475
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,710
And even if they're not perfect,
it doesn't matter.

476
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,990
Just try something.

477
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,910
Take finding a horse, for example.

478
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,300
There are many ways to go about it.

479
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,070
You could start by finding a donkey,

480
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,990
then ride the donkey
while looking for a horse.

481
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,810
Ride the donkey while looking for a horse?

482
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,240
I have many responsibilities
at the Shanghai Business Association,

483
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,110
and each one requires

484
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,830
capable hands.

485
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,880
Not all of them

486
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,310
may be a perfect fit for you,

487
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,680
but that's alright.

488
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,640
Just start with something.

489
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,590
And as you go,

490
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,190
you'll discover
what you're truly suited for.

491
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,660
Now that the child has been found,

492
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,770
I can finally be at peace.

493
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,410
Really,

494
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,720
there's no

495
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,980
better news than that.

496
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,590
So, tell me,

497
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,440
what can I do?

498
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,560
I've made a deal with
Zhang Jizhi from Nantong

499
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
to take over a low-profile newspaper

500
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,720
here in Shanghai.

501
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,310
The goal is to turn it into

502
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,790
a nationally influential paper

503
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,650
in a short time.

504
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,590
You mean that top scholar
and boss of Dasheng,

505
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,550
Zhang Jian?

506
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,410
Yes,

507
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,720
Zhang Jian, also known as Zhang Jizhi.

508
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,330
He's currently in Shanghai,

509
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,070
organizing the
Preparatory Constitutional Association

510
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,050
and launching a petition campaign
to the parliament.

511
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,250
And no campaign

512
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,980
can succeed without public support.

513
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,070
Boss.

514
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,200
What are you

515
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,750
putting in front of me?

516
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,510
It seems to have been sent by

517
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,130
Miss Shuhong from Shanghai.

518
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,310
Shuhong?

519
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,170
Take one out and let me have a look.

520
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,980
Looks like she's asking us

521
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,440
to help reprint something in the newspaper.

522
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,830
We can ignore others,

523
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,600
but I can't refuse

524
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Shuhong.

525
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,030
Take this

526
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
to the Asahi Shimbun,

527
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,920
ask for the president,

528
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,920
and tell him I personally requested this:
It must be

529
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,480
reprinted on the front page.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,510
Understood, sir.

531
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,310
Make sure they clearly indicate

532
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,350
it's reprinted from the Shanghai News,

533
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,290
the newspaper
with the largest circulation in Shanghai.

534
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,090
Did you get that?

535
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,620
Yes, sir.

536
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,210
What's Shanghai News?

537
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,710
I've never heard of it.

538
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,640
Come, Baoquan.

539
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,020
Try the tea I made.

540
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,230
Our news

541
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,110
made the front page

542
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,350
of Japan's biggest newspaper!

543
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,610
What kind of news is it?

544
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,120
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

545
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,320
Where are you going?

546
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,650
I'm going to find Jizhi.

547
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,020
You're not even going to have your meal?

548
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,840
Twenty thousand yuan in total?

549
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,990
That much?

550
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,000
That's right.

551
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,430
This is what you deserve.

552
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,930
This doesn't seem right.

553
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,440
Shuhong, you've got real talent.

554
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,200
You don't know how happy

555
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,830
Jizhi was today.

556
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,310
He spent the whole day

557
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,070
answering telegrams from all over.

558
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,830
So many prominent people

559
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,130
want to sign the petition to parliament.

560
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,590
You, girl,

561
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
managed to get our news

562
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,140
on the front page of
a major Tokyo newspaper!

563
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,670
Do you know what that means?

564
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,070
After just one round of distribution,

565
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,680
the whole country knows

566
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,200
Zhang Jizhi

567
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
is leading
this parliamentary petition movement.

568
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,200
What an incredible achievement.

569
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,240
Here, take the 20,000 yuan.

570
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,760
Just in time to buy back your sister's

571
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,960
electric appliance store.

572
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,930
That way, you'll have a solid base

573
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,690
in Shanghai for future growth.

574
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,470
Thank you so much, Chairman.

575
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,770
Don't mention it.

576
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,720
We still have

577
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
a long road ahead

578
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,820
working together in our careers.

579
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,120
By the way,

580
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,960
what kind of connections do you have

581
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,070
in Tokyo?

582
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,050
They seem quite influential.

583
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,240
Just an acquaintance.

584
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,760
Oh, right.

585
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,570
Actually, he has a favor

586
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,070
to ask of you.

587
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,160
What is it?

588
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,600
The newly appointed
Japanese military attaché to China

589
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,790
is about to take up his post in Beijing

590
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,240
and will be passing through Shanghai.

591
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,310
He wants to meet

592
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,480
China's

593
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,720
constitutional leader,

594
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,440
Zhang Jian.

595
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,770
He's hoping you can help
arrange the meeting.

596
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,710
That shouldn't be a problem.

597
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,910
I'll help you with it.

598
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,110
What's the attaché's

599
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,650
name?

600
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,170
Ichiro Hirata.

601
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:37,920
Look!

602
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,270
What's that?

603
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,070
That's a street performance.

604
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,110
Wow, amazing!

605
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,360
He's breathing fire!

606
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,700
Look!

607
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,630
It's so much fun!

608
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,220
So impressive!

609
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,070
Make way!

610
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,070
Look!

611
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,350
What's that?

612
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,970
So impressive!

613
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,200
Such a lively Beijing—

614
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,350
I love it!

615
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,370
Yes.

616
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,160
[Ichiro Hirata, Japanese military attaché to China]

617
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,200
It's a bit dirty

618
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,910
and a bit chaotic,

619
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,440
but it's still the capital
of a great nation after all.

620
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,830
What's that over there?

621
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,040
Seems like some kind of food.

622
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,260
Candied hawthorn.

623
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,480
Hello.

624
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,780
Hello.

625
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,440
Give me one, please.

626
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,540
One copper coin

627
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,790
each.

628
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,890
Thank you.

629
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,030
Candied hawthorn.

630
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,720
It's so delicious.

631
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,440
Is it good?

632
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,310
Try some.

633
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,680
How is it?

634
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,030
It's good.

635
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,790
So sweet.

636
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,530
Be careful.

637
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,930
People in Tokyo

638
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,440
walk way too fast.

639
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,920
Out on the streets,

640
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,480
everyone's rushing

641
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,740
like they're racing to be reborn.

642
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,350
As an old Chinese lady,

643
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,350
I just wanted to ask for directions,

644
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,460
but they just shook their heads
like rattles.

645
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,240
Just like this.

646
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,590
I kept looking and looking,

647
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,700
but couldn't figure out

648
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,420
who to ask.

649
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,210
But what stuck with me the most

650
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,840
was something that happened

651
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,200
in a bathhouse in Tokyo.

652
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,160
There was an elderly Japanese woman.

653
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
The moment she saw me,

654
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,890
she immediately knew I was Chinese.

655
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,310
I was baffled.

656
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,330
We hadn't even spoken,

657
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,110
right?

658
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,200
And

659
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,070
we were both naked in a bathhouse.

660
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,640
How could she tell

661
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,750
I was Chinese?

662
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,030
She told me,

663
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,890
the easiest way to tell a Chinese person

664
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,590
from a Japanese one

665
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,590
is by looking at their feet.

666
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,110
So I said,

667
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,010
"If someone had bound feet,

668
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,400
I could see how you'd tell.

669
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,790
That's obvious.

670
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,310
But I've

671
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,200
never had my feet bound.

672
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,470
My feet are just average-sized.

673
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
How could you tell?"

674
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,590
A Chinese girl nearby

675
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,720
translated for me.

676
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,440
It's not the feet,

677
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,070
but the toes.

678
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,870
Chinese people's

679
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,320
toes are close together,

680
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,800
whereas Japanese people's

681
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,070
big toe

682
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,360
is set apart from the others.

683
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,480
Why?

684
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,720
It's because

685
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
they wear wooden clogs all the time.

686
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,550
That toe gap is always stretched

687
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,670
and never goes back to normal.

688
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,120
Alright, Mother.

689
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,970
You've only been in Tokyo for a few days.

690
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,030
How do you already have so many jokes?

691
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,550
Yoshiko and I

692
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,500
just arrived in Beijing two days ago,

693
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,750
and we're already loving it.

694
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,450
It's full of history,

695
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,280
and the people

696
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,630
are simple and honest.

697
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,960
Last time at your place,

698
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,560
those pastries you served

699
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,070
were delicious.

700
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,350
Here,

701
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,290
try this.

702
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,030
This is Ma Xiangxin's flatbread.

703
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,030
What do you think?

704
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,310
How is it?

705
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,330
It's really good!

706
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:31,960
Son,

707
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,110
when you have the chance,

708
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,550
talk to Chief Steward Li
and smooth things over.

709
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,700
Take the ladies to visit the Summer Palace.

710
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,830
Take a good look around.

711
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,350
Make sure they see the Jade Bridge,

712
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,110
the White Marble Boat,
and the painted corridors.

713
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,920
And especially,

714
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,790
ask Chief Steward Li to bring out

715
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,830
some of the jade treasures

716
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,200
from the Summer Palace.

717
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,960
Let Miss Yoshiko

718
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,310
have a proper look.

719
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,480
No problem.

720
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,710
I'll have Er handle it.

721
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,230
That kid's got connections everywhere.

722
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:01,980
Duo Mei.

723
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,310
It's exactly the same

724
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,030
as the painting your husband

725
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,480
gave us.

726
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,360
Really?

727
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,480
It's beautiful.

728
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,960
I saw in a Tokyo intelligence report

729
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,679
that you were nearly

730
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,150
assassinated in Zhangde.

731
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,280
It gave me quite a scare.

732
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,560
You know about that too?

733
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,570
It actually wasn't that serious.

734
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,400
Why is Tokyo

735
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,679
so concerned with these things?

736
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,190
The Tokyo military leadership

737
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,230
has long regarded you
as one of the most promising officers

738
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,060
in the Chinese military.

739
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,400
You're still showing such

740
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,880
consistent favor towards me.

741
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,960
It really leaves me

742
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,290
at a loss for words.

743
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,150
What's your view on

744
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,630
the grassroots revolutionary movements

745
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,560
happening across China right now?

746
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,440
As long as they don't spread to Manchuria,

747
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,290
the military leaders here

748
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,260
probably won't pay much attention.

749
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,400
That lines up

750
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,600
pretty closely with my own assessment.

751
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,120
Drillmaster Hirata,

752
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,770
Japan shouldn't be so opportunistic.

753
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,850
In Manchuria,

754
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,000
instead of

755
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,550
fighting for our country's interests,

756
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,550
it feels more like

757
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,670
you're fighting

758
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,510
for your own.

759
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,110
To be blunt,

760
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,350
isn't that a bit too sly?

761
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,710
The way you speak

762
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,130
already carries

763
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,050
the tone of a military commander.

764
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
Indeed,

765
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,440
after three days apart,

766
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,710
one should

767
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,670
see a person in a new light.

768
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,630
If you weren't

769
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,880
once my mentor,

770
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,350
I wouldn't speak to you so directly.

771
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,510
It's better to be straightforward.

772
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,170
Liang Xiang,

773
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
you know very well

774
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,370
that your country

775
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,600
has now reached

776
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,760
a historic turning point.

777
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,690
What do you mean?

778
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,110
Ichiro,

779
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,490
come take a look.

780
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,690
These goldfish are so beautiful.

781
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,820
Zaifeng's words

782
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,510
also carry this meaning.

783
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,220
It's just one thin layer away.

784
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,220
Yet,

785
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,810
that is the message.

786
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,290
Even a long-lived tortoise

787
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,000
will eventually die.

788
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,540
Logically,

789
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,510
that day has to come eventually.

790
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,650
But how could I bear to part

791
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,670
with Her Majesty?

792
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,750
I can't even imagine it.

793
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,740
Hirata

794
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,160
told me something else

795
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,200
that day.

796
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,770
I didn't dare to tell you.

797
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,960
He said that,

798
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,810
according to Japan's intelligence experts,

799
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
if the ruler were to pass away,

800
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,630
the one living in Yingtai

801
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,430
would surely die first.

802
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,370
Sounds like that Japanese
is just spouting nonsense

803
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,180
with ulterior motives.

804
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:06,850
Son,

805
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,570
you mustn't let yourself
be provoked by that.

806
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,920
I understand, Mother.

807
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,300
Why would he say such things?

808
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,190
That's just vile.

809
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,450
No.

810
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,390
Maybe they really are trying to help me.

811
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,140
You know,

812
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,320
Hirata and his wife have been...

813
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
Help you?

814
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,100
This feels more like
cursing the Qing dynasty itself!

815
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,800
Mother, don't worry.

816
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,830
I know how to judge things.

817
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,250
But because of that,

818
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,310
I'm warning you,

819
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,970
keep your distance from those Japanese.

820
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,100
Remember when those two

821
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
came over?

822
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,120
We just made small talk.

823
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,930
Son, do you understand?

824
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,620
When the friendship is shallow,

825
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,880
you shouldn't discuss serious matters.

826
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,130
The Japanese have ill intentions.

827
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,030
I understand, Mother.

828
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,870
Mother.

829
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,010
Come, Tufang.

830
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,990
Kaizhi,

831
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,290
where's that boy I saw last time I was here?

832
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,150
That was a relative's child.

833
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,150
Now,

834
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,110
they've moved
near the Imperial University of Peking.

835
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,840
My relative

836
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,100
found a job over there.

837
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,550
Have you thought about

838
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,730
what I asked you the other day?

839
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,750
I've thought it over.

840
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,550
Would you be willing
to join my Imperial Guards?

841
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,230
Tufang,

842
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,360
the Imperial Guards

843
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,590
are made up entirely of bannermen.

844
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,410
I'm a commoner.

845
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,670
It wouldn't be appropriate.

846
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,200
Kaizhi,

847
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,280
it's pointless if you look at it that way.

848
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,960
Well, you see,

849
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,550
this whole thing is meaningless.

850
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,400
And I'm not about to pretend

851
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,360
it means something when it doesn't.

852
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Don't you agree?

853
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,110
Kaizhi,

854
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,700
be honest.

855
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,320
Since we've known each other,

856
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,110
have I ever

857
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,240
treated you like a low-born commoner?

858
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,400
The country's in such a crisis,

859
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,320
and we're still caught up
in talks of noble blood and low status?

860
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,700
Isn't that just foolish?

861
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,160
Isn't that leading us straight to collapse?

862
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,410
And anyway,

863
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:43,980
I've never felt

864
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,230
there was any real difference between us.

865
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,630
We were both in Jingzhou.

866
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,750
Let me put it this way:

867
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,630
I only got

868
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,630
my first new set of clothes

869
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,230
right before going to Tokyo.

870
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,800
Bannermen

871
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,320
can't go into business or farm.

872
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,030
They have to live off their court stipends.

873
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:03,800
My father died

874
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,670
when I was just over

875
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,590
two years old.

876
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,800
So the income our family received

877
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
was very limited.

878
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,940
My mother supported us
by sewing uniforms for the camp soldiers,

879
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,750
with some help from my grandfather.

880
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,080
I already know all that.

881
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,700
Kaizhi,

882
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,790
back in Tokyo,

883
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,540
what did we promise each other?

884
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,630
To build

885
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,110
a truly modern army.

886
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,240
But now, when the time has come...
