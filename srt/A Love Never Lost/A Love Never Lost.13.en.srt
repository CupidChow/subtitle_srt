00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,880
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,400
Mr. Kanyama.

4
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,200
You're pretty.

5
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,229
Prettier than before.

6
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,610
Where have you been?

7
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,560
My brother-in-law

8
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,200
insisted I go to Utako Shimoda's school

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,330
to study for a while.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,479
Utako Shimoda?

11
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,979
She's a noble lady in Tokyo.

12
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,430
How's business

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
been lately,

14
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Mr. Kanyama?

15
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,120
Not great.

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,710
It's slack.

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,090
Even the paintings
haven't been selling since you left.

18
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,840
Mr. Wu asked me to bring this to you.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,210
Here's the thing, Shuhong.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,240
I checked out the place Mr. Wu mentioned.

21
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,430
It's a nice location.

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,970
There's a bakery
right by the street downstairs.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,290
You can consider

24
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,360
renting that shop.

25
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,870
Will they agree?

26
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,690
The bakery downstairs is doing quite well.

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,800
I'll make them agree.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
I'll open another bakery?

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,630
No, no, no.

30
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,370
A stationery shop.

31
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,360
To help me with distribution.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
What do you think?

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,590
It keeps things discreet and convenient,

34
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,310
doesn't it?

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
About the costs,

36
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,870
we can sign

37
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,200
an agreement right now.

38
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,430
Yes.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
Right, this is it.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,750
[Agreement]

41
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,310
What are you writing?

42
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,710
Go away.

43
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,240
For…

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,020
All private matters. Stop snooping.

45
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,150
What?

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
I think you're out of your mind.

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
You really don't

48
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,760
learn your lesson, do you?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
So what?

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,680
By the way,

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,960
don't tell Liang Xiang about this.

52
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,560
Why not? You're afraid of him?

53
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,710
I'm not afraid of anyone.

54
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,410
I'm just afraid

55
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,120
he'll nag me like you.

56
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,310
Never figured you

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
for the gutsy type.

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
Have you heard this poem?

59
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,680
What poem?

60
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,360
"With a smile, I walk this road.

61
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,630
With a smile,
I walk through the heart of the desert.

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,780
Where is the place I'll finally rest?"

63
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,720
Where?

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,750
"I'll be buried by unfamiliar hands

65
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,040
in the barren desert."

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
How tragic.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,830
"With a smile, I walk this road.

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,159
I keep walking,

69
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,600
walking toward where I want to be."

70
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,720
You mean hell?

71
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,159
You're hopeless.

72
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,430
What road, Kaizhi?

73
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,690
Where are you going?

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,120
I was joking with Qianli.

75
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,280
We're still on rotating patrol tonight.

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,940
The password is "curry rice."

77
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,720
Sounds delicious.

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,190
I've only heard of it in passwords.

79
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,040
The canteen never serves curry rice.

80
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,240
It's always carrot stew with potatoes.

81
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,190
Kaizhi, you're on first watch tonight.

82
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,190
Go to the post now.

83
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,310
Be on time for the changeover.

84
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,310
Don't oversleep.

85
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't worry.

[Tea]

87
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,310
You're not still tangled up

88
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,159
with that Korean girl,

89
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,270
are you?

90
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,159
Cut it out.

91
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,380
I really don't have the time.

92
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,360
I've got several exams waiting for me.

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,190
No time to teach for you.

94
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,190
I don't get it.

95
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,290
It's only a handful of you.

96
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,040
Why the need for a military school?

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
It's not my idea.

98
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,830
Sun Wen asked me for help.

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,480
He's starting the Qingshan Military School

100
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,610
and asked me to find a few instructors.

101
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,480
Aren't we

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
discussing a merger?

103
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,120
Shouldn't you show some goodwill?

104
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,050
I really can't spare the time.

105
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,610
Fine.

106
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,890
How's Liang Xiang been lately?

107
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,960
Whatever you do,

108
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,430
you have to

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,600
win him over for me.

110
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,060
He left a great first impression.

111
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,390
I have a feeling—

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,130
this guy's a real talent.

113
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,000
Of course.

114
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Li Renjun told me

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,220
Yuan Shikai

116
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,750
personally saved a regimental commander post

117
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,750
for him.

118
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,390
He's determined to win him over.

119
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,310
Yuan Shikai's making quiet moves too,

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,310
placing pawns in advance.

121
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,750
Liang Xiang's no pawn.

122
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,600
He's very popular.

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
When we left Shanghai,

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,390
Prince Chun, Zaifeng, personally met him.

125
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,870
When he arrived in Japan,

126
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,920
Prince Qing sent his son Zaizhen

127
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,270
to deliver funds.

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
On the Japanese side,

129
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Duke Ayakura

130
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
became his guardian,

131
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,600
picked out his courses,

132
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
and introduced him to Japan's upper class.

133
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,210
To put it bluntly,

134
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,870
they're grooming him for the Qing government

135
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,680
as a military leader

136
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,310
who truly understands Japan.

137
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,560
If you ask me,

138
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,790
it's not me winning him over.

139
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,270
It's him winning me over.

140
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,710
He's trying to win you over?

141
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,870
Not just me.

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,430
Every Chinese student from his class—

143
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,600
whoever's short on cash,

144
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,730
he's offering help.

145
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,430
Look at the new prep students—

146
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,390
Yue Kaixian,

147
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,680
Xu Xiaogang,

Zhang Xiaozhun,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,159
and Xu Chongzhi—

150
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,780
Liang Xiang
is making connections with all of them.

151
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,470
Hanhua.

152
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,720
I think

153
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,190
it's not you revolutionaries

154
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,560
recruiting Liang Xiang.

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,490
It's Liang Xiang

156
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,180
recruiting

157
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,140
the best of revolutionaries.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,040
Looks like

159
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,720
I underestimated that boy.

160
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
Of course.

161
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,980
Think about it.

162
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,710
A man of the imperial clan

163
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,480
actually cut off his braid.

164
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,310
Can you name a second royal

165
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,120
who's done that?

166
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,820
If that's the case,

167
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,660
here's what you do:

168
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,390
if he's trying to recruit you,

169
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,430
you play along.

170
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,940
Wherever he goes,

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
you go with him.

172
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I believe he'll need

173
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,740
a trusted right-hand man by his side.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
You want to...

175
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,750
This could be

176
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,880
a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to infiltrate his circle.

177
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,559
A perfect strategy for the revolution

178
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,380
to take Beijing one day.

179
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,600
Don't miss it, bro.

180
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,850
I'll try my best.

181
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,470
That's not enough.
You have to give it your all.

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,030
From now on, don't be distracted

183
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,670
by relationships again.

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,640
This is the library.

As a descendant
of the Eight Banners, I've always wondered

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,550
why the invincible Eight Banners Army

193
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,120
collapsed completely

194
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,290
after the defeat at Baliqiao.

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,000
Good.

196
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:10,910
You know pain,

197
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,440
and you're looking for answers in history.

198
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,760
It was brutal.

199
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,390
Many of my relatives

200
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,010
served under Sengge Rinchen's cavalry.

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,870
Tens of thousands of cavalrymen

202
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,550
were slaughtered by the British and French

203
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,870
with their Gatling guns

204
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,130
and Congreve rockets.

205
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,200
Only a few of them survived.

206
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,320
They say

207
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,030
when the Empress Dowager heard
so many royals had died,

208
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,200
she was deeply shaken.

209
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,360
So she decided they shouldn't fight anymore,

210
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,220
only serve as ceremonial guards.

211
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,180
That's no different

212
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,380
from disbanding them.

213
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,960
No different at all.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,930
But the worst pain hasn't come yet.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Not yet?

216
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,440
For China,

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,720
the most painful moment is still ahead.

218
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,130
Only when you've tasted the deepest pain

219
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,950
will you learn…

220
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,240
to reflect on it afterward.

221
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
Here's goat hair, weasel tail hair,

222
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:49,160
[Shuhong Stationery Store]

223
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,930
badger hair, and squirrel tail hair.

224
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,670
This large brush
is for writing big characters.

225
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,800
It's made from horse mane. Take a look.

226
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Brother-in-law.

227
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,180
Tianbai is upstairs.

228
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm busy here.

229
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,320
You'd also like some ink?

230
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,200
If you want ink,

231
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,670
get this top-grade ink.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,330
It's good for the brush.

233
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
This is Canggui ink.

234
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
A bit pricier,

235
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,750
but dense and smooth without being sticky.

236
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,040
It's easy to write with.

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,170
Perfect for writing spring couplets.

238
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,960
You and Shuhong
are running a little household now.

239
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,440
Hey.

240
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,270
Coffee's over there. Help yourself.

241
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:16,950
Great.

242
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,180
It tastes good.

243
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,010
Compared to back in Osaka,

244
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,900
this is heaven.

245
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,330
I heard those two bombs

246
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,090
that just went off in Guangzhou

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,200
were made by you.

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,750
How is the merger going?

249
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Don't mention it.

250
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,670
It's not that easy.

251
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,870
It'll take some time.

252
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,890
Too many differences?

253
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,810
How should I put it?

254
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,890
Our theoretical goals

255
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,000
are miles apart.

256
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,000
Both sides agree that if we don't

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
overthrow the Qing dynasty,

258
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,870
China can't be saved.

259
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,170
But as for

260
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,870
what kind of country

261
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,960
to build after that

262
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,520
and what system to adopt,

263
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,870
that's where all the shouting

264
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,200
and arguments begin.

265
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,540
Why talk about building anything now?

266
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,510
The empire's still holding the reins.

267
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,200
Tearing it down is the priority now.

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
Discussing construction now

269
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,620
only leads to disagreements,

270
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,950
making it hard to unite.

271
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,560
Tao Chengzhang feels the same way.

272
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,120
But personally, I think

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,930
Sun Wen of the Revive China Society

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
sees further than us.

275
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,070
Their theoretical goals

276
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,510
are crystal clear.

277
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,480
Since when did you

278
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,200
side with Sun Wen?

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,180
There's an old saying where I'm from—

280
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,550
before you jump into the pond,

281
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,320
you need to know how to climb back out.

282
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,270
It's easy to tear things down.

283
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,360
But after that,

284
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,510
what should we do?

285
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,120
You can't just dive in

286
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,870
without knowing how to get out.

287
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,580
Sun Wen's Three Principles of the People

288
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,080
are truly brilliant.

289
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,150
Land equalization; establishing a republic.

290
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,690
Their destination

291
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,750
is very clear.

292
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,200
Right.

293
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,690
We need to keep talking.

294
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,120
When we finally agree on our theoretical

295
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,790
goals,

296
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,170
we can talk about merging.

297
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,490
By the way,

298
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,550
what exactly is Shuhong up to?

299
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,270
She didn't really come to Tokyo

300
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,930
to do small business, did she?

301
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,320
She's got her whole heart

302
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,850
set on that shop of hers now,

303
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,470
earning every penny she can.

304
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,130
Let me tell you something.

305
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,990
Let her help you buy weapons.

306
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,680
What?

307
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,960
You want her to help me buy weapons?

308
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,290
She's got a low profile—perfect for this.

309
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,750
Of course,

310
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,630
this is

311
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,870
a last resort.

312
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,630
What?

313
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,730
You want me to buy weapons for you?

314
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,360
You want me to buy rifles?

315
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't think of them as rifles.

316
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Just think of them as…

317
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,670
celery, cabbage, and eggs.

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,790
Just a vegetable dealer.

319
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,000
This way, it won't weigh on you.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,120
How's that the same?

321
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,780
Those things can kill people!

322
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,670
Don't put it like that.

323
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,510
If you're set on it,

324
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,370
even chopsticks can kill people.

325
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,640
Let me ask you.

326
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,850
Haven't you guys done this before?

327
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,670
Then let him keep doing it.

328
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,750
Why drag me in?

329
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
Because you're capable.

330
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Don't sweet-talk me.

331
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,790
Who's paying?

332
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,200
We've raised

333
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
a donation overseas.

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,130
So you do have money.

335
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,700
Money is not a problem.

336
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,590
Then why stop the old supply chain?

337
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,350
Right now, relations

338
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,440
between Japan and Russia are tense.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,060
Japan needs China,

340
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,200
so they're trying hard to please the court.

341
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
All the things

342
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,670
revolutionaries used to

343
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,200
get away with in Japan—

344
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,240
now they've cracked down on them.

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
Every channel is cut off,

346
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,840
and everyone's under surveillance.

347
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,440
That's why we need your help.

348
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,870
Besides, it's easier for women
to move around unnoticed.

349
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,790
Fine, I'll give it a try.

350
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,550
Have them deposit the money

351
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,950
into the shop's account.

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,270
Don't short me again.

353
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,260
Integrity is important in business.

354
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,430
Hold on,

355
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,740
you're saying yes?

356
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,000
Didn't you want me to say yes?

357
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,870
But that was way too easy.

358
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,900
You just bought into this?

359
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,750
Well…

360
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,050
how could I not trust you two?

361
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,580
That's my brother-in-law.

362
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,190
Are you my nemesis?

363
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,200
See? This is why you're naive.

364
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,370
Let me tell you how you should handle this.

365
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,410
I'm all ears.

366
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,720
Even if you agree,

367
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,650
you've got to negotiate with them.

368
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,480
First,

369
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,440
you don't handle the money directly.

370
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,720
The accounts
among revolutionaries are a mess.

371
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,240
Not everyone
is a selfless saint.

372
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,960
Some are just
getting rich off this revolution.

373
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,720
Keep your hands off the cash.

374
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Arrange the ships and goods,

375
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,220
negotiate the prices,

376
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,579
but let them handle the payments.

377
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,310
Second,

378
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,069
you need to find a firearm expert.

379
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,270

You need an expert
to inspect the guns for you.

384

You need to know the prices

for different guns.

I can't have a proper conversation
with someone who doesn't understand dogs.

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,800
The war's started,
and it's about to escalate.

570
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,310
Let's just watch how these Japanese

571
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,830
mobilize their troops and move their armies.

572
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,720
They'll have to use

573
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,620
all their new weapons
and tactics, won't they?

574
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,610
It was easy for them to fight us,

575
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,590
but going up against
the Russians won't be so easy.

576
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,650
Because it's hard,

577
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,690
they'll have to throw in

578
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,090
everything they've got.

579
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:20,960
And us?

580
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,680
Amateurs watch the excitement,

581
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,410
but pros watch the techniques.

582
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,210
Isn't that exactly what we're here to learn?

583
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,480
Right.

584
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,220
Isn't that so, Tufang?

585
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,560
So you're the only wise man here.

586
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,520
The guns are a bit outdated,

587
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,260
decommissioned

588
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,240
by the army

589
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,110
five years ago.

590
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,170
But they've been well maintained.

591
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,100
Each one's coated with butter

592
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,340
and wrapped individually

593
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,830
in oilcloth.

594
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,440
Don't just talk.

595
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,800
I need to check them myself.

596
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,480
You pay,

597
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,080
and you can
get your hands on them immediately.

598
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,590
Take them back to China.

599
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,590
They're better than the stuff your army

600
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,960
is currently using.

601
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,080
Don't try to fool me.

602
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,530
The Beiyang Army's three divisions

603
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,140
all use Mannlicher rifles,

604
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,960
carbines, pistols, and Krupp cannons.

605
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,070
You're actually asking 100 yen a piece

606
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,670
for this second-hand stuff?

607
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,830
You really are an expert.

608
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,070
If I can't handle the heat,

609
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
I wouldn't be playing with fire.

610
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,110
We can…

611
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,830
negotiate the price.

612
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,110
What's going on?

613
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,790
Why are you so angry?

614
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

615
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,390
What does that mean?

616
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,920
A bunch of fools!

617
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,860
They can't even count past seven.

618
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,480
Who do you mean?

619
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,550
The Qing government

620
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,910
has made its stance
on the Russo-Japanese War.

621
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,970
You know what it is?

622
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,610
Strictly neutral.

623
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,830
Aren't they just a bunch of fools?

624
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,960
Completely rotten!

625
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,830
That's good.

626
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,160
It means tearing it down is easy.

627
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,040
I saw those

628
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,960
Japanese soldiers

629
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,200
about to head off to the front lines,

630
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,000
every one of them
ready to die without hesitation.

631
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,070
I just hate it!

632
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,070
Hate what?

633
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,850
Hate that we don't have such soldiers!

634
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,650
We've got 400 million people in China, but…

635
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,330
Stop lecturing me.

636
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,040
Just tell me,

637
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,280
did you get the price down or not?

638
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,710
Kanyama softened up.

639
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,580
How much is he willing to lower it?

640
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,710
Five yen off per gun.

641
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,350
Five's not enough.

642
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,080
At least knock another ten off.

643
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,070
For heaven's sake,

644
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:38,880
do you even know

645
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,070
what it's like out there now?

646
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,200
War is coming.

647
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,680
What will be the most valuable?

648
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,720
Guns.

649
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,590
Finding a seller at all is already lucky,

650
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,190
and you're trying to haggle?

651
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,590
You think I'm an idiot?

652
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,070
I...

653
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,480
Because of the war,

654
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,830
guns are worthless.

655
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,590
When there's war,

656
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,590
arms factories go full throttle,

657
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,850
working day and night.

658
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,960
When there's war,

659
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,560
weapons will be everywhere!

660
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,830
The more guns,

661
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:01,740
the looser the control.

662
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Just wait till thousands of people die.

663
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,320
There'll be even more guns.

664
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,490
You don't believe me?

665
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,960
Just wait and see.

666
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,080
And those second-hand guns of his?

667
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,790
Haggle!

668
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,150
Ten yen off is me being generous.

669
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,840
Why are you looking at me?

670
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,350
I didn't know you were so clever.

671
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,100
Wu Tianbai!

672
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,280
No one

673
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:46,130
[Tokyo Imperial University]

674
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,960
has the power

675
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,960
to keep us chained in slavery forever.

676
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
And no so-called destiny

677
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,490
can condemn

678
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,920
our country to permanent humiliation.

679
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,590
Not Tsarist Russia.

680
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,110
Not Japanese warlords!

681
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,230
Exactly!

682
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,320
We must have a goal.

683
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
We must have

684
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,070
a simple and clear goal.

685
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,720
It's too important.

686
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,480
With it, we find stability.

687
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,200
Without it, we fall into danger.

688
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,160
Today's China

689
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,300
could rise or fall,

690
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,320
grow strong or stay weak,

691
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,940
splinter or unite.

692
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,590
We're already

693
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,790
at a crossroads.

694
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,410
Where do we go from here?

695
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,880
Where is our country headed?

696
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,940
It comes back to that goal,

697
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,310
the goal we fight for.

698
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,280
Do you have it?

699
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,790
Yes! Yes! Yes!

700
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,270
What's the goal

701
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,900
you're talking about?

702
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,960
I know you, young man.

703
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,400
I know you support

704
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,880
reform within the court.

705
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,120
Some believe imperialism

706
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
has been China's long-term enemy,

707
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,640
and I agree

708
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,080
with that view.

709
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,400
It's well-founded.

710
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,370
But it also brings us a problem

711
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,890
we can't solve.

712
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,570
Before we gain control of state power,

713
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,070
how will we stand up

714
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,630
to the foreign powers?

715
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,000
Just by standing here

716
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,190
with empty talk?

717
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,190
That's why the only goal

718
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,090
I'm pointing you toward

719
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,300
is revolution!

720
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
With revolution,

721
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,150
we'll bury the Qing dynasty!

722
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,360
Revolution is the only way out!

723
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
Great!

724
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:24,840
Revolution!

725
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,090
Revolution! Revolution!

726
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,150
Revolution!

727
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,960
Revolution! Revolution!

728
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,840
Revolution!

729
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,630
Revolution!

730
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,840
Great!

731
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,630
Revolution!

732
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,400
Great!

733
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,480
Great!

734
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,300
[his beliefs are irreconcilable with theirs, and a fierce fight is bound to come.]

735
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,300
[Liang Xiang resolves to dedicate himself to military studies and help the court recruit new talent. At last, he realizes]

736
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:47,300
[The Russo-Japanese War rages on, stirring the hearts of all Chinese. Cries for revolution echo everywhere.]

737
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,320
Revolution! Revolution!

738
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,190
Revolution!

739
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,550
Revolution! Revolution!

740
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,270
Yang Kaizhi!

741
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,480
Let's go.

742
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,520
Kaizhi! Kaizhi!

743
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,400
I can't run anymore.

744
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,670
I'll pull you along!

745
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,320
I really can't run anymore.

746
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
Didn't you hear the commotion back there?

747
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,070
The police will be here any second.

748
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,550
Are you afraid of the police?

749
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm not afraid of them!

750
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,360
We can't let the police find out.

751
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,070
Are you afraid?

752
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,960
I'm afraid they'll disturb us.

753
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,230
Stop.

754
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,850
I really can't run anymore.

755
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:06,800
I...

756
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,310
I'm already

757
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,880
engaged.

758
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,150
Since when?

759
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:19,070
You never told me.

760
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,010
Just yesterday.

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,770
They arranged it for me.

762
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,400
Arranged it?

763
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,110
Tell me,

764
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,960
who are they? Who exactly are they?

765
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,610
Japan's Security Police.

766
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,840
What's wrong?

767
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,440
Are you afraid of them?

768
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,160
You agreed to it?

769
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,810
You think I had a choice?

770
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,910
And you're going to accept it like that?

771
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,860
It's because I refuse to accept it

772
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,480
that I came to you!

773
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,510
Take me away.

774
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,150
Let's run off together!

775
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,040
Let me think.

776
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
I need to think.

777
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,720
Think about what?

778
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,960
There's no time left!

779
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,780
Let's head for the dock now

780
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,160
and go to China together!

781
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,090
But

782
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,840
if I leave like this,

783
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,850
I'll never be able to come back.

784
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,450
Let's think it through

785
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,840
and see if there's a better way.

786
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,400
I still have my revolution in Tokyo.

787
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,190
If I take you away,

788
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,030
then…

789
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,740
Revolution and love are the same thing!

790
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,320
A revolutionary is always a romantic.

791
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,740
Please.

792
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,760
Please, take me away.

793
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,540
They're not the same.

794
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,410
Really.

795
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,070
Don't look at me like that.

796
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,000
Revolution demands sacrifice.

797
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,760
Right now, I can't…

798
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,770
I understand.

799
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,970
You never really…

800
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,670
You never really understood me.

801
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,370
It's too late for everything.

802
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,000
See?

803
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,990
Your chance is gone.

804
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,550
You missed it.

805
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,670
They're coming this way.

806
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,580
Why do we have to keep watching

807
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,590
that Korean woman every day?

808
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,590
It's exhausting.

809
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,230
It's an order from above.

810
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,730
Her father

811
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,440
is an anti-Japanese activist.

812
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,000
Please come again.

813
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,090
[Shuhong Stationery Store]

814
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,920
You're not

815
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,550
here for paintings again, are you?

816
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,650
I'm not buying anything.

817
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,790
Then you...

818
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,440
L-Last time,

819
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,370
I passed by your shop in a carriage.

820
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,800
So…

821
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,010
can I… can I treat you to a meal?

822
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:53,460
You want to…

823
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,720
buy me dinner?

824
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,020
I just ate.

825
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,030
Well…

826
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,190
Alright.

827
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,280
Maybe wait for me outside for a bit?

828
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,400
Look at me, dressed like this.

829
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,330
I'll change into something nicer.

830
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,350
Alright.
