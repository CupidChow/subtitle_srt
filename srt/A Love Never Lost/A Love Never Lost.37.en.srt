00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,930
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,240
If Wuhan becomes

4
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,820
China's Bastille...

5
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,660
Then all the Qing dynasty's

6
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,580
underlying crises

7
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,410
could be set off

8
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,540
by this single "ko."

9
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,090
The first domino

10
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,020
has already fallen.

11
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,370
Hunan, Shaanxi,

12
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,140
Jiangxi, Shanxi,

13
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,700
Yunnan,

14
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,000
one after another.

15
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,740
Who's next?

16
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,800
No one knows.

17
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,740
The most despicable thing is

18
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:53,860
the consuls of foreign powers in Wuhan

19
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,700
have all declared

20
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,870
strict neutrality.

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,810
They claim this revolution

22
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,710
is not a lower-class uprising.

23
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,400
Even the usually moderate constitutionalists

24
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,270
have now turned toward revolution in Wuhan.

25
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,740
Tang Hualong, a leading constitutionalist,

26
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,070
has outright joined the rebellion

27
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,840
and has sent telegrams

28
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,110
urging leaders in other provinces

29
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,530
to follow suit.

30
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,740
How can the Western powers

31
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,940
be so irresponsible?

32
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,050
Isn't this just like watching a boat capsize

33
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,710
from atop Yellow Crane Tower?

34
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,470
They only care about their own interests.

35
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,750
When have they ever
truly been accountable to us?

36
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,630
Since I became regent,

37
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,980
the only advice the British minister

38
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,420
has ever given me was:

39
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,530
Don't kill Yuan Shikai.

40
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,880
Do you understand?

41
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Were the six conditions Yuan Shikai proposed

42
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,940
for returning to court

43
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,460
really his own

44
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,380
idea?

45
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,260
No.

46
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,820
That was practically the last card

47
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,430
the Western powers played against me.

48
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,690
How could I not know

49
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,020
that releasing Yuan Shikai,

50
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,500
that tiger,

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,260
would only lead to bloodshed?

52
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,290
But could I stop it?

53
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,520
No, I couldn't.

54
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,480
And it's not just the Westerners.

55
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,450
Even within our own court,

56
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,730
how many are feeding him information,

57
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,990
trying to cozy up to him

58
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,330
for their own

59
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,620
future gains?

60
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,940
So,

61
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,220
Tufang, I know what you want to say,

62
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,350
even if you don't say it.

63
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,330
But there's nothing I can do.

64
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:30,970
Tufang,

65
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,360
you don't look well today.

66
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,080
You should go to bed early.

67
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,500
The Old Madam hasn't gone to bed yet?

68
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,060
No,

69
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,630
she said she was waiting for you
to come home.

70
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,170
Stepmom.

71
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,190
What is it?

72
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,970
Do other children wet the bed too?

73
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:00,910
Wait a moment.

74
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,700
Of course.

75
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,500
Bugu,

76
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
don't be ashamed.

77
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,170
When I was your age,

78
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,220
I wet the bed too.

79
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,500
How did you get better?

80
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,040
By chanting scriptures
every night before bed.

81
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,490
How do you chant them?

82
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,520
Well, repeat after me.

83
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,850
Once upon a time,
there was a Bed-Wetting King.

84
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,450
Once upon a time,
there was a Bed-Wetting King.

85
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,060
At the first watch,
he soaked his red silk quilt.

86
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,500
At the first watch,
he soaked his red silk quilt.

87
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,730
At the second watch,
he drenched his ivory bed.

88
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,290
At the second watch,
he drenched his ivory bed.

89
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,940
At the third watch,
he flooded his mandarin duck pillows.

90
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,409
At the third watch,
he flooded his mandarin duck pillows.

91
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:41,140
At the fourth watch, he soaked
his cotton shirt and flowered clothes.

92
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,170
At the fourth watch, he soaked
his cotton shirt and flowered clothes.

93
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,500
By the fifth watch,
he peed straight through to dawn,

94
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,170
leaving the room a watery mess.

95
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,820
By the fifth watch,
he peed straight through to dawn,

96
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,020
leaving the room a watery mess.

97
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,290
A watery mess.

98
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:57,500
A watery mess.

99
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,120
Bed-Wetting King.

100
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,040
Are you the Bed-Wetting King?

101
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,150
Bed-Wetting King.

102
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,540
Mother.

103
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,850
How are things in Wuchang?

104
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,290
It's a mess.

105
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
In just a few days,

106
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,340
Hunan's declared independence,

107
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,289
Shaanxi too,

108
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,020
Shanxi's rebelled and taken control.

109
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,100
And just now,

110
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,380
we got urgent telegrams

111
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,169
from Yunnan and Jiangxi.

112
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,260
It's spreading like wildfire.

113
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,030
Everyone's sending out distress calls.

114
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,430
It's like the end of the world.

115
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,410
Didn't they try to bring Yuan Shikai back?

116
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,530
They did.

117
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,490
But he wouldn't bite.

118
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,140
He's not content being
the Viceroy of Huguang,

119
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,870
which is like playing
second fiddle to Yinchang.

120
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,130
They couldn't convince him?

121
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,170
They sent Xu Shichang

122
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,170
to Huanshang Village to negotiate.

123
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,390
He came back with six conditions.

124
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,750
What are those six conditions?

125
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,210
Better if you don't know.

126
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:18,260
Each one

127
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,930
could cost you your life.

128
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,650
Does His Highness have the luxury to refuse?

129
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,260
He doesn't.

130
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,530
But at the core, those six conditions

131
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,260
are all about seizing power.

132
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,650
Seizing power?

133
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,530
He wants to convene a parliament,

134
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,900
restructure the cabinet,

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,140
lift the ban on political parties,

136
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,450
show leniency toward the revolutionaries,

137
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,910
and hold full military command at the front.

138
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,810
Isn't this

139
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,610
the stance of someone
aiming to remake the nation?

140
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,770
Yuan Shikai's ambitions

141
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,770
are as clear as day.

142
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,070
What about His Highness's stance?

143
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,410
I just heard

144
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,200
that he's already looking for someone

145
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,130
to draft a rescript for penitence.

146
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,310
Drafting a rescript of penitence

147
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,650
at a time like this?

148
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,660
He's completely lost his initiative.

149
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,970
He took all the blame on himself.

150
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,380
That might show good character, but...

151
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,020
Bullshit!

152
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,660
What's the point of
talking about character now?

153
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,340
If he doesn't step up

154
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,380
right now, who else will?

155
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,370
Being a nice guy at a time like this
won't get him anywhere.

156
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,020
You're stuck with a master like that.

157
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,930
Who knows what'll happen

158
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,020
from here on out?

159
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,770
He's a lost cause.

160
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
No wonder Yuan Shikai

161
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,260
is so aggressive.

162
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,570
He has seen through it all.

163
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,300
He's dead set on seizing power.

164
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,290
As for you,

165
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,410
my son,

166
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,900
I'm afraid you'll end up
like a hunchback falling over,

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,410
losing out on both sides.

168
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,960
Things aren't looking good already.

169
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,310
Zhang Shaozeng, Lan Tianwei, and others

170
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,170
have committed a grave offense
by petitioning the military in Luanzhou.

171
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,930
These two just so happen to be

172
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,930
my classmates from
our time studying in Japan.

173
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,900
So that gave them a handle to grab onto,

174
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,430
claiming my personnel policies were flawed.

175
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,320
The Prince Regent has just suggested

176
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,640
that, as a precaution,

177
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,370
Kaizhi's military power
should be taken away.

178
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,260
I really don't know

179
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,720
how to handle this matter.

180
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,580
If I'm a bit too harsh,

181
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,790
it might push him into rebellion.

182
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,410
Son,

183
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,380
leaves fall when their time comes.

184
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,410
No matter

185
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,910
if the rooster crows or not,

186
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,170
the sun

187
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,300
will still rise in the east.

189
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,380
Which unit are you from?

190
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,520
Report,

191
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,290
Commander-in-Chief.

192
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,260
A supply train

193
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,190
heading to Wuhan

194
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,450
has just halted at the station.

195
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,770
Colonel Feng requests orders on

196
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,370
whether to allow it through.

197
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,380
Hold it.

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,140
All equipment and ammunition

199
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,260
are to be seized immediately.

200
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,380
Reserve them for our troops' use.

201
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,020
Yes, sir.

202
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,940
Wait a moment.

203
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,650
Kaizhi,

204
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:41,900
intercepting the court's supplies

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,950
intended for suppressing
the Wuchang rebellion,

206
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,750
I'm afraid...

207
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,290
Hold it.

208
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:47,650
That's what we'll do.

209
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,380
Yes, sir.

210
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,810
Report: There's a telegram
from General Liang Xiang

211
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,210
of the Beijing Military Advisory Council.

212
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,900
Read it.

213
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,550
Yes, sir.

214
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,930
Yuan Shikai has officially

215
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,140
accepted the court's appointment

216
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,900
and has left Zhangde
to oversee the southern troops.

217
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,570
He has now arrived

218
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,260
at the Beiyang General Headquarters
in Xinyang.

219
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,350
Our Beiyang Army

220
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,900
has launched a full-scale offensive
towards Hankou today.

221
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,760
Just want you to know
the advance is going smoothly.

222
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,290
Mr. Yuan really gets things done,
doesn't he?

223
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,020
He's just made his appearance,

224
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,500
and already it's a full house of applause.

225
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,750
So, when it comes to intercepting
military supplies headed south,

226
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,810
I hope you'll proceed carefully.

227
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,500
Carefully?

228
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,730
How careful exactly?

229
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,530
Don't we need supplies

230
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,990
to defend against the Shanxi rebels?

231
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,670
I'll take full responsibility for this.

232
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,290
I obey your orders,

233
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,910
Commander-in-Chief.

234
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,380
Yuan has come out of retirement.

235
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,930
The situation looks grim.

236
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,020
Contact Zhang Shaozeng
and Lan Tianwei immediately.

237
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
It's time for the three of us
to join forces.

238
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,870
Understood.

239
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,770
Damn it!

240
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,340
Those bastards at the front

241
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,930
are indeed loyal to individuals.

242
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,450
Yuan's only been here two days,

243
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,180
but Hankou has already fallen?

244
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,500
He's not fighting a war.

245
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,430
He's just putting on a show.

246
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,410
Good cop, bad cop,

247
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,270
he's playing both roles himself.

248
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,900
When he wants to win,
he sings songs of victory;

249
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
When he doesn't, he laments defeat.

250
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,930
He used the excuse of resting
in Huanshang Village

251
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,570
to set the stage

252
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,650
for everything.

253
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,020
He used the court
to suppress the revolution,

254
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,050
while secretly nurturing
revolutionary forces,

255
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,510
letting them grow strong enough
to threaten the court itself.

256
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,460
That's why they say
he's a formidable figure.

257
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,750
Even Zaifeng can't handle him.

258
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,830
With this victory,

259
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,340
won't he become even harder to control?

260
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,660
This is Zaitao speaking.

261
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,300
Go ahead.

262
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,450
What?

263
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,450
Li Renjun of the Twelfth Brigade,

264
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,510
Sixth Division, has sent a telegram.

265
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,630
What did he say?

266
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,530
Got it.

267
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,770
How audacious!

268
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,770
What happened?

269
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,650
Yang Kaizhi

270
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,860
from the Sixth Division

271
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,690
intercepted a military train
carrying supplies to Wuchang.

272
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,770
It looks like he

273
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,810
really intends to

274
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:15,930
part ways with us.

275
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,450
I've said it before,

276
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,930
Tufang, you can't be too soft-hearted.

277
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,460
We should've stripped him of
his military power a long time ago.

278
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,020
It's not that I haven't thought about

279
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,140
removing him.

280
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,260
But have you considered

281
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,530
another scenario?

282
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,670
If Yuan resolves the chaos in Wuhan

283
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,800
within a few days

284
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,720
and rides the wave of his victory

285
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,140
to suddenly return to Beijing,

286
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,140
will we still have

287
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,140
any leverage to hold him back?

288
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,530
Well, I think we should go ahead with this.

289
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,930
Let's play chess as well.

290
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,260
How should we play?

291
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,930
Luanzhou.

292
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,020
The trouble with Zhang and Lan
in Luanzhou isn't settled yet.

293
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,800
Why not

294
00:16:59,290 --> 00:16:59,980
send Yang Kaizhi there

295
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,170
to calm things down?

296
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,460
That way,

297
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,819
we stabilize Luanzhou,

298
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,380
and also transfer Yang Kaizhi

299
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,010
and the Sixth Division troops away,

300
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,210
to avoid any mishaps.

301
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,450
You're also capable of such trickery.

302
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,339
I'm not stupid!

303
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,589
Draft the order immediately.

304
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:18,970
Alright.

305
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,210
Hello?

306
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,930
It's me, Zaitao.

307
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm listening.

308
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,930
I have nothing to say.

309
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,880
Since you've decided.

310
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,270
Who should I hand over
the Military Advisory Council to?

311
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,860
Alright.

312
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,450
What about the Imperial Guards?

313
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,380
That's fine too.

314
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,820
I'll do as you say.

315
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,650
That's it then.

316
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,340
What's going on?

317
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,430
Zaifeng has already dissolved the cabinet.

318
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,690
Dissolved the cabinet?

319
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,100
He also dismissed Zaixun

320
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,140
from his post as Minister of the Navy.

321
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,930
What?

322
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,820
My position as
Chairman of the Military Advisory Council

323
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,080
has also been revoked.

324
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,580
For now, I'll temporarily take over

325
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,470
as the Minister in charge of

326
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,130
training the Imperial Guards

327
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,620
until

328
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:19,280
the new Prime Minister arrives
in the capital and assumes office.

329
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,650
Who is the new Prime Minister?

330
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,580
Who else could it be?

331
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,210
Yuan Shikai.

332
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,100
I knew this day would come.

333
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,950
I just didn't expect it

334
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,560
to come so soon.

335
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:12,620
Tufang,

336
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,860
take whatever you want

337
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,820
from here.

338
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,210
It's not mine anymore anyway.

339
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,690
Hello?

340
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,240
There's

341
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,930
no longer

342
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,320
a Chairman of
the Military Advisory Council here.

343
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:44,120
[On November 1, 1911, the Qing government announced the dismissal of the royally
dominated cabinet and appointed Yuan Shikai as Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet.]

344
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,170
Is this what they call
suppressing a rebellion?

345
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,340
This is a massacre.

346
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,860
Feng Guozhang is rampaging

347
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,950
through Hankou, burning and looting.

348
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,100
Blood runs like rivers.

349
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,030
How could any human do such a thing?

350
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,690
Maichen,

351
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,820
send a telegram to Beijing in my name.

352
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,930
I want him impeached for the crime

353
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,100
of slaughtering civilians.

354
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,660
Kaizhi, calm down.

355
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,240
No! This is a matter of principle.

356
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
We have to send it.

357
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,450
Don't be so scholarly about it.

358
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,620
What's wrong with being scholarly?

359
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,100
I am a scholar, damn it!

360
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,100
Send it!

361
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,810
Commander Li,

362
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,070
you must help us settle scores!

363
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,690
That dude, Yang,

364
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,690
is dragging us

365
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,690
into a mess!

366
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,010
That's right.

367
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Yuan has come back to power.

368
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,380
We have nothing to fear now.

369
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,210
I think

370
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,930
we should just tie him up.

371
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,620
Qianli,

372
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,170
you give an order.

373
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,820

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,690
How is Yingshi now?

562
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,410
The surrender negotiation failed,
and now they’ve detained him.

563
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,690
He’s in danger.

564
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,930
Song Chen, listen to me.

565
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,820
You can't just stand here.

566
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,380
Shanghai has already changed flags
and been liberated.

567
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,930
This is the last reactionary stronghold.

568
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,620
Take it down.

569
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,620
You must take it.

570
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,820
We don't have enough firepower.

571
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,820
We're also short on manpower, Father.

572
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,990
I've brought the ammunition.

573
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:55,900
I'll go get it.

574
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,830
Hurry, go get the ammunition!

575
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,860
Li Xiehe has already ordered
the Zhabei Police

576
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,860
to take fast boats

577
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,950
and bypass the Settlement
to come as reinforcements.

578
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,100
The Shanghai naval forces

579
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,210
will also take sampans

580
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,540
fully loaded with sailors to arrive here.

581
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,550
That's great!

582
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,280
You are my son.

583
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,580
What’s happening today

584
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,550
is what

585
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,580
Napoleon called

586
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,240
"the final fifteen minutes".

587
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,650
Victory or defeat

588
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,060
lies between your courage and timidity.

589
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,930
If you don’t dare to take Ying Shi’s place

590
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,330
and lead the death squad,

591
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,410
then

592
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,100
I will

593
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,860
lead it myself.

594
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,490
Father!

595
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,040
You and Shuhong get in the car.

596
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,210
Your son is now

597
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,940
the Captain of the death squad.

598
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,390
Sacrifice for the revolution,
restore China!

599
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,860
I am prepared to die tonight.

600
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,690
Are you willing to go with me?

601
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,580
At your command, Captain.

602
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:01,770
You go

603
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
take a few men upstairs

604
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,930
and take out the machine gunners.

605
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,170
Everyone else, hold your position.

606
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:05,930
Yes.

607
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,530
Charge!

608
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,650
Charge!

609
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,090
Charge!

610
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,820
Charge!

611
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,380
He has made it.

612
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,020
[November 4, 1911.
September 14th,

613
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,770
the 3rd year of Xuantong,
Shanghai is restored]

614
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,050
[Luanzhou, Zhili]

615
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,300
[Camp of the 20th Division]

616
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,470
Look at you.

617
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,900
It's not over yet, is it?

618
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,050
You little monkey!

619
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,580
You treacherous rebels!
What are you trying to do?

620
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,730
Want to follow the Hubei rebels
and start an uprising, huh?

621
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,660
Shut your mouth!

622
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,940
Qing lackey.

623
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,100
What right do you have to speak to me?

624
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:21,930
Who are you calling a lackey?

625
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,890
Who's the lackey?

626
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,010
Xiao Yusong, everything you eat,
wear, and use

627
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,320
was all bestowed by the Emperor.

628
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,840
And now

629
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,310
I’m the lackey?

630
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,110
And you’re the hero?

631
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,710
Screw you!

632
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,700
Slap him! Let's see if he's still a hero.

633
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,650
Try it.

634
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,530
Call me that again and I’ll slap you.

635
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,300
You think that look is gonna scare me?

636
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,340
Don't be shameless.

637
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,050
Do you want me to slap you?

638
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,110
Try slapping me and see what happens.

639
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,590
You dare to hit me?

640
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,320
What's going on?

641
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,130
Fighting among ourselves?

642
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,220
What a disgrace!

643
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,960
[Zhang Shaozeng,
Commander of the 20th Division]

644
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,600
He called me a Qing lackey.

645
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,950
He called me a treacherous rebel!

646
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,900
You are a treacherous rebel.

647
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:18,930
That’s enough!

648
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,970
Commander Yang has come
to our division for pacification.

649
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,300
If you have anything to say,

650
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,560
you can tell him later.

651
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,520
Commander Yang

652
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,030
also has something to say to everyone.

653
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,380
Attention!

654
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,570
Your Excellency.

Please give us your instructions.

Sit down.

659
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,180
Officers of the 20th Division.

660
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,300
Today,

661
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,780
I

662
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,570
want to use

663
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,770
the prestige of Commander Yang Kaizhi,

664
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,860
the recipient of
the Imperial Badge of the Double Dragon,

665
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,780
the famous border defense hero,

666
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,900
to strengthen the unity

667
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,860
among our 20th division officers,

668
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,970
and strive together for our great cause.

669
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,370
We must not fail our duty.

670
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,050
Youmin, what are you doing?

671
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,970
This is a bomb with a fuse.

672
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,570
Nobody moves!

673
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,520
Move again and I'll hammer it.

674
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,780
Sit down!

675
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,050
Today, if anyone says

676
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,810
anything against the Emperor,

677
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,530
I'll hammer it.

678
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,780
No one’s leaving this room!

679
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,010
Don’t be reckless.

680
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,570
Youmin.

681
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,780
Commander Yang
is the Court’s special envoy.

682
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,220
Here to pacify our division.

683
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,780
Stop fooling around.

684
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,560
Commander-in-chief.

685
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,860
Court envoy?

686
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,940
Everyone knows that Yang Kaizhi

687
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,130
is a well-known

688
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,130
veteran from Revolutionary Party.

689
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,150
Am I right,

690
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,910
Mr. Pacification Commissioner?

691
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,020
You better watch your words.

692
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,570
I have a short temper.

693
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,950
The revolution you mentioned,

694
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,500
what does it refer to?

695
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,450
Why are you asking me?

696
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,380
I'm asking you all.

697
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,050
Your so-called revolution.

698
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:06,390
What’s it really about?

699
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,780
So,

700
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,550
you're coercing me

701
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,280
into answering your question.

702
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,670
Call it that if you want.

703
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,670
Alright.

704
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
I'll answer you.

705
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,970
The revolution that I believe in

706
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,160
is nothing more than

707
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,480
solving two issues.

708
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:26,010
Which two?

709
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,300
First,

710
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,480
anyone who is not Chinese

711
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,980
has no right to manage Chinese affairs.

712
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,230
This is the spirit of nationalism.

713
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,740
And the second?

714
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,330
Every Chinese

715
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:40,010
has the right to manage Chinese affairs.

716
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,910
This is the spirit of democracy.

717
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,740
I don't see

718
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,340
what this has to do with me

719
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,530
or with

720
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,000
any of us here.

721
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,300
Who pays my wages?

722
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,020
Who offers me a job?

723
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,600
All just fancy talk

724
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,870
made up by you scholars.
