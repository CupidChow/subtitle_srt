[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,020
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,200
Kaizhi,

4
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,509
a woman lived with a man

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,280
for so long,

6
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,280
and yet she didn't know

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,070
why she needed him so much.

8
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
It's like a fish living in water,

9
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,070
never once asking

10
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,540
what water even is.

11
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,920
She never thought about

12
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,120
goals,

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
beliefs,

14
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,400
or ideals

15
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,900
because that person

16
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
made almost every decision for you.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,870
She took his dreams as her own,

18
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,150
his goals as her goals,

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,670
his victories as her victories,

20
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,850
and his honors as her honors.

21
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,079
I get it.

22
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
Until one day,

23
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,240
she lost him,

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,400
and only then did she realize

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,870
she had no idea where to go.

26
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,590
There's this emptiness inside her,

27
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,440
like everything left with him.

28
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,810
You understand?

29
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,080
I do.

30
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,080
But I also don't.

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,710
How could one person…

32
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,800
completely replace

33
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,080
another person?

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,030
Whatever the case,

35
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,630
what you did in Tokyo—

36
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,370
not every woman

37
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,980
could've done that.

38
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,430
I don't believe

39
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,430
you were just brainwashed by someone else.

40
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,360
It's simple.

41
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,170
I had to survive, didn't I?

42
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,310
That is belief.

43
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,240
That's belief?

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,150
Of course.

45
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,520
Shuhong,

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,480
I know how deeply it hurts

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
to lose the one you love.

48
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,560
But this is not the end of the world.

49
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,880
I believe

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,310
humans won't

51
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,360
just scrape by;

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,079
they'll thrive.

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,060
Humanity is not meant to fade.

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,870
That's belief.

55
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,400
Mother,

56
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,380
why are you still up?

57
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,450
Why'd you put the turtle in the fishbowl?

58
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,160
Look at the goldfish.

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,580
They're not afraid of the turtle.

60
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,730
That turtle's got a wide shell,

61
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,630
but it's slow and clumsy.

62
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,630
Look at it.

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,430
Where's that boy?

64
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,190
Where's the boy at Kaizhi's place?

65
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,650
Duo Mei, go bring him over.

66
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,880
Mother is too bored.

67
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,500
Bring him over?

68
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,480
His mother came back

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
and took him home.

70
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
Is that so?

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
That explains it.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,510
Come on.

73
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,480
Mother,

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,630
let's have a chat.

75
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,890
With that boozy breath?

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,310
Chat my foot.

77
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,960
Go wash up and get to bed.

78
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,720
We're turning in too.

79
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,070
Jianqiu,

80
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
is the foot bath ready?

81
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,120
Yes, it's ready.

82
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,870
Tufang, the boy at Kaizhi's place…

83
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,720
Duo Mei.

84
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,570
Come.

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,190
Where is he?

86
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,860
Right in this room.

87
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,240
Second Lord.

88
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Director Yang, why did you

89
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,870
invite me here?

90
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,920
Can't we just have a meal together?

91
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,480
No.

92
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,760
What's there to eat at Douhua Restaurant?

93
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,490
If you've got business, say it.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,430
Hey.

95
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,070
Go to the carriage

96
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,390
and take those two pups

97
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,160
to the Japanese legation.

98
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,310
Go.

99
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,650
Liang's been asking me
to do that for half a month.

100
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,170
Said they have to be delivered

101
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,970
to the military attaché's wife.

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,650
They're for Ms. Yoshiko,

103
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,170
the wife of Attaché Hirata, right?

104
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,930
Her father

105
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,130
is from the Japanese royal family.

106
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,050
I almost forgot.

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,050
Kaizhi.

108
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,050
You studied in Japan too, didn't you?

109
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,530
I heard you and Liang

110
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,930
had beds side by side.

111
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,050
That's true.

112
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,760
Then why are you asking me for help?

113
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,530
If there's something,
go talk to Liang Xiang.

114
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,090
The Prince Regent,

115
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,920
by the imperial edict
from the Xuantong Emperor,

116
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,730
has consolidated
military power under himself,

117
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,760
acting as Commander-in-Chief
of both the Army and Navy.

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,090
His two blood brothers—

119
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,470
one's been made Minister of Navy,

120
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,930
the other Chairman
of the Military Advisory Council,

121
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,610
and he's in charge
of the Imperial Guards too.

122
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,670
Those three people

123
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,240
know nothing at all.

124
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,610
Military orders
and telegrams about military affairs

125
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,490
are all

126
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,880
handled by Liang.

127
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,170
Tufang is the one

128
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,020
who asked me to come see you.

129
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,050
He sent you to me?

130
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,090
Second Lord.

131
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,610
I'm a soldier.

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,730
I speak plainly.

133
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,050
I invited you here

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,380
for just one thing:

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,360
to deliver something

136
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,510
to your father.

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,240
There it is.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,760
I was wondering
why the Border Defense Hero

139
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,650
of the court

140
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,320
wanted to have dinner with me.

141
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,090
No.

142
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Please let me finish.

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't.

144
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,430
I don't want to hear it.

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,390
My father is my father, and I am me.

146
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,600
If you want something, go to him directly.

147
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,169
Don't come to me.

148
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,500
Besides, he wouldn't listen to me anyway.

149
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,330
Second Lord.

150
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,610
You don't need to say a word.

151
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,740
Just pass along one thing for me.

152
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,770
Well,

153
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,530
you owe my father money?

154
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,720
That's right.

155
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
After all, he holds the power

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,850
to decide the life and death

157
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,750
of a low-ranking officer like me.

158
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,770
But my father is no longer

159
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,650
the Chief Grand Council Minister.

160
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,290
No.

161
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,650
In my opinion,

162
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
once a leader, always a leader.

163
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
Not just for me—

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,180
even for Empress Dowager Longyu,

165
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,010
her title and status back then

166
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
were something your father

167
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,680
helped secure

168
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,200
from the late Empress Dowager.

169
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Isn't that right?

170
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,440
For that alone,

171
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,890
the Prince Regent

172
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,340
should show some respect to your father.

173
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,890
Today,

174
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,560
I've finally met someone who gets it.

175
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,530
Sit.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I do get it.

177
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,050
If I'm to help someone,

178
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,770
I only help those who get me.

179
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,410
Helping clueless fools

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,410
is a waste of effort and thankless.

181
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,770
That bunch of dimwits
knows nothing at all,

182
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,410
always begging for help,

183
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,960
like my father's some public toilet

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,890
anyone can use.

185
00:09:59,010 --> 00:09:59,840
And it's always over

186
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,320
the pettiest and nastiest problems.

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,530
Ridiculous.

188
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,890
What I want is simple.

189
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,840
I believe

190
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,410
I have the ability and qualifications

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
to lead the Sixth Beiyang Division.

192
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,650
That final line I said

193
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,890
was so badass!

194
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,410
With that 30,000 yuan

195
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,530
right under his nose,

196
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,440
it didn't really matter what you said.

197
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,130
No.

198
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,580
The point is that

199
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,510
I was so confident and righteous.

200
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,050
Sounds like a trade to me.

201
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,200
You're not wrong.

202
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,070
But if it's a trade,

203
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,530
you shouldn't have

204
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,320
thrown all your money
on the table at once.

205
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,120
That puts you in a weak position.

206
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,060
You've left yourself no leverage.

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,020
That's exactly the point!

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,010
What if he thinks

209
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,940
it's not enough?

210
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,860
How can it be not enough?

211
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,890
If it's a trade,
there's always price negotiation.

212
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,490
Haggling is part of the game.

213
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,200
No,

214
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
this isn't a trade.

215
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,890
It's a gamble.

216
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
I've put

217
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,410
all my money on the table,

218
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,010
so it's not my money anymore.

219
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,810
You two are surprisingly alike.

220
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,680
You mean Wu Tianbai?

221
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,320
That's right.

222
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,770
That kind of
small-stakes thinking of yours

223
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,030
will ruin everything.

224
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,450
With that attitude,

225
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,770
you think they'll hand

226
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,290
the Beiyang Army's main force over to you?

227
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,320
Am I right, Bugu?

228
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,410
Sounds like

229
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,730
you make a good point.

230
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,890
So…

231
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,320
For a trade this big,

232
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,320
you can't push from only one side.

233
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
You need Liang Xiang's help.

234
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,010
We all need help from others.

235
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,890
Don't be too reserved with Liang Xiang.

236
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,680
He's already the reserved type.

237
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,140
You two are a bit too alike,

238
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,200
both trying to keep your hands clean.

239
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,890
But this whole thing

240
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,350
isn't clean to begin with.

241
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,960
Exactly.

242
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,380
That's why the way I do things…

243
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,580
Alright. Go back now.

244
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,230
I've aired out your quilt.

245
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,890
Bugu.

246
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,530
Bring me your dirty laundry.

247
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,990
Mommy will wash it for you.

248
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,890
Good boy.

249
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,540
Don't get your sleeves wet.

250
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,770
Oh, don't spill the water.

251
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:45,890
Be good.

252
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,770
I almost plunged headfirst into the water.

253
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,210
Look at how I wash it.

254
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,820
Bugu,

255
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,490
come here.

256
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,560
Give this to your mom.

257
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,690
I forgot to tell you.

258
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,420
There's soap on my cabinet.

259
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,150
It helps

260
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,410
a lot.

261
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,860
Sleep early.

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,120
Go back now.

263
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,650
Bugu.

264
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,650
Bugu.

265
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm leaving.

266
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:56,080
[Military Advisory Council]

267
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,160
Shift change.

268
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,200
Tufang,

269
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,440
I don't think it's a good idea.

270
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,010
Why insist on
wearing the Beiyang Army's uniforms?

271
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,670
The Imperial Guards' uniforms
look way better.

272
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,410
The Military Advisory Council

273
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,200
commands the entire army of the country.

274
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,650
If you only wear
the Imperial Guard uniform,

275
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,250
it'll look like
you've got limited authority.

276
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,300
Wearing the Beiyang Army uniform

277
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
reaffirms the Military Advisory Council's

278
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,540
authority over elite army units.

279
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,530
Fair point.

280
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,200
Let's go.

281
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,650
Time to see

282
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,530
your command room

283
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,460
as the Chairman.

284
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,770
Well?

285
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,010
Do I look like

286
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,200
the Qing Army's

287
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,730
Chief of the General Staff?

288
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,370
Just looking like it isn't enough.

289
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,770
Then what should I do?

290
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,530
Three words:

291
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,410
control the troops.

292
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,940
Where do all these lines connect?

293
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,200
This one

294
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,170
goes directly
to the Prince Regent's residence.

295
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,010
This one

296
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,530
to the six Beiyang Divisions.

297
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,960
And this one here

298
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:30,770
goes directly to

299
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,300
the Imperial Guards' Training Department.
I just moved there.

300
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,410
Who is it?

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,650
Zaifeng.

302
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,200
It's me, Zaitao.

303
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,650
Yes, yes, yes.

304
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,930
I've arrived
at my Military Advisory Council,

305
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,650
and I'm formally reporting to you:

306
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,530
as of today,

307
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,530
we are officially in operation.

308
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,410
What?

309
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,440
You're talking to Zhang Jian?

310
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,890
Who is Zhang Jian?

311
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,820
He says…

312
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,890
Zhang Jian is the leading figure

313
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,650
of the southern constitutionalists.

314
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,290
How could you not know him?

315
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,170
Zhang Jian, Li Jian, whatever.

316
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,650
Not even a word of congratulations

317
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,290
from him.

318
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,680
Buzzkill.

319
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,290
The constitutionalists

320
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,410
are a real headache
for the court right now.

321
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:19,890
Zhang Jian

322
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,950
was even once Yuan Shikai's teacher.

323
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Even so,

324
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,840
the Prince Regent personally

325
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,410
received him, trying to win him over.

326
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,440
It's a wise move

327
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,890
that shows vision.

328
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,530
Where were we just now?

329
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,210
Control the troops?

330
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,650
How?

331
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,200
Two words:

332
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,680
use people.

333
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,770
I want to appoint people,

334
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,770
but I don't get a say.

335
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,290
Do you know who

336
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,010
Prince Qing

337
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,560
nominated yesterday
as commander of the Sixth Division?

338
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,080
You'll never guess.

339
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,730
Who?

340
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,960
Your old classmate,

341
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,500
Yang Kaizhi.

342
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,730
Do you think he's a good fit?

343
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,460
This time, Prince Qing

344
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,780
made the right call.

345
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,130
I don't think so.

346
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,260
Someone reported to me

347
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,890
that Yang Kaizhi has a
questionable background.

348
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,200
He had close contact

349
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
with rebels back in Tokyo.

350
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,250
Is that so?

351
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,569
Tufang.

352
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,520
In this matter,

353
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,530
you don't have a personal stake, do you?

354
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,340
Tokyo is a mixed bag.

355
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,890
There are all kinds

356
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,410
of people there.

357
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,510
Everyone is an acquaintance.

358
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,570
It's impossible to avoid each other.

359
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,590
I'm the same.

360
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,520
Truth be told,

361
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,440
even ringleaders

362
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
like Qiu Jin and Xu Xilin—

363
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,930
I've crossed paths with them

364
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,500
at social events in Tokyo.

365
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,170
By this standard,

366
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
are you gonna

367
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,280
stop trusting me too?

368
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,760
No.

369
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,520
No, no.

370
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,330
How could I not trust you?

371
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
If I don't trust you, who can I trust?

372
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,990
You're not like them, Tufang.

373
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,410
Before you left for Tokyo,

374
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,040
when you were in Shanghai,

375
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,970
Zaifeng already had his eye on you.

376
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,810
Among all the Bannermen,

377
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,930
you're the one who's down-to-earth

378
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,170
and stays true to our ancestral teachings.

379
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,040
If you brothers

380
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,410
trust me,

381
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,650
then you should trust

382

Leaving him stuck in the Ministry of War

385
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,030

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,170
Good.

572
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:54,890
Good.

573
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,810
Good.

574
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll do the same.

575
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,670
Whatever I see,

576
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,540
I'll just repeat that one word.

577
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
Good.

578
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,090
Good.

579
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,280
Good.

580
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,680
Feels kind of great.

581
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,620
The catch is—

582
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,650
you've got to say nothing at all

583
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,510
but let your face say everything.

584
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,130
To outsiders, all they should sense

585
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,240
is restraint and composure.

586
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,930
I am restrained.

587
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,500
I can stay composed.

588
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,540
I can do that.

589
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,790
What does restraint mean?

590
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,090
It's when your face says everything,

591
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,570
but you stay quiet

592
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,070
without speaking out.

593
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,130
I can stay quiet.

594
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,670
I'll hold it in.

595
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,940
But you need
to have something to hold in.

596
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,810
Like what?

597
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,370
You're the Seventh Lord,

598
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,610
now serving as the Chairman
of the Military Advisory Council.

599
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,200
In Japan,

600
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,480
that position is the equivalent of

601
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,340
Chief of Staff.

602
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,480
The face of the Chief of Staff

603
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,080
should carry so many things.

604
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,890
Everything about the army—

605
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,040
its equipment, skills,

606
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,130
experience, hard work,

607
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,760
soldiers, officers, and everything else—

608
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,290
you have to know all of them.

609
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,720
You have to let the soldiers

610
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,680
see that in you.

611
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,460
If they don't see it,

612
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,980
they won't follow you.

613
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,060
That's the military.

614
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,040
So what do I do?

615
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,850
Tufang.

616
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,370
You've really got to help me

617
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,720
make up for what I lack.

618
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,040
There's only

619
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,240
one way.

620
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,610
Tell me.

621
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
From this moment on,

622
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,750
you're responsible for your face.

623
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,330
Bit by bit, you learn.

624
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,610
Bit by bit, you grow.

625
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,730
Listen more. Observe more.

626
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,680
Speak less.

627
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Understand?

628
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,610
Kinda hard.

629
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,610
Honestly,

630
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:47,680
I can't get through a single page

631
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,740
of military books.

632
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
Then don't read them.

633
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,440
Huo Qubing didn't read

634
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,770
military books either.

635
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,290
He was younger than you.

636
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,610
At 19, he was already
galloping across battlefields,

637
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,850
winning countless battles.

638
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,380
Exactly!

639
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,240
That's my role model.

640
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:02,610
Wasn't Huo Qubing known

641
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,410
as a general who lived in luxury?

642
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,090
There's that poem:

643
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,810
"While soldiers risked
their lives on the battlefield,

644
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,440
the general was enjoying
songs and dances in his tent."

645
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,090
What a remarkable general.

646
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,610
He won wars

647
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,960
and enjoyed his life.

648
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,960
But his most famous quote is:

649
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,990
"As long as the Xiongnu remain,
I can't go home."

650
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,060
Can you do that?

651
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,960
You, Zaitao,

652
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,170
already have married two women.

653
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,380
[The 3rd Division
of Beiyang New Army in Baoding]

654
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
Why are you guys

655
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,930
working so hard?

656
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,010
You're staying up late.

657
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,610
We don't dare to sleep.

658
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Those lords

659
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,170
from the Military Advisory Council

660
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,090
are coming tomorrow for inspection.

661
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,420
There's a dozen of them.

662
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,540
The officers are all in a panic,

663
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,450
ordering us

664
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,380
to fake the books all night.

665
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,090
They'll even check old accounts

666
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,810
from the 21st year of Guangxu?

667
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,130
You bet.

668
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,960
From the 21st year of Guangxu

669
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,490
to the 2nd year of Xuantong,

670
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,960
every record of firewood costs,

671
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
horse feed costs,

672
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,980
and official expenses

673
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,570
needs to be rewritten.

674
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,010
They'll check everything.

675
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,330
No wonder the commander-in-chief

676
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,240
sent me all the way to Tianjin

677
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,370
to buy Western-style porcelain toilets.

678
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,440
You know what?

679
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,440
I was told to buy 200 boxes

680
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,930
of premium cigars alone.

681
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,340
And 200 catties
of dried sea cucumber and shark fin.

682
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,850
So it's not just an inspection.

683
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,470
They'll also audit the books.

684
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,930
Turn over the quilts.

685
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,200
Air out the other side.

686
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,440
Air out the bottom of the box too.

687
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,440
Xiang's fur vest has been

688
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,100
stuffed in there so long
it's starting to smell.

689
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,480
Young Madam,

690
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,360
the boy's mother is here.

691
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,510
Hello.

692
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,090
Boy,

693
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,660
is this your mom?

694
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,680
At first glance,

695
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,480
I thought you were a schoolgirl.

696
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,770
Old Madam is in the main hall.

697
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,720
Nothing urgent.

698
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,240
She just really loves the boy

699
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
and talks about him all the time.

700
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
This way, please.

701
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,600
How's Madam Liang doing?

702
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:47,670
It's been like…

703
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,680
eight years

704
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,810
since I last saw her.

705
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,730
You know Old Madam?

706
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
Back in Tokyo,

707
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,590
we were neighbors.

708
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,170
That's amazing!

709
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,720
Tonight, Old Madam

710
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,240
is not going to sleep a wink.

711
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,810
Her neighbor from Tokyo has come to visit.

712
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,680
Wait here for a sec.

713
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,370
I'll go in to give her a heads-up.

714
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,200
She's getting old.

715
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
Better not startle her and cause a fuss.

716
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,740
A neighbor from Tokyo?

717
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,260
Shuhong?

718
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,130
That boy's Shuhong's son?

719
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,530
You still remember her.

720
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,720
I knew it.

721
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,930
No wonder the moment I saw the boy,

722
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,260
I found him so adorable.

723
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,740
Turns out…

724
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,130
Where is she?

725
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,330
Right outside.

726
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,230
Take it slow.

727
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,090
Shuhong, Shuhong!

728
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,960
Shuhong, look at you.

729
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,760
What a surprise

730
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,660
to meet you again like this.

731
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,660
[3rd Battalion,
Artillery Company, 3rd Army Division]

732
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,530
Present arms!

733
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,020
Salute!

734
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,570
Why aren't we allowed

735
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,200
to walk the red carpet?

736
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,200
Exactly.

737
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,850
Zaitao

738
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,510
is hogging all the spotlight.

739
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,610
You don't get it.

740
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,610
That's called "making a statement."

741
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,480
If we join him,

742
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,850
who's gonna notice him?

743
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,720
Where's Liang Xiang?

744
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,610
I haven't seen him.

745
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,470
Neither have I.

746
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,020
He didn't even come through the gate.

747
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,720
He stays outside

748
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,960
in a carriage by the barracks.

749
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,560
You know what that's called?

750
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,710
The real deal keeps a low profile.

751
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,610
High firepower, long range.

752
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,720
This is our German-made mountain gun.

753
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,320
We've got 20 of them in total.

All officers and soldiers
of the 3rd Division

756

respectfully invite
Mr. Liang to enter the camp.

757
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,610
Has the inspection concluded?

758
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,080
Yes.

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,850
The reviewing minister

760
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,130
is being escorted
by the commander-in-chief

761
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,130
to inspect the soldiers' quarters.

762
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,810
I see.

763
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,200
Good.

764
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,280
Good.

765
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,440
Good.

766
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,260
Sir, please take a look.

767
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,960
This is our German-made

768
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,680
Model 79 Mauser rifle.

769
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,610
Effective range: 500 feet.

770
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,810
Powerful firepower.

771
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,440
At present,

772
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,040
it's considered
the best equipment in the army.

773
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,500
Our soldiers
maintain them with great care.

774
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,810
They're fully up to standard.

775
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:03,720
Good.

776
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,450
Very good.

777
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,330
Where did you go?

778
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,860
I've been holding in a piss.

779
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,040
I don't know
if I should relieve myself

780
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
and where to do it.

781
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,120
May I see

782
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,929
the army latrines?

783
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,370
Are they clean?

784
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,080
Sure.

785
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,639
This way, follow me.

786
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,110
Cooked books, huh?

787
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,210
Second Lord.

788
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,090
Here, take a break.

789
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,170
What kind of cigarette is this?

790
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
A premium cigar

791
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,790
bought in Tianjin.

792
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,890
Two silver dollars a stick.

793
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,210
Two silver dollars

794
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,590
is all you're giving me?

795
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,480
It smells amazing, though.

796
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,160
Shut the hell up!

797
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,690
It's all fake!

798
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,480
The records
are from the 29th year of Guangxu,

799
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,890
but the ink's not even dry!

800
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,730
Look!

801
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,960
It's on my finger!

802
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,470
That over there is our infantry unit.

803
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
Go find Li Renjun.

804
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,540
Tell him to do this.

805
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,160
Go!

806
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:14,780
Yes, sir.

807
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,160
It's strange, isn't it?

808
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,940
Old Madam loves the boy,

809
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,850
but now that the boy's mother is here,

810
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,850
she's taken a liking to her instead.

811
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Listen.

812
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,340
They've been chatting for so long.

813
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,850
Time flies.

814
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,580
It's been eight years already.

815
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,440
Even your son

816
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,570
has grown so big now.

817
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,210
How can I not feel old?

818
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,250
Thinking back,

819
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,850
those were better days.

820
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,480
People were closer.

821
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,810
Look at things now.

822
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,850
I live behind high walls,

823
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,410
and anyone who comes by

824
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,370
either wants a promotion

825
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,250
or a favor.

826
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,120
It's just so dull.

827
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,890
Now that you mention it,

828
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,600
I think of

829
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,330
the landlady of the Bamboo Hotel.

830
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,330
She sent me her regards

831
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,130
in a letter last year
when I was in Shanghai.

832
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,390
We're like family now.

833
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,960
These Japanese women

834
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,370
are really something.

835
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,850
They're so good at this.

836
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,410
All polite and courteous

837
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,440
while they're making money off you.

838
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,810
She told me that

839
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,400
your Mr. Wu was in trouble

840
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,600
for counterfeiting money.

841
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,160
How could she say that?

842
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah.

843
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,570
I didn't believe it either.

844
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,640
But that day,

845
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,600
a whole swarm of police showed up.

846
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,850
All armed,

847
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,160
looking intimidating.

848
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,690
Actually,

849
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,930
who can make sense

850
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,370
of Japanese law?

851
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,160
What might be nothing here

852
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,850
can be a huge deal over there.

853
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,330
It was just a business dispute.

854
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,640
Nothing serious.

855
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,410
That's a relief.

856
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,560
So where is Mr. Wu now?

857
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,370
He's gone back to his hometown in Sichuan.

858
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:07,970
Is that so?

859
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:08,960
Yes.

860
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,640
Is it convenient for you

861
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
to stay at Kaizhi's place now?

862
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Very convenient.

863
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,160
Kaizhi should've told me.

864
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,730
He just said Bugu was a relative's kid.

865
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,270
His cousin is my brother-in-law.

866
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,640
Wow.

867
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,490
That's practically family.

868
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,560
No wonder

869
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,960
I like the boy so much.

870
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,040
The way he moves and acts

871
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,370
looks so familiar to me.

872
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,250
Now it all makes sense.

873
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,690
He really is a familiar.

874
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,160
Boys at his age

875
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
are so naughty.

876
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,690
Even dogs can't stand them.

877
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,410
Boys are all naughty.

878
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,690
When Tufang was little,

879
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,960
he caused trouble in the Banner Battalion

880
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
every single day.

881
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,160
Have you seen him

882
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,890
since you came back to China?

883
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,730
You mean your son?

884
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,650
I remember back in Tokyo,

885
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,850
you two

886
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,040
didn't quite get along.

887
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,110
I see his name in the papers all the time.

888
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,890
Back then, who would've thought

889
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,290
he'd become such a high-ranking official?

890
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,640
When did you

891
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,850
come back from Japan?

892
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,390
Two years later than your son.

893
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,890
This kid was born in Tokyo?

894
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,370
Yes.

895
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,640
How old is he?

896
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,690
By the end of the year,

897
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,440
he'll turn five.

898
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,900
Six by traditional count.

899
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,410
I'm getting old…

900
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,350
not much left to ask about.

901
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,780
My son's always off somewhere,

902
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,560
and his wife hasn't given him a child.

903
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,480
People say

904
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:53,290
my family

905
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,750
is on the rise right now,

906
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,080
but actually,

907
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,930
we still have

908
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,210
our own worries.

909
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,480
Where is your son?

910
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,040
He's in Baoding,

911
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,840
accompanying the Prince Regent's
younger brother on a trip.

912
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,130
This wasn't even supposed to be his job.

913
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,410
Where are we going?

914
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,410
Second Lord,

915
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,270
we're almost there.

916
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,320
Almost?

917
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,960
We've been running around all day.

918
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,120
We don't have
the energy to wander with you.

919
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,440
Exactly. Where are we going?

920
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,260
Second Lord, please.

921
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,880
Welcome.

922
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,510
So considerate.

923
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,850
Sirs, come on in.

924
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Hurry, hurry.

925
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,410
Make sure they're entertained.

926
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,850
Don't let them out

927
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,250
until noon tomorrow.

928
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,890
They must stay until tomorrow noon.

929
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,440
Understand?

930
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,640
Yes.

931
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,810
Don't worry.

932
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,600
Officer Li,

933
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,120
leave it to me.

934
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,960
So sinful.

935
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,600
There goes a whole week's worth

936
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,960
of grocery money.

937
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:41,640
Sirs, have a good night.

938
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,890
I still have military duties to attend to.

939
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,090
I must excuse myself.

940
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,600
Take good care of these two lords.

941
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:49,810
Make sure they're not slighted.

942
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,640
Understood.

943
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,410
I shall take my leave first.

944
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,330
Well,

945
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,600
why were the Second Lord and his men

946
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,930
so well-behaved today?

947
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,210
How did the audit go?

948
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:11,890
Chairman,

949
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,960

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,560
