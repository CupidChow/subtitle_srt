00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,840
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,380
This is it. Let's get settled.

4
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:49,009
[Bamboo]

5
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,170
Take off your shoes.

6
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Madam.

7
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,440
Madam.

8
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,190
Mr. Wu.

9
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,210
It's great to see you.

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,540
You're finally back.

11
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,890
This is great.

12
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,540
My husband

13
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,110
talked about you the other day.

14
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,260
Here you are, in the flesh.

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,240
Welcome. Let me take your luggage.

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,930
What a beautiful girl.

17
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,840
Who is she?

18
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,530
She's my student, Shuhong.

19
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,530
I see.

20
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,280
Miss Shuhong.

21
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,140
Nice to meet you.

22
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,900
Will you take the usual room?

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,620
Yes.

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,360
Yes.

25
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,980
The sheets are all new.

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,540
The room is still the way you left it.

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,930
You left many books last time.

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,000
I put them in the storage room.

29
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,990
I'll bring them to you later.

30
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,260
Have a good rest.

31
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,820
Please.

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,410
Dinner will be served at the usual time.

33
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,750
I'll prepare your favorite dishes.

34
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,430
I'll leave you to rest.

35
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,560
Thank you.

36
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,890
What did she say?

37
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,450
Just preliminaries.

38
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,070
You two seem well-acquainted.

39
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,780
It's just the way the Japanese do business.

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,980
A friend is a friend. Business is business.

41
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,380
She won't charge me less.

42
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,930
This is where we'll stay.

43
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,660
Decide where you want to sleep.

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,370
Why aren't there any beds?

45
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,630
What did you say?

46
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,820
Why aren't there any beds?

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,300
This is the Japanese way of life.

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,100
It's a small place.

49
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,620
We'll sleep on the floor.

50
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,780
You can sleep anywhere you want.

51
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,060
There are quilts in the closet.

52
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,029
You'll take the back room.
I'll take the front room.

53
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,409
We can cook here.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,290
I have to tell you seriously

55
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,610
that Tokyo is not Shanghai.

56
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,740
You need to learn to cook now.

57
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,170
We'll stay here for a long time.

58
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,460
Maybe a year or two.

59
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,610
I don't have much money with me.

60
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,700
It's enough

61
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,659
for three months' rent,

62
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,659
but after that, I don't know.

63
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,830
Anyway, we'll figure something out.

64
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,560
Just be careful with the money.

65
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,140
I'll try not to

66
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,600
let you live on the street.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,400
For two fugitives,

68
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,470
a place like this

69
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,460
is already heaven.

70
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,520
Don't you think so?

71
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,780
So,

72
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,810
I'm your burden now?

73
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,100
A beautiful burden.

74
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:16,700
Don't worry.

75
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,790
I'll find a way to support myself.

76
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,110
I don't believe

77
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,270
I can't make a living

78
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,670
in a big city like Tokyo.

79
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,620
I appreciate that attitude.

80
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,470
Life's full of possibilities.

81
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,840
See what you can do.

82
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,730
Unpack.

83
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,450
I need to meet

84
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,170
my old friends here.

85
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,780
They don't know

86
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,580
I'm in Tokyo.

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,170
Father, Mother.

88
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,170
Sister.

89
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,980
Why am I so stupid?

90
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,490
Why am I so stupid?

91
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,300
Where are you?

92
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,500
Why aren't you here to help me?

93
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,010
Miss.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,800
Miss.

95
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,580
What did you say?

96
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,850
Miss,

97
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,000
these are Mr. Wu's books.

98
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,409
Are you okay?

99
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,170
Are you sick?

100
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,580
What happened?

101
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,780
What are you talking about?

102
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,510
I don't understand Japanese.

103
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,050
What happened?

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,460
Are you okay?

105
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,170
I don't understand Japanese.

106
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,680
I don't know what you're saying.

107
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,730
Don't worry. I'll go get help.

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,290
Wait for a moment.

109
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,220
Help. Help.

110
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,410
Anyone?

111
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,700
I don't understand you.

112
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,700
Can you help me?

113
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,900
Sure.

114
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,580
What is she saying?

115
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,780
Hello.

116
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,410
The landlady wants to know

117
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,730
if you're feeling unwell.

118
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm not feeling unwell.

119
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,150
She said she's fine.

120
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,990
You're welcome here.

121
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,170
Mr. Wu used to stay here

122
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,320
when he came to Japan.

123
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,220
Tell me if you need any help.

124
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,170
The landlady said you're welcome here.

125
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,290
Mr. Wu used to stay here

126
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,460
when he visited Japan.

127
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,340
He's an old friend.

128
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,170
Tell her

129
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,300
if you need any help.

130
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,270
Do you know

131
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,460
where I can buy noodles, rice,

132
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,850
and vegetables?

133
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,450
That's all this is about?

134
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,700
That's not serious enough?

135
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,610
It is. Everybody needs to eat.

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,170
Later,

137
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,750
I'll take you to the market.

138
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,730
It's very convenient.

139
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,050
I cook by myself too.

140
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,050
It's just that

141
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,620
the landlady may be unhappy.

142
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,540
She'll earn less

143
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,870
if you cook by yourself.

144
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,390
What did she say?

145
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,340
I won't be unhappy. Don't worry.

146
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,580
Why are you worried about that?

147
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,780
I've known Mr. Wu

148
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,160
for three years.

149
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,140
You can cook

150
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,340
if you want.

151
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,299
It's okay. Don't cry.

152
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,460
Thank you.

153
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,050
You came back so late.

154
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,490
Yeah.

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,580
I went through a lot with those friends.

156
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,580
We were lost in conversation until it was almost dawn.

157
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,180
I had to buy dinner tonight.

158
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
But I didn't let the landlady take advantage.

159
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,580
I packed everything I could

160
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,110
bring back in the lunch box.

161
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,220
At least

162
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,880
we don't have to make lunch tomorrow.

163
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,160
You've taken my words seriously?

164
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,700
Of course I have.

165
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,700
You impressed me as someone who could do anything

166
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,490
but suddenly told me you're cash-strapped.

167
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,020
I have to take it seriously.

168
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,510
I want to tell you

169
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,780
I'm not your burden.

170
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,620
I can live frugally.

171
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,180
Our life here has just started.

172
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,240
I made a promise to your brother-in-law.

173
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,250
But how to live our life here,

174
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,130
I don't know.

175
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,940
Except for those
government-sponsored students,

176
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,610
every Chinese person in Tokyo is short of money.

177
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,300
Luckily, I didn't

178
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,060
bring money with me when I went out.

179
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,590
They all asked me for money.

180
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,850
I wonder what they've

181
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,180
been doing these years.

182
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,610
Go to sleep.

183
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,980
You're right.

184
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,060
I'm just

185
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,720
a silly girl from a small town.

186
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,060
Somehow,

187
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:42,980
I ended up in a big city

188
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,980
like Tokyo.

189
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,160
I have no family or friends here.

190
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,850
But it's fine.

191
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,080
What worries me the most

192

the Qing dynasty has hope again.

387
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,860
Such a report

388
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,380
is the conspiracy of the Western powers.

389
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,980
They have ulterior motives.

390
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,220
Can't you see that?

391
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,140
Tianbai.

392
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,090
The beef,

393
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,860
should I braise or poach it?

394
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,550
Braise, of course.

395
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,770
Cheap beef like that can only be braised.

396
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,930
Fry the sauce first

397
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,150
until it's fragrant.

398
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,420
Then add green onions, ginger, and garlic.

399
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,080
Add beef at last. Understand?

400
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,770
I told you so many times

401
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,500
only fresh fish can be poached.

402
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,420
I don't trust the Western press.

403
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I never do.

404
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,190
Whether you trust it or not,

405
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,780
it can't solve the problem.

406
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,420
Sir.

407
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,860
Sir.

408
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,700
What is it?

409
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,090
I'm really sorry.

410
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,900
You're a regular client here.

411
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,570
I shouldn't be saying this.

412
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,500
But you're not the only guest

413
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,130
staying in my house.

414
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,420
Just say it.

415
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,730
What is it?

416
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,140
Recently,

417
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,250
all the customers complained to me

418
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,660
They're saying your room is very noisy.

419
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,660
Look at the smoke.

420
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,220
It's going into the courtyard.

421
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,010
Also, you're using hot oil.

422
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,350
This house really can't withstand

423
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,180
all this smoke.

424
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,940
Shuhong, stop cooking the beef.

425
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,450
But what about lunch?

426
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,980
Didn't you buy vegetables?

427
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,580
We'll have vegetable salad.

428
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,200
I don't know how to make vegetable salad.

429
00:22:59,010 --> 00:22:59,660
How about

430
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,380
we get your meals instead?

431
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,290
That would be great!

432
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,290
Mr. Wu, our new cook

433
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,420
is really good.

434
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,330
Would you mind letting us eat on credit

435
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,640
for the first month?

436
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm short of cash this month.

437
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,900
Mr. Wu, you...

438
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,140
Alright.

439
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,620
I trust you.

440
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,140
It's a deal then.

441
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,010
Our food is 10 yen per person per month.

442
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,490
It'll be 20 for two people.

443
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,620
You can pay for them next month
along with the rent.

444
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,180
Thank you.

445
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,250
What did she say

446
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,420
is 20 yen per month?

447
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,810
That's too expensive.

448
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,050
Don't worry about it.

449
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,650
We'll buy the meals
and stay at hers for now.

450
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,130
[Three months later]

451
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,740
[Student Regiment station outside Tokyo]

452
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,530
Eat. Eat.

453
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,810
Liang Xiang!

454
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,860
Well hello. Here to visit?

455
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,660
Seriously.

456
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,400
It stinks here.

457
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,970
How can you stand it?

458
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,180
Japanese pigs are different

459
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,010
from Chinese pigs.

460
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:03,770
Do they bite?

461
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,250
How did you two

462
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,190
manage to sneak out today?

463
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,490
It's Sunday.

464
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,320
Don't you guys get the day off?

465
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,280
We do.

466
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,980
But these guys

467
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,420
must get their meals.

468
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,330
It's been three months.

469
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,570
Tufang, aren't you too docile?

470
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,940
We came here for military training,

471
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,570
but here you are, feeding pigs.

472
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:24,180
Kaizhi and I

473
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,010
are no better.

474
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,730
He's washing dishes in the canteen,

475
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,620
and I'm tending fire in the bathhouse.

476
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,480
The government paid our tuition.

477
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,570
How could they do this to us?

478
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,030
We are here to ask you

479
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,380
to go and see the commander with us.

480
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,420
He can't treat us

481
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,180
like this.

482
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,180
I'm not going.

483
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,880
You can go if you want. But I'm not going.

484
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,090
Liang Xiang.

485
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,490
We should go together.

486
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,860
Come out.

487
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,030
You stupid pig.

488
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,180
What are you saying?

489
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,660
It wasn't to you guys,

490
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,900
but to them.

491
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,820
These pigs

492
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,620
only understand Japanese.

493
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,910
Here. Make yourselves at home.

494
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,920
Did you wash your hands?

495
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,600
You're feeding us right after
feeding the pigs.

496
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,900
Don't be so fussy.

497
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,600
We're all in the same boat.

498
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,620
I have to chop

499
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,770
more than 500 pounds of firewood a day.

500
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,810
It's like a mountain.

501
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,770
And yet Sergeant Yamashita
is still not happy with me.

502
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,930
Mind you,

503
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,820
your daily baths at the bathhouse

504
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,900
aren't just baths.

505
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,870
They're the result of my hard work.

506
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,000
Look at the calluses on my hands.

507
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,060
Do you know what this is?

508
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,790
It's willpower training.

509
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,010
If you can't do it,

510
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,020
you're not working hard enough.

511
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,360
Don't drink.

512
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,140
Our unit forbids

513
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,600
drinking in the barracks.

514
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,980
What are you afraid of?

515
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,380
This is ours, not stolen.

516
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:07,940
Liang Xiang,

517
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
for a member of the imperial family,

518
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,700
your guts

519
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,770
are literally minimal.

520
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,300
Exactly.

521
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:12,770
Listen,

522
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,980
when we go and talk

523
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,860
to the commander,

524
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,980
you need to say something.

525
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,860
You need to let him know who you are.

526
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,420
Yes.

527
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,570
It's one thing

528
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,570
with the two of us.

529
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,830
He can't do this to you,

530
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,460
a relative

531
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,140
of the Chinese emperor.

532
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
He's clearly trying to humiliate you

533
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,950
by making you feed the pigs.

534
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,050
And humiliating you

535
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,380
is the same as humiliating China.

536
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,460
Am I right, Qianli?

537
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,380
Absolutely!

538
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:31,900
Right?

539
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,530
Absolutely!

540
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,250
Right, Qianli?

541
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,250
The sergeant is here. Stop drinking.

542
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,140
Stop drinking.

543
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,380
Just go! Go, go, go!

544
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,900
He's coming from that way.

545
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,980
Go from there.

546
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,290
Hurry up.

548
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,760
Hold on.

549
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,990
Take your stuff.

550
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,770

566

some Chinese kung fu.

567
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,980
You overestimate yourself.

569
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,250
Get out of the way.

577
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,310
and lock them up.

578
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,530
Yes, sir.

579
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,390
Yes, sir.

580
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,270
Your combat skills...

581
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,990
Such a disgrace to the Emperor's honor!

582
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:36,860
Sorry!

583
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:40,010
He knows Chinese kung fu.

584
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,550
[Confinement Chamber]

585
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,570
So, Li Renjun,

586
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,010
are you as aggressive

587
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:51,980
in your unit?

588
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:53,980
Not at all.

589
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,010
He's as docile as a cat

590
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,590
and does whatever he's told to do.

591
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,430
Then why did you

592
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,210
make such a scene here?

593
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,530
I suppose

594
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,090
it's a grievance

595
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,330
that's been held in for too long.

596
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,870
Vent it, and you cause trouble.

597
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,790
Am I right, Qianli?

598
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,650
But you're indeed really good at fighting.

599
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,770
That jump kick

600
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,490
was particularly impressive.

601
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,530
Right on Sergeant Yamashita's ribs.

602
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,460
Sent him to the floor with a stitch.

603
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,970
Sergeant Yamashita is the best
in unarmed combat

604
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,600
in the unit.

605
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,690
You're really not to be underestimated

606
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,270
as a member of Wuwei Corps Right Division.

607
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,090
Terrible luck today.

608
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,570
You know what I was?

609
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,510
Hyped up by your presence!

610
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,010
I would never

611
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,620
have done that if you two hadn't been there.

612
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
I've put up with it for three months.

613
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,550
But with you two being there today,

614
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,490
I just felt this spurt of rage
coming into my head.

615
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,250
Feel here.

616
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,640
Feel it.

617
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,050
Is it hot?

618
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,530
It's still hot now.

619
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,490
It really is.

620
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Hard qigong?

621
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,570
These students of yours.

622
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,810
I don't want any of them.

623
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,160
You take them all

624
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,560
back!

625
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,090
Colonel,

626
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,220
you can punish my students

627
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,980
and lock them up.

628
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,570
You can insult them, too.

629
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,250
But helping Qing

630
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,460
train their military personnel

631
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,900
is a state policy.

632
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,380
Lieutenant Hirata,

633
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,430
I know that better than you do.

634
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,360
Don't forget that this is my regiment.

635
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,510
My soldiers are treated

636
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,330
worse than the academy's military horses.

637
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,380
How can they have pork

638
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,050
if they don't raise their own pigs?

639
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,720
It's your right to use the enlisted students

640
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,460
to feed pigs.

641
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,490
The academy has no intention of interfering.

642
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,380
We don't have to be nice to them,

643
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,570
but we shouldn't make them feel that

644
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,770
they traveled all the way across the sea

645
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,010
to learn how to feed pigs.

646
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,490
Fine.

647
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,900
I can take your advice.

648
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,140
But you have to know that

649
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,980
if these three Chinese

650
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,900
commit any more violations,

651
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,380
I will expel them

652
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
immediately.

653
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,900
I have no objections.

654
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,380
By the way,

655
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,010
may I

656
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,940
see these three students?

657
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,090
I'd advise you not to.

658
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,980
Why expose our disagreement

659
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:07,250
to those Chinese?

660
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,380
I see.

661
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,860
If you'll

662
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,300
excuse me now.

663
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,050
Stop dwelling on it, Qianli.

664
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,980
What's been done has been done.

665
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,440
It's too late for regrets.

666
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,570
Well,

667
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,820
when I close my eyes,

668
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,570
I can't fall asleep.

669
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,050
I feel as if Mr. Yuan

670
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,310
is right in front of me.

671
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,710
Yuan Shikai?

672
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,980
That's right.

673
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,940
He's glaring at me.

674
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,909
You're imagining things again.

675
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:54,210
Well,

676
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,170
if we really get expelled,

677
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,010
what should we do?

678
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,090
I'll be letting Mr. Yuan down.

679
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,650
He picked me himself.

680
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,090
It's not just you.

681
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,420
If I get kicked out,

682
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
things will be difficult for me as well.

683
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,470
We need to come up with something.

684
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,150
If we really get expelled,

685
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,740
it'll be too late for anything.

686
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,710
What can we possibly do?

687
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,340
I have 1,000 yen in my little bag.

688
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,900
1,000 yen?

689
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,000
You sure are rich, aren't you?

690
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,980
Money from people's blood and sweat.

691
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,240
Looted from Wuwei Corps Right Division?

692
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,050
How about

693
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,570
we use it

694
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,940
to bribe the commander?

695
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
If we give them this 1,000 yen,

696
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,340
we'll lose our identities as citizens

697
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,380
of Qing dynasty.

698
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,170
I think it's fine.

699
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,340
Anyway, the money

700
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,860
must be dirty.

701
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:23,380
Dirty?

702
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,580
How?

703
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,490
No matter how dirty,

704
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,820
it'll become clean in Li Renjun's hands.

705
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,780
How is it clean?

706
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,490
How is it not?

707
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,820
At your current military rank,

708
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,480
how much can you earn a year?

709
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,340
How'd it become clean?

710
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,490
It's none of your business.

711
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,130
Explain to me.

712
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,010
-It’s none of your business.
-Tell me.

713
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,160
Stop arguing.

714
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,610
Is anyone there?

715
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,820
Is anyone there?

716
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,170
Behave yourself. Don't make noise.

717
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,490
Open the door!

718
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,090
Open the door!

719
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,260
Open the door!

720
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,570
Open the door!

721
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Private Liang.

722
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,830
As someone in confinement,

723
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,740
what were you doing causing a ruckus

724
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
at this late hour?

725
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,310
Do you know what consequences

726
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,780
your actions will bring?

727
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,090
Yes.

728
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,340
Then why did you commit an offense knowingly?

729
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,650
I was wrong.

730
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,440
But I want to inform my guardian

731
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,570
of my mistake.

732
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,910
Your guardian?

733
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:05,700
Yes.

734
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,320
When disembarking in Tokyo,

735
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,010
he was secretly assigned to me

736
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,820
by the Chinese legation.

737
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,010
Who is he?

738
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,780
Duke Ayakura of the Japanese royal family.

739
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,380
Duke Ayakura?

740
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,490
Yes.

741
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,130
Duke Ayakura.

742
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,490
Welcome.

743
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,140
As the commander of Inukai Regiment, I salute you.

744
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,490
I'm just a guardian.

745
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,730
[Duke Ayakura, a member of the Japanese royal family]

746
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,010
I'm here to see my Chinese student.

747
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,070
[Duke Ayakura's residence]

748
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,090
We're home, kid.

749
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,530
Let's go in.

750
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,820
This is my wife

751
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,040
and this is my youngest daughter,

752
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,650
Yoshiko.

753
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,500
[Yoshiko]

754
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,150
Can you tell

755
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,090
what country my guest is from?

756
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,450
Except for that braid,

757
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,500
he looks just like us.

758
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,760
Don't talk nonsense, Yoshiko.

759
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,040
He knows Japanese.

760
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:42,960
Right,

761
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,710
Liang Xiang?

762
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,590
A little.

763
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,930
Our guest

764
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,570
just came out of confinement.

765
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,630
He's still hungry.

766
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:52,030
Go get some food.

767
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:55,530
The food in the military camp isn't good to begin with.

768
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,720
Yes.

769
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,740
Have a seat.

770
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,490
Don't they look familiar?

771
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,290
They're from the Summer Palace.

772
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,090
In the Year of Gengzi, a Japanese military officer

773
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,350
brought them to Tokyo.

774
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,860
After wandering around and ending up in the cultural relics store,

775
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,340
I bought them.

776
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,380
All my paintings and antiques here

777
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,510
have their origins.

778
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,820
Is he

779
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,270
really a relative of the Chinese emperor?

780
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,570
That's what I heard.

781
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,740
If he cuts off that braid,

782
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,470
he would be more handsome.

783
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,980
Does he not know that?

784
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,900
Don't talk nonsense.

785
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,640
Please come in.

786
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,260
Eat up.

787
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:33,260
Make yourself at home.

788
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,300
This is your home.

789
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,860
Visit anytime you want.

790
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,530
In the Japanese army,

791
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,130
fighting is never tolerated.

792
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,980
Especially when it comes to assaulting one's superiors.

793
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
I know I was wrong.

794
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Why can the Japanese army

795
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,330
fight like a bunch of creatures

796
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,000
at will?

797
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,330
It relies on

798
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,150
absolute obedience to orders,

799
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,530
even if it is

800
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:14,600
not a right order.

801
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,650
You might think

802
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,420
that not everyone

803
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,200
will act according to orders.

804
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,980
You may ask

805
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,780
why it must be like this.

806
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,420
Listen carefully.

807
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,270
You can only execute it after understanding it.

808
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,510
There are no explanations

809
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:38,780
in the Japanese army.

810
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,490
You must first understand

811
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,130
what the Japanese army is.

812
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,780
Then can you complete

813
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,340
all military education,

814
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:59,210
encompassing the classical, model, and order,

815
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:00,820
and tactics,

816
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:05,160
fortification, weapons, transportation, and terrain.
