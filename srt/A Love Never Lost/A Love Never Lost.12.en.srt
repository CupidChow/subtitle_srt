[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,890
[Episode 12]

3
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,150
We were supposed to meet a year ago.

4
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,350
What a pity.

5
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,270
Really, Liang Xiang.

6
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,710
She was supposed to be introduced to you,

7
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,979
but you left early.

8
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
What exactly did you two do behind my back?

9
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,560
Nothing.

10
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,039
Our classmate

11
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,590
is quite a catch.

12
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,710
I don't get what's going on between you two.

13
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,350
Kaizhi,

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,900
since your good friend is here,

15
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,190
we must make tonight special.

16
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,680
Let's get something decent.

17
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
Serve the dishes now.

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,160
The host hasn't arrived yet.

19
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,800
Let's wait until he gets here before serving.

20
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,240
Fine.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Kaizhi, you're letting someone else
pick up the tab again.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,750
When will you

23
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,150
treat us for once, huh?

24
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,310
Now that you're rubbing shoulders
with a rich Korean merchant,

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,570
we can't afford to disgrace
the dignity of the Qing Empire.

26
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,290
Sorry, I'm late.

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
My apologies.

28
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,870
Let me introduce.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,190
This is my cousin Yang Yifan,

30
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,230
and his courtesy name is Hanhua.

31
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,030
They're in the private room.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,310
Keep an eye on them.

33
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,590
Yes, sir.

34
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,360
Come on.

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,870
Make yourself at home.

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,870
Sure thing.

37
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,800
Since you're Kaizhi's big brother,

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,150
then that makes you our big brother too,

39
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,630
right?

40
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,430
That's right.

41
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,120
Actually, we've heard Kaizhi mention before

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,450
that he has a big brother

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,000
who passed the Imperial Exam.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,710
Only one in ten thousand make it.

45
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,710
It's really rare.

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,590
Don't believe that.

47
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,079
Seriously, don't believe a word of it.

48
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,810
All that talk about the Imperial Exam and titles?

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,930
Haven't you heard?

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
Even farting in the exam hall

51
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,190
brings glory to your ancestors.

52
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,490
Did you hear that, Kaizhi?

53
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,710
The real scholars

54
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,360
don't even show their knowledge.

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Am I right?

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you being sarcastic?

57
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,590
When it comes to China's Imperial Exam System,

58
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,720
no need to be polite.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,850
No need for discussion.

60
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,470
Feel free to curse it.

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,800
Kicking down its gates,

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,310
destroying its temples would be even better.

63
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,310
Mr. Yang,

64
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,090
you seem to have a negative view

65
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,690
of the Imperial Exam System.

66
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,660
The design of the Imperial Exam

67
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,350
is genius, I'll give you that.

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
The court used the Imperial Exam

69
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,840
to mobilize all the scholars in the country

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
to spend their lives on the Eight-Legged Essay,

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,120
instead of anything useful.

72
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,910
It wasted and crushed so much talent

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,070
and energy

74
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,800
of so many young people.

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Well, Yifan,

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,510
I mean,

77
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,120
you've just met,

78
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,320
let's keep it light.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
I'm sorry, here, here.

80
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,570
Joohee,

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,159
do you know what they're talking about?

82
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
See? What are you talking about?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,050
How could you leave the lady aside?

84
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,240
Is that even appropriate?

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,300
The Imperial Exam?

86
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,760
It's okay if you don't understand.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,680
Cheers.

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,020
Do you understand?

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,890
Cheers.

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,020
Cheers!

91
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,070
Cheers!

92
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,790
Cheers.

93
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,980
Cheers.

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,000
Well...

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,750
Tufang,

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,510
if you are interested,

97
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,180
we can discuss it further later.

98
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,740
You two get in.

99
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,480
What are you doing?

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,540
What are you doing?

101
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,250
What are you doing?

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,530
Kaizhi! Kaizhi!

103
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,540
What are you doing?

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,310
Kaizhi.

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,100
What are you doing?

106
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,190
Don't move!

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,180
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,000
[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]

109
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
That's strange.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,610
Why did they arrest us?

111
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,660
It can't be because of you, right?

112
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,840
What do you mean?

113
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,870
Then we need to find someone to sort this out.

114
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,510
Tufang, you have many connections.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,370
Who should I talk to?

116
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,990
What should I say?

117
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,430
The police department

118
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,970
can't just arrest people for no reason, right?

119
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,970
How do you know

120
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,120
they had no reason to arrest us?

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Mr. Yang,

122
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,620
where do you live in Tokyo?

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,310
Do you think this is because of me?

124
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,680
No, no, I'm just asking.

125
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,640
I don't think they'd arrest me.

126
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,030
Yesterday afternoon,

127
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,520
I even had tea with a Japanese general.

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,720
You know a Japanese general?

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,070
Not exactly.

130
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,040
It was our first time meeting, introduced by a friend.

131
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
We chatted a bit

132
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,200
about the current Russo-Japanese relations.

133
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,020
Really?

134
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,310
If they wanted to arrest me,

135
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,410
they should've done it yesterday.

136
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,480
But the thing is,

137
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,720
what's the use of arresting me?

138
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
When Sun Wen was arrested in London,

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,159
it shook the world.

140
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,830
But before that,

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,360
who outside China

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,270
had even heard of a Chinese man named Sun Wen?

143
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,330
If that's the case,

144
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,360
Hanhua,

145
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,630
maybe...

146
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,930
tomorrow you'll be the next Sun Wen.

147
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,870
I've heard Japanese generals

148
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,870
aren't very tall.

149
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,070
Is that true?

150
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,360
He's short and plain-looking.

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,040
His skin is tanned.

152
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,420
When he thinks,

153
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,370
he looks no different from a farmer.

154
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,890
But when he looks at you,

155
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,720
when he listens to you,

156
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,380
his eyes are like a hawk's.

157
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,780
He carefully listens to every word you say,

158
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,480
and you can feel

159
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,360
his burning ambition.

160
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,760
You're very perceptive, Mr. Yang.

161
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,390
I've been in Japan for years,

162
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,160
and that is something

163
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,390
I know well too.

164
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,690
That's exactly why things need to change.

165
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
Liang Xiang,

166
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,120
with your status,

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,380
it's quite impressive

168
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,180
that you can realize this.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,730
The key is how to change things?

170
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,840
Change from following heaven's will
to following the people's will.

171
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,870
Change is a must.

172
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,440
Of course, it has to be for the Emperor.

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,030
Right now, there's change in politics
and in the military.

174
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,289
Political change means reform,

175
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,490
and military change means revolution.

176
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,450
So, Mr. Yang, do you advocate for reform

177
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,960
or revolution?

178
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,630
What do you think?

179
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
China needs gradual reform.

180
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,770
A revolution will just throw China

181
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,960
from the frying pan into the fire.

182
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,080
It seems that your military school

183
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,960
teaches more than just military affairs.

184
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,840
In Tokyo alone,

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
there are nearly 10,000

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,100
Chinese students now.

187
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,480
You can meet Chinese students everywhere.

188
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,210
Once you meet them,
you can't avoid these topics.

189
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,600
Now, Chinese politics

190
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,720
is something everyone wants to participate in.

191
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,480
Everyone

192
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,150
thinks they have a say in it.

193
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,800
Where is this place?

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
How did we end up here?

195
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,150
Are you asking us?

196
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,680
I was going to ask you.

197
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,480
Did you

198
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,770
do something illegal?

199
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,740
Are we at the police department?

200
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,240
What happened exactly?

201
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,870
I... I need to take a leak.

202
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,450
Listen up!

203
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,050
Each of you needs to register here.

204
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,320
After that,

205
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
you'll need someone to bail you out.

206
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,060
Excuse me.

207
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,550
Why exactly

208
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,120
are you detaining us?

209
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,390
You didn't even interrogate us,

210
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,670
yet you want us to call someone to bail us out?

211
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,480
Cut the crap!

212
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,090
If I tell you to register, then register.

213
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,900
If I tell you to find someone, then find someone!

214
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,420
You know what this is about.

215
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,360
That's enough for today.

216
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,010
Let me help you.

217
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,220
Thank you.

218
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,600
Miss Shuhong.

219
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes?

220
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,960
Are you married?

221
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,720
No.

222
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,870
Have you ever...

223
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,910
been with someone?

224
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,390
I don't mean anything else by it.

225
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,800
It's just that...

226
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,990
I see a kind of maternal instinct in you,

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,720
which is rare to see in someone your age.

228
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,270
Is that good or bad?

229
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm not trying to interfere with your life.

230
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,450
Even if you wanted to, it's too late.

231
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,510
Give me your hand.

232
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,200
Let me see.

233
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,600
What a beautiful hand.

234
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,110
It shows that your figure is elegant.

235
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,670
They say your hands match your figure.

236
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
Really?

237
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,360
We should have a proper chat sometime.

238
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,910
I have a good impression of you.

239
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,920
Excuse me.

240
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,960
Miss Shuhong.

241
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,150
Yes?

242
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,000
Do you have

243
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,840
a brother-in-law named Yang Yifan?

244
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, that's right.

245
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,840
What happened to Yifan?

246
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,360
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police just contacted us

247
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,840
that he needs you to bail him out.

248
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:12,650
[Kanda Police Station]

249
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,530
Nice to meet you.

250
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,390
I'm drillmaster Hirata from the military school.

251
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,010
Drillmaster Hirata.

252
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,680
Nice to meet you. My name is Shuhong.

253
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,030
Are you here to bail someone out too?

254
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,130
Yes.

255
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,960
It's my pleasure to meet you.

256
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,190
Come out.

257
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,990
Let's go.

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,480
Yifan,

259
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
what's going on?

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,930
How did you get involved with them?

261
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,720
It's all my friends' fault.

262
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Your friends?

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,930
What did they do?

264
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,440
They're causing trouble everywhere.

265
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,550
It's outrageous.

266
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,380
Causing trouble everywhere?

267
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,130
Who did they take a fancy to?

268
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,960
They don't go after just any woman.

269
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,000
They went after

270
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,860
a rich Korean merchant woman.

271
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,860
A rich Korean merchant woman?

272
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,760
They're out of her league.

273
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,190
The Japanese have eyes on her 24 hours a day.

274
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,350
I don't know how you three

275
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,110
got involved

276
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,550
with that Korean woman.

277
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,270
I just want to remind you,

278
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
from now on,

279
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,670
stay away from her!

280
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,480
Don't even try to hit on her.

281
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,270
Understand?

282
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,720
Yes.

283
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,790
Understood, sir.

284
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,150
Understood, sir.

285
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,100
Liang Xiang, you stay.

286
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,760
You two, dismiss!

287
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,670
Yes, sir!

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
Liang Xiang.

289
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,870
I know

290
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,080
you're taking the blame for someone else.

291
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,750
You can explain to me.

292
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,710
Why?

293
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,930
Honestly, I'm also wondering

294
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,470
why the Tokyo police, knowing full well

295
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,030
that only one Chinese man

296
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,000
was involved with that Korean woman,

297
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,330
yet they arrest all his Chinese students.

298
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,060
Because at that time,

299
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,440
you weren't in uniforms,

300
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,000
besides...

301
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,360
you were still wearing those silly braids.

302
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,160
They wanted to know who you were,

303
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,650
and what you're there for.

304
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,440
That's a good reason.

305
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,840
Sir.

306
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,410
Is there anything else?

307
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,609
You really don't want

308
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,359
to have a heart-to-heart chat with me, do you?

309
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,829
I see.

310
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,589
You're free to go now.

311
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,829
Yes, sir.

312
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,720
Connect me to Duke Ayakura's place.

313
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,280
Tufang, what did Hirata say to you?

314
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,080
Hey, I'm talking to you.

315
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,480
What are you looking for?

316
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,720
Tufang.

317
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,040
Tufang!

318
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,520
Are you crazy?

319
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,030
Give me the scissors.

320
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,430
Tufang, Tufang, Tufang!

321
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,310
Tufang!

322
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,520
Have you made up your mind?

323
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,830
You're different from us.

324
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,890
How am I different?

325
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,530
What's the difference?

326
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,590
If I take off this uniform,

327
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,070
the Tokyo police would still arrest me!

328
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:31,700
Give it to me.

329
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,380
Tufang!

330
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,030
Tufang!

331
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,590
Listen to me.

332
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,890
I can cut it, but you can't.

333
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,920
You have to think about your own future.

334
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,220
It's none of your business!

335
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,150
Give me a reason.

336
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:42,720
Give me a reason

337
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,070
and I'll cut mine with you, okay?

338
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,870
Let me ask you.

339
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,850
Why did we even come to Tokyo?

340
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,520
It's that Hirata again, right?

341
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,550
He's just a lieutenant!

342
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,440
Three years ago, I was a field-grade officer!

343
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,430
Who cares if he talks crap?

344
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,310
If we do, we'll never achieve anythingh.

345
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,550
It's not about him.

346
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,660
I just want to cut my braids!

347
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,860
It's very important.

348
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,160
No!

349
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,030
Providing services to Qing dynasty nobles

350
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,560
is a policy of conciliation.

351
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,130
Conciliation is to win them over.

352
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,810
Winning them over is to assimilate them.

353
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:27,720
Assimilating is to cultivate pawns for the Empire.

354
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,640
These students will eventually become

355
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,120
the future military

356
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,440
and political elites of Qing Empire.

357
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,160
Here,

358
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,310
we have to plant Japanese ideals in them,

359
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,510
and build loyalty

360
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,000
and trust toward Japan

361
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,550
among Qing's future rulers.

362
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
This is essential.

363
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,570
You should know that.

364
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,550
Yes, sir!

365
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,840
This is...

366
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:12,830
the Emperor of Japan's century-long plan

367
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,280
and the dream of our Yamato people

368
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,070
for generations.

369
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,310
I hope you can

370
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,440
keep our mission deep in your heart.

371
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,790
Never

372
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,250
let your self-esteem, competitive streak,

373
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,070
or emotions cloud your judgment.

374
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:37,480
Reshaping their spirits

375
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,290
is all part of the Empire's big strategy.

376
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,400
I will follow your teachings by heart.

377
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,990
Sir Hirata.

378
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,400
Did you cut your braids?

379
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,170
I did it yesterday.

380
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,790
Why?

381
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,380
Let's call it a way to show my resolve.

382
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,080
You're already excellent,

383
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,550
and now you're even more handsome.

384
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,400
You're not feeling pressured, are you?

385
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,920
I am under pressure.

386
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,550
Yoshiko has been...

387
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,030
Let's not talk about this.

388
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,680
I'd like to introduce a new student.

389
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,420
Miss Lee Joohee.

390
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,030
Thank you for helping me tidy up.

391
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,430
You're welcome.

392
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,590
Miss Li,

393
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,680
you transferred from Tokyo Imperial University.

394
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,430
Was it not good there?

395
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
They asked me to transfer.

396
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,000
Who are they?

397
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,160
I don't know.

398
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,440
Miss Shuhong.

399
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,520
The principal wants to see you.

400
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,180
Okay.

401
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,680
What is it?

402
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,490
What do you want from me?

403
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,250
My friends came all the way here.

404
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,590
Please.

405
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,380
Stop.

406
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,480
Mr. Wu,

407
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,510
how dare you lie to me?

408
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,310
What do you take this place for?

409
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,000
Your private club?

410
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,640
No, it's a misunderstanding.

411
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,400
Let me explain.

412
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,650
Explain what?

413
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,200
You're an educated person,

414
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,440
how could you do something like this?

415
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,480
The check you pawned at my Yokohama Specie Bank

416
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,680
was actually forged.

417
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,590
Do you think I'm an idiot?

418
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,830
No.

419
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,490
That's right!

420
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,050
It's forged, totally forged!

421
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,160
You're pretty tough, huh?

422
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,210
Let's see

423
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,480
if your neck's tougher than my knife.

424
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
Bastard!

425
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
It wasn't me!

426
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,270
It's Mr. Kanyama.

427
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,760
It's Mr. Kanyama of the Black Tiger.

428
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,590
Wait.

429
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,550
Mr. Kanyama?

430
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,790
Yes.

431
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,070
The one who runs a stationery store?

432
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,270
Yes.

433
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,530
The one who sells paintings, counterfeit money,

434
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,560
and also four treasures of the study.

435
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,610
Why are we in such a place?

436
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,410
With all the debauchery.

437
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,920
Even Japanese politicians are not this extravagant.

438
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,130
Your check...

439
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,410
can only be used here.

440
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,850
Unfortunately, it's only half-finished.

441
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,270
You're a bit too impatient.

442
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,960
Besides making counterfeit money,

443
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,000
what else do you do?

444
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,070
That depends on what you want to do.

445
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,030
If you love art,

446
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,470
you can make calligraphy and painting.

447
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,310
If you want to dine with politicians,

448
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,790
then arrange

449
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,550
one of your guys in the cabinet.

450
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,510
If one day, you want

451
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,000
to take a stroll through the Chinese Imperial Palace,

452
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,680
the best way is

453
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,030
to start investing

454
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,200
in a Chinese revolutionist like you.

455
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,200
we should sit down and talk properly sometime.

456
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,800
But there's one condition for working with me.

457
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,350
My money...

458
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,640
can only be used for the revolution.

459
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,140
Yes, sir.

460
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,880
How did you fall for that person?

461
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,680
That person?

462
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,200
Yang Kaizhi is my brother-in-law's cousin.

463
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,310
Really?

464
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,990
That's great.

465
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,680
I'll treat you to a meal.

466
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,400
A lot of delicious food!

467
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,510
A Korean feast!

468
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Do you want try it?

469
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,720
Of course I do.

470
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:42,680
Then I'm treating you tonight.

471
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,930
Let's go.

472
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,030
Come on, let me help you up.

473
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,040
Is that okay?

474
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,790
It's fine.

475
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,110
Hurry up.

476
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,140
You're really something.

477
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,030
You're a real chemist!

478
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:58,960
Wrong.

479
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,550
I'm a broke chemist.

480
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,510
Have a seat, Mr. Kanyama.

481
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,130
I'm sorry.

482
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,620
I only have one chair here.

483
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,620
Don't tell me

484
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,640
you want to blow up this roof?

485
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,880
That's why I urgently need money.

486
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,510
Those stable chemical materials

487
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,920
on the market

488
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,550
are generally

489
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,000
very expensive.

490
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,270
They're like fine women.

491
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,000
How come you never mentioned

492
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,960
Shuhong?

493
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,480
Where is she now?

494
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,270
She's in Tokyo, but...

495
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,510
That's good.

496
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,680
Have her come talk to me.

497
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,370
I only trust her.

498
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,750
I don't feel safe

499
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,100
leaving my money with you.

500
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,400
No.

501
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,640
I don't plan

502
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,030
to drag her into this matter.

503
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,160
It's too dangerous.

504
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,750
Then, why should I

505
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,200
invest in your dangerous deal?

506
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,160
Didn't you say

507
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,680
you want to stroll through

508
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,340
the Chinese Imperial Palace?

509
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,920
Well said.

510
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,240
But I don't need bombs.

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,260
What I need is the intel

512
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,000
on the Russian Army in Manchuria,

513
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:28,550
and...

514
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,480
accurate info

515
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,240
on the Russian Pacific Fleet

516
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,960
at Port Arthur.

517
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,350
That's not too much to ask.

518
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,510
It's a fair deal.

519
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,970
We both get what we need.

520
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,920
Comrades from all over
are coming to Tokyo to look for me.

521
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,580
They desperately need bombs.

522
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,070
How much is it

523
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,510
to buy materials and upgrade gear?

524
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,750
Make a list.

525
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,920
Then...

526
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,070
have Shuhong give it to me.

527
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,480
Between you and me,

528
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,750
we won't handle the money...

529
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,350
directly.

530
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,820
Wait, Mr. Kanyama.

531
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,030
I...

532
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,880
I have another question I'm very curious about.

533
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,350
How did you get involved

534
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,920
in this Russo-Japanese affair?

535
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,640
Do you have

536
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,030
a relative in the cabinet's military department

537
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,350
or something?

538
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,030
A word of advice,

539
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,510
don't get too nosy.

540
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,830
In Tokyo,

541
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,350
this is top-secret stuff.

542
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,000
If you poke around too much,

543
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,440
and the Japanese safety police

544
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,680
will come knocking.

545
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,920
Watch yourself, Mr. Wu.

546
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,820
Don't

547
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,170
blow up your own roof.

548
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,170
I waited for you two for two hours.

549
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,960
Tell me.

550
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,550
Where did you go?

551
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,170
Hold on! Wait.

552
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,200
Excuse me.

553
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,440
Hello.

554
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,210
Who are you looking for?

555
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,110
I'm looking for Shuhong.

556
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,070
What's your relationship to her?

557
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,310
I'm her teacher.

558
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,720
Teacher?

559
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,290
Yes, I'm her teacher.

560
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,450
I'm very sorry.

561
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:06,350
The school has a new regulation,

562
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,100
all female students

563
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:11,650
are not allowed to receive visitors after 9 PM.

564
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
Why aren't you saying anything?

565
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,480
I have nothing to say, Principal.

566
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,960
It's not that I'm being too strict,

567
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,469
Miss Shuhong.

568
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,030
But I can't keep you here anymore.

569
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,550
The safety police came here earlier.

570
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,929
For Miss Li,

571
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,420
the Safety Police Department
has made special arrangements.

572
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,550
I had no choice

573
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,920
but to expel you.

574
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,920
Your tuition fees

575
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,020
will be fully refunded by the school.

576
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,440
After all, we were teacher and student,

577
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,710
and I still think highly of you.

578
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,710
But there's nothing I can do, Miss Shuhong.

579
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,810
Principal.

580
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,830
Miss Shuhong, it's settled.

581
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,750
You're expelled tonight.

582
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,510
By the way, that man

583
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,570
is waiting for you at the school gate.

584
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
What's wrong?

585
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,450
I've been expelled.

586
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,130
Really?

587
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
Come here.

588
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,670
In my opinion,

589
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,920
this is all Yifan's fault.

590
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,230
You know?

591
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,000
He shouldn't have wasted that money.

592
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,230
If you stick with me, Wu Tianbai,

593
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,760
and it's like going to school.

594
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,900
I'm like a walking encyclopedia

595
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,750
that you can read for a lifetime.

596
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,310
You're back on your old job?

597
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,270
To be honest,

598
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,320
I just got an investment.

599
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,360
Really?

600
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,710
How about we team up

601
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,520
and open a husband-and-wife shop together?

602
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,030
You're being shameless again.

603
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,430
Can we really stay apart?

604
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,590
We're inseparable, you know that.

605
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,030
You want me run errands for you.

606
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,760
That's right. I'll handle the wheel.

607
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,960
You want me sweet-talk others

608
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,530
and put on a smiling face.

609
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,930
I'll make plans.

610
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,890
You're all talk.

611
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,890
You just run errands.

612
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,070
So you want to be the hands-off boss?

613
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,270
You're naturally the sidekick anyway.

614
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,710
Who are you dealing with this time?

615
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,800
Your former boss, Mr. Kanyama.

616
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,150
Mr. Kanyama?

617
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,600
He's a Japanese gang member.

618
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,360
What can we do about that?

619
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
Shuhong.

620
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,800
If you can't dodge it,

621
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,630
it's just your rotten luck.

622
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,310
Hands off!

623
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,480
Where do I sleep?

624
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,030
Anywhere.

625
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,280
Anywhere?

626
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,000
As long as you don't sleep on the bombs,

627
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,800
you can sleep anywhere you want.

628
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,710
Why are you staring at me like that?

629
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:46,440
Am I more dangerous than a bomb?

630
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,110
This doesn't look like a place for you to sleep.

631
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,710
You didn't go back

632
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,370
to see the Madam of Bamboo Inn?

633
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,710
Why would I go see her?

634
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,720
Do you think I don't know?

635
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,190
What do you know?

636
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,310
I've seen through you long ago!

637
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,430
You're great in every way, except for this one flaw.

638
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,340
What are you looking at?

639
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,600
I'm not even gonna waste my breath on you.

640
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,190
As a man in business,

641
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,000
you must have some dignity, right?

642
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,860
How can you have no dignity at all?

643
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,360
Bring the box over.

644
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,660
I, Kanyama, am the boss here.

645
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,660
And I was elected

646
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,290
by all the senior members with one vote each.

647
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,280
Yes, sir.

648
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,150
I have to call the shots in Shanghai.

649
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,030
Yes, sir.

650
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,360
I am the rule.

651
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:50,970
Yes, sir.

652
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,150
When I say take the money, you take it.

653
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,920
If I want someone dead,

654
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,620
they die.

655
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,880
Yes, sir.

656
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,510
Come in.

657
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:03,280
Boss,

658
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,030
Shuhong is here.

659
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,310
When you go back to Shanghai,

660
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,840
just tell them what I said.

661
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,190
If you have any reports later,

662
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,690
just write it like this.

663
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,990
The view's great, life's sweet,

664
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,910
I'm satisfied with everything.

665
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,280
Over.

666
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,360
Yes, sir.

667
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,590
You may leave now.

668
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,630
Shuhong.

669
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,030
Mr. Kanyama.

670
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,030
You're pretty.

671
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,030
You've gotten prettier.

672
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,360
Where have you been?

673
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,230
My brother-in-law

674
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,000
insisted that I go to Utako Shimoda's school

675
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,130
to study for a while.

676
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,440
Utako Shimoda?

677
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,760
She's a noble lady in Tokyo.

678
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,150
Lately,

679
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,960
how's your business at shop, Mr. Kanyama?

680
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:21,840
Not so good.

681
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,440
It's slack.

682
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,800
Since you left, even the paintings aren't selling well.

683
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,390
Mr. Wu asked me to bring this to you.

684
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,930
Here's the thing, Shuhong.

685
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,670
I saw Mr. Wu's place.

686
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,320
It's a nice location.

687
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,840
There's a bakery downstairs.

688
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,030
I can consider

689
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,280
renting that shop.

690
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,590
Will they agree?

691
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,320
The bakery downstairs is doing well.

692
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,510
I'll make them agree.

693
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,510
Are you also opening a bakery?

694
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,440
No, no, no.

695
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,440
We'll open a stationery store.

696
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,160
I want you to handle distribution for me.

697
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
What do you think?

698
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:12,320
This way, it's both discreet and convenient,

699
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,030
am I right?

700
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,030
As for the fee,

701
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,590
we can sign

702
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,920
an agreement right now.

703
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,150
Yes, sir.

704
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,000
Right, this is it.

705
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,480
[Agreement]
