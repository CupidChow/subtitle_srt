Who is it?

9
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,660
Still sleeping?

10
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,640
This is rare.

11
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,630
As far as I can remember,

12
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,470
I've never seen you

13
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,910
sleep in, Shuhong.

14
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,270
I guess

15
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,710
I got worn out from the village procurement

16
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,579
a couple of days ago,

17
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,040
so I couldn't get up today.

18
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,500
Is Tianbai still sleeping?

19
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,630
How is he?

20
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,200
Is he feeling any better?

21
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,390
Even if he isn't, what can we do about it?

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,310
No matter

23
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,840
how proud a person is,

24
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,400
he has to accept his fate, doesn't he?

25
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,060
Well, you underestimate him.

26
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,620
It's not about the gunshot wound.

27
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,510
He has different opinions on

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,630

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,829

of the revolutionary movement,

33
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,390
but they were not accepted.

34
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,920
So he's very disappointed.

35
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,520
Is that so?

36
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,490
No wonder he's been quiet

37
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,000
and snapping at me all the time.

38
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,310
Snapping at you is nothing.

39
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,159
He even had a huge fight with me.

40
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,590
That's just how he is.

41
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,810
Feeling the entire world is corrupt
and he's clean alone.

42
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,100
You should talk to him.

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
He feels upset.

44
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,870
This is a matter of ideological differences and
theoretical differences.

45
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,670
Do you think talking would work?

46
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,409
Why are there even differences
between you two?

47
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,330

You're leaving too?

58
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,540
What do you mean? Who else is leaving?

59
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,510

60
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,680
Shanghai or Anqing?

61
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Your sister is already in Shanghai.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,680
I asked her to rent a storefront there,

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,630
so that she could have a job cover

64
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,300
like you do.

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,670
Alright, go.

66
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:37,830
You all go.

67
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,470
Once you're all gone, it'll be peaceful.

68
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,000
You should still try to understand him.

69
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,270
Tianbai is a sensitive man.

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,420
He has a pure heart.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,390
few possess such outstanding talent

73
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,510
as he does.

74
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,290
Tell him that

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
all of us members still

76
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,570
respect him

77
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,080
and trust him as always.

78
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,270
Although we have some different opinions,

79
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,330
it doesn't matter.

80
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,310
You two should

81
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,830
take care of yourselves

82
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,230
and live your life well.

83
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,730
I only have one task

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,120
for you, Shuhong,

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
which is to take good care of
Tianbai for me.

86
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,830
He doesn't care about the consequences

87
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,120
at all when he gets impulsive.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
It's good to have you by his side.

89
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
At least

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,980
he could act like a normal person.

91
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,570
Just like you said,

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,680
some are responsible for the revolution,

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,540
and some are responsible
for the revolutionaries.

94
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,040

You leaving us at this time

113
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,430
really makes me sad.

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,630
Any news from Hirata?

115
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,630
Last night,

116
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,900
the commander of the General Staff Headquarters
came to my house

117
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,500
and told me something,

118
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,480
which kept me awake all night.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,510
What did he say?

120
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,070
He said that in just one battle last month,

121
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,910
3,500 people were killed.

122
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,830
Oh my god.

123
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,730
What about

124
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,390
Drillmaster Hirata?

125
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,200
That's why I said

126
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,440
you leaving at this moment

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,510

I have something for you.

131
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay.

132
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,400

Hey, I heard from Renjun that

138
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,910
you were planning to stay

139
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,510
in Tokyo for a while longer. Is that true?

140
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

141
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,630
Why don't you leave with us?

142
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,030
That way, we would come and leave together.

143
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,000
We have to find a way out, don't we?

144
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,350
How can I compare to you?

145
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,510
Right. I'll go back and test
the waters first.

146
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,550
If I have a way out,

147
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,390
I'm sure you'll have one too.

148
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,510
They have brought my mother

149
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,970
from Jingzhou to Beijing,

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,870
to a house

151
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,000
in Guangmingdian Alley.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,080
It's also an old house of our ancestors.

153
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,670
Kaizhi,

154
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,850
just wait for my good news.

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:02,870

156
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,280
What is this about?

157
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,870
You're even packing them yourself.

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
These are all for you.

159
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll arrange for someone

160
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,160
to ship them for you along with the boat.

161
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,250
You're too kind.

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,840
Giving a man a fishing net

163
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,210
is better than giving him a fresh fish.

164
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,650
This saying is not mine.

165
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,460
Your ancestors said it.

166
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
For the past three years,

167
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,870
Duke,

168
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,160
you've been encouraging and
guiding me all the time.

169
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,890
Liang Xiang.

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
Let me put it this way.

171
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,360
Before you,

172
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,510
there had never been

173
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,170
a Qing Dynasty's royal family

174
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,960
that was so close to

175
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,570
our Japanese royal family.

176
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:51,870
Actually,

177
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,080
our two countries

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,200
have had very similar experiences.

179
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,320
It's just that Japan took a step
forward first.

180
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,320
And I have the responsibility

181
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,790
to convey our experiences

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,150
to you.

183
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,630
In the past year or two,

184
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
your officials

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,120
have frequently visited Japan,

186
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,080
trying to learn from us.

187
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,960
But what can you really see

188
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,540
with such cursory visits?

189
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,700
It's nothing more than

190
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,320
the Emperor eating beef,

191
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,870
officials wearing tailcoats,

192
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,190
and the whole country embracing
Western customs:

193
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,000
eating Western food, wearing Western clothes,
speaking English,

194
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,760
parting their hair,

195
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,260
dancing ballroom,

196
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,930
marrying Westerners,

197
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,390
Western suits and Japanese Kimonos coexisting,

198
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,270
bars and tea houses coexisting,

199
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,270
and Western operas

200
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,930
and Japanese Ukiyo-e competing
for attention.

201
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
No, no, no.

202
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,980
None of them are the fundamentals
of today's Japan.

203
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,750
In comparison,

204
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,600
you know us

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
better than they do.

206
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,450
We've lived together

207
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,810
for almost three years.

208
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,840
Right.

209
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,080
If a person does not have the opportunity

210
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,720
to view their

211
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,630
ever-thriving country,

212
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,320
land, and civilization

213
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,210
from beyond national borders,

214
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,790
then they will never be able

215
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,840
to have a more precise perspective

216
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,150
on the world and life.

217
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,510
You want me

218
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,890
to see my own country in a new light?

219
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,270
You really understood me.

220
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,150
You want me to see the crux of
my country's problems,

221
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,630
and then

222
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,940
revitalize it.

223
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,000
For a young man

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
with a second lieutenant rank,

225
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,870
isn't this a bit too grand?

226
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,670
What you're bringing back to China

227
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,150
is not just a diploma,

228
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,030
but also this.

229
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,960
In the future, if China falls into chaos,

230
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,440
I hope you can

231
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,860
remember Japan's nurturing

232
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,110
of you today.

233
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
Can you take a detour

234
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,190
from that street on the left?

235
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,050
You mean this street?

236
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:12,930
Yes.

237
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,030
No need to stop.

238
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,090
Let's just have a little ride around.

239
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,450
Sausages, 110 catties.

240
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,980
Beef jerky,

241
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,050
114 catties.

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,270
Stop the carriage. Pull over.

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,160
Let's go! Quick!

244
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,760
Get lost, you bastard!

245
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,690
Go away!

246
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,550
Get lost!

247
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,030
Get lost!

248
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,030
Bastard!

249
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,640
[November 27, 30th year of the Guangxu reign (January 2, 1905)]

250
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,470
[Russian army occupying Lüshun, China, surrendered,
and the Japanese army captured Lüshun, China.]

251
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,790
You look handsome, Kaizhi.

252
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,530
This Japanese military uniform

253
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,970
feels really awkward to wear.

254
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,030
Many people here in Tokyo

255
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,720
think I just came back from the front line.

256
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,080
You know, at a time like this,

257
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,670
why should we get involved in this mess?

258
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,270
That's right. We shouldn't.

259
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,750
It's dog-eat-dog.

260
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,790
Some people naively believe

261
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,360
that Japan's victory over Russia

262
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,240
was a triumph of constitutional monarchy

263
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,370
over dictatorship.

264
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,630
Ridiculous. How ridiculous.

265
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,160
Make yourself at home.

266
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,970
Shuhong!

267
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,930
Kaizhi is here. Pour some tea.

268
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,230
What's your take on this, Mr. Wu?

269
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,630
News from China reports that

270
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,030
Yuan Shikai and others have suggested that

271
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,840
the court learn from Japan and

272
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,520
implement a constitutional government.

273
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,640
You want to know

274
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,530
my take on this?

275
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,510
Yes.

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,360
Listen, Yang Kaizhi.

277
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,130
Let those idiots waste their time.

278
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,260
Let's see who'll have the last laugh.

279
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,600
They think there will be no revolution after
the constitution is established?

280
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Nonsense!

281
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,780
If we don't establish a constitution,
we will overthrow it.

282
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,360
If we establish a constitution,

283
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,750
we will still overthrow it.

284
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,360
Not to mention constitutional monarchy.

285
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,790
Mr. Wu, your theories have always been

286
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,520
so straightforward and clear.

287
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,960
I'm different from your cousin.

288
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,120
He likes to throw around

289
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,840
a bunch of terms like

290
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,790
people's livelihood, democracy,

291
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,030
civil rights, republic, and constitution.

292
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,910
To me, it's simple.

293
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,310
I always cut to the chase.

294
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,220
Shuhong, don't bother.

295
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,650
Sit down and let's talk.

296
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,600
Don't mind her.

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,080
Mr. Wu.

298
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,200
Don't you treat Shuhong

299
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,170
like a servant.

300
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,600
She's my relative.

301
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,609
Mr. Wu.

302
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,819
The relationship between you two

303
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,550
has always been quite strange.

304
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,510
I was already curious back when
we were on the cruise.

305
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,440
Yang Kaizhi, don't change the subject.

306
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,240
Let me ask you.

307
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,950
Do you have the blueprint for
going back to China?

308
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,750
Blueprint?

309
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,240
You cadets,

310
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,590
with both new knowledge and old learning,

311
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,830
in terms of theory, morality,

312
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,490
significance, and function,

313
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,440
are unparalleled

314
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,510
in history.

315
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,610
You must bear the great responsibility of

316
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,510
overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and
establishing a republic.

317
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,350
Mr. Wu.

318
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,270
I know.

319
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,680
I know what you mean.

320
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,090
I have

321
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,650
that blueprint all along.

322
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,920
When I started training as a cadet,

323
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
my cousin secretly assigned me

324
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,790
a mission,

325
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,160
which is to keep a close eye on

326
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,790
a noble from the imperial clan, Liang Xiang.

327
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,790
Wherever he went,

328
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,890
I would follow him,

329
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,440
so I could penetrate the core circle.

This wardrobe is very precious.

336
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,720
Watch the steps.

337
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,610

how great Tokyo is.

it's nothing special.

365

couldn't get it in.

380
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,280
He's almost here,

381
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,270
and the bedroom is not ready yet. This is...

382
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,400
Why are you

383
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,790
so clueless?

384
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,020
If you can't move it in as a whole,
just take it apart.

385
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,940
You can reassemble it once
you get it in, right?

386
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,730
But it's made of yellow rosewood.

387
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,550
It's very expensive.

388
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,550
It's really valuable.

389
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,270
Valuable?

390
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,270
Do you think Six

391
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,070
would give you valuable things?

392
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,570
Go ahead and take it apart.

393
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,790
Just be careful.

394
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
Don't use too much force.

395
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,300
Okay, I'll listen to you, Mother.

396
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,330
Mother.

397
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,760
Dear Mother.

398
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,180
The kitchen is asking

399
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,720
whether the wild duck sentby
the Fifth Prince

400
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,690
[Rong Ge, member of Jingzhou Banner Battalion]

401
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,320
should be stewed or roasted in sauce?

402
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,880
The hard-as-hell duck

403
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,310
was shot down with a homemade rifle.

404
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,070
Every bite will be full of metal pellets.

405
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,980
What was the Fifth Prince thinking?

406
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,680
Why on earth would he give a wild duck

407
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
as a gift of all things?

408
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,310
And we still have to owe him a favor
for this.

409
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,270
Tell the kitchen

410
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,110
not to bring it to the table.

411
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,400
What if the cooked duck

412
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,880
flew away?

413
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,440
Go take care of it.

414
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,240
Yes, I'll listen to you, Mother.

415
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,680
Even if the cooked duck flew away,

416
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,880
Liang Xiang wouldn't dare deny

417
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,340
his marriage arrangement with you, Duo Mei.

418
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,070
They're here!

419
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,710
Here comes the carriage!

420
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,970
They've already arrived at
the alley entrance!

421
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,240
Sir, you're back.

422
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,750
Honored Mother.

423
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,920
Your son, Liang Xiang, has returned from Japan.

424
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,320
Please accept my kowtow.

425
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,360
Alright, rise, Son.

426
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:24,510
Yes, Mother.

427
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,430
If your father were still alive,

428
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,030
how wonderful that would be.

429
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,550
Son.

430
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,030
Look who this is.

431
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,170
Greetings, Brother Liang Xiang. I'm Duo Mei.

432
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,640
Duo Mei?

433
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,830
Who is Duo Mei?

434
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,100
Son, have you forgotten?

435
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,240
That year,

436
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,440
I got drunk

437
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,410
at the Governor of Jingzhou's place.

438
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,340
You went there and carried me back.

439
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,210
You met each other at that time.

440
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,080
Now I remember a little.

441
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,270
Right.

442
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,160
It's been four years.

443
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,110
You also live in Beijing now?

444
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,090
My father was transferred to Wanping.

445
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,960
I...

446
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,680
I...

447
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,960
Duo Mei has been my goddaughter

448
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
for three years.

449
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
In Jingzhou,

450
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,790
she's the only one who's been
keeping me company.

451
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,680
Now,

452
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,400
I've arranged

453
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,060
the marriage between you two.

454
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,290
You two should get along well.

455
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,870
But Mother...

456
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,960
But what?

457
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,790
Don't tell me that in Japan,

458
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,200
you've already...

459
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,680
No, Mother.

460
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,260
When I was in Shanghai,

461
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,660
Lord Zaizhen told me that

462
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,590
Prince Qing had already arranged talks

463
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,680
for me to marry the daughter of Fuca,

464
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,550
the Minister of the Imperial Guards.

465
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,010
I've given much thought to

466
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,430
Prince Qing's goodwill,

467
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,830
but I fear

468
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,720
it may be difficult to decline.

469
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
What's so great about him, Prince Qing,

470
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
that he thinks he can arrange

471
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,960
a marriage for my son?

472
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,400
If it were 200 years ago,

473
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,830
none of today's princes

474
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,440
would be able to compare to your ancestors.

475
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,310
But Mother,

476
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,160
you should try to put yourself in my shoes.

477
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,460
I just studied abroad for four years,

478
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,790
and I haven't achieved anything yet.

479
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,830
I've just come back,

480
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,310
and I'm going to marry two women?

481
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,070
This... This...

482
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,270
This is too...

483
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,550
Find a way to decline the marriage

484
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,480
arrangement with the Fuca family.

485
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,790
If you can't decline it,

486
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,640
then marry both of them.

487
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,860
Our house is big enough anyway.

488
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,860
They can both fit.

489
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,920
Duo Mei, let's go.

490
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,330
Let's go check on

491
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,200
the house

492
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
prepared for your dear Liang Xiang.

493
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,070
Long time no see, Liang Xiang.

494
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,800
Liang Xiang!

495
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,210
Luo Ge, Rong Ge.

496
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,370
Why are you two here?

497
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,310
You are also in Beijing?

498
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,720
Yes.

499
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,550
Luo Ge and I

500
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,920
got assigned to the Jianrui Battalion
here in Beijing

501
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,680
as reinforcements the year after
you went to Japan.

502
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,550
Really?

503
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,400
This is great.

504
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,830
With you two childhood friends here,

505
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,830
I won’t be lonely.

506
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Who's in charge of your Jianrui Battalion?

507
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,110
Prince Chun is in charge.

508
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,130
Prince Chun?

509
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,550
Yes.

510
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,060
[Armory of the Jianrui Battalion
of the Imperial Guards]

511
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
Is this new?

512
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,490
Yes, it's new, Your Highness.

513
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,290
Who brought it here?

514
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,640
It was recently purchased from Germany

515
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,900
by Yuan Shikai, the Minister of Beiyang.

516
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,130
[Aisin Gioro Zaifeng, Prince Chun and
fifth brother of the Guangxu Emperor]

517
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,680
I heard that there are ten of them in total.

518
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,440
When Prince Qing inspected the new army,

519
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,020
he gave this to Prince Qing as a gift.

520
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,160
Prince Qing brought it back to Beijing

521
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,400
and asked us to help maintain it.

522
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,130
It's not on the weapon list yet.

523
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,240
Yuan Shikai bought ten in total.

524
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,070
He kept

525
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,160
nine for himself,

526
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,070
and left one here

527
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,310
to show off.

528
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,480
Right. No one knows how to use it.

529
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,110
Then return it.

530
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,550
This is not

531
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,210
the Yuan family's warehouse.

532
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,410
Your Highness.

533
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,480
This is Maxim heavy machine gun.

534
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,550
Even in the West,

535
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,920
this weapon is extremely rare.

536
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,550
Its firepower is incredibly strong,

537
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,680
capable of continuous firing

538
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,920
in a 180-degree arc.

539
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,320
Its firing speed

540
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,790
is equivalent to

541
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,520
that of 100 Mannlicher rifles.

542
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,400
If mounted on a carriage,

543
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,030
its mobile firepower

544
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,890
is practically

545
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,780
an unstoppable moving fortress.

546
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,070
You are?

547
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm Liang Xiang.

548
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,560
Greetings, Prince Chun.

549
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:32,920
So it's you.

550
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,240
Yes, it's me.

551
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
I was just talking about you

552
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,960
with Zaixun and Zaitao a few days ago.

553
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,200
And here you are.

554
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,310
All these years,

555
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,510
I've also missed

556
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,030
your teachings back in Shanghai,
Your Highness.

557
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,070
How's everything?

558
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,470
How is your mother doing?

559
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,670
Is that house comfortable to live in?

560
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,000
Yes. All is well.

561
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,720
It's just

562
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,550
I don't know

563
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,880
what kind of job the court

564
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,280
is going to assign me yet.

565
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,370
If I could be assigned to Your
Highness's command...

566
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,690
Liang Xiang.

567
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,960
There seems to be something new

568
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,550
in the Russo-Japanese War.

569
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,510
Did you hear anything interesting

570
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,050
in Tokyo?

571
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,090
Many people have been asking me this
these past few days.

572
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,590
Who else?

573
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,490
Last night,

574
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,310
the Governor of Hunan, Duanfang,

575
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,400
specifically summoned me to his
official residence in Beijing.

576
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,000
He asked me

577
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,310
why Japan,

578
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,640
a constitutional monarchy,

579
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,400
defeated Tsarist Russia,
an autocratic monarchy.

580
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,330
That's not something unexpected.

581
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,160
Duanfang

582
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:45,110
is currently petitioning the Empress Dowager
with Yuan Shikai,

583
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,590
suggesting that the court follow
Japan's example

584
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,390
in formulating a reform outline

585
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,280
and establishing a
constitutional government.

586
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,910
No wonder.

587
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:57,800
Liang Xiang.

588
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,390
You study military affairs.

589
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,690
Don't get involved with them.

590
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,200
Can you understand

591
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,360
constitutional issues?

592
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,480
In my opinion,

593
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,510
you and I are both like

594
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,440
frogs in a well.

595
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,480
We don't understand those things.

596
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,480
Since we don't understand,

597
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,220
we shouldn't get involved.

598
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,200
Yes.

599
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,240
Your Highness.

600
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,200
His Highness wouldn't say a word

601
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,460
about my appointment.

602
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,330
It's really baffling.

603
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,000
Obviously,

604
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,850
Zaifeng isn't in charge of your affairs.

605
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,750
But,

606
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,440
back in Shanghai, he...

607
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,000
Wake up.

608
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Who doesn't know how to talk big?

609
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
Think about it.

610
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,550
How awkward

611
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,580
Zaifeng's current situation is.

612
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
His older brother

613
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,920
has become nothing more

614
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,430
than a puppet emperor.

615
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,070
Everything has to go through
the Empress Dowager.

616
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,000
In my opinion,

617
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,280
it would be better if he didn't
have this brother.

618
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,970
But I'm not asking for much.

619
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,310
I can start

620
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,720
as a squad leader in the Jianrui Battalion

621
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,920
and try leading the troops first.

622
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,240
You little fool.

623
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,550
He's no longer

624
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,610
the Prince Chun he was four years ago.

625
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,590
Even a woman like me can see that.

626
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,310
What do you see?

627
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,090
When Zaifeng came back from Germany,

628
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,110
do you know

629
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,270
what the first thing

630
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,090
the Empress Dowager did for him was?

631
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:34,750
What was it?

632
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,790
She arranged a marriage for him.

633
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,590
Just like me?

634
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,750
That was a completely different situation.

635
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,440
I heard from your aunt that

636
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,510
Zaifeng already had a girl

637
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,680
he likes.

638
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,070
The two families had even issued the
red betrothal contracts.

639
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,030
However, the Empress Dowager
arranged for him

640
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,880
to marry Rong Lu's daughter.

641
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,440
Rong Lu's daughter?

642
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,270
Exactly.

643
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
You know, Rong Lu is no ordinary man.

644
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,400
He's been in charge of all the troops
of the Qing dynasty.

645
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,790
The military officials in today's court are

646
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,050
all his disciples and favored students.

647
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,000
Look.

648
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,850
The Supreme Prince ended up marrying

649
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,680
such a high-profile woman.

650
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,060
Think about it.

651
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,280
Jianqiu.

652
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,680
I kind of understand now.

653
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,350
No wonder.

654
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,480
I was wondering

655
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,600
why his mood shifted all of a sudden.

656
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,350
It turns out the favor was too great,

657
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,550
and it scared him.

658
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,400
Mother.

659
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,070
This marriage

660
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,730
might have really scared him.

661
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:40,980
Isn't this like

662
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,920
pushing him

663
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,580
into his brother's position?

664
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,790
So he might really...

665
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,990
Don't go any further.

666
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,840
Be careful with your words.

667
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
As long as you understand what it is.

668
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,450
He's actually quite pitiful.

669
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,140
In that case,

670
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,450
I really need to find a way to

671
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,860
decline the marriage Prince Qing tried
to arrange for me.

672
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,510
I don't want to be like Zaifeng,

673
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,640
firmly leashed

674
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,790
by that marriage,

675
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,790
making him unable

676
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,030
and dare not do anything.

677
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,830
Therefore,

678
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,790
Son,

679
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,770
when it comes to marriage,

680
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,550
you should find someone
you can build a life with.

681
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,990
If you marry some fool,

682
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
how am I supposed to get along with her?

683
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,070
I've lived all my life

684
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,470
in the Banner Battalion,

685
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,210
with a bunch of simple people.

686
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,680
They all have simple thoughts

687
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,940
and live a simple life.

688
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,030
Just like our ancestors,

689
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,130
we all stand on our own two feet.

690
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,960
You're right.

691
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,030
We should live by our own abilities.

692
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,040
Don't be discouraged, Tufang.

693
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,260
I didn't expect

694
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,330
Father to only give you

695
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,920
the honorary title as an officer in
the Military Education Department

696
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,070
of the Bureau of Military Training.

697
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,510
Does Prince Qing

698
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,270
dislike me like this?

699
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,640
I didn't think so when you had your cap on.

700
00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:00,350
[Aisin Gioro Zaizheng, the son of
the Chief Grand Council Minister, Prince Qing, Yi Kuang]

701
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,730
But when you took off your cap,

702
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,960
I heard Father coughing.

703
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,400
He coughed?

704
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:05,060
Outsiders might not pay attention,

705
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,250
but as his son, I knew

706
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,260
he probably didn't like it.

707
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,680
Could it be

708
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,300
he only like those with a braid?

709
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Also,

710
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,480
you

711
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,300
shouldn't have declined that marriage.

712
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,640
Father places great importance on it.

713
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,550
But my mother

714
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,350
has already arranged a marriage for me.

715
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,270
As her son,

716
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,000
even if I'm full of words...

717
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,400
Not to be judgmental, but

718
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
a hero has to pass the test of beauty.

719
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,700
Just marry whoever he arranged for you.

720
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,310
Even if she's blind or lame,

721
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,440
it doesn't matter.

722
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,540
Just look the other way, and
you'll be able to get by.

723
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,590
If I had known this,

724
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,350
I should have gone to join Yuan Shikai.

725
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,550
He's still holding the
Eighth Battalion Commander

726
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,590
position for me.

727
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,640
It's really generous of Yuan Shikai.

728
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,770
So why didn't you go?

729
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,350
Would your father be okay with it?

730
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,580
You're mistaken.

731
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,970
Father and Yuan Shikai are really close.

732
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,760
Many people have accused him,

733
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,960
and it was only with Father's strong support

734
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,640
that Yuan remained unshaken.

735
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,630
I see.

736
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,040
Take your time to learn.

737
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,449
The court isn't like Japan.

738
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,340
Danger lurks everywhere,
even in the gutters.

739
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,630
See you then.

740
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,400
Tufang.

741
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,130
Tomorrow morning,

742
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,840
go straight to

743
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,699
the Bureau of Military Training
to report for duty.

744
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,300
[Premier's Bureau of Military Training]

745
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,750
[Military Education Department, Bureau of Military Training]

746
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,740
New officer of the Military Education Department,
Liang Xiang,

747
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,870
reporting for duty.

748
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,760
Good.

749
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,990
You must have studied abroad, young man.

750
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,920
Please have a seat.

751
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,410
Pardon us.

752
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,950
This is truly disrespectful,

753
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,030
but there's only one chair here.

754
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,840
Look.

755
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,260
Do you want to take this...

756
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,750
No, no need.

757
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,630
Please sit.

758
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,540
Please sit.

759
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,020
Apologies for our poor hospitality.

760
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,490
In our Military Education Department of
the Bureau of Military Training,

761
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,630
there's one Chief Delegate

762
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,880
and seven Deputy Delegates.

763
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,880
The rest six

764
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,070
work in these three Archives Rooms.

765
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
This is the biggest room.

766
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
The other two rooms

767
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,550
are piled up with archives from
all over the country.

768
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,350
And you are...

769
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:49,230
[Li Shousheng, Deputy Delegate,
Military Education Department, Bureau of Military Training]

770
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,580
Deputy Delegate,

771
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,070
Li Shousheng.

772
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,610
You can call me Shousheng.

773
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,340
Then I...

774
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,880
Look.

775
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,980
Officer Liang.

776
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,540
Get familiar with the archives first, will you?

777
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:35,430
[Shanghai]

778
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,360
It's just a meal.

779
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,490
Why are you making such a fuss about it?

780
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:04,440
Ding.

781
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,440
You guys

782
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,920
go straight to the kitchen.

783
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,400
If you need anything,

784
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,710
just tell Mrs. Song.

785
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,360
Okay. Got it.

786
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,320
Thank you.

787
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,840
Come on.

788
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Unload the stuff.

789
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,280
How could you say something like that?

790
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
Do you think Ding from the Yu Mansion

791
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,860
is easy to hire?

792
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,360
People would even queue up to hire him.

793
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:29,710
No matter how hard it is to hire him,

794
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,110
he's still just a cook.

795
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,670
Do you think we can manage
without a good cook?

796
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,840
You know Eunuch Zhang.

797
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,770
He may look thin,

798
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,460
but he's got "thick" lips.

799
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,440
What delicacies

800
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,370
hasn't he tried?

801
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,240
The dishes our cook can make

802
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,630
can't even hold a candle

803
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,690
to those of Ding's.

804
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,320
You have to satisfy Eunuch Zhang's appetite,

805
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,840
right?

806
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,550
Only when he's satisfied

807
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,420
will he transfer the money the imperial palace

808
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,620
owes us into the Imperial Bank of China.

809
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,360
I'm doing this for your sake,

810
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,530
and you don't even appreciate it.

811
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,650
I'm so mad at you.

812
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,440
Master.

813
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,550
I'm back!

814
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,730
Little rebel.

815
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,920
You're back.

816
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,190
Let me see.

817
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,810
You look really decent.

818
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,150
Please allow me

819
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,190
to quote a line from Homer's Epic Poems:

820
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,390
"Now that we're back,

821
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,630
the world will no longer be the same."

822
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,410
You're even reciting Homer's Epic Poems now.

823
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,280
Back then, you came to extort money

824
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,320
from me with

825
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,850
Tang Caichang's worthless tickets.

826
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,630
Now, you've only studied in the Tokyo Military School
for a few days,

827
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,510
and you're already reciting
Homer's Epic Poems.

828
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,290
Look at you.

829
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,650
Have a seat. Come on.

830
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,560
Let me see

831
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,310
how you are different from before.

832
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:57,870
Please.

833
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,920
Such a handsome rebel.

834
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,590
Those who don't know your background

835
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,190
really won't be able to tell.

836
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,370
But you still have that look in your eyes.

837
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,960
Don't they look very wise

838
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:10,840
and capable,

839
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,180
like they can see through everything?

840
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,830
Nonsense.

841
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,070
Sneaky.

842
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,370
Still looking restless.

843
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,110
When you came

844
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,440
to extort money from me,

845
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,420
you got that look in your eyes.

846
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,320
The moment I saw you,

847
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,930
I knew you were someone special.
