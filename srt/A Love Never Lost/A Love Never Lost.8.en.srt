[A Love Never Lost]

00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,890
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,970
He doesn't want to draw?

4
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,400
How can you be so straightforward?

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,759
You'll

6
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,310
scare the old man away.

7
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,640
When it comes to such a scary deal,

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
you will scare even the donkey away

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,170
when you tell them about it.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
You should know what to do

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,280
and treat him with kindness.

12
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,070
How could I reason with him?

13
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,470
Not to mention kindness.

14
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,880
You should have argued the case for revolution

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,810
and expressed the grief of people.

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,620
Where did my digest go?

17
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,060
What digest?

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,500
It's Brother Zou Rong's new work.

19
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,230
Oh yes.

20
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,110
It's here.

21
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,260
I'll read a paragraph to you.

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Listen to this. Just one paragraph.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,000
We should sweep away

24
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,870
thousands of years of authoritarianism,

25
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,290
shed away

26
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,070
thousands of years of slavery,

27
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,310
and wash away

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,750
the shame of

29
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,600
260 years of cruelty and abuse.

30
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:56,020
Let's purify mainland China,

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,800
where the Emperor's descendants can continue to live on prosperously.

32
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,360
Some may have resurrected

33
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,570
and returned to their senses.

34
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,850
They got out of the 18 layers of hell,

35
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,420
ascended to the 33 levels of heaven

36
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,530
and are full of zeal and vigor.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,630
They think they are the best and most unique.

38
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,870
A purpose of greatness and excellence

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,190
lies in

40
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,840
the revolution.

41
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,079
The revolution

42
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,000
is lofty.

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,610
The revolution is exuberant.

44
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,880
Where are you?

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,900
I got you some water to wash your feet.

46
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,310
Look at you.

47
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,750
I am trying to teach you.

48
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,120
Do you really think that

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,430
everyone could listen to what you have to say?

50
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,620
He can’t possibly understand if you never say anything.

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,130
What do you have to say that he doesn't know about?

52
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,079
He's 73 years old.

53
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,150
He drew 9 cranes

54
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,800
for Empress Cixi.

55
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,480
What is it that he hasn't seen?

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:49,960
I have something else.

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,620
I'll give you a new paragraph.

58
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,960
Mr. Wu?

59
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,240
I'm your neighbor.

60
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,870
I brought some boiled meat

61
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,680
for Miss Shuhong.

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,550
You should try some too.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,130
Thank you, Madam Liang.

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,350
For these,

65
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,960
you need to cut them up into thin slices and dip it in soy sauce.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,220
If you can't finish it,

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,870
it's still really delicious with rice.

68
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,570
I will get going.

69
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,529
Let me see you off.

70
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,649
No need. Go back.

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,180
What a delicacy.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,670
Let's slice two pieces and give it a try.

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,810
Come in.

74
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,650
You are so well-dressed.

75
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,740
Where's your mother?

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,140
She went to the clinic to see a doctor.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
This is your family's plate.

78
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,310
Your mother's boiled meat

79
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,160
is delicious.

80
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
What are you holding?

81
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,110
You want to see it?

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,930
Then, hold it for me.

83
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,980
Put it on the floor.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,480
Pull.

85
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,320
A Chinese painting?

86
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,600
Cai Guangqi's Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
It's really nice.

88
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,600
My guardian will definitely love it.

89
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,800
Guardian?

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where can I buy a painting like this?

91
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,909
It's too expensive.

92
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,770
You don't have to spend the money.

93
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,070
Pass it to me.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,720
Hold this end.

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
Pull it tight.

96
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,360
Why are you

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,490
so dressed up today?

98
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,040
Today is my big day.

99
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,310
I just said goodbye to the Inukai Regiment

100
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,310
and ended six months of enlistment.

101
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,040
Really?

102
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,370
Should I congratulate you?

103
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,790
Wouldn't you feel awkward

104
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,550
congratulating a member of the imperial clan?

105
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,310
Awkward?

106
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,860
What's so awkward about it?

107
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,480
If I'm not mistaken,

108
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,390
Mr. Wu

109
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,720
seems to be

110
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,550
a political refugee from Tokyo.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,780
You have a good eye.

112
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,380
Do I need a good eye to tell?

113
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,040
I don't think

114
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,360
he's all that profound.

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,090
He's just an ordinary scholar.

116
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,290
You don't have to be wary of me.

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,360
In Tokyo,

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,670
there are three propositions

119
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,330
for every two Chinese person.

120
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,310
Don't talk to me about the revolution.

121
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,159
To be honest,

122
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,920
I still

123
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,280
don't understand this word.

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,400
Isn't it simple?

125
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,710
To put it bluntly,

126
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,710
a revolution is a change of dynasty.

127
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,150
A change of dynasty?

128
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,920
Yes.

129
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,120
If that's the case,

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,270
the Qing dynasty should not be called the Qing dynasty.

131
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,510
Then what should we call it?

132
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,600
The Ming dynasty?

133
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
You should ask Mr. Wu instead.

134
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,270
He didn't see me, right?

135
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,659
So what if he did?

136
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,530
You're right.

137
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,560
I saw that you guys were being polite

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,159
and even greeted each other.

139
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,120
Well then, what else could we have done instead?

140
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,600
Should we have resorted to arms?

141
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,240
Didn't you come to Japan

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,600
just to study military affairs?

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,380
Aren't military affairs all about resorting to arms?

144
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,180
That's wrong.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
Modern military affairs

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,480
go far beyond physical combat.

147
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,409
The purpose of my studies here

148
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,830
can be summarized into eight words.

149
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,000
To revitalize our national defense, and to save our country.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
Oh my god.

151
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,350
Why are all men like this?

152
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,600
Isn't Mr. Wu also...

153
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,000
Are all of you men

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,830
willing to be

155
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,360
the father of this country?

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,520
In my opinion,

157
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,390
it's still not clear

158
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,190
who is saving who is in this country.

159
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,120
Congratulations again

160
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
on completing your enlistment.

161
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,150
And thank you for your mother's

162
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,080
extremely delicious boiled meat.

163
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,789
[Bamboo]

164
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
Welcome back.

165
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,250
Duke Ayakura

166
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,950
is too kind.

167
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,510
He came to the clinic himself.

168
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,420
I'm kind of embarrassed about it.

169
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,280
Really?

170
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,390
Actually, my sickness

171
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,420
has not acted up even once since I came to Japan.

172
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,030
Look.

173
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,060
I ended up with such a huge pile of medicine.

174
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,670
The girl next door came by?

175
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,580
You mean Mrs. Wu?

176
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,960
Mrs. Wu?

177
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,130
Yes, that Chinese woman next door?

178
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,910
Why does hearing this from you

179
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,870
sound so awkward to me?

180
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,000
Awkward?

181
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,960
What's awkward?

182
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,240
Why haven't I heard that

183
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,960
this girl is

184
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,150
Mr. Wu's wife?

185
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,450
It doesn't seem like it either.

186
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,850
I've been to their house.

187
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,170
They have separate living quarters.

188
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,350
Madam said that

189
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,470
they are teacher and student.

190
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,710
Did you really have to get to the bottom of it,

191
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,350
Mother?

192
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,270
Because I have a son.

193
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,550
I think she's a nice girl.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Of course I have to put more effort into it.

195
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Don't you make this about me.

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,480
Son,

197
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I think

198
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,550
you two

199
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,160
look good together.

200
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,750
Mother.

201
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,180
Let me tell you.

202
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,590
Among the Chinese people in Tokyo,

203
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,250
9 out of 10 of them

204
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,020
lean towards the revolution.

205
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,150
No way.

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,390
Think about it.

207
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,240
How well

208
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,910
has the court governed

209
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,480
the country over the past few years?

210
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,910
If you compare it to the Japanese society,

211
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,910
maybe one day,

212
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,040
even your son will become...

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,860
How can you say such nonsense?

214
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,750
You want a revolution too?

215
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you also not satisfied with the court?

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,600
Are you also not satisfied with your ancestors?

217
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,720
Bullshit!

218
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,210
Listen up, Liang Xiang.

219
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
If I hear you

220
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,270
spewing such nonsense again,

221
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,120
I'll rip your mouth away.

222
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,990
How dare you!

223
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Mother.

224
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,570
I'm just reminding you

225
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,600
not to go around

226
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
looking for your daughter-in-law.

227
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,720
Firstly,

228
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,150
I don't need you to do it.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,670
Secondly,

230
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,080
with your son's ability,

231
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,630
I can easily

232
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,420
find you a daughter-in-law

233
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,110
who can bear many grandchildren for you.

234
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,110
Believe it or not.

235
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,750
That would be best.

236
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Why are you dressed like this today?

237
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,130
The carp has leaped over the dragon's gate,

238
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,790
Mother.

239
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Good boy.

240
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,110
You are indeed my son.

241
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:39,940
[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]

242
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,120
Shoot!

243
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,630
Raise the flag.

244
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,010
Salute!

245
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,270
Our hard days

246
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,440
is finally over!

247
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,370
We don't have to wash dishes,

248
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,630
chop firewood, or feed the pigs anymore!

249
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,120
Later, let's go out

250
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,510
for a drink together!

251
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay!

252
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,970
Don't drink.

253
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,030
Have you forgotten about what happened

254
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
when you drank the last time?

255
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,150
If you don't want to drink, you can just watch.

256
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,120
Kaizhi, let's drink together.

257
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I'll drink with you.

258
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Okay.

259
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Tonight,

260
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,600
let's get drunk.

261
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,240
Okay.

262
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,250
Kaizhi,

263
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,700
why do you look strange in my eyes now?

264
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,410
It's only been a few days since I last saw you.

265
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,740
Turn around. Let me see.

266
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,690
Yes, something feels strange.

267
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,520
What's strange?

268
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,600
Kaizhi,

269
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,050
where is your braid?

270
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,190
The braid?

271
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,780
I cut it.

272
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,360
You cut it?

273
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,770
You're not a rebel, are you?

274
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,790
What?

275
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,550
After we finish our enlistment,

276
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,340
we'll become a part of the foreign faction.

277
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,480
Why should we keep it?

278
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,630
No one will laugh at us anymore.

279
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,760
It's more convenient to sleep as well.

280
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,470
Both of them had also cut their braids.

281
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,450
You guys have cut yours too?

282
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,490
How dare you cut it?

283
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,850
Qianli,

284
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,670
why don’t you

285
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,650
cut your braid too?

286
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,680
No, I won't.

287
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,870
When we return home,

288
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,120
how can we face Mr. Yuan if we had cut it?

289
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
That's easy.

290
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,280
When you head back,

291
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,880
isn't it more convenient to just get a fake one?

292
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,580
You can choose to keep or remove it.

293
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,630
Watch.

294
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,790
You can't even tell whether it's fake or not.

295
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,230
And there's no real or fake...

296
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,850
because all of this is mine.

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Also, it doesn't really matter what's real,

298
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,790
isn't it?

299
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,480
Well,

300
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,910
you two should

301
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,040
cut your braids too.

302
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,270
Cut it if you want.

303
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,910
I won't cut it anyway.

304
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,130
Me neither.

305
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:01,900
You guys!

306
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,760
Attention!

307
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Salute!

308
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,790
Firstly,

309
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,480
congratulations on completing your enlistment training.

310
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,750
Thank you, Drillmaster Hirata

311
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,610
Yang Kaizhi.

312
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,200
You cut your hair.

313
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,820
You look much better,

314
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,750
don't you?

315
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,720
Yes.

316
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
I think so too.

317
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,870
Of course.

318
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,920
The school

319
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,870
respects your cultural norms,

320
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
and also,

321
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,350
your personal choice.

322
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,320
A new phase of studies

323
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,150
is about to start.

324
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm not sure

325
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
if you guys can get used to it.

326
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,400
But there's one thing

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,320
that I can be sure of.

328
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
Your new phase of studies

329
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,080
has nothing to do with

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
the length of your hair.

331
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,870
Dismissed.

332
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,900
Hirata speaks Chinese?

333
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,550
I heard he's a China Hand.

334
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,390
He's also our drillmaster.

335
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,760
I've checked the schedule.

336
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,430
It seems like he teaches horse riding.

337
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,500
Horse riding?

338
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,770
Firstly,

339
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,580
we must understand the horses,

340
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,450
get familiar with the horses,

341
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,200
get close to the horses,

342
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,320
and regard it as a silent comrade.

343
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,970
You should be connected to the horse by blood

344
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,870
and through the heart,

345
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,750
in order to empathize with each other.

346
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,750
You should aspire

347
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
to feel like there's no one on your horse,

348
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
and to feel no horse under your hips.

349
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,960
You should be one with the horse

350
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,080
to be qualified to ride.

351
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,910
Isn't this a sage discussing

352
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,360
the Three-Character Classic?

353
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,690
His horse riding skills

354
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,240
is not even as good as you.

355
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,110
Get on the horse.

356
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,270
Kaizhi!

357
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,890
Cadet Yang Kaizhi.

358
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,420
You have done it.

359
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,359
You have no one on your horse

360
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,440
and no horse under your hips.

361
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,070
Medics!

362
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,550
There's an injured personnel over there.

363
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,830
The horse is injured too.

364
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,300
Check its front legs

365
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,040
and take it back to the stable.

366
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,630
Yes.

367
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,040
No one else is as unlucky as you.

368
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,750
Don't touch it. It hurts.

369
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,200
It's the first time you got on a horse,

370
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
and yet you managed to injure both the horse and yourself.

371
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,640
They said you broke the school record

372
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,550
for injuring both

373
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,440
the horse and yourself

374
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,680
in the shortest time.

375
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,310
I've never rode a horse before.

376
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:21,830
Even so,

377
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,660
you should know how to hold the rein, right?

378
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,120
You were trying to climb up without the rein.

379
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,550
You're a disgrace to

380
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,550
the Qing dynasty.

381
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,270
Here.

382
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,720
Tufang,

383
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,350
what are you doing?

384
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,920
Try this method of treatment from our Banner Battalion.

385
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,720
The school infirmary gave me a prescription though.

386
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,650
That's useless.

387
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,030
This method of mine

388
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,460
can allow you to walk freely by tomorrow morning

389
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,120
and be completely healed in three days.

390
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,990
Really?

391
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,310
Lift your leg.

392
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,910
Be gentle. That hurts!

393
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,830
Stop talking.

394
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,110
The secret recipe of our Battalion

395
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,160
has been passed down for over 200 years.

396
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,640
That's how

397
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,880
the leg injuries of the old Taikhan Nurhachi

398
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,030
were treated.

399
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,770
Let's not mention what it can do

400
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,430
for your tender arms and legs.

401
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,510
I need to apply the herbs

402
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,910
directly onto your legs.

403
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,490
It's mixed with some wine, so it will feel a little cold.

404
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,550
Don't! That hurts.

405
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,490
That hurts!

406
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,440
It hurts!

407
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,480
It hurts!

408
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Hang in there.

409
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,950
Kaizhi.

410
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,720
Lie down and close your eyes.

411
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,580
Don't worry about anything else.

412
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,010
Slowly.

413
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,760
Don't...

414
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,370
That hurts!

415
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,660
Renjun.

416
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,740
Hold him down. Don't let him move.

417
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,030
No, no, you don't have to.

418
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,720
No, don't!

419
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,480
You guys help me lift up his leg.

420
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Just close your eyes.

421
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,960
You...

422
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,880
Shut up.

423
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,920
It's cold!

424
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,720
Don't scream.

425
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,150
Don't scream.

426
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,780
Does it still hurt?

427
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,200
It doesn't hurt,

428
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,040
but it's just a little scary.

429
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,680
Look at you.

430
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,920
Treating the horse after treating the man.

431
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,710
To be honest,

432
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,380
you are really a loyal man.

433
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,300
That's all?

434
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
There's still one more ritual to go.

435
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,680
We have to pray to the God of Horse.

436
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,680
Pray?

437
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Is this another secret recipe

438
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
from your Banner Battalion?

439
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,660
The heavenly master of the steed,

440
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,000
please tame and restrain

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
these fierce horses,

442
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,780
dispel any calamity,

443
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,840
and remove any misfortune.

444
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,310
Make them like to graze and drink water.

445
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
May they carry people

446
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,650
on their own without being guided.

447
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,480
May they get out

448
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,570
of the stable without being urged.

449
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,350
Let their noses

450
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,710
be able to smell fragrances.

451
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,270
Let their ears

452
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,550
be able to hear songs.

453
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,200
Let their eyes

454
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,070
be as bright as the sky.

455
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,390
Let the head be the balance of the body,

456
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,680
the spine

457
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,660
be the core of the body,

458
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,110
and the legs be the support of the body.

459
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,320
Let the tail repel mosquitoes.

460
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,110
Let the abdomen

461
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,770
become a treasure bag of grass and herbs.

462
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Let them travel a thousand miles

463
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,610
and gallop freely.

464
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,830
What are you two doing?

465
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,410
How did the horse recover?

466
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,490
How did you recover too?

467
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,840
You're not in pain anymore? You can get out of bed?

468
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,510
I can walk now,

469
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,240
but it still hurts a little.

470
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,500
Don't be too greedy.

471
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,440
You should have

472
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,130
waited until tomorrow morning to get out of bed.

473
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,430
Am I seeing incorrectly?

474
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,550
Yang Kaizhi?

475
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,830
It’s me, drillmaster.

476
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,640
I thought you were still in the infirmary.

477
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,170
No,

478
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,420
I'm here.

479
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,720
That's strange.

480
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,220
The horse has recovered too?

481
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,000
Yes.

482
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,350
There's a man on the horse and a horse under the crotch.

483
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,380
I heard

484
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,480
you cast a spell.

485
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,720
Amazing, Liang Xiang.

486
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,680
Drillmaster,

487
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,070
it's not a spell.

488
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,900
It's the miracle of my ancestors.

489
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,850
Your ancestors

490
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,570
were indeed miraculous.

491
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,830
But what about now?

492
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,510
Tufang,

493
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,290
don't be too sad.

494
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,140
I'm the one that got you into trouble.

495
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,440
I didn't expect Drillmaster Hirata

496
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,680
would do such a thing.

497
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,790
How can I not be sad?

498
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,820
He's straightforward

499
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,580
and honest.

500
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,110
Look at the Japanese military academy.

501
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,790
Even the crown prince is no exception.

502
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,390
He also has to struggle on the training fields.

503
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,710
But what about us?

504
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,720
Your Japanese drillmaster

505
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,090
talked about our ancestors like this?

506
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,770
Mother,

507
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,970
is there sense in his words?

508
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,790
It's a bit harsh

509
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,620
when others say it.

510
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
We Manchurians

511
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,320
were really smart at the top

512
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,110
since the times of Khan Nurhaci,

513
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
while the bottom was really stupid.

514
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,830
So,

515
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,930
that's what formed the basis

516
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,090
of the Qing dynasty for over 200 years.

517
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,030
The opera singers also said

518
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,210
the higher-ups were too smart

519
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,270
and refused to pay out.

520
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,870
The lower people were smart too.

521
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,800
They weren't willing to fight,

522
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,360
so it was game over for them.

523
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,920
What about now?

524
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,440
Now, the Qing dynasty

525
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,500
is also smart on both ends.

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,880
How can we be strong?

527
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,530
Son,

528
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:32,640
don't feel wronged.

529
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,550
Just let them scold you.

530
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,670
If you want to rise to the top,

531
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,660
you must be able to lie low.

532
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,730
You must bear hardships with determination.

533
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,960
You need this kind of strength.

534
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,790
Duke Ayakura

535
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,780
invites you and your mother to drink tea with him.

536
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,210
Yes.

537
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,270
Stop right ahead of that shop.

538
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,630
Yes, sir.

539
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,810
[Songyun Hall]

540
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,550
Mother,

541
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,760
I need to buy a gift

542
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,920
for Duke Ayakura.

543
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,960
Go ahead.

544
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,740
Hello, sir.

545
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,720
Hello.

546
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,270
Are you Chinese?

547
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
Yes.

548
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,790
These are

549
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,120
premium products customized from China.

550
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,600
These are the most famous

551
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,890
Huzhou brushes,

552
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,680
Duanzhou inkstones,

553
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,440
Huizhou ink,

554
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,730
and Xuanzhou paper.

555
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,270
Which would you like?

556
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:27,910
This painting is good.

557
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,800
It's just a little small.

558
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,860
Is there a bigger one

559
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,900
that can cover an entire wall?

560
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,210
Of course.

561
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
You can customize it.

562
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,310
It'll be painted according to your requirements.

563
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,440
This is pretty good.

564
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,190
You can add some grapes.

565
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,640
Have them all in blobs.

566
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,030
Blobs?

567
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,920
In my hometown,

568
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,160
wisteria and grapes

569
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,930
are on the same trellises year-round.

570
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,990
The purple flowers and purple grapes

571
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,030
are not only pleasing to the eye,

572
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,890
but also delightful to the heart.

573
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,860
Delightful to the heart.

574
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,320
Why isn't that girl back yet?

575
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,870
She went to get

576
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,200
Mr. Shoushan's landscape painting.

577
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,410
I see.

578
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,400
Please wait a moment.

579
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,360
Please.

580
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,880
It's grapes, right?

581
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Yes.

582
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,940
I see.

583
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,400
Please go over there

584
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,750
and pay some deposit.

585
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:58,380
Okay.

586
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,590
Please.

587
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,510
Thank you.

588
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,750
Let's go.

589
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,250
Mr. Shoushan's landscape painting.

590
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,090
Take a look.

591
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,350
Come here.

592
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,920
The customer just now

593
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,590
wanted a painting even bigger than that one.

594
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,720
Even bigger.

595
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,440
Big?

596
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,350
Yes.

597
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,220
A painting even bigger,

598
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,200
bigger than this one.

599
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,310
How do I say it?

600
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,000
That...

601
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,720
Fruits.

602
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,200
Blobs?

603
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,240
Blobs?

604
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,640
Wait.

605
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,500
Blobs?

606
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,640
This one.

607
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,440
Look at this.

608
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,970
It's this.

609
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,050
A four-meter painting

610
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,190
of grapes and wisteria?

611
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,080
Yes.

612
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,310
Oh my.

613
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,810
A four-meter painting by Cai Guangqi?

614
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,530
It'll cost thousands of yen.

615
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,380
If the price is too low,

616
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,590
he won't paint it.

617
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,450
Yes.

618
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:21,710
Is it the customer

619
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,990
that just left?

620
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,480
Yes.

621
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,030
You have to give me a raise.

622
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,030
I brought you good luck.

623
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,950
You're right.

624
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,350
Here.

625
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,560
Thank you.

626
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,860
Son, the tea is a little bitter.

627
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,790
Madam Liang.

628
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,540
Mother.

629
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,150
She's talking to you.

630
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,200
Your son told me

631
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,200
you can read fortunes with paper cards.

632
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,680
Can you tell my fortune?

633
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,960
Can you tell her fortune?

634
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,830
Yoshiko, don't be rude.

635
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,280
When a land deity of the east

636
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,390
moves to the west,

637
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,720
it stops working.

638
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Why?

639
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,880
She asked why.

640
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,950
After I arrived in Tokyo,

641
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,000
I can no longer connect to the land.

642
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,550
This why different lands

643
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,080
cultivate different gods.

644
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,830
Tell her.

645
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,430
That's right.

646
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,410
Our legation in China

647
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,160
also told me

648
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,830
that after he brought the Sun Goddess to Beijing,

649
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,430
she became less responsive.

650
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,920
So, if China

651
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,140
imitated the Meiji Reform completely,

652
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,680
it would be like moving a land deity to a different place

653
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,670
and probably would not work.

654
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,440
Let's not talk about your politics.

655
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,960
Yes.

656
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,680
Have some tea.

657
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,630
Have some tea.

658
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,610
Have some tea.

659
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,370
Come.

660
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Yes.

661
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,560
Son, this tea is very bitter.

662
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,850
It doesn't taste good.

663
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,160
Take a look at this.

664
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,830
You can't do that.

665
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,310
Son,

666
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,030
we can't take their things.

667
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,070
Mother.

668
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:17,240
Let her finish speaking.

669
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,610
Please.

670
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,480
Yes.

671
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,890
Is this jadeite?

672
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,200
My husband

673
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,030
bought it from an antique shop.

674
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,900
It is said that it was from

675
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,030
the Chinese palace.

676
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,460
Please take a look for me.

677
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,560
This is not from the palace.

678
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,750
It's a commoner item.

679
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,980
Bracelets from the palace

680
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,620
are as beautiful and clear

681
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,880
as the eyes of a beauty.

682
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,490
You get one piece of jade from thousands of stones,

683
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,810
while there's only one jadeite

684
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,210
among thousands of jade.

685
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,680
Son, tell them.

686
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,440
This is just a commoner item.

687
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,070
Bracelets from the palace are like the eyes of a beauty.

688
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,550
They're one in a million.

689
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,000
She probably means

690
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
that this thing isn't good enough to enter the palace.

691
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,360
I see.

692
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,050
I've met an expert this time.

693
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,330
Yes.

694
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,760
Fortunately,

695
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,090
it wasn't from the Chinese palace.

696
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,630
If it were,

697
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,630
it would be awkward with Madam Liang here.

698
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,110
Liang Xiang,

699
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,520
have your mother try the dessert.

700
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,400
I made it myself.

701
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
She hopes you can try it.

702
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,430
This is delicious.

703
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,760
Mother.

704
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,360
Why are you so quiet?

705
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,030
What should I say?

706
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,710
I recognized

707
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,190
that bracelet at a glance.

708
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,580
It was from the palace.

709
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,150
That jadeite

710
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,230
was truly from the palace?

711
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,030
It was lost in the Year of Gengzi.

712
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,800
I could tell at a glance.

713
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,510
It makes sense.

714
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,140
Even a trivial matter can have lasting impacts.

715
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,930
But you said it was fake.

716
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,440
If I said it was real,

717
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,390
how could we

718
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,010
continue to drink tea there?

719
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,950
They say we have the same language and race.

720
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,540
We can't accept it.

721
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,960
We can't accept this language or race

722
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,270
even after 100 years.

723
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
How generous.

724
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,500
Grilled eel, saury,

725
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,420
and sashimi.

726
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,500
Did you find money?

727
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,650
Mr. Kanyama doubled my salary.

728
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,600
Why aren't you eating? Eat.

729
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,080
Pour me some too.

730
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,360
Doubled your salary?

731
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,770
Why are you looking at me like that?

732
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,590
Is your boss

733
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,960
a painter too?

734
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,080
He sold a big painting.

735
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,510
The buyer might be

736
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,580
a member of the Japanese royal family.

737
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,350
Really?

738
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,180
In that case,

739
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,190
you really

740
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,320
found a good boss.

741
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,520
We indeed should drink to it.

742
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,080
You socialize with friends all day long

743
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
to establish a foundation for your great cause,

744
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,680
but

745
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,480
you still have to live

746
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
cent by cent,

747
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,600
don't you think?

748
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,560
It's so spicy.

749
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,150
Thanks to you,

750
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,440
I have good news today too.

751
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,090
It's a 10-yuan banknote from the Imperial Bank of China.

752
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,670
We changed our method.

753
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,440
We found a Japanese technician

754
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,040
to make molds from pictures.

755
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,960
It's exactly the same.

756
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:52,540
[Shanghai]

757
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,800
Da Ren,

758
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,250
you have to understand me.

759
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,200
I am the chairman of the Business Association,

760
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,950
[Imperial Bank of China]

761
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,460
but I'm only a trustee

762
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,560
of the Imperial Bank.

763
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,750
Shorty Sheng has the final say in everything.

764
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,150
He's a tycoon

765
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,880
with wealth and abilities in his hand.

766
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,950
I understand,

767
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,510
but Sheng Xuanhuai has

768
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,800
dozens of responsibilities

769
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,000
and is indeed spread too thin.

770
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,190
Get to the point.

771
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,520
What do you need me to do?

772
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,280
Did you know?

773
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,960
What?

774
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,500
The bank is losing money?

775
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,000
Exactly.

776
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,270
Shorty Sheng didn't tell me.

777
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,400
How could he

778
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,110
tell you about these troubles

779
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
pertaining those noblemen?

780
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
The bank has its regulations.

781
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,630
Regulations

782
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,490
don't matter for official banks.

783
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,370
However, there is

784
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,880
a good solution now.

785
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,440
Japan's

786
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,910
Yokohama Specie Bank is willing to invest.

787
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,190
They've had several rounds of negotiations,

788
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,450
but Sheng Xuanhuai just won't accept it.

789
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,510
When you're free,

790
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,070
tell him not to be like this.

791
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,590
You have to be more flexible at times,

792
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,190
right?

793
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,710
Da Ren,

794
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,380
you can't be flexible with such a big matter.

795
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,190
On this matter,

796
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,590
Sheng Xuanhuai did the right thing.

797
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,970
We are the only

798
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,960
Chinese-invested bank in China.

799
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,400
We can't let the Japanese

800
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,440
get into our business

801
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,710
again.

802
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,620
[Songyun Hall]

803
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,920
Welcome.

804
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,180
I'm Takeshita from the Yokohama Specie Bank.

805
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,600
Where is Mr. Kanyama right now?

806
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,110
Please follow me.

807
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,710
Come in.

808
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:23,980
President,

809
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,360
a gentleman from the Yokohama Specie Bank

810
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,490
is here to visit you.

811
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,070
Are these all authentic?

812
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,840
We never sell fake products.

813
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,810
If a customer said they wanted to buy fake products,

814
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,580
would you sell it?

815
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,740
It depends on

816
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:14,000
how much they offer.

817
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,800
President Kanyama,

818
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,670
what is it?

819
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,920
One of my customers

820
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:59,150
has the same interest as you.

821
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,070
Cut that out.

822
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,350
You just want to raise the price, don't you?

823
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,070
Name the price. As long as it's not too much,

824
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,230
we can agree to it.

825
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,630
This is...

826
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,060
quite risky.

827
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,840
It's not risky for you.

828
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,960
The Japanese law

829
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,880
doesn't punish those

830
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,700
who forge foreign banknotes.
