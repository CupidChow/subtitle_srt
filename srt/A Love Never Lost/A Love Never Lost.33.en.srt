[Episode 33]

3
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:51,150
Great! Great!

4
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,479
Alright.

5
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Today isn't

6
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,280
about me talking

7
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,759
and everyone else listening.

8
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,289
I want to hear from you guys.

9
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,920
Hey, you,

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,950
rearrange the seating.

11
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,730
Let's make a circle.

12
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,820
No need for that.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
The speaker can stand where I am.

14
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,190
I'll sit down and listen.

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,770
The topics are not limited.

16
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,360
If you have suggestions for me

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,620
as your new commander,

18
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,240
whether it's about

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,310
military discipline,

20
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,390
training strategy,

21
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,680
improvements and reforms,

22
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,710
living conditions, and so on,

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,810
just say whatever's on your mind.

24
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,520
I want everyone

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
to speak freely.

26
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,600
And if you're not ready
to say it out loud,

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
you can submit a report to me.

28
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,340
I promise

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,340
to take every word seriously.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,240
Great!

31
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,250
Great! Great!

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,400
Everyone,

33
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,680
our new commander-in-chief

34
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,560
is kind and approachable,

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,120
truly kind and approachable.

36
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,570
As subordinates,

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,720
we're deeply inspired,

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,730
so deeply inspired!

39
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,380
Mr. Yang's explanation

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
of a soldier's duty

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,890
was clear and concise,

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,450
truly concise!

43
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,450
Why is that?

44
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,170
Because the man is educated.

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,170
Truly educated!

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,950
Highly educated!

47
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,290
He also has

48
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,329
passion and resolve,

49
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,010
true passion and resolve,

50
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,960
unmatched passion!

51
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,010
The arrival of the new commander-in-chief

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,450
is a blessing for our Sixth Division,

53
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,840
truly a blessing indeed.

54
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,050
Such talent,

55
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,450
such rich knowledge,

56
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,290
such passion and resolve—

57
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,120
what does it reflect?

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,000
It reflects
the Emperor's great benevolence.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,730
It shows the Emperor and the court's

60
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,640
deep concern,

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
genuine favor,

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,170
and high regard

63
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,610
for all of us in the Sixth Division!

64
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,170
Great! Well said!

65
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,290
Great!

66
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,620
[Residence of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Sixth Division]

67
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,280
Maichen.

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,250
Have you noticed

69
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,090
that in the Sixth Division,

70
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,050
there seems to be

71
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,180
a shadow commander?

72
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,909
Yeah, I noticed.

73
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,530
In the second half

74
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,090
of the meeting during the day,

75
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,050
a few voices threw out hollow flattery

76
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,180
and endless praise,

77
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,580
but most people were dead silent,

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,820
watching someone's every expression.

79
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,030
Whose expression?

80
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,530
Tell me.

81
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,030
Commander Zhou of the 12th Brigade.

82
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:05,650
Yeah.

83
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,820
Even Commander Wu of the 11th Brigade

84
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,550
is deferential to him.

85
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,680
Some people even say

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,280
he's the uncrowned king
of the Sixth Division.

87
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,270
Who said that?

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,200
The meeting today went quite well.

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,700
Let's keep it that way.

90
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,090
Butter him up so much that

91
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,440
he doesn't know whether to laugh

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,650
or cry.

93
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,200
As the saying goes,

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,360
"You don't hit a smiling face
with a hard fist."

95
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,290
He came in swinging,

96
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,460
but we'll stay calm and collected,

97
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,880
putting on a smile before him

98
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,440
and showing him all due courtesy.

99
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,530
Now let's see

100
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,970
what he'll do next.

101
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,650
Sir, you're so clever.

102
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,650
That Yang boy has powerful backing,

103
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,770
but we won't butt heads with him.

104
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,710
We'll take the soft approach.

105
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,690
Know what that's called?

106
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,610
It's called the "Formless Formation."

107
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,520
Has tomorrow's schedule been set?

108
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,440
Yang's

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
aide from Beijing, Staff Officer Gu,

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,530
informed me

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,010
they won't need any company tomorrow.

112
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,510
They'll inspect the troops on their own.

113
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,760
Going solo, huh?

114
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,990
I've already notified the troops.

115
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,260
Wherever Yang goes,

116
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,110
we'll get timely updates.

117
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,650
No need to be so cautious.

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,650
We still have a long way to go.

119
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,730
The key is to keep a close eye on

120
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,090
those few dissenters.

121
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,760
As long as they

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
don't join forces with Yang Kaizhi,

123
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,970
the rest won't be much of a problem.

124
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,090
You mean…

125
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,090
Fang Quanlin, Xu Liqun,

126
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,490
and especially

127
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,350
the colonel of the 24th Regiment,

128
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,409
Feng Hanhai.

129
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,580
[Base of the 24th Regiment,
Sixth Division]

130
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,090
I'm Feng Hanhai,
colonel of the 24th Regiment.

131
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,690
[Feng Hanhai, colonel
of the 24th Regiment, Sixth Division]

132
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,150
Good morning, sir.

133
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,490
Hello, Colonel Feng.

134
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,320
Hello, sir.

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,580
Why so few men out here?

136
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,970
The Brigade Office sent word last night,

137
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,880
saying that today,

138
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,340
you might come for a visit.

139
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,880
They told me to have a few soldiers

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,010
out for show to avoid

141
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,360
the parade ground looking too empty.

142
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,490
That would look bad.

143
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,800
You heard that?

144
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,920
They were worried
I might drop by unannounced.

145
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,130
So tell me,

146
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,560
at yesterday's meeting,

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,350
why didn't you speak up?

148
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,530
What was there to say?

149
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,290
It was all hollow talk for the higher-ups,

150
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,490
just a load of hot air.

151
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,530
You're quite frank.

152
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,250
How many live-fire drills
do you have in a year?

153
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,540
Just once this year.

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
Which month is it now?

155
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,890
You've only practiced once?

156
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,650
What about trench building

157
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,200
and field engineering?

158
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,760
He…

159
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,720
Never.

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,530
Never?

161
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,770
That's right.

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,920
All those

163
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,650
shovels, spades, and iron tools

164
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,910
are painted spotless,

165
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,290
sitting in the armory

166
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,650
waiting to be counted

167
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,910
when visitors show up.

168
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,530
Sir,

169
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,080
why don't you count them too?

170
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:38,929
Since you've

171
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,770
prepared well enough

172
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,630
to deal with me,

173
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,070
what's the point of me checking?

174
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,140
Indeed, there's no point.

175
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's go.

176
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,460
Take me to the soldiers' mess hall.

177
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,890
This way, please.

178
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,130
It's so bland.

179
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,230
Not even a whiff of meat.

180
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,030
There is meat.

181
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
Right here.

182
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,770
That's it?

183
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,840
For 500 people?

184
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,440
It's fine that it's not much,

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,370
but they should've
at least given us the full amount.

186
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,740
Where did you buy it?

187
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,220
It's supplied
by the brigade quartermaster.

188
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,060
He was

189
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,060
generous today.

190
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
He heard you might come.

191
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,890
So it was issued.

192
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,840
How much does it weigh?

193
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,930
According to the records,

194
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,460
it's 21 catties and 5 taels.

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,190
This morning,

196
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,320
we just got it from the Brigade Office.

197
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
21 catties and 5 taels?

198
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,500
Does this look like 21 catties?

199
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,600
Bring a scale. Let's weigh it.

200
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,530
14 catties.

201
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,650
7 catties short.

202
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,420
7 catties short out of 21.

203
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,340
The brigade quartermaster's scale

204
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,670
is a bit too rigged, huh?

205
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,440
Colonel Feng, it seems like you have a lot

206
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,370
to say to me.

207
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,040
If you

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,370
don't feel comfortable speaking openly,

209
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,180
you can write a report to me.

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,320
Say everything

211
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,850
on your mind.

212
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,820
Don't hold back.

213
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,050
An official

214
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,900
has the duty of fixing what's broken.

215
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,620
Goodbye,

216
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,850
Colonel Feng.

217
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,130
Everyone,

218
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,250
today's meeting

219
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,850
will address only one issue.

220
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,130
Every supply unit and mess unit

221
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,650
in the entire division

222
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,550
must use standardized scales.

223
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,370
General Zhou.

224
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,720
What's the name

225
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,130
of your quartermaster

226
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,780
in the 12th Brigade?

227
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,650
His name is Chen Furen.

228
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,170
Right.

229
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,500
When you get back, tell him that

230
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,530
a catty is a catty.

231
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,250
One catty is 16 taels,

232
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,740
not nine taels

233
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,370
or 11 taels.

234
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,250
I think improving the Sixth Division's

235
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,050
soldier supplies should start with

236
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,250
fixing the issue of short-weight rations.

237
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,480
Start by making sure a catty is 16 taels.

238
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Wu,

239
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,420
you heard that?

240
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,250
You know how to weigh things?

241
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,720
I grew up

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,890
selling peanuts!

243
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,220
I know all about scales!

244
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,680
So you know one catty is 16 taels, right?

245
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,010
General Zhou,

246
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,480
are you messing with me?

247
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,770
Wu,

248
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,400
what are you doing?

249
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,770
If the brigades' scales
need to be accurate,

250
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,890
shouldn't the Division Office's scale

251
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,890
be accurate too?

252
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,890
Are you saying the Division Office's
scale isn't accurate?

253
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,420
Well, accurate or not,
we have to test to know.

254
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,560
How do we test that?

255
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,370
One bullet weighs one tael and three qian.

256
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,890
That's a set standard.

257
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,900
Whether the scale is accurate,

258
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,990
we'll weigh the bullets and know.

259
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:29,930
Commander-in-Chief,

260
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,480
look at him.

261
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,850
What a troublemaker.

262
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,800
Wu actually wants to

263
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,000
check the scale of the Division Office.

264
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
Staff Officer Gu.

265
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,530
Yes.

266
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,650
Have the division quartermaster come now.

267
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,890
Tell him to bring a scale.

268
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:45,550
Right away.

269
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,370
Yes.

270
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,770
Commander-in-Chief,

271
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,010
I don't mean to speak ill

272
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,140
of the previous commander-in-chief,

273
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,130
but the scale used by the Division Office

274
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,930
isn't accurate most of the time.

275
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,770
Take last year for example.

276
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,650
The Ministry of War,
through the division quartermaster,

277
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,680
gave us 10,000 catties of soybeans

278
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,560
as premium feed,

279
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,890
distributed to each brigade
to feed the horses.

280
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,020
They said my 12th Brigade was allotted

281
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,370
2,500 catties.

282
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,370
But when it arrived and I weighed it,

283
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,630
guess how much it was?

284
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,890
1,750 catties.

285
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,890
750 catties vanished

286
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,930
right under the Division Office's

287
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,130
scale.

288
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,170
General Zhou is right.

289
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,170
That's why,

290
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,150
to solve this problem,

291
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,260
we don't start from the bottom.

292
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,890
We start right here

293
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,130
with the Division Office.

294
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,790
Commander-in-Chief.

295
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,770
Let it go.

296
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,890
You're really going to weigh them?

297
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,560
Yes.

298
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,290
Right now.

299
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,680
One catty

300
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,450
is exactly 16 taels.

301
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,370
The scale of the Division Office

302
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,370
is no exception.

303
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,150
Commander-in-Chief.

304
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,030
Five bullets weigh
six taels and five qian in total.

305
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,290
The sun must be rising from the west.

306
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,050
D-Dead accurate.

307
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,860
How could it not be accurate?

308
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,220
Quartermaster Li,

309
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,800
you don't have
two different scales, do you?

310
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,170
That's not possible.

311
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,650
Quartermaster Li.

312
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,370
Yes.

313
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,600
From now on,

314
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,210
the scale in your hand

315
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,130
will be the standard scale
for the Sixth Division.

316
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,290
I order you
to use this scale as the benchmark

317
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,020
to calibrate

318
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,480
all scales in every brigade, regiment,

319
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,530
and mess unit in the entire division.

320
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,050
If any shortchanging happens again,

321
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,130
once confirmed,

322
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,370
the penalty will be tenfold.

323
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:32,480
[Headquarters]

324
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,030
Wu.

325
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,380
We'd better be careful.

326
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm afraid

327
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,070
this may not just be about scales.

328
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,890
New officials want
to hit the ground running.

329
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,150
It's always like this.

330
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,370
Be careful.

331
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,580
Don't land yourself in trouble.

332
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,080
By the way,

333
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,650
how's your relationship with Ma Buzhou

334
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,830
from the cavalry battalion?

335
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,190
I trained him.

336
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,680
What do you think?

337
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,650
That's good.

338
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,599
Yang just picked Ma Buzhou

339
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
to be his guard captain.

340
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,540
This person is crucial.

341
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:12,440
You need to win him over for me.

342
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,480
Just in case.

343
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,030
Is that really necessary?

344
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,530
Yang's background is very complicated.

345
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,530
We'd better plant this piece early.

346
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,030
It might come in handy
at a critical moment.

347
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,760
Come in.

348
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,440
Buzhou.

349
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,700
[Ma Buzhou]

350
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,660
What's the matter?

351
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,020
Colonel Feng Hanhai is here to see you.

352
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,730
Colonel Feng?

353
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
What do you think of

354
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,840
Colonel Feng?

355
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,480
He's got solid military skills

356
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,610
and is very upright.

357
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,190
Just a bit of a maverick.

358
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,540
Brigade Commander Zhou
doesn't really like him.

359
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,640
Does Brigade Commander Zhou

360
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,900
like you?

361
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,850
The cavalry battalion is
an independent unit.

362
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,780
He doesn't have authority over me.

363
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,200
When Duan was in charge,

364
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I answered to him.

365
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,200
Compared to my predecessor, Duan,

366
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,590
what do you think of me?

367
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,410
Hard to compare.

368
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,150
Every commander has their own style.

369
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,960
What's my style?

370
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,730
Can't say yet.

371
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,070
We haven't worked together long enough.

372
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
You're quite honest.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,570
We've got time.

374
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,570
Let's get along.

375
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,340
Ask Colonel Feng to come in.

376
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,190
Yes.

377
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,480
Wait.

378
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,650
Here's a letter.

379
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,620
It should be sent to Shanghai.

380
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,210
Mail it for me.

381
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,450
Yes.

382
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,780
Colonel Feng.

383
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,680
I read your report.

384
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,590
You pointed out six

385
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,200
specific problems

386
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,040
in the army that need fixing.

387
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,680
Very good.

388
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,040
However,

389
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,620
someone is not happy about it.

390
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Who might that be?

391
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,520
You know who it is, sir.

392
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
I'd like to know

393
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,010
what Brigade Commander Zhou's

394
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,440
background is.

395
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,040
Why is he so arrogant

396
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,960
in the Sixth Division?

397
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,100
When Duan left, he explicitly stated

398
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,770
that the Ministry of War

399
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,850
wanted Zhou to succeed him

400
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,850
as commander of the Sixth Division.

401
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,200
He's one of the earliest officers
for the military training at Xiaozhan.

402
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,680
Most of the officers in the two brigades

403
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,930
were trained by him.

404
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,570
He naturally assumed

405
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,130
that he would be the new head

406
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,390
of the Sixth Division.

407
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,580
Unexpectedly,

408
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
you showed up.

409
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,570
I see now.

410
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,720
Turns out

411
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,180
I ruined someone's plans.

412
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,960
Of course.

413
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,720
This man is domineering

414
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,570
and likes to pull strings

415
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,970
and bestow small favors.

416
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,570
As long as someone is his man,

417
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,810
regardless of his vices,

418
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,810
he'll still be given key positions.

419
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,840
And with that,

420
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
the Sixth Division

421
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,660
became rotten to the core.

422
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,280
Lack of knowledge

423
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,720
or no real grasp
of military affairs is fine.

424
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,960
Using army funds

425
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,440
for personal gain is okay.

426
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,040
Splitting up supplies meant for the troops

427
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,720
like horse feed and firewood

428
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,680
for private profit

429
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,930
is totally ignored.

430
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
As long as you

431
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
win favor with Zhou,

432
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,890
you can rise quickly and smoothly.

433
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
How can this go on?

434
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,090
But let me ask you.

435
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,330
Feng Hanhai,

436
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
how did you become a colonel?

437
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,440
Did you climb up

438
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,230
by pleasing Zhou too?

439
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,040
I was promoted by Duan.

440
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,040
Duan himself

441
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,200
was a clean man.

442
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,380
His ambitions lay elsewhere.

443
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,140
He also knew

444
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,970
Zhou was a corrupt officer.

445
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,200
But

446
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,440
Duan needed Zhou

447
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,700
to control the troops.

448
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,950
In that dilemma, he promoted me

449
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,080
to balance things out

450
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,280
and keep Zhou from going too far.

451
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,920
This is the first time

452
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,500
I've heard about the real situation.

453
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,810
Then how

454
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,240
should we change

455
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,570
the current situation?

456
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,970
I'm just reporting the situation.

457
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,150
As for changing it,

458
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,290
it depends on your resolve.

459
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,640
If I remove him from his post…

460
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,770
do you think that would solve the problem?

461
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,200
Well…

462
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,260
That depends on who will replace him.

463
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,570
If it's just one of his men,

464
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm afraid...

465
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,110
It's you.

466
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,250
You'll replace him.

467
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Can you guarantee

468
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,240
that you'll turn the situation around?

469
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,700
They'll never appoint me.

470
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,040
Why not?

471
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,980
You may not know this, sir,

472
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,960
but I wasn't

473
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
part of the Wuwei Corps Right Division.

474
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Although I graduated
from Baoding Military Academy,

475
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,690
I wasn't in the inner circle.

476
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,240
They'd never trust me

477
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,960
to take Zhou's place.

478
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,550
We haven't even tried yet.

479
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,720
How do you know it won't work for sure?

480
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,760
From top to bottom,
they've got their people everywhere.

481
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,820
And who are "they"?

482
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,820
Mr. Yuan's die-hard supporters.

483
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,280
What if

484
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,240
I send a telegram to Lord Zaitao

485
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,170
at the Military Advisory Council?

486
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,070
I didn't think of that.

487
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,040
Sir, can you really

488
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,570
get through to Lord Zaitao?

489
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,630
Let me give it a try.

490
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,380
But first, you should be mentally prepared

491
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,780
to take responsibility.

492
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,000
Help me truly take charge

493
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
of the Sixth Division.

494
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,610
We can't let this

495
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,140
toxic mess go on any longer.

496
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,880
[Military Advisory Council in Beijing]

497
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,910
Sir,

498
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
we just received this,

499
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,330
a signed telegram
from Commander Yang Kaizhi

500
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,520
of the Sixth Division,

501
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,440
addressed specifically to the Chairman

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,840
and General Liang Xiang.

503
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,000
Leave it here.

504
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Both of them are on a visit to Europe.

505
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
All telegrams

506
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,000
will have to wait until their return.

507
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,470
The telegram is marked urgent.

508
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,940
It seems pressing.

509
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,410
Then forward it to the Ministry of War.

510
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,780
Let Mr. Yinchang handle it.

511
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,510
Understood.

512
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,040
This is the main duty office

513
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,960
of the Military Advisory Council.

514
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,570
Go ahead.

515
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,680
Hurry!

516
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,480
Master. Master.

517
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,280
Master.

518
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,740
What's the matter?

519
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,330
Mr. Yinchang
from the Ministry of War in Beijing

520
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,130
has sent a confidential letter.

521
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,320
You may go now.

522
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,490
Master.

523
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,900
Has something happened?

524
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,360
Mr. Yinchang personally
wrote you a letter.

525
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,570
Yang has taken action

526
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,480
to take me down.

527
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,250
Commander-in-Chief Yang?

528
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,930
He sent a secret telegram to Lord Zaitao,

529
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,440
accusing me of being a heavy opium addict,

530
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,300
calling me no better than a thief,

531
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,930
and recommending Feng Hanhai

532
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,610
to replace me

533
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,480
as the commander of the 12th Brigade.

534
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:49,930
Then

535
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,520
what's Mr. Yinchang's response?

536
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,230
Lord Zaitao is on the rise,

537
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,380
and Mr. Yuan has retreated to Zhangde.

538
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,930
Mr. Yinchang doesn't dare
to openly oppose,

539
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,790
so he can only respond evasively.

540
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,230
How evasively?

541
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,200
We send him so much silver

542
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,040
every year.

543
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,240
He can't just sit back and watch!

544
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,810
Enough.

545
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,060
Get the carriage

546
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,040
ready now.

547
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,930
I need to talk with Wu.

548
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
We need a plan.

549
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,960
Go!

550
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,140
It was so quick.

551
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,680
Someone in Beijing

552
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,740
has tipped him off.

553
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yet here we are,

554
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,380
still waiting for any kind of reply.

555
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,440
It's not our fault.

556
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,090
We didn't know
before sending the telegram.

557
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,130
No one expected
Liang Xiang to be out of the country

558
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,040
and the telegram to be sent

559
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,300
to the Ministry of War.

560
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,840
The timing wasn't right.

561
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:41,960
Listen.

562
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,140
Go bring in the guard captain.

563
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,720
Yes.

564
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,730
Commander-in-Chief, you wanted to see me?

565
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
Something's come up.

566
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,420
People on General Zhou's side

567
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,650
probably hate my guts now.

568
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,440
Just in case,

569
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
from now on,

570
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,810
we need to tighten security

571
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,720
at both the office and the residence.

572
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Notify the guards

573
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,820
to be ready for duty at any time.

574
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,930
Yes.

575
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,900
There's nothing shady going on here.

576
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,200
General Zhou and I

577
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,720
have no personal grudges.

578
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,090
It's purely a matter of

579
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,760
different leadership philosophies.

580
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,710
Make sure your men understand that.

581
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,640
Tell them not to be overly hostile.

582
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,630
Understood?

583
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:57,660
Understood.

584
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,850
This isn't

585
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,440
just about me.

586
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,720
He's targeting all of us old officers

587
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,780
from the Wuwei Corps Right Division.

588
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,520
In his eyes,

589
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,440
we've always been

590
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,430
"Yuan's faction."

591
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,090
We cannot just sit back and do nothing.

592
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,680
We must push back.

593
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,200
He can't think that just because
Mr. Yuan has stepped down,

594
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,090
we're now helpless rabbits

595
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:35,200
waiting to be slaughtered.

596
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,330
No.

597
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,000
None of you here

598
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,870
are ordinary.

599
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,440
You command troops.

600
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
Your voices still carry weight.

601
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,570
We need to speak up.

602
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,960
We need to voice our opinions.

603
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,820
We need to push back against Yang.

604
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,770
Yeah,

605
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,620
we must speak up.

606
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,240
Now that you're in trouble,

607
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,090
it's only right

608
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,680
for us to stand with you.

609
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,570
But the question is,

610
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,760
how do we speak?

611
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Who do we speak to?

612
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,960
Yeah.

613
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,130
Our words need to hit the mark.

614
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,570
We need a plan.

615
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,070
We can't proceed without one.

616
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,240
Stay calm.

617
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,650
That Yang boy

618
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,200
might have done that

619
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,280
to draw us out,

620
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,480
planning to take us all down in one go.

621
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,520
Exactly.

622
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,440
I have

623
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,280
always treated you all well.

624
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,710
But now, in this moment of life and death,

625
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,440
you're still clinging to false hope?

626
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,280
Wake up!

627
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,960
Let me tell you something:

628
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,090
if Yang

629
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,280
can take me down,

630
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
then from here on out,

631
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,040
in the Sixth Division,

632
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,930
he can go after anyone he wants.

633
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,790
He can mess with whoever he wants!

634
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,330
Zhou.

635
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,040
Sit, sit.

636
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,410
Calm down.

637
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,680
Sit, sit.

638
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,060
You and Mr. Yinchang are close, right?

639
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,020
Just have him reject Yang's request.

640
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,720
That

641
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,330
shouldn't be hard.

642
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,680
Mr. Yinchang

643
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
sent me a message overnight.

644
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,390
That is his stance.

645
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,960
What more do you need to be convinced?

646
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,200
Of course,

647
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,370
the higher-ups
have their own way of doing things.

648
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,040
Mr. Yinchang will surely speak up,

649
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,440
but he won't do it blindly.

650
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,290
Everyone plays their part.

651
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,040
You need to escalate this conflict

652
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,840
all the way up to the Army Office.

653
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,240
Only then can Mr. Yinchang step in.

654
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,240
You mean…

655
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:48,570
we need to

656
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,200
submit something in writing?

657
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,040
I've already

658
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,520
prepared it for you.

659
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,720
It needs your signatures
before submission.

660
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,730
Yang Kaizhi

661
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,700
isn't some spotless figure.

662
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:15,480
Back when he was studying in Japan,

663
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,310
he had ties to the revolutionary party.

664
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,760
We'll use that.

665
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,370
We'll say he slipped anti-Qing

666
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,960
revolutionary rhetoric

667
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,200
into his inaugural speech.

668
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,240
Slipping in?

669
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,040
Zhou,

670
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I don't think

671
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,040
that's proper.

672
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Then change it.

673
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,330
Make it

674
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,210
"openly inciting anti-Qing revolution."

675
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,030
That's not proper either.

676
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,570
If it was open incitement,

677
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
then why didn't we

678
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,280
stop him on the spot?

679
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,240
Moreover,

680
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
everyone applauded.

681
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,500
The room

682
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,930
was thunderous with applause.

683
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,440
A complaint full of nonsense…

684
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,270
Zhou,

685
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,440
we really

686
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
can't sign our names on it.

687
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
What do you mean?

688
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,570
You're shutting me out?

689
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,810
No.

690
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,570
General,

691
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,330
the commander-in-chief
asked me to wait here for you.

692
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,830
Please.

693
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,520
General Yang.

694
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
Stabbing me in the back like this

695
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,770
is a bit too cruel, isn't it?

696
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,480
An opium addict

697
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,570
who's no better than a thief?

698
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,040
It's utter nonsense!

699
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,000
General Zhou.

700
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,570
Who told you this?

701
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,650
Don't think you're the only one

702
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,440
with connections,

703
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,170
Yang Kaizhi.

704
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,570
I've got backing too.

705
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,810
This isn't some dice game

706
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,970
where we compare

707
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,620
whose number is bigger.

708
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,200
We've got to compare when necessary.

709
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,570
When I was training troops at Xiaozhan,

710
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,700
where were you, boy?

711
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,200
I've crossed more bridges

712
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,660
than you've walked roads.
Believe it or not.

713
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,690
I believe it.

714
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,480
Then that settles it.

715
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,810
I'm asking you

716
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,440
to withdraw your request.

717
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,770
Send a telegram
to the Ministry of War now.

718
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,980
Why should I listen to you?

719
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,430
Don't bring trouble on yourself.

720
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,140
Are you threatening me?

721
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,720
Listen.

722
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,260
Even if you drive me away,

723
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,740
you still can't control
the Sixth Division!

724
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,180
Just by the way

725
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,580
you're talking to me now,

726
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,750
I can't keep you.

727
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,570
You're a subordinate,

728
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,200
yet you're trying

729
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,730
to threaten your superior.

730
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,520
If you were me,

731
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,420
would you keep someone like that?

732
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,690
General Yang,

733
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,250
don't take it personally.

734
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,120
I trained in the field

735
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,050
to get where I am.

736
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,929
Those from the Beiyang Army

737
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,040
are all like me.

738
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,810
You're different.

739
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,889
You trained in the classroom

740
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:42,480
in Japan.

741
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,020
You want refinement?

742
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,120
That's easy.

743
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,480
How about

744
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,409
I take you to

745
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,940
the Deyue Hotel in the city?

746
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,780
We'll enjoy the company
of some refined ladies,

747
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,270
and in the cool breeze and moonlight,

748
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,730
amidst the playing of zithers and singing,

749
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,370
you and I

750
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,640
can have a heart-to-heart talk.

751
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:12,960
Commander-in-Chief,
an urgent telegram from Beijing.

752
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,800
It's from the Ministry of War, isn't it?

753
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,820
Ministry of War.

754
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,530
A personal telegram from Mr. Yinchang.

755
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,140
I suppose I need to

756
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,480
congratulate that jerk Feng Hanhai

757
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,520
in advance.

758
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,420
This telegram has nothing to do with him.

759
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
So you're saying

760
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,560
that Feng Hanhai

761
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,220
didn't get what he wanted?

762
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,600
He got all worked up

763
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,040
for nothing, huh?

764
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,890
I didn't expect

765
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Mr. Yinchang

766
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,410
to value you so much.

767
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,080
My friend,

768
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,540
just think about it.

769
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,440
What kind of relationship

770
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,970
do I have with Mr. Yinchang?

771
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,330
You sent a telegram,

772
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,520
and I already knew how it'd go.

773
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:14,890
I thought so.

774
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,960
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

775
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
transferred you
back to the Ministry of War

776
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
to be a military advisor.

777
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,200
The new brigade commander

778
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,850
is already on his way.

779
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,740
He'll arrive any day now.

780
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,410
His name is Li Renjun.

781
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,740
Take a look.

782
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,830
Captain Ma,

783
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,520
see him out.

784
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,370
Li Renjun?

785
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,350
Who the hell is this guy?

786
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,760
[Shanghai]

787
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,250
My dearest Shuhong,

788
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,600
I received the short letter
you sent from Shanghai.

789
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,440
I understand

790
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,570
everything you've just been through.

791
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,930
Actually,

792
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,440
every love story

793
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,640
inevitably comes with

794
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,480
its own struggles and confusion

795
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,250
for the two people

796
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,330
in the story.

797
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,710
We're no different.

798
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,410
That sweet night in Beijing

799
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,560
was destined

800
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,690
to demand its price

801
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,880
from both you and me.

802
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,270
Separation isn't the worst thing.

803
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,950
At the very least, deep in our hearts,

804
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
there are still

805
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,850
so many lingering feelings

806
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,330
that make us

807
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,850
feel warm every day,

808
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,960
even if at this moment,

809
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,840
you are surrounded by

810
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,570
a bunch of idiots.

811
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,850
Dear Kaizhi,

812
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,560
forgive me for not replying sooner.

813
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,330
Shanghai is in the throes

814
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,590
of an unprecedented stock market crash.

815
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,480
The rubber stocks

816
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,080
people were frantically chasing

817
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,610
have plummeted overnight.

818
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,120
They're worthless now.

819
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,520
So many people and banks

820
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
have gone bankrupt and closed down.

821
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,370
There was this absurd belief

822
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,770
that the future
would be built from rubber:

823
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,410
tires, shoes, steamships,

824
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,960
even roads and houses.

825
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,480
Vice Chairman Song's bank

826
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,330
was affected too

827
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,980
and suffered huge losses.

828
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:47,690
These days,
I've been helping with the aftermath,

829
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,310
comforting and compensating
his friends and associates.

830
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,770
It's been heartbreaking.

831
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,120
Someone jumped.

832
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,450
Quick, someone jumped!

833
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:56,780
Someone jumped!

834
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,600
Chairman Song.

835
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,050
Did you deliver the letter?

836
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,520
No.

837
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,890
Why not?

838
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,920
He jumped off a building.

839
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,330
Right in front of me.

840
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,650
I was just one step too late.

841
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,320
He was already dead
before reaching the hospital.

842
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,730
Shuhong.

843
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,480
Do you know

844
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,250
who I miss the most right now?

845
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,610
Your Mr. Wu.

846
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,810
Mr. Wu firmly believed that

847
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,050
to deal with the rotten Qing regime,

848
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,640
the people must hold power.

849
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,860
Otherwise,

850
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,300
they'll do whatever they please.

851
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,660
What do you mean by that?

852
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,690
Financial crises happen everywhere,

853
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,770
but look at how other

854
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,230
governments handle them.

855
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Now look at us.

856
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,040
Let's not talk about
the first stock crash.

857
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,520
We were all somewhat to blame.

858
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,250
But this second crash?

859
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,100
It's entirely man-made!

860
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,290
Man-made?

861
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,850
By whom?

862
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:38,770
The circuit intendant of Shanghai

863
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,000
pulled two million taels of silver

864
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,160
from Yuanfengrun Bank

865
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,330
to get back

866
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,990
at the Ministry of Finance.

867
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,520
This caused China's

868
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,000
largest bank to collapse,

869
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,810
affecting dozens of branch banks.

870
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,670
Is this something a man should do?

871
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,230
Just for the sake

872
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,180
of his own pride,

873
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,100
he once again

874
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,850
kicked all of this city's money

875
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,250
straight into the river,

876
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,530
not caring if it'd flood the whole place!

877
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,850
Okay, okay.

878
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,160
I understand.

879
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,520
Baoquan,

880
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,180
Mr. Yu just called.

881
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,730
He wants you
to go to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce

882
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,480
to discuss

883
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,870
the disbandment of the merchant militia.

884
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,790
Disbandment?

885
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,580
Whose idea is that?

886
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,640
H-How would I know?

887
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,480
Mr. Yu said on the phone

888
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,730
that the circuit intendant
of Shanghai has resigned.

889
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,810
Technically,

890
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,000
he should be

891
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,930
in charge of the merchant militia.

892
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,000
That's what he said.

893
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,460
Don't ask me to explain it.

894
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,080
Mr. Yu has lost his mind.

895
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,000
We poured a fortune

896
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
into building that armed force.

897
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,440
How can we just hand it over?

898
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Who knows when

899
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,040
we might need
to change our way of speaking?

900
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:58,600
Go, go, go.

901
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,300
Call for a car.

902
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,480
I'm going to
the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce.

903
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,010
Okay.
