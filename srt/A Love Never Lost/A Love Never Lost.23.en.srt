[A Love Never Lost]

2
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,940
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,479
Sir, this is impressive.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,060
You set up an incense hall in a prison.

5
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,070
It's like the fall of a hero, Tianbai.

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Incense hall? No.

7
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,780
I'm like an encaged bird,

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,840
with wings unable to spread.

9
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,690
And I'm like a tiger away from its turf,

10
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,120
left all alone.

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,130
I'm like an aquatic dragon,

12
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,680
stranded on the beach.

13
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,260
I didn't bring my instrument today.

14
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,480
Otherwise, we could perform

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
the opera, "Silang Visits His Mother."

16
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,020
What's wrong, Tianbai?

17
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,740
You can't even walk?

18
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,370
Come on, lie down.

19
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,970
Let me take a look.

20
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,570
Take it slow.

21
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,810
What happened?

22
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,650
Six years ago,

23
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,180
when we were in Shaoxing,

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,340
you gave me a divination. Remember?

25
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:42,970
Is that so?

26
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,820
It didn't ring a bell.

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,270
You said

28
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,430
I would suffer a bloody disaster at 31.

29
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,060
If it was in the divination,

30
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,070
it was decided not by me,

31
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,180
but by God.

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,020
So...

33
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,650
I believed it.

34
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,580
You really believed it?

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,810
I really did.

36
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,330
Jingchao, you're clairvoyant.

37
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,740
You said I would be hit by

38
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,070
a bloody disaster at 31.

39
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,370
In other words,

40
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,460
I'd be safe before 31.

41
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,690
So, before turning 31,

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,740
I rushed to pull off
all the riskiest stuff

43
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,650
while I could.

44
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,440
You should've come
to meet me earlier, Tianbai.

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,850
You're right.

46
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,790
This is a gunshot wound.

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,510
If you had come earlier,

48
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,570
I could have totally fixed

49
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,510
your meridians and acupoints.

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,740
But now,

51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,750
I can only help you recover

52
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,530
to 50%.

53
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,900
Recover to 50%?

54
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,590
That's good enough!

55
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,900
Otherwise, I'll

56
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,020
be a total wreck.

57
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,940
Take off your pants.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,600
Let me try acupuncture on you.

59
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
Keep steady.

60
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,400
Judging from your breath,

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,120
your qi and blood are quite vigorous.

62
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,100
Yes, hold on.

63
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,810
Relax.

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,890
It stings! Ouch!

65
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,810
It feels like an electric shock.

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,980
That's good.

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,960
Stay still.

68
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,470
My buttocks...

69
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
They're burning.

70
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,210
It's scorching hot.

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,740
Hot, hot, hot!

72
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,680
The heat's reached my knees.

73
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,250
It's gone down to my toes.

74
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,360
You are literally
a great doctor working miracles.

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,250
You know what?

76
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,890
For almost two years,

77
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,740
my little toe

78
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,250
has had no feeling at all.

79
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,210
Illness comes like a sudden avalanche,

80
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,370
but it feels like
it'll take forever to heal.

81
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,830
Don't expect one treatment
to work wonders.

82
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,580
Guess you'll need to come
a few more times.

83
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,180
I'm not bragging. I've treated

84
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,140
at least 1,000 people with my acupuncture.

85
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,180
It must hit the point

86
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,580
with sincerity and understanding.

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,000
That's also the way

88
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,940
of making friends, right?

89
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,659
You need to be real with each other

90
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,570
and tightly connected.

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,220
Yes, you're right.
Be real and tightly connected.

92
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,320
I'll come visit you again.

93
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,780
I think my foot is sweating.

94
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,250
The left foot, right?

95
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,850
Yes, the left foot.

96
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,540
If you had come earlier,

97
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,920
I could have made both of your feet

98
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,860
sweat.

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,250
Come on!

100
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,980
If you get one of my feet
back on the ground,

101
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,240
that's enough to make me owe you big time!

102
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,250
Then I can walk with a crutch, right?

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,620
You came to see me

104
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,660
not just for treatment. Am I right?

105
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,300
You, Wu Tianbai,

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,850
are literally a heroic figure well-versed

107
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,790
in almost everything of all times.

108
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,570
Your heart is filled
with immense ambitions.

109
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,690
Jingchao, you know me well.

110
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,770
So what brings you here?

111
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,300
Don't be evasive.

112
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,540
We both

113
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,300
know each other well.

114
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,150
You are a superior doctor.

115
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,230
A mediocre doctor treats people.

116
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,260
Yet a superior one

117
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,250
cures the world.

118
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,740
I'm here to ask you
for your family's secret panacea,

119
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,700
the one that can cure the world.

120
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,420
Put them back on.

121
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,810
Come on, give it a shot.

122
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
Just with this one acupuncture,

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,200
I, Wu Tianbai, have also become

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,130
one of your followers, Master Sun.

125
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,970
Now I understand how

126
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,490
secret society leaders like you

127
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,350
manage to rally and unite people.

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,060
The world abounds

129
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,210
with the sick, the disabled,

130
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,490
and those who suffer.

131
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,430
The government turns a blind eye,

132
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,490
but you, a folk physician,

133
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,920
have gathered millions

134
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,780
of loyal followers just with some

135
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,450
acupuncture needles.

136
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,140
They strictly follow your lead

137
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,270
and instructions with no hesitation.

138
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,690
This is how the White Cloth Party,

139
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:03,900
the Elder Brothers Society,

140
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,760
the Vast Family, and the Green Gang
came into being.

141
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,570
Those officials out there

142
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,770
don't give a damn about people's lives.

143
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,080
We have to take care of them, don't we?

144
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,060
Master Sun,

145
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,800
you have to do something about it.

146
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,640
Go straight to the dock

147
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,270
instead of the residence.

148
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,990
Head to the dock.

149
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:32,620
Shuhong,

150
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:33,850
the plan changed.

151
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,140
Tianbai is on his way to the dock.

152
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,020
Get back to Shanghai

153
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,620
right now.

154
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,940
Just a moment.

155
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,450
Here are Tianbai's everyday items.

156
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,380
Take them to him.

157
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,150
Let's go.

158
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,420
Mr. Wu,

159
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,940
where are we going next?

160
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,830
We're going to Fuyang.

161
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,470
To find Sun Jingchao's military advisor,

162
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,660
who's got
the entire network of relationships

163
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,320
within the White Cloth Party.

164
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,420
Master Sun gave me his token

165
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,140
and even cured my leg.

166
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,270
It's a real boost to the power.

167
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,810
I'll try to win over
those 20,000 people to join

168
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,540
the Zhejiang-Anhui Uprising.

169
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,600
Hurry up.

170
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,690
Master Sun's silver needles

171
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,090
can really work wonders!

172
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,390
[Duanfang's Mansion, Beijing]

173
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,060
Well, why did you bother

174
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,380
bringing me this gift?

175
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,180
I really appreciate it, though.

176
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,210
To express our gratitude
for your help the other day,

177
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,070
our Old Madam insisted on sending this.

178
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,490
It's been passed down from our ancestors.

179
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,380
I'm a layman.

180
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,610
If anyone can make the most of it,

181
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,140
it's you.

182
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,380
This is a valuable piece.

183
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,340
A fine piece indeed.

184
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,810
Well then, I'll

185
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
humbly accept it.

186
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,640
Why do I keep

187
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,330
hearing about you these days?

188
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,140
I've been in Beijing
for my official report

189
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,260

Did you hear some rumors again, sir?

191
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,210
I heard that the memorial you wrote,

192

"The Qing Army's
Status Quo and Construction

193
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,260
in the Autumn Military Drill,"

194
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,570
was highly valued by the Empress Dowager.

195
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,380
It's now been passed on

196
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,440
to the Grand Council for discussion.

197
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,020
Duke Feng Shan of the Army

198
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,570
is very displeased.

199
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,660
Indeed.

200
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,660
You skipped him and submitted it
directly to the Empress Dowager.

201
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
That's offensive.

202
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,130
If I didn't do it this way,

203
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,560

heard by the supreme?

204

This way.

205

206
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760

207
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,600
during the Wuxu Reform.

208
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,620
The Empress Dowager
didn't say anything else?

209
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,610
You mentioned in your memorial that

210
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,200
the Six Beiyang Divisions

211
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,140
have become too powerful and held sway.

212
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,260
Yes.

213
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,570

After reading your memorial,

219
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,820
the Empress Dowager

220
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,820
seemed to be somewhat tempted.

221
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,810
She's had the Grand Council discuss

222
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,570
the possibility of forming

223
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,830
an army of independent Imperial Guards.

224
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:02,970

I guess even you

229

didn't expect this.

230

Planning to build an army
of independent Imperial Guards

231
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,940
indicates that

232
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,850
the Empress Dowager is
questioning the loyalty

233
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,210
of the Beiyang Army guarding Beijing.

234
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,490
What now?

235
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,810

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,690
heirloom pills, secret ointments.

376
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,730
Everyone claims that

377
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,490
their goal is to save us common people

378
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,380
from our dire straits.

379
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,860
But I think the worst one

380
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,380
is the so-called new policy.

381
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,110
You're so sharp, sir.

382
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,770
It sounds so good.

383
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,860
Don't you think so?

384
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,500
Abolish the Imperial Exam,
establish new schools,

385
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,720
switch to constitutionalism,
and train new armies.

386
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,070
They all

387
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,380
sound amazing.

388
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,580
But I just have one question.

389
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,100
Which of these

390
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,140
doesn't cost money?

391
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,210
They all need a large amount of money!

392
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,010
Yes, exactly!

393
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,410
You're insightful, sir.

394
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,380
Then tell me

395
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,620
where to get the money
for this new policy.

396
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,340
It's from us,

397
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,140
the poor people,

398
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,490
isn't it?

399
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,210
Yes, it is.

400
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,680
And think about it.

401
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,690
Since the new policy was implemented,

402
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,420
how many new taxes
has the government collected?

403
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,940
What kind of new policy is that?

404
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,660
All the benefits go to the court,

405
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,230
yet only we, the poor people, are paying!

406
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,710
Does that make sense?

407
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,380
Indeed!

408
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,100
It's so unreasonable!

409
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,420
Let's talk about something else, Mr. Wu.

410
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,000
My son used to study at a private school

411
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,100
in the village,

412
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,860
which didn't cost much.

413
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,490
Now he's gone
to public school in the city,

414
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,620
with expenses covering
food, accommodation,

415
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,990
and tuition.

416
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,970
It's suddenly several times
more expensive.

417
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,500
Without money for school,

418
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,490
there's no path
to an official career either.

419
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,450
Tell me where my son can go.

420
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,700
Where will life take him? Huh?

421
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,970
He'll have to come back to his father

422
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,080
and join the White Cloth Party

423
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,110
for rebellion, right?

424
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,060
Indeed.

425
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,030
Therefore,

426
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,450
for those peddlers
of their fake solutions,

427
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,710
my proposition is that

428
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,820
whether they're humans or ghosts,

429
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,010
ancient or modern,

430
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,070
or which ancient classic they quote,

431
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,380
we should take down all of them!

432
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,100
Right, take them down!

433
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,700
Take them down!
Take them down! Take them down!

434
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,820
Dewy-eyed,

435
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,850
why are you back at this hour?

436
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,210
Mrs. Qiu Jin sent me over

437
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,010
from Datong Academy

438
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,620
to deliver a message overnight.

439
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,680
What's the matter?

440
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,180
Something big has happened.

441
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,660
Mrs. Qiu Jin

442
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,820
saw the newspaper in Shanghai

443
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,490
that reported the incident in Anqing.

444
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,620
Xu Xilin has been killed.

445
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,250
Mrs. Qiu Jin was
overwhelmed by great agony.

446
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,820
She didn't eat, speak, or give any orders.

447
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,970
Later, she obliterated
the secret documents

448
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,580
as well as

449
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,210
the Restoration Society's telegrams.

450
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,140
She also hid the academy's firearms,

451
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,860
ordering the students

452
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,320
to disperse and relocate.

453
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,580
She said the uprising plan had been leaked

454
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,820
and asked Mr. Wu and the Advisor

455
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,860
to make Plan B immediately

456
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,320
to preserve our strength.

457
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,100
The government troops

458
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,160
in Hangzhou could attack at any time.

459
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,970
Then

460
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,970
did Qiu Jin herself move to a safe place?

461
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,450
She ignored everyone's advice

462
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,450
and insisted on guarding the academy.

463
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,100
In the end, Datong Academy was

464
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,250
surrounded by soldiers two hours later.

to stay at Datong Academy herself.]

Datong Academy and arrested Qiu Jin.]

562
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,820
Come on.

563
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,740
Just sit here.

564
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,940
We can take photos at home too?

565
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,340
Then I should go get dressed up first.

566
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,170
Or I won't look great in the camera.

567
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,260
This is good!

568
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,220
Keep it real and comfy
when we take photos at home.

569
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,280
It's a candid shot.

570
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,340
Shuhong,

571
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,850
how about I go get another round fan?

572
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,650
Let me help you.

573
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,070
Here you are.

574
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,590
How elegant this painted fan is!

575
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,100
There's even a poem on it.

576
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,610
"If life could remain
the way it was when we first met.

577
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:43,700
There would be no grief
over the past on the painted fan."

578
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,010
What does it mean?

579
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,170
It means

580
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,010
if only life could stay

581
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,490
at the moment when lovers

582
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,260
first meet.

583
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,010
Then there wouldn't be

584
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,170
any heartbreak or drama that comes after.

585
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,740
Elegant.

586
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,970
The calligraphy is elegant,
and so is the poem.

587
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,410
But it's just wishful thinking.

588
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,090
No one can keep

589
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,020
those good old days forever.

590
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:07,940
Besides,

591
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,710
when you first meet those men,

592
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,780
they all hide

593
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,970
their true colors,

594
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,500
pretending to be caring

595
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,770
and attentive.

596
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,780
But once a man's got you as his woman,

597
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,510
he's no longer the same person.

598
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,970
Chairman Song wouldn't
treat you like that, would he?

599
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,290
All men are tricky.

600
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,900
They're all the same.

601
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,920
Turn your face a bit to the side.

602
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,710
Mrs. Song, you have a beautiful nose.

603
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,620
Has anyone told you that?

604
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,730
At my age,

605
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,820
no one would compliment me like that!

606
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,460
Song Chen told me that

607
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,520
your father's the owner

608
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,650
of the largest flour mill in Shanghai.

609
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,610
You and Song Chen

610
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,130
have talked about me?

611
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,640
I guess he just mentioned it casually.

612
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,260
Shuhong,

613
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,290
even today, I still can't figure it out.

614
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,250
Why did

615
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,180
someone like you, a gorgeous girl,

616
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,050
end up getting involved

617
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,700
in that bloody mess?

618
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,700
It's so weird.

619
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,420
Your family owns the decent,

620
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,050
time-honored brand, the Kaiwentang.

621
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,980
You could have led a carefree life.

622
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,610
Your ancestors rest
in a spot of good feng shui.

623
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,860
"There would be no grief
over the past on the painted fan." Right?

624
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,340
Shuhong?

625
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,210
Stay still.

626
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,380
I'm going to take it.

627
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,180
Look this way.

628
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,010
Hold on.

629
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:27,580
Good.

630
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,570
Master.

631
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,300
I've been to

632
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,700
the photography studios so many times,

633
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,220
but haven't got one satisfactory photo.

634
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,480
Guess this one you took

635
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,110
is going to be weird as well.

636
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,510
What makes you laugh?

637
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,650
Baoquan, come here.

638
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,490
Let Shuhong

639
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,940
take a photo of you too.

640
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,420
Come on, sit down.

641
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,270
Here.

642
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,970
Alright.

643
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,390
Shuhong,

644
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,420
you must make sure our Baoquan

645
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,750
looks good in the photo.

646
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,490
Our Baoquan's a big shot!

647
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,440
He can easily cause a stir

648
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,710
and make the metropolis tremble.

649
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,410
How about this?

650
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,830
I have a 6-inch plate left.

651
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:13,520
Would you like a photo
of you two together?

652
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,300
Yes! That's a great idea!

653
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,010
Baoquan,

654
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,050
how long has it been

655
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,050
since we last took a photo together?

656
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,480
This fan is quite nice.

657
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,970
Ren Bonian's flower painting. That's rare.

658
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:29,870
Don't just look at the painting.
There's calligraphy too.

659
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,450
"If life could remain
the way it was when we first met."

660
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,940
Nalan Xingde's poem.

661
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:38,510
Okay.

662
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,140
Chairman Song.

663
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,630
Shuhong,

664
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,190
these two stocks you bought

665
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,600
have tripled in value.

666
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,820
I felt they might drop
in the next few days,

667
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,130
so I sold them for you.

668
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,980
And what a coincidence that

669
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,230
you happen to need money right now.

670
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,480
Any news about my sister?

671
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,450
But I've confirmed

672
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,050
with the police station that

673
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
your brother-in-law, Yang Yifan,

674
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,990
was not one of the three under arrest.

675
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,280
Thank God.

676
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,240
That's really great news.

677
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,090
I truly

678
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,730
admire people like you.

679
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,550
You've turned one into millions,

680
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,590
sacrificing for the cause,

681
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,570
fighting to the death,

682
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,370
never-ending, never-ceasing.

683
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,380
Thank you for seeing it that way.

684
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,090
Shuhong,

685
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,090
a young, pretty,

686
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,300
and well-educated girl like you shouldn't

687
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,610
lead an unsettled, chaotic life

688
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,700
like this forever.

689
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,880
Don't you think so?

690
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,090
I'm fine,

691
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,900
really.

692
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,610
After all these years,

693
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,610
it's my first time living by myself.

694
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,200
Away from that man,

695
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,420
I surprisingly feel so calm inside.

696
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,030
You're referring to Mr. Wu?

697
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,490
He's no ordinary man.

698
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,880
You think he's extraordinary?

699
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,590
Of course.

700
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,610
Everyone in Shanghai's

701
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,210
business world agrees on it.

702
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,170
He's been involved in almost

703
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,900
all those world-shaking feats.

704
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,860
You all know about him?

705
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,020
This is a century of revolution.

706
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,010
No one can stay out of it.

707
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,230
But why do I feel that

708
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,020
he's becoming
more and more unapproachable?

709
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,740
I could tell when you just
came to my house.

710
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,540
Something so serious happened,

711
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,780
yet I didn't see fear on your face.

712
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,040
All I could see

713
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,220
was a sense of loss and sadness.

714
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,970
I'm very sad.

715
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,580
Like, heartbroken.

716
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,220
How did you two meet?

717
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,770
It's a long story.

718
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,310
Did he force you to accept him?

719
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,670
Well, that's it.

720
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,930
It was your own choice, wasn't it?

721
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,380
I can understand.

722
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,060
Compared to my son,

723
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,050
a man like him is more exciting

724
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,530
and appealing

725
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,260
to girls.

726
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,900
I can easily see the changes

727
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,780
he has brought to you.

728
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,180
I'm even thinking that

729
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,700
it's hard to believe

730
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,610
a girl like you

731
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,940
is from Anqing.

732
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,170
Song Chen is also embarking on this path.

733
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,040
He and Mr. Wu

734
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,400
hit it off immediately.

735
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,530
That's because of you.

736
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,010
I know my son.

737
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,380
He only shows respect to rivals

738
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,650
he can't defeat.

739
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,220
You're not asking about him?

740
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,550
What should I ask about?

741
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,450
He only talks to me

742
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,260
when he needs money.
